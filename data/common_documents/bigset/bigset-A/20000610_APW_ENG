N.M. Park Superintendent To Retire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Roy Weaver, the park superintendent who approved a
prescribed burn that blew out of control and rolled through Los Alamos last
month, said Friday he will retire in July. Weaver, superintendent of Bandelier
National Monument for nearly 10 years, said he believed conditions had been just
right for the park's annual regimen of burning brush May 4 to stave off a
potentially disastrous fire. But after the burn was started, it became the
largest wildfire in state history, destroying more than 200 homes in Los Alamos
and forcing 25,000 people to evacuate.

   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. efforts to lay down borders between Lebanon
and Israel hit bumpy terrain Friday, with protesters stoning U.N. inspection
teams, officials raising objections and villagers threatening to evict
peacekeepers. Also Friday, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli troops on the
border. Several protesters cut the fence and walked through, drawing warning
shots from Israeli guards. The day's troubles highlighted the continuing
turbulence along the border, where there has been no real authority since last
month's Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

U.S., North Korea Reach Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean officials reached an
agreement Friday to immediately resume the search for more than 8,000 U.S.
soldiers missing in action from the Korean War. The first search mission is
scheduled for June 25, the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.
The agreement to conduct five joint operations between June and November was
reached after three days of talks between the U.S. Defense Department and the
North Korean People's Liberation Army. As a result of previous negotiations,
U.S. teams have conducted 12 recovery operations inside North Korea since 1996
and found 42 sets of remains.

Pop Artist George Segal Dies At 75
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- George Segal, an American pop art icon of the '60s
known for his life-size plaster sculptures, died Friday of cancer at age 75.
Segal began his career as a painter but later turned to sculpture. He received a
National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton in 1999. Segal's
three-dimensional sculpture scenes include ''Cezanne's Still Life,'' a breakfast
table with ripe fruit, tea pot and milk pitcher modeled after the famous
painting, and ''Woman on Orange Bed,'' a nude woman lounging on a rumpled,
sun-streaked bed.

Review: Race A Key In Capital Cases
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- At least nine men were sent to death row in Texas after a
psychologist recommended the death penalty partly because of the defendant's
race, a review has found. The death sentence that prompted the review was thrown
out Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court. Psychologist Walter Quijano had testified
that Argentine laborer Victor Hugo Saldano, a convicted murderer, was a future
danger to society because of his Hispanic heritage. Texas Attorney General John
Cornyn began investigating in April after his office found problems with the
Saldano case. Of the eight other cases, only six may result in further legal
action.

that the environmental impact had not been adequately considered. The case now

Arab-Americans Angry Over Policy
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arab-Americans booed and shouted at Undersecretary of
State Thomas Pickering on Friday as he tried to give a luncheon speech in
support of continued sanctions against Iraq. ''Shame, shame on you,'' an
unidentified man shouted at Pickering, the State Department's third highest
official. Several dozen people walked out in protest. Pickering said sanctions
are needed because Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not complied with U.N.
resolutions passed after his 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions have been
blamed by critics for increasing suffering in Iraq -- rising poverty, illness
and death rates.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Pitches in Minors  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) -- John Rocker was in complete control during
his first minor league appearance Friday, but he couldn't keep his
temper in check around reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, making his first appearance for the Triple-A Richmond
Braves, struck out the side in the ninth inning against the Toledo
Mud Hens.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker threw 20 pitches, missing on just five. He walked one
batter. His fastballs were in the 93-95 mph range.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched ahead, which was the key,'' Richmond pitching coach
Mike Alvarez said. ''It was all good.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing the bottom of the order, Rocker struck out right fielder
Chris Wakeland on three straight pitches. After giving up a walk,
Rocker came back to get second baseman Chris Lemonis on three
straight pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was popping his fastball and his slider looked good,''
Lemonis said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Jesus Azuaje stuck out swinging to give Richmond a
10-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was much better than he had been in Atlanta where he had
10 saves in 11 opportunities and a 3.93 ERA this season, but had
walked 25 batters in 18 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did not talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He signed some autographs during the game, setting off a run on
souvenir baseballs at the gift shop. There was no question who the
crowd of 7,733 came to see.
</P>
<P>
   They went wild when he sprinted into the game. He warmed up with
''Wild Thing'' playing on the Ned Skeldon Stadium speakers.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker got up to stretch in the sixth inning, fans
immediately swarmed toward a railing along the bullpen. Sheriff's
deputies quickly moved them back.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, an angry Rocker stalked off into the clubhouse
following a throwing session in which he was agitated with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker appeared angry as soon as he stepped out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get a good picture of me throwing, that's important,'' he said
while glaring at a half-dozen reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   A few tosses later he again glared into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me ask you something, is it more exciting to watch a guy
throw or paint dry?'' Rocker said to Alvarez. ''Paint probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker threw for about 10 minutes, with most of his pitches far
from the strike zone. After four pitches landed in the dirt,
Rocker's bullpen catcher moved up a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a frustrated Rocker tossed a ball in the stands and
stalked off into the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Braves assistant general manager Frank Wren said he was not
upset by Rocker's reaction before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can understand why he feels like he does,'' he said.
''Bullpen blowups are not unusual for relief pitchers. That neither
bothers me or concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker didn't seem bothered by a much larger crowd of reporters
who watched him throw in the bullpen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves last season with Atlanta, was banished
to the minor leagues Monday for control problems. He also was fined
$5,000 for a confrontation, before Sunday's home game in Atlanta,
with Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman. In December,
Pearlman had written a story on Rocker's comments about gays,
minorities, and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's outburst Friday came one day after a Toledo television
report claimed the pitcher made an obscene gesture toward a camera
crew.
</P>
<P>
   The video shown by WNWO-TV showed someone in a cab making the
gesture after Rocker and the Richmond Braves played the Toledo Mud
Hens on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wren said Rocker was not the person in the video, and that
Rocker was on the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a joke, Wren said after watching the video. ''They
should've checked with the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo general manager Joe Napoli said he also watched Rocker
get on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''He absolutely, positively, undoubtedly got on the bus,''
Napoli said. ''I didn't even see a taxi cab.''
</P>
<P>
   A WNWO executive said there were conflicting statements from
Braves management and players about whether Rocker was on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we did is put it out there and give the Braves a chance to
make their position,'' said Tim Livingston, the station's executive
producer.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces New U.S. Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) -- Wind mussing his hair, Vice President Al
Gore sped up the Columbia River Friday in a boat named ''Can Do
II,'' turning the administration's designation of new national
monuments into a campaign event.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic presidential candidate saluted local
preservationists who have fought for three decades to protect the
Columbia's Hanford Reach, a 51-mile stretch of salmon-rich waters
and sloping sandstone bluffs. It once served as a security buffer
for Hanford, where the government made plutonium for the nation's
Cold War nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes the effort must have seemed like you yourselves were
swimming upstream,'' Gore said. ''But your ship's come in. I don't
want to get too many metaphors in here, but this is a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Gore, in blue jeans, made a 16-mile tour of the
Columbia then addressed a riverbank gathering, President Clinton
made the formal monument designations at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The designations were made under the Antiquities Act, which
allows creation of monuments on federal land for scientific or
historic reasons. Also chosen:
</P>
<P>
   -- Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou, including Soda Mountain and nearby
lands where plant and animal life are abundant.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Canyons of the Ancients, nine miles west of Mesa Verde
National Park in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Ironwood Forest, a 129,000-acre area northwest of Tucson,
Ariz., that is filled with stands of ironwood trees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's courtship Friday of the Pacific Northwest -- emerging as a
battleground in the race against Republican George W. Bush -- was an
exhaustive one. He left Los Angeles at 6 a.m. for a 17-hour day of
campaigning across Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Conference of Mayors' meeting in Seattle, Gore
touted the administration's economic record: ''One of the reasons
America's cities are back is that America is back and our economy
has turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for a two-week campaign swing focused on future
economic policy, Gore warned that bad decisions about how to handle
budget surpluses are just as dangerous as bad decisions about
deficits. ''We could kill the golden goose,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   He also headlined the state Democratic Party dinner in Spokane
before returning to the nation's capital on an overnight flight.
</P>
<P>
   At a Democratic Party lunch to raise $450,000, Gore shook hands
with Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, the first elected official to
endorse the vice president's primary rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley. Both now support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter if Washington Democrats are enthusiastic
about Gore, Schell said, ''We have no choice,'' saying he's better
than Bush. As for formerly backing Bradley, he said, ''I make no
apologies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not helping him that we got the federal government trying
to take apart one of our major businesses out here,'' Schell said,
referring to the government-ordered breakup of Seattle-based
Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Steele, a retired engineer from the Hanford nuclear plant,
piloted the small motor boat that cruised Gore and the state's top
Democrats, Sen. Patty Murray and Gov. Gary Locke, up the river.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was later the ''surprise guest'' at a re-election
fund-raiser for Locke.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president promised, if elected, to convene a ''summit''
to decide the controversial question of breaching four dams across
the Snake River in Washington to help save the region's famous but
endangered salmon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will bring together all interested parties to find a real
solution. Mine will be an inclusive approach based on solid science
-- the kind of approach that is working right now in coastal areas
like the Puget Sound,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and labor officials say that breaching the dams, as
environmentalists suggest, would threaten farming, other businesses
and jobs. Demonstrators with signs that read, ''Don't Gore our
Dams,'' greeted the vice president here in southeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has pledged to block any attempt to breach the dams and his
campaign criticized Gore Friday for not taking a position.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore continues to demonstrate weak leadership on an
important issue,'' said Bush spokesman Dan Barlett.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Boise, Idaho, Green Party candidate Ralph Nader
also urged the breaching of the dams.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican, and county
commissioners in Hanford's three surrounding counties oppose the
federal designation of the Hanford Reach, arguing that such
decisions should take into account the views of local residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanford nuclear site is a priority Superfund area for future
cleanup, and Gore said, ''I am committed to making sure that we
continue to clean up the Cold War legacy of contamination on this
land.''

<HEADLINE> New Greek Museum Opens  </HEADLINE>
By THEODORA TONGAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece has a lot of history. And a lot of
museums.
</P>
<P>
   Now one museum is offering visitors a glimpse of it all, packing
exhibits that span more than 5,000 years into one place.
</P>
<P>
   The Benaki Museum in Athens reopened its doors Friday after a
renovation that cost $20 million and took more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to offer a summary but (also) panoramic view of
Greek history,'' said museum director Angelos Delivorias. ''It is
the only museum that unifies Greek time and space under one roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivorias led an army of restoration workers and other experts
who arranged more than 20,000 items chronologically in 36 rooms in
a radical restoration that now uses an area more than double the
original 32,300 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Collections were enriched. A wing was added, display cases were
installed and everything behind the building's neoclassical
exterior was modernized.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the collection are rare hammered gold cups from
the Aegean of the early Bronze Age. At the other, the two Nobel
Prizes for literature won by George Seferis in 1963 and Odysseus
Elytis in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In between are early Christian Fayum death portraits, Byzantine
icons and scores of local costumes from around Greece. There's a
copy of the first Greek Constitution signed in 1844, and weapons
used by the poet Lord Byron in Greece's war of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Delivorias said the exhibits on display include just 20 percent
of the museum's collection. Room for Greek items is so limited that
Islamic and Chinese works once on display will be moved to other
sites.

<HEADLINE> Charity: Letter Aided Embezzlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS (AP) -- An American Cancer Society executive accused of
embezzling $6.9 million from the charity turned himself in Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wiant, the former chief administrative officer for the
society's Ohio chapter, was arrested late Friday at Port Columbus
International Airport after stepping off a flight from Toronto, FBI
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus television station WBNS reported that he had traveled
unaccompanied from Zurich, Switzerland, to Montreal, then to
Toronto, before returning to Columbus, where he faces bank fraud
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wiant is scheduled to appear before a federal judge on Monday.
Calls Friday night to his lawyer, Kevin Durkin, were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Wiant, 35, oversaw computer and financial operations for the
American Cancer Society's Ohio chapter and was authorized to
transfer money between the charity's accounts, said Harvey
Schwartz, the charity's vice president of market development in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Schwartz said, Wiant faxed a letter to Fifth Third
Bank that said he wanted to transfer money to a law firm in Austria
and that the money was going to be disbursed for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The research statement was a ruse, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, the money was wired to a bank in
Austria. The FBI has not said if the money was recovered or where
the money is now.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Wiant called his wife last week to tell her
about the alleged scam and to say he wasn't coming back, and she
then called police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease with which nearly half of the nonprofit
organization's $15 million annual budget was moved out of the
country, officials for the Ohio chapter and the bank were confident
all of the money would be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really have any comment about this case in terms of
whether Fifth Third followed everything to the 'T','' bank official
Debbie Beyer said when asked whether normal protocol on transfers
had been followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we're trying to communicate is that once we
became aware of it, that everything was put into motion to avoid
any losses,'' Beyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The missing money was among funds raised by volunteers to
support cancer research, education and prevention programs.

<HEADLINE> Rice Steps Up For Lakers  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers' third option suddenly
became No. 2, and not by choice.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, much maligned throughout the playoffs for his
inconsistent play on offense, was up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And so were Ron Harper, Derek Fisher and Robert Horry, who also
moved up in the pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   An 11-year veteran known as one of the NBA's top outside
shooters but often a disappointment this season, Rice came through
after Kobe Bryant sprained his ankle in the first quarter, scoring
21 points as the Lakers beat Indiana 111-104 Friday night to take a
2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who made 1-of-8 shots and scored three points in the
Lakers' 104-87 victory in Game 1, bounced back with a 7-of-15
performance, including 5-of-6 from 3-point range. His point total
equaled his high in this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's biggest shot was a 3-pointer from the top of the key with
a little less than five minutes left, ending a 6-0 Indiana run and
giving the Lakers an 89-84 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers weren't closer than three points after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took the lead for good on a foul shot by Shaquille
O'Neal with 2:53 left in the third quarter, and Rice followed with
his fourth 3-pointer in as many tries at that stage to give the
Lakers a 71-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, forced to play more minutes than usual and become more
of a scorer as well because of Bryant's injury, also scored 21
points including four free throws in the final 32.5 seconds to
clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's running bank shot with a little more than eight minutes
left made it 82-78, and Fisher followed with a 3-pointer to give
the Lakers the game's biggest lead at that stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a second-team All-NBA selection as well as first-team
all-defense pick, was injured while making his only shot of the
game, a 17-foot jumper with 3:26 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who sprained his right foot in Game 5 of the Western
Conference finals against Portland but didn't miss any playing
time, landed on Jalen Rose' foot after releasing the shot, and went
down.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious immediately that the injury was significant, as
he arose hobbling, and shortly thereafter, he left the court for
good.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's status for Game 3 at Conseco Fieldhouse on Sunday night
is unclear. The Lakers said Bryant, who scored 14 points in Game 1,
is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, O'Neal set a playoff record by attempting 39 free
throws, making 18. He was fouled intentionally several times in the
late going, and made 5-of-10 in those situations.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers leading 99-96, the ball went into O'Neal, but he
dropped it to Horry before the Pacers could foul him, and Horry's
three-point play gave Los Angeles a six-point lead.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Can't Capitalize on Bryant  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers got an unexpected break
when Kobe Bryant sprained his left ankle early in Game 2. But they
couldn't take advantage of the injury that should have been a pain
for the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant landed on Jalen Rose's left foot nine minutes into Friday
night's game and didn't return, taking away the Lakers' No. 2
scoring option.
</P>
<P>
   His absence made it a close game, but the Lakers hung on for a
111-104 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pacers played much better than they did in losing
Game 1 104-87 Wednesday night, Reggie Miller again failed to
produce any heroics in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, coming off a career playoff-low seven points Wednesday,
was held to two points in the fourth on two free throws that drew
the Pacers within three with less than two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finished with 21 points on 7-of-16 shooting, far fewer
shots than he said he wanted to take after Game 1. Jalen Rose
scored 30 points and Austin Croshere added 24, including 12-of-12
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers hurt themselves with 37.5 percent field-goal
shooting, then were forced to foul repeatedly in the final 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's injury put the pressure on Shaquille O'Neal, especially
in the fourth when the Pacers went to Hack-a-Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who set a record for most free throws attempted in an
NBA game, hit just enough to keep the Lakers in front. He sank
18-of-39 foul shots and finished with 40 points and 24 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal went mostly unchallenged in the post against Dale Davis
and Sam Perkins after Rik Smits picked up his fifth foul with 7:09
remaining in the third. Smits didn't return until the final minute
and finished with four points in 16 minutes.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 111, Pacers 104  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- This wasn't just Hack-a-Shaq. This was
Hack-a-Shaq in hyperdrive, Hack-a-Shaq hysteria -- and it still
didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal took so many foul shots -- hitting 18 of 39 --
that he knocked Wilt Chamberlain and Bob Cousy out of the record
books.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of another incredible statistical night for O'Neal,
who had 40 points and 24 rebounds as the Los Angeles Lakers
overcame an injury to Kobe Bryant to defeat the foul-happy Indiana
Pacers 111-104 Friday night and take a 2-0 lead in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   In the entire history of the league, no player had taken so many
free throws in a game. Chamberlain set the overall record of 34 in
1962, and Cousy set the postseason record of 32 in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal left them in the dust long before this one was over,
making just enough to allow the Lakers to maintain a slim lead down
the stretch. The shocking numbers followed O'Neal's 43-point,
19-rebound performance in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is Sunday, and the Pacers will be hard-pressed to come up
with a crazier strategy to turn this series around and try to
become just the third team in league history to come back from such
a deficit in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   If committing 38 fouls couldn't do the trick, even with Bryant
sitting out the final 3{ quarters with a sprained ankle, maybe
nothing will.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice and Ron Harper both stepped up in Bryant's absence,
scoring 21 points apiece. Harper was aggressive with the ball,
driving repeatedly to the hoop, while Rice found his shooting touch
and made five 3-pointers after scoring just three points in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Jalen Rose scored 30 to lead Indiana, Austin Croshere added 24
and Reggie Miller had 21 -- just two coming in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Perkins and Dale Davis fouled out from hacking Shaq, while
Rik Smits committed five fouls and Miller, Mark Jackson and
Croshere had four each. Of the 10 Pacers who played, each fouled
O'Neal at least once.
</P>
<P>
   Of O'Neal's 39 foul shots, 16 came in the fourth quarter when
the Pacers employed the strategy of sending the 7-footer -- a 49
percent foul shooter in the playoffs -- to the line repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal never made two out of two in the fourth, but he never
went 0-for-2 either. And although the Pacers drew within three
points several times, they never completely caught up.
</P>
<P>
   The Hack-a-Shaq strategy heated up in the final three minutes.
Every time the Lakers inbounded, the Pacers hacked him, grabbed
him, tackled him or climbed all over him. He took 12 free throws in
a span of 1:46, making half of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying to get myself to calm down. I was looking over at
my father. He told me to take my time, follow through and shoot,''
O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   His success rate was good enough, it turned out, to help the
Lakers overcome what could have been a devastating loss.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant went down in obvious pain just 7{ minutes into the game
when his foot landed on Rose's foot after Bryant shot a jumper.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to get up, stumbled down and then repeated the process
again. Hopping around on his uninjured foot and not knowing in
which direction to turn, he looked like the human equivalent of a
thoroughbred horse pulling up lame with a fracture.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center crowd went silent as Bryant limped off the
court and to the locker room, where he underwent X-rays that came
up negative. He was later seen walking down a hallway near the
locker room, unable to put any weight on the injured foot. The
Lakers listed him as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers started pulling away early in the fourth after
Indiana got within two with 8:25 left. Harper drove for a bank
shot, Derek Fisher hit a wide-open 3-pointer as the Lakers swung
the ball out of a double-team and O'Neal went 1-for-2 from the
line.
</P>
<P>
   That made it 86-78, but Indiana came back as O'Neal was whistled
for his fifth foul -- a highly questionable call that appeared to be
a clean block of Travis Best's shot. Best made both shots to start
a 6-0 run that made it 86-84.
</P>
<P>
   Rice answered with a 3-pointer, O'Neal scored the Lakers' next
two baskets and the stage was set for Indiana to start fouling.
</P>
<P>
   That they did, but to no avail -- just like the Portland Trail
Blazers found out in the Western Conference finals when they sent
O'Neal to the line 25 times in the fourth quarter of Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bryant's injury and O'Neal's 5-for-17 shooting from the
foul line, the Lakers still held a 52-49 halftime lead as O'Neal
scored 15, Rice 13 and Harper 11.
</P>
<P>
   Miller served notice early that he was eager to shoot himself
out of his slump, making his first attempt -- an 18-footer -- on the
Pacers' first possession. Breaking from their usual habit of trying
to get Smits involved early on offense, the Pacers looked to go to
Miller or Rose nearly every time downcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Rose finished the first quarter with 10 points, Miller had eight
and O'Neal had just six. Los Angeles stayed ahead early in the
second quarter, but the Pacers stayed within striking distance and
finally regained the lead when Rose followed an airball by O'Neal
by pushing the ball into the lane for a short turnaround that made
it 38-37 with 6:32 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers held a 52-49 halftime lead, and the score was tied
60-60 with 7:09 left in the third quarter when Smits picked up his
fifth foul. Undaunted, the Pacers pulled ahead, Miller gaining
confidence as he hit a wide-open 3-pointer and a two-handed jam --
both on fast breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's lead didn't last long, though, and the Lakers took a
73-69 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Cousy of the Boston Celtics shot 32 free throws against
Syracuse in a quadruple-overtime playoff game March 21, 1953. There
were 128 total free-throw attempts in that game -- 32 more than
Indiana and LA combined for. ... Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks
held the NBA Finals record of 24 free throws against Boston on
April 9, 1958. ... Actress Pamela Anderson was among the courtside
celebrities, sporting a temporary ''Man of Steel'' tattoo just like
O'Neal's on her right arm. Tracy McGrady of the Toronto Raptors sat
directly behind her wearing a black doo-rag and a red NBA
Entertainment credential.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 4, Angels 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Randy Johnson allowed three hits in six innings
to become the National League's first 10-game winner Friday night
as the Arizona Diamondbacks snapped a five-game losing streak by
beating the Anaheim Angels 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson (10-1) struck out eight to tie fellow left-hander Mickey
Lolich for 13th on the career strikeout list with 2,832. Steve
Carlton is the only lefty to strike out more. Johnson walked one
and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who had missed his last start after receiving a
cortisone injection to relieve soreness in his left shoulder, left
the game after throwing 101 pitches. The six-inning stint was his
shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is 7-0 with a 0.98 ERA at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   Vincente Padilla, Dan Plesac and Byung-Hyun Kim blanked the
Angels over the last three innings. Kim got his seventh save in
nine chances.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's only run came on a 457-foot homer by Troy Glaus in the
third inning. The blast, which landed in the dining area outside
Friday's Front Row restaurant far beyond the left-field wall, tied
Ron Gant for the third-longest in Bank One Ballpark. It was Glaus'
18th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez hit his fourth home run in five games, a two-run
shot off Brian Cooper (2-2) in the Diamondbacks' four-run fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Angels' first baseman Mo Vaughn committed two errors, one of
them costing a run.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, in his fourth start since being recalled from Triple-A
Edmonton, allowed three earned runs and six hits in five innings.
He struck out one, walked three and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack tripled into the right-field corner with one out in
the fourth, then scored on Jay Bell's single. Gonzalez followed
with his 15th homer, on Cooper's first pitch, to make it 3-1. Steve
Finley broke out of 1-for-11 slump with a two-out double. Turner
Ward followed with a one-bouncer to first, but Vaughn threw wildly
past the bag as Cooper tried to cover, allowing Finley to score.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, back for a brief three-game home stand after a
1-5 trip, loaded the bases with one out in the fourth but failed to
score when Kelly Stinnett hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Diamondbacks traded utility man Andy Fox to Florida for
outfielder Danny Bautista, who is to be in uniform for Saturday's
Arizona-Anaheim game. ... The Diamondbacks activated Travis Lee
from the DL (groin pull), and he started at first base. ...The only
home runs hit farther at Bank One Ballpark than Glaus' were by
Scott Rolen and Matt Williams. ... Anaheim's Darin Erstad was
0-for-3 to end his eight-game hitting streak. ... Johnson struck
out the side on 12 pitches in the first inning.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Eager To Move On  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Ray Lewis is looking forward to getting
back into another sticky situation -- on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a colorful shirt, khaki pants and sandals, Lewis spoke
Friday at the Baltimore Ravens' training complex, his first news
conference since he went to trial in the stabbing deaths of two men
after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is done. This is a chapter that needs to be closed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The star linebacker knows all about making important plays while
wearing a football uniform, but nothing could have prepared him for
facing hard questions about a double murder.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, now a free man, admitted he erred when he initially lied
to police about the murder outside of an Atlanta nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've faced fourth-down-and-one a lot of times, but when it's
fourth-down-and-life, you don't know what's going to happen in that
situation,'' he said. ''When the police approached me, I gave a
false statement to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he admitted that was a mistake, Lewis couldn't hide the
ill feelings he still harbors toward Atlanta prosecutor Paul
Howard, who had Lewis arrested on murder charges and brought him to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where am I going from here?'' Lewis said. ''Back to what I've
been doing, playing football and enjoying what I do, showing kids
that there's still a passion for the game even though you're
falsely accused about certain things.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what I honestly learned is that no matter who you are,
no matter how much money you have and no matter who you think you
know, that if someone wants to accuse you of something, they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is eager to put all that behind him. The next step in his
effort to make the transition from accused murderer back to NFL
star comes Monday, when he dons a jersey and helmet on the first
day of the Ravens' veteran minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis expects his teammates to readily welcome him back. And he
will be surprised if he is subjected to trash talk from opponents
on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would take a person that's heartless to bring this up on
the football field because ... two people are dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The murder charges were dropped Sunday, and Lewis pleaded guilty
to obstruction of justice Monday and was sentenced to a year on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ray Lewis was totally exonerated,'' said his attorney, Ed
Garland, who called the misdemeanor charge the equivalent of a
speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis led the NFL in tackles last season and was an integral
part of the league's second-ranked defense. He was selected to play
in the Pro Bowl, but missed the game after being implicated in the
Atlanta murders.
</P>
<P>
   His codefendants remain on trial, and closing arguments were
Friday. As part of his plea bargain, Lewis testified on behalf of
the prosecution, and he said Friday he would not concern himself
with the fate of his co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   He missed a minicamp and two other camps this spring, but Lewis
said that shouldn't affect his preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you've been doing something 15 years, a couple of months
of missing it won't make you lose everything that you've learned or
gained,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Lewis received a valuable lesson from the
harrowing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's anything I'll change, it's the choices I make,'' he
said. ''I've always been a guy who's made great choices. Everybody
stumbles every once in a while, but I don't think it's about
stumbling. It's about recovering, to see where you go from there.''

<HEADLINE> Rocker Perfect in Toledo  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SEEWER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAUMEE, Ohio (AP) -- John Rocker was a much different pitcher
when the reporters and photographers weren't near.
</P>
<P>
   The combustible reliever struck out the side during his first
minor league appearance Friday with the Triple-A Richmond Braves.
But before the game, he was yelling at reporters as he tried to
warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker overpowered the bottom of the Toledo Mud Hens' lineup,
throwing 15 of 20 pitches for strikes. His fastball was sharp,
consistently hitting in the 93-95 mph range.
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched ahead, which was the key,'' said Richmond pitching
coach Mike Alvarez. ''It was all good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker walked the second batter he faced, but struck out the
next two.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Rocker appeared angry as soon as he stepped out
of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Get a good picture of me throwing, that's important,'' he said
while glaring at a half-dozen reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   A few tosses later he again glared into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me ask you something, is it more exciting to watch a guy
throw or paint dry?'' Rocker said to Richmond pitching coach Mike
Alvarez. ''Paint, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker did not talk to reporters. He stalked off into the
clubhouse following the early throwing session.
</P>
<P>
   He also signed some autographs during the game, setting off a
run on souvenir baseballs at the gift shop. There was no question
who the crowd of 7,733 came to see.
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker got up to stretch in the sixth inning, fans
immediately swarmed toward a railing along the bullpen. Sheriff's
deputies quickly moved them back.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that amazed me most was that he warmed with 10 cops
around,'' said Toledo manager Dave Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd went wild when he sprinted into the game. He warmed up
with ''Wild Thing'' playing on the Ned Skeldon Stadium speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker struck out Chris Wakeland on three straight pitches.
Jesus Azuaje struck out swinging to give Richmond a 10-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was much better than he had been in Atlanta, where he had
10 saves in 11 opportunities and a 3.93 ERA this season, but walked
25 batters in 18 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   During warmups, he threw for about 10 minutes, with most of his
pitches far from the strike zone. After four pitches landed in the
dirt, Rocker's bullpen catcher moved up a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a frustrated Rocker tossed a ball in the stands and
left.
</P>
<P>
   Braves assistant general manager Frank Wren said he was not
upset by Rocker's reaction before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can understand why he feels like he does,'' he said.
''Bullpen blowups are not unusual for relief pitchers. That neither
bothers me or concerns me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker didn't seem bothered by a much larger crowd of reporters
who watched him throw in the bullpen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who had 38 saves last season with Atlanta, was banished
to the minor leagues Monday for control problems. He also was fined
$5,000 for a confrontation, before Sunday's home game in Atlanta,
with Sports Illustrated reporter Jeff Pearlman. In December,
Pearlman had written a story on Rocker's comments about gays,
minorities, and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's outburst Friday came one day after a Toledo television
report claimed the pitcher made an obscene gesture toward a camera
crew.
</P>
<P>
   The video shown by WNWO-TV showed someone in a cab making the
gesture after Rocker and the Braves played the Mud Hens on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Wren said Rocker was not the person in the video, and that
Rocker was on the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a joke,'' Wren said after watching the video. ''They
should've checked with the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo general manager Joe Napoli said he also watched Rocker
get on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''He absolutely, positively, undoubtedly got on the bus,''
Napoli said. ''I didn't even see a taxi cab.''
</P>
<P>
   A WNWO executive said there were conflicting statements from
Braves management and players about whether Rocker was on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we did is put it out there and give the Braves a chance to
make their position,'' said Tim Livingston, the station's executive
producer.

<HEADLINE> Stars Ready To Hammer Devils  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Ken Hitchcock has an interesting analogy to
describe the way the New Jersey Devils have attacked his Dallas
Stars in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been the nail and they've been the hammer,'' the coach
of the defending champions said. ''And we've just been moving the
nail around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars got in a few licks in Game 5, dragging things out to a
third overtime and finally winning on a goal from Mike Modano. That
victory brought the series back to Dallas for Game 6 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Stars are still down 3-2 and facing elimination,
they believe they've proven the series is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the further the game went, the more we kept saying,
'If we can win this one, boys, we're going to be right there,'''
captain Derian Hatcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano said the team was convinced that if they won Game 5,
''we'd be going back to play Monday,'' for a seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's still our mindset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The longest shutout in finals history was only the start of a
long 24 hours for the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fly back immediately after the game, they had a
45-minute bus ride to Piscataway, N.J., the closest place they
could find a hotel. After another bus ride back to Newark Airport,
their flight home was forced to circle the airport several times
because of weather. It finally landed on a faraway runway, forcing
them to roll all the way to their destination.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, trying to become only the second of 26 teams to overcome
a 3-1 deficit in the finals, can force a deciding game with a
victory at Reunion Arena, where it is 9-3 this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those losses, however, came to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel that we can't lose three in a row at home,'' Modano
said. ''We plan on playing our best game, too, and continue on with
the things we did last night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a patient game, whoever can wait out the other team and
mentally break them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, especially Bobby Holik, had plenty of chances to
claim the Cup, but couldn't get past Stars goalie Eddie Belfour.
New Jersey's Martin Brodeur also was brilliant in goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had the party ready to go,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk
said, ''and we took it away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey can take solace in having played a great game, too.
And if the Devils check the standings, they still have two chances
to get the one victory needed to clinch the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Two other factors work in New Jersey's favor: overcoming a 3-1
deficit the previous round, which helps the Devils understand the
mindset needed to avoid such a collapse; and a 9-2 road record this
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he's not sure who has the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know one thing: We have a hockey team that can hardly wait
to come to the rink,'' he said. ''That wasn't the case two days
ago.''

<HEADLINE> 49ers Young Formalizes Retirement  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Steve Young has signed off on his
retirement. All that remains now is to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Young on Friday sent his formal retirement notice via fax to the
San Francisco 49ers, and team officials began preparations for
Monday's farewell news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 38, told general manager Bill Walsh of his intention to
retire in a midweek phone call and followed that with his
retirement letter.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't spoken publicly since word came down Thursday that he
was ending his 17-year pro career, including 15 NFL seasons, the
last 13 with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-rated passer in league history, Young led San
Francisco to its fifth Super Bowl title following the 1994 season.
He hasn't played since going down last September at Arizona with
his eighth known concussion, and fourth in three years.
</P>
<P>
   His formal retirement announcement at noon EDT on Monday will be
held in an unusual setting: the 49ers' locker room at club
headquarters. The guest list is lengthy and includes former 49ers
owner Eddie DeBartolo, who turned over control of the team to his
sister earlier this year as part of resolving a family feud; and
former club president Carmen Policy, who left San Francisco to join
the new Cleveland Browns after a falling out with DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   Young's wife, parents and other relatives also are coming, along
with Brigham Young coach LaVell Edwards, who was Young's coach in
college. Denver coach Mike Shanahan and Seattle coach Mike
Holmgren, both former offensive coordinators in San Francisco and
both influential in Young's development, were also on the guest
list.
</P>
<P>
   Among the teammates expected to be on hand are Jerry Rice, with
whom Young formed the most prolific touchdown-pass tandem in NFL
history, Harris Barton and Brent Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word if four-time Super Bowl winner Joe Montana,
who was both a teammate and rival of Young, would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, the 49ers' coach when he pulled off the 1987 trade to
bring Young to San Francisco from Tampa Bay, will miss the the
quarterback's departure. Walsh has already left town on a
previously scheduled family vacation in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   While Young spent much of Friday talking with friends and
relatives and getting invitations out to the news conference, 49ers
officials were preparing the locker room for Monday's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of squeezing everyone in posed a bit of a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we're going to make it work,'' team spokesman Kirk
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the tributes to Young have already started.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe he's one of the top five players ever to play
the game at his position,'' Shanahan said Friday. ''I think the
world of him. What a career he's had.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could do it all. He had a great sense of timing. He could
make all the throws. He was a great competitor. He was a leader,
both on and off the football field. And he could make plays when
nothing was there. He was a legitimate sub-4.5 quarterback, and
they don't exist very often. He had that burning desire which only
the great ones have to be as competitive as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Ray Brown said Young will be missed.
</P>

   ''He was obviously very talented athletically,'' Brown said.
''But he was on the same page as the coaches, because he knew the
system as well as they did. That's going to be sorely missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That guy has been through the battles and the wars. He stood
out among stars in this locker room. To be a star guy and be very
approachable, that's unique. He was very much one of the guys.''

<HEADLINE> Cancer Soc. Official Turns Himself In  </HEADLINE>
By KATE ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- An American Cancer Society executive
accused of embezzling $6.9 million from the charity turned himself
in Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wiant, the former chief administrative officer for the
society's Ohio chapter, was arrested late Friday at Port Columbus
International Airport after stepping off a flight from Toronto, FBI
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus television station WBNS reported that Wiant had
traveled unaccompanied from Zurich, Switzerland, to Montreal, then
to Toronto, before returning to Ohio, where he faces bank fraud
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Wiant is scheduled to appear before a federal judge on Monday.
Calls Friday night to his lawyer, Kevin Durkin, were not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Wiant, 35, oversaw computer and financial operations for the
American Cancer Society's Ohio chapter and was authorized to
transfer money between the charity's accounts, said Harvey
Schwartz, the charity's vice president of market development in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Schwartz said, Wiant faxed a letter to Fifth Third
Bank that said he wanted to transfer money to a law firm in Austria
and that the money was going to be used for research purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The research statement was a ruse, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, the money was wired to a bank in
Austria. The FBI has not said if the money was recovered or where
the money is now.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Wiant called his wife last week to tell her
about the alleged scam and to say he wasn't coming back, and she
then called police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease with which nearly half of the nonprofit
organization's $15 million annual budget was moved out of the
country, officials for the Ohio chapter and the bank were confident
all of the money would be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really have any comment about this case in terms of
whether Fifth Third followed everything to the 'T','' bank official
Debbie Beyer said when asked whether normal protocol on transfers
had been followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we're trying to communicate is that once we
became aware of it, that everything was put into motion to avoid
any losses,'' Beyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The missing money was from funds raised by volunteers to support
cancer research, education and prevention programs.

Alaska Airlines Submits Plans
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines on Friday filed its response to the Federal
Aviation Administration's concerns over the company's maintenance practices. A
recent audit and inspection by the FAA turned up more than 150 cases of missing
or incomplete maintenance records, the agency announced last week. The
inspection was launched after the Jan. 31 crash of an Alaska Airlines jet off
the California coast. Although further investigation found that the maintenance
in question had been adequately performed, the FAA is considering stripping
Alaska of the right to perform heavy maintenance -- work that requires an
aircraft be removed from service while major components are repaired or
replaced.

U.S., North Korea Reach Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean officials reached an
agreement Friday to immediately resume the search for more than 8,000 U.S.
soldiers missing in action from the Korean War. The first search mission is
scheduled for June 25, the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.
The agreement to conduct five joint operations between June and November was
reached after three days of talks between the U.S. Defense Department and the
North Korean People's Liberation Army. As a result of previous negotiations,
U.S. teams have conducted 12 recovery operations inside North Korea since 1996
and found 42 sets of remains.

N.M. Park Superintendent To Retire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Roy Weaver, the park superintendent who approved a
prescribed burn that blew out of control and rolled through Los Alamos last
month, said Friday he will retire in July. Weaver, superintendent of Bandelier
National Monument for nearly 10 years, said he believed conditions had been just
right for the park's annual regimen of burning brush May 4 to stave off a
potentially disastrous fire. But after the burn was started, it became the
largest wildfire in state history, destroying more than 200 homes in Los Alamos
and forcing 25,000 people to evacuate.

Acquittal in Prison Gladiator Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Eight California prison guards were acquitted Friday
of federal charges that they entertained themselves by staging gladiator-style
fights among inmates, including a brawl in which a prisoner was shot to death.
After a nine-week trial, the jury reached its verdict in six hours of
deliberations. It cleared the guards of charges that they conspired to deny the
prisoners' right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. Defense lawyers
argued that guards did not set up any fights. They said the fights erupted when
inmates of different ethnic and geographic backgrounds were forced to exercise
together in the prison's highest-security unit, as part of a since-rescinded
''integrated yard'' policy.

   KFAR KILA, Lebanon (AP) -- U.N. efforts to lay down borders between Lebanon
and Israel hit bumpy terrain Friday, with protesters stoning U.N. inspection
teams, officials raising objections and villagers threatening to evict
peacekeepers. Also Friday, Palestinians threw stones at Israeli troops on the
border. Several protesters cut the fence and walked through, drawing warning
shots from Israeli guards. The day's troubles highlighted the continuing
turbulence along the border, where there has been no real authority since last
month's Israeli troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

Segal began his career as a painter but later turned to sculpture. He received a
National Medal of the Arts from President Clinton in 1999. Segal's
three-dimensional sculpture scenes include ''Cezanne's Still Life,'' a breakfast
table with ripe fruit, tea pot and milk pitcher modeled after the famous
painting, and ''Woman on Orange Bed,'' a nude woman lounging on a rumpled,

to defeat the foul-happy Indiana Pacers 111-104 Friday night in Game 2 of the
NBA Finals. Game 3 is Sunday, and the Pacers will be hard-pressed to come up
with a crazier strategy to turn this series around and try to become just the
third team in league history to come back from such a deficit in the finals.
Jalen Rose scored 30 to lead Indiana, Austin Croshere added 24 and Reggie Miller
had 21 -- just two coming in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 6, Cubs 5, 14 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ray Durham's RBI single in the 14th inning gave
the White Sox a 6-5 victory over the crosstown rivals Cubs on
Friday night -- the longest game of the season for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Herbert Perry singled to right and then stole
second. Todd Van Poppel (0-2) walked pinch-hitter Jeff Abbott,
putting runners at first and second with only one out.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel was relieved by Daniel Garibay, and Durham sent a 2-1
pitch bouncing down the left field line to score Perry, ending it
after 4 hours, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel gave up one run on two hits in 1 1-3 innings. Jesus
Pena (1-0) walked one and struck out one in two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa, who had struck out in his first four at-bats, tied
the game at 5 with a two-out, two-run homer in the ninth off closer
Keith Foulke. It was his first homer at Comiskey Park since June 1,
1991, when he was playing for the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa also fanned in the 12th, finishing one shy of the club
record, set by Don Hoak in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight game Foulke has given up a run, though
he managed to get the save in the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas and Jose Valentin hit solo home runs for the White
Sox, who improved their AL-best record to 36-23. They've won five
straight and eight of their last nine.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs starter Jon Lieber, 0-1 in his previous two starts despite
giving up only three runs, ran into trouble in the fourth. After
giving up a single to Thomas, Magglio Ordonez hit a deep fly ball
to center. Damon Buford, running back, couldn't make the catch, and
Ordonez had a stand-up triple.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs tried to get a sliding Thomas at home, but his foot
beat Augie Ojeda's throw for the 1-0 lead. Chris Singleton and
Carlos Lee added RBIs to give the White Sox a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made it 4-1 in the fifth when he homered off of Lieber.
It was his 14th homer of the season and his third in as many games.
Valentin homered in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glenallen Hill closed the Cubs to 4-3 when he homered on the
first pitch he saw in the sixth. Hill knew the ball was gone as
soon as he hit it, too, standing calmly at the plate and letting
his bat just drop as the ball sailed into the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd of 44,140 was the fourth-largest for a
regular-season game at new Comiskey. The top five crowds at the
ballpark have all been for games with the Cubs. ... The White Sox
have homered in 13 straight games, three short of the club record
set in 1987. ... Former-Cub OF Brant Brown was reacquired before
the game in a three-way trade with the Texas Rangers and Florida
Marlins. Brown is expected to join the Cubs on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.S., North Korea Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By RANJAN ROY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On June 25 -- the 50th anniversary of the start
of the Korean War -- a U.S. military team will resume searching for
remains of U.S. servicemen at the scene of a stunning Chinese
onslaught that killed hundreds of American and South Korean troops.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement for the search at the Chongchon River area in
North Korea is part of a deal struck Friday by U.S. and North
Korean negotiators for a series of five joint excavations this year
-- for which the U.S. government agreed to pay North Korea a total
of $2 million -- that could yield the largest number of remains
since joint recovery missions began in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Remains searches were halted last fall in a dispute over North
Korea's demand for new humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Liotta, the lead U.S. negotiator at this week's talks in
Malaysia, said in a telephone interview Friday that the United
States would pay about $400,000 for each of five excavation
operations.
</P>
<P>
   That is twice the $200,000 paid per mission in 1999. Liotta said
the price went up because the search and recovery teams will be
larger this year.
</P>
<P>
   The searches initially will be in Unsan and Kujang counties,
near the Chongchon River north of Pyongyang, the North Korean
capital. It was in this region that elements of the 8th U.S. Army
Cavalry Regiment encountered a surprise attack by hundreds of
thousands of Chinese troops who had slipped across the border
largely unnoticed in October 1950 as U.S. and South Korean forces
pressed toward the Yalu River.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ''MacArthur's War,'' author Stanley Weintraub
described the scene, which marked a reversal of fortunes for a
U.S.-led United Nations force that believed it was within days of
winning the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Effective at infiltrating enemy positions, the Chinese quickly
created panic. Organized resistance evaporated. Rushed forward to
help, the 5th Regiment (1st Cav) lost whole units to encirclement.
Suddenly it was a new war.''
</P>
<P>
   Liotta, deputy director of the Pentagon's POW-MIA office, said
wartime records indicate there are upward of 1,500 unrecovered
remains of U.S. servicemen in the Unsan and Kujang areas. He said
it was impossible to estimate beforehand how many might be
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a pretty good chance of bringing back good numbers
of remains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement permits the United States to broaden its search
for remains all the way to the Yalu River, on the Chinese border,
Liotta said. Many hundreds of U.S. POWs died in camps on the Korean
side of the Yalu.
</P>
<P>
   Remains recovered during this year's searches will be flown by
U.S. military aircraft from the North Korean capital to a U.S. air
base in Japan. For years the United States insisted that war
remains be repatriated through the United Nations Command at
Panmunjom, the border village inside the Demilitarized Zone.
</P>
<P>
   By the Pentagon's count, 8,174 U.S. servicemen are unaccounted
for from the Korean War, which began June 25, 1950, with a North
Korean invasion that nearly drove responding U.S. troops off the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal struck Friday in Kuala Lumpur, the
United States will be allowed 20 people on its search teams. Each
mission will last 25 days.
</P>
<P>
   For many years after the war ended in 1953, the United States
had no means of recovering remains north of the Demilitarized Zone
that was established to divide the capitalist South from the
communist North. But in the early 1990s, North Korea began
unilateral returns of a small number of remains, and later it
negotiated terms of cooperation on joint recovery missions, the
first of which was conducted in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of 12 recovery operations inside North Korea since
then, 42 sets of remains believed to be those of American soldiers
were recovered, although only three have been positively identified
by the Army's Central Identification Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The searches were halted in November 1999 and a subsequent round
of talks in December broke off when North Korea demanded new
American humanitarian donations, including the construction of
factories to produce children's clothing.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Gov. Tries To Lure Natives Home  </HEADLINE>
By RAVEN HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Iowa natives: Is Chicago REALLY your kind of
town? Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack hopes the answer is a resounding
''No!''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was the latest stop on Vilsack's nationwide crusade to
lure native Iowans and alumni of the state's colleges and
universities back to the Hawkeye State. A jazz quartet entertained
alumni and former Iowa residents as they milled about Wednesday
night during a reception sponsored by Vilsack and the Iowa Human
Resource Recruitment Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from businesses were on hand, ready to make a
pitch for the state. Vilsack said the Iowa's low unemployment rate
has forced it to more aggressively sell the state to potential
employees elsewhere. At previous receptions, state representatives
have touted Iowa's low crime rate, quality schools and its growing
job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want folks to know that we are investing in cultural and
recreational opportunities that may be different than the Iowa they
left,'' Vilsack said, pointing to a $200 million partnership with
local governments to develop such opportunities
</P>
<P>
   People in their late 20s and early 30s have been most receptive
to the pitch, he said, especially if they're starting families.
That age-group is particularly interested in raising children in a
safe, secure environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the consortium have also hosted receptions in
New York City, San Diego and Los Angeles. They've planned one for
Minneapolis in the fall. Consortium members said the receptions
have been helpful not only in luring people back, but in changing
the overall perception of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''At times I've found that I must break through the perception
of Iowa. It helps to have others that can help sell the state,''
said Christine Headington-Hall, a human resources manager at a
company near Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   But for some, the question remains -- why Iowa?
</P>
<P>
   Shira Peltan shook her head when asked if she'd consider moving
back to Iowa, where she completed undergraduate studies at Grinnell
College.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer large cities,'' the 22-year-old Northwestern
University graduate student said.
</P>
<P>
   Others seemed ready to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd go back to Iowa in a heartbeat,'' said Rosalyn
Beecham-Green, associate provost at the University of Illinois at
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   A native Iowan who completed all three of her degrees at the
University of Iowa, Beecham-Green said she misses the way of life
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's easy, relaxed, friendly. I miss the helpfulness,'' said
the married mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Reardon, a spokesman for the Illinois Department of
Commerce and Community Affairs, said the marketing efforts aren't
causing state officials to break a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the Wisconsin governor trying to raid our companies
for workers, the Iowa governor trying to convince people to leave
and the Minnesota governor trying to get people to vacation
there,'' Reardon said. ''In a way, it's a compliment to Illinois.
It speaks to the fact that we have a diverse state with a lot to
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack said the state is also increasingly focusing on ways to
retain minority graduates of Iowa colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are tremendous opportunities for alums to have jobs and
to be a part of creating a new impression of a state that has been
pretty much considered Caucasian,'' Vilsack said.
</P>
<P>
   James Alsup, a black graduate of Drake University, said
minorities ''know what they're getting into'' when considering a
move to Iowa, especially if they went to college in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know the state is like, 2 percent black and 98 percent
white,'' he said. ''But it's a nice place to raise a family, it's
quieter and your money goes a lot farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack said he is optimistic that his campaign will strike a
chord with some Iowans who have been longing to return.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amazing thing about Iowans is that they never stop being
Iowan,'' Vilsack said. ''No matter where they move, if you ask them
where they're from, they'll say they're from Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   His wish now? That they'll say it from Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy GOP Opponent Clears Hurdle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The state's Democratic and Libertarian parties
have challenged the nominating signatures collected by Jack E.
Robinson, the only Republican in the state's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The two other parties are hoping to disqualify enough signatures
to knock Robinson off the Republican primary ballot in September.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Secretary of State William Galvin certified
10,139 of the signatures gathered by Robinson. Candidates for U.S.
Senate in Massachusetts need 10,000 certified signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic incumbent Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who has held the
seat since the 1960s, and Libertarian Carla Howell both submitted
well over the 10,000 margin for signatures. The Libertarian Party
is the only other party recognized by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties said they found several problems with Robinson's
paperwork, including signatures that might not be genuine and
incomplete forms.
</P>
<P>
   The formal challenges, filed Friday, will be sent on to the
five-member, bipartisan state Ballot Law Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats already have had handwriting experts scouring
Robinson's papers, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also may try to use the so-called ''stray mark''
rule to kill entire sheets of signatures. The Supreme Judicial
Court has ruled that no stray marks can be allowed on signature
papers for ballot questions, but have not said whether the same law
applies to signature papers for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin said he hopes the dispute is resolved in time for his
office to print ballots, but is worried it might drag on through
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may well end up in court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges are the latest obstacle for the 39-year-old
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of announcing his candidacy, reports surfaced that a
woman had taken a restraining order out against Robinson years
earlier. The millionaire businessman countered by releasing an
11-page ''Robinson Report'' outlining his past, including flunking
the bar three times and being accused of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Paul Cellucci and the party immediately pulled
their support.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci recently appeared on a morning talk radio show and
repeated his opposition to Robinson based in part on the
candidate's personal history.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson issued a news release Friday criticizing Cellucci for
continuing to raise questions about his past.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very sad that the governor would lash out like this,''
Robinson said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Concedes Decoy Allegations  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon acknowledges it used simpler
decoys in recent flight tests of an anti-missile interceptor, but
it denies allegations that this amounted to dishonest manipulation
to hide a fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   The first two interceptor flight tests, in 1997 and 1998, used
more complex and challenging decoys because the Pentagon was
testing competing designs of interceptors built by Boeing Co. and
Raytheon Corp., said Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, spokesman for
the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. He said the
intent was to stress the interceptors' sensors as part of choosing
the superior design.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with test flight No. 3, last October, simpler and fewer
decoys were used because that marked the start of testing with the
winning design, by Raytheon, and from the start the plan was to
increase gradually the level of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The October test hit the mock warhead, but the interceptor
missed its target in the most recent test, in January. The next
test is scheduled for early July, and more than a dozen others are
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Decoys are used in the testing because it is anticipated that
any hostile nation that would fire a long-range ballistic missile
at the United States would try to confuse the interceptor with
false targets during the missile's flight.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's New York Times quoted Theodore Postol, an arms expert
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as saying the
Pentagon's flight tests were rigged to hide the inability of the
interceptor's sensors to distinguish between enemy warheads and
decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is blatantly untrue,'' Lehner said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Gansler, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and
technology, said the Postol accusation amounted to slander and
unfairly impugned the integrity of Pentagon officials from Defense
Secretary William Cohen down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will categorically deny that we're fixing the flights, that
we're lying, that we're cheating,'' Gansler said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner said the Pentagon has made no secret that the
interceptor, at least in its initial configuration, will be unable
to defeat sophisticated missiles, with highly challenging decoys
and other countermeasures, that Russia or China possesses. Instead,
it is designed to shoot down crude warheads, with relatively simple
countermeasures, that might be launched in the coming decade by
North Korea, Iraq or Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Gansler said a decision was made not to create a missile defense
system more complex and costly than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a choice of spending more and more money on more and
more complexity to address all the (missile) threats that one could
hypothesize, versus using our intelligence estimates and our
technical talents to say, 'What are the likely threats that we're
likely to see? ... And can we defeat those?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The political debate in the United States over missile defense
is heating up as President Clinton nears a decision -- probably this
autumn -- whether to give the Pentagon the go-ahead to deploy the
weapon system.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of missile defense, including Postol, have long argued
that distinguishing between warheads and decoys is the Achilles
heel of a missile defense system, which also includes a network of
radars and battle management computers.
</P>
<P>
   Postol and other critics assert that the Pentagon is rushing to
deploy an unproven weapon. They have some support in that from an
independent panel, headed by retired Air Force Gen. Larry Welch,
that reported last November that it found ''a legacy of
overoptimism'' about progress in developing reliable interceptor
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Lehner, the spokesman for the missile defense office, noted that
the Welch panel said the decoys used in the first two flight tests,
in 1997 and 1998, were unnecessarily complicated and recommended
making subsequent flight tests less challenging in terms of
countermeasures.

<HEADLINE> Administration Rejects IMF Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is pushing a
relatively benign overhaul of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank over a set of sweeping operational changes that
congressional Republicans are promoting.
</P>
<P>
   Rejection of the broad changes could spell trouble for two major
administration initiatives: reduction of debt for the world's
poorest countries and increased financial support to the World Bank
for the fight against AIDS in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say unless the administration shows more willingness
to accept a congressionally appointed advisory panel's
recommendations for the international lending institutions, it will
be denied approval for its debt and AIDs initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The administration sent to Congress on Friday a formal 45-page
response to proposals put forward by the commission, headed by
Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that the commission's
proposals would so weaken the IMF and the World Bank that ''vital
U.S. interests would be compromised because of a reduction in their
capacity to respond effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Meltzer commission recommended that the IMF restrict its
operations to providing short-term emergency loans to countries
facing financial crisis that have pre-qualified by meeting IMF
guidelines for economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   For the World Bank, the Meltzer commission recommended that it
halt three-fourths of the loans it now makes, which go to countries
that have access to international capital markets.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the administration argued that such an approach
would have hamstrung the IMF during the 1997-98 Asian crisis, and
the restrictions on the World Bank would keep loans from going to
countries where millions of poor people live.
</P>
<P>
   ''If these recommendations had been in place during the Asian
financial crisis, it would not have been possible to mount the kind
of international response that was ultimately successful in
containing the crisis and preventing it from having a significant
adverse impact on the U.S. economy,'' Summers told reporters at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is pushing a more limited set of changes that
would open the two Washington-based institutions to more public
scrutiny and eliminate some of the overlap between them.
</P>
<P>
   But top Republicans, who have long complained about the IMF and
the World Bank, say the administration needs to be more open to the
Meltzer panel's recommendations. They have warned the
administration that it risks approval of its requests for increased
support for debt relief and AIDS programs in Third World countries
if there is no compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are at an impasse with the administration,'' complained the
Senate Banking Committee chairman, Phil Gramm, R-Texas. ''I am
willing to compromise, but only if we are going in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he believes compromise is possible because the
urgent need to provide debt relief and AIDS funding cannot wait
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a strong desire to find effective solutions,''
Summers said. ''I think we will be able to work through the issues
this year.''

<HEADLINE> New Exhibit For Great Depression  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Ben Shahn, a foremost artist of the 1930s, made his
reputation painting realistic New York scenes from the Great
Depression, but a new exhibit at the Phillips Collection shows that
he found his photographs just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a social painter or photographer,'' he once told an
interviewer. ''I find difficulty in making distinctions between
photography and painting. Both are pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 easel paintings and 112 photos in the show, which
opened Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Turner, curator of the show, called Shahn ''one of
America's greatest artists.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked doing paintings that closely followed the photos he had
snapped himself or found in newspapers. He based one painting on an
Associated Press photo of a demonstration in New York's Union
Square on May 1, 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a right angle viewfinder on his 35 mm. Leica camera
enabled Shahn to shoot faces while appearing to focus in a
different direction. That gave him candid shots without his
subjects knowing they were being pictured. His painting called
''Myself Among the Churchgoers'' depicts him doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some photographers think such deception unethical. That didn't
bother Shahn, though he called flash bulbs ''immoral'' because he
felt they destroyed the natural darkness and mystery of a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Shahn got his first and only lessons from Walker Evans, the
classic photographer. They worked together both in lower Manhattan
and picturing poverty in the southeast for the New Deal's Farm
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Giving instructions on how to set his photo exposure, ''F/9 on
the sunny side of the street, F/4.5 on the shady side of the
street,'' was all Walker told Shahn. ''For a 20th of a second hold
your camera steady.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks At Last Commencement  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his last commencement address as chief
executive, President Clinton spotlights his administration's
efforts to fully open the doors of higher education to all
qualified Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was speaking to the 423 graduating seniors at Carleton
College, an academically distinguished school in Northfield, Minn.,
about 40 miles south of Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the president will use this last commencement to talk
at length on a subject that's very important to him -- breaking down
the barriers of educational opportunity in this country,'' said
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton will cite his administration's
achievements in making college education more open and affordable
''and then look to the future in terms of the great investment we
make in our own lives -- in our own prosperity -- by investing in
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carleton College speech is the 23rd commencement address
Clinton has delivered since taking office in 1993 and his third
this year.
</P>
<P>
   His practice has been to speak at a military academy, a public
college or university and a private institution each year. Over
eight years he has spoken twice each at the Army, Navy, Air Force
and Coast Guard academies and addressed graduates at a range of
institutions, including New Hampshire Technical College (1993 ),
Princeton University (1996) and Grambling (La.) State University
(1999).
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already spoken this year at the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Conn. and at Eastern Michigan University in
Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1866, Carleton College has about 1,850 students and
normally draws an audience of about 3,700 people to its outdoor
commencement ceremonies. This year, with the president as a drawing
card, about 7,000 are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first sitting president ever to deliver a
commencement address at the school and is the first to visit the
campus since President Dwight D. Eisenhower campaigned there in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   The White House noted that Carleton is often near the top in
U.S. News &AMP; World Report's annual rankings of national liberal arts
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   During his one-day Minnesota visit, Clinton also was to address
a Democratic National Convention luncheon and attend a Soul Asylum
rock concert and Democratic Party fund-raiser, both in Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Japan WoodBlocks on Display  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was the first war of a modernized Asian
country against a Western power, and Japanese propaganda turned
back to a classic medium to bolster morale at home -- the
centuries-old tradition of multicolored woodcuts.
</P>
<P>
   Wood block prints, as made by Hokusai and Hiroshige had
portrayed the geishas, prostitutes and playboys of Tokyo's
''floating world.'' Only now the artists portrayed battle scenes
and heroes.
</P>
<P>
   However they were limited in their methods for showing women,
and old habits were strong. Women caring for wounded or mourning a
casualty were sometimes shown making subtle, traditional -- and
probably unintended -- erotic gestures, said James T. Ulak, who as
curator of Japanese art at the Smithsonian Institution's Arthur M.
Sackler Gallery has constructed an exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Sunday, it features the dramatic woodblock prints, some
not seen publicly since the Russo-Japanese War nearly a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The war was short. Smaller but efficient Japanese forces soundly
beat the ill-led army and navy of Czar Nicholas II. Eighteen months
after the fighting started, President Theodore Roosevelt made peace
at Portsmouth, N.H. A dozen years later, the czar was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Ulak told reporters the Japanese government may have worried
about the effect on its people of the military draft and its
burdens. It wanted to show that ordinary members of the armed
forces, as well as upper classes, could please the emperor with
their heroism so several prints highlight their feats.
</P>
<P>
   Others feature the deeds of officers showing concern for
servicemen of lower rank.
</P>
<P>
   Hirose Takeo graduated from the Japanese Naval Academy, studied
in Russia, was said to have opposed the war and became a favorite
of foreign military observers and western reporters.
</P>
<P>
   His warrant officer was setting charges to scuttle a ship and
seal off a harbor when a Russian torpedo hit. The print by
Kobayashi Kiyochika shows Hirose surging from his launch, grasping
his sword, in a vain and fatal attempt to rescue his subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   A small image of a nurse with a red cross on her cap -- a novelty
in Japan -- comes from a series of erotic images, Ulak said. He
suggested that her head, inclined to one shoulder, conveyed an
impression of coyness to a Japanese viewer if not to a western one.
</P>
<P>
   A print of a woman with a handkerchief stuffed in mouth, reading
a letter that apparently reports a Japanese officer struck by enemy
fire, also reflects an old tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The image of the prostitute in dishabille ... handkerchief or
garment sleeve clenched in her teeth while reading a letter
announcing love, lust or rejection ... was common fare in premodern
Japanese prints,'' his label says. ''Use of earlier, erotically
charged visual conventions is somewhat jarring and highlights the
shortcomings of traditional models available to depict new social
realities.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''A Well-Watched War: Images from the Russo-Japanese Front
1904-1905'' will be at the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery through Nov.
26. Admission is free.

<HEADLINE> Monks, Government Clash Over Pagoda  </HEADLINE>
By TINI TRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- The famed lotus-bedecked grounds of the
One Pillar Pagoda have become the backdrop of a simmering battle
for control of the Buddhist shrine, underscoring Vietnam's tight
controls on religious activities.
</P>
<P>
   A government campaign to dismiss and expel the two resident
monks from the pagoda and replace them with a government appointee
has sparked strong resistance from local Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong dispute -- pitting Hanoi officials against
80-year-old presiding monk Thich Thanh Khanh and his assistant
Thich Tam Kien -- has drawn attention from Buddhist groups
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   While Vietnam's constitution enshrines freedom of religion, the
government traditionally maintains a firm grip on religious
activities.
</P>
<P>
   International human rights groups claim Catholics, Protestants
and members of the government-banned Unified Buddhist Church of
Vietnam are regularly suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the monks were part of the
state-sanctioned Vietnam Buddhist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began last July, when the local People's Committee
of Ba Dinh District issued a letter dismissing Khanh as ''Superior
monk'' and expelling Kien. Khanh was ordered to turn over control
of the pagoda to a state-appointed monk.
</P>
<P>
   Khanh promptly fired off a letter to Vietnam's leaders and the
Communist Party, claiming the intervention violated the church's
charter, which says it has sole power over its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The pagoda's congregation rallied around the monks, sending a
petition last fall protesting the measure as ''unlawful (and)
uncivilized.'' They cited a government decree stating the People's
Committee has authority only to approve, not appoint, religious
clergy and hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The One Pillar Pagoda, or Chua Mot Cot, was built by Emperor Ly
Thai Tong in 1049. Legend says the heirless emperor dreamed one
night of meeting the Goddess of Mercy who, seated in a lotus
flower, handed him a male child. Seeing it as a heavenly omen, Tong
married a young peasant girl he met by chance and promptly had a
son. In gratitude, he had the pagoda created to honor the goddess.
</P>
<P>
   The small but elaborate wooden pagoda sits on a stone pillar
four feet wide in the middle of a lotus pond, evoking the image of
a blossom rising from a sea of sorrows. Located behind the Ho Chi
Minh Mausoleum in Hanoi, it is in a compound next to a full-fledged
temple where the caretaker monks live.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Committee, backed by the Hanoi Buddhist
Association, says Khanh was only an interim head of the pagoda
following the 1996 death of his predecessor, Thich Tam Can. Local
officials also claim Can's chosen disciple, Thich Tam Kien, is
unsuitable to be a monk and tarnishes the Buddhist religion. Thich
is the Buddhist title for monk.
</P>
<P>
   It did not give specifics, and requests to interview People's
Committee officials were denied.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon at the immaculate, incense-filled pagoda,
Kien angrily claimed the objections have nothing to do with
religion and everything to do with control.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials and the Hanoi Buddhist Association have long had
an eye on the One Pillar Pagoda, which gets a sizable number of
visitors and donations, he said. The monks keep the money for
maintenance and charity work.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very famous pagoda and there's a lot of economic
profits. They don't care about the Buddhist cause; they only want
the profits and prestige of running this pagoda,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is apparently not the first time Hanoi has tried to gain
control of the pagoda. The Paris-based International Buddhist
Information Bureau, the information arm of the Unified Buddhist
Church of Vietnam, said the government planned to confiscate the
pagoda in the mid-1980s and turn it into a museum honoring Ho Chi
Minh, the father of modern Vietnam. After Buddhists objected en
masse, the plan was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, the two monks have appealed for aid in
letters to the National Assembly, the Communist Party, the
government and local media. Local Buddhists have sent letters to
the outlawed Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam asking it to help
mobilize support.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Committee issued an ultimatum in March that Kien
leave the premises by April 30 or ''relevant agencies would be
assigned to enforce measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months later, Kien remains ensconced in the pagoda
and said no efforts have been made to remove him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the authorities try to remove me, the followers will block
their way,'' he said. ''There is a saying that the righteous tree
has no fear of falling.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: I'll Veto Estate Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is holding tough on his
threat to veto House-passed legislation that eventually would
abolish the federal inheritance tax, calling it too expensive and a
''windfall'' for the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this bill were presented to me in its current form, I would
veto it without hesitation,'' the president said Friday after the
House Republicans brushed aside a Democratic alternative and passed
their bill 279-136.
</P>
<P>
   It would repeal the tax gradually by 2010. Clinton's statement
on the vote said it would cost losses of $750 billion in the decade
after repeal is fully in place.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about a tremendous amount of money,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''If they want the
accomplishment, they're going to have to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Joined by 65 Democrats, Republicans ignored Clinton's veto
threat and sent the repeal bill to the Senate. Supporters said they
were acting to prevent taxes from ruining family farms and small
businesses, but detractors decried it as a costly giveaway to the
wealthiest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would cost $105 billion during the 10-year phaseout by
cutting the top 55 percent federal rate in 2001 and gradually
reduce all other rates until 2010. While the bill doesn't directly
affect state inheritance taxes, many link collections to the
federal tax and would have to be rewritten to continue in force.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2 percent of families of people who die pay the
estate tax, which applies this year to estates above $675,000 for
an individual. In 1997, about 43,000 estates out of 2.3 million
adult deaths were taxable. Because of more generous exemptions,
only a tiny fraction of farm and small business heirs are affected.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the repeal bill said the threat of the tax forces
people to do costly estate planning, restrains expansion and
investment and jeopardizes jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The death tax is a natural-born killer of everything they have
worked for their entire lives,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. ''This isn't a rich
against the poor issue. This is a jobs issue and a fairness
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although repeal is a top GOP priority, co-sponsors included many
black and Hispanic Democrats and liberals not normally allied with
such tax cuts. They agreed the tax was causing headaches for
minorities and other middle-class entrepreneurs who are taking
advantage of the booming economy to build successful enterprises
and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who hires the workers in America? Is it the guy on the street
corner or the people who achieve some success?'' said Rep. James
Traficant, D-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in
voting for the measure, sponsored by Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.,
and John Tanner, D-Tenn. The margin was just enough to override a
veto, but Democratic leaders said a combination of absentees and
members promising to switch would give them the 10 more votes
necessary to sustain a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic opponents said their alternative would better help
family farms and small businesses by raising exemptions and cutting
all rates by 20 percent in 2001. At a cost of $22 billion over 10
years, they argued their measure would leave more of the projected
future budget surplus for spending priority programs, paying down
public debt and ensuring Social Security and Medicare don't go
broke as baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also pointed to Internal Revenue Service figures
showing that almost half the inheritance tax revenue comes from
estates over $5 million and contended that many of these wealthy
people could escape taxes entirely through shelters that protect
their incomes while alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take care of the problem, but we don't take care of the
multibillion dollar estate,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York,
senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected the Democratic alternative on a 222-196 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other tax bills moving in the House this year,
estate tax repeal was part of the $792 billion tax cut vetoed last
year by Clinton. Republicans have carved up that bill and are
pushing its individual pieces to the floor, forcing some Democrats
to take uncomfortable votes as both parties vie for control of the
House in the November elections.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Veto on Bankruptcy Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, who supports rewriting the
bankruptcy laws in principle, is threatening to veto pending
legislation he contends is unfair to ordinary debtors.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to congressional leaders Friday, Clinton said he
especially objected to provisions that would limit the amount of
money some bankrupt consumers could keep in their retirement
accounts and allow debt collectors to charge people high fees if
they failed to make good on bounced checks within a month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ... must ensure that a reasonable fresh start is available
for those who turn to bankruptcy as a last resort when facing
divorce, unemployment, illness and uninsured medical expenses,''
the president wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, he recognized the need to reduce
abuses of the bankruptcy court system by a few debtors, including
some wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, a chief sponsor of the bipartisan
legislation, criticized Clinton's letter, calling it ''an 11th-hour
message'' that undercuts Democratic lawmakers who have been
negotiating with members of the GOP majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Together we have achieved a balanced bill that strengthens the
safety net for those who need a fresh start and closes the
loopholes that let big spenders walk away from debts they could
repay,'' Grassley said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have been working for weeks behind closed doors to try
to reconcile differing House and Senate bills, both passed by
veto-proof margins, that would make it harder for people to sweep
away their debts in bankruptcy proceedings. The bills would apply
new standards for determining whether people filing for bankruptcy
should be forced to repay their debts under a court-approved
reorganization plan instead of having them dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, pushed by banks, credit card companies and
other consumer-credit businesses, has raised protests recently from
consumer advocates, unions, women's groups and religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the House-passed bill ''so one-sided'' toward
creditors that he would veto it. He said the Senate version is more
balanced in its treatment of people who owe money and companies
seeking to collect debts, but he still had serious concerns about
some provisions.
</P>
<P>
   One he cited would limit to $1 million the amount of money that
some insolvent consumers could keep in their retirement accounts.
Grassley has said he was seeking to prevent wealthy debtors who
file for bankruptcy protection from shifting their assets into
protected retirement accounts to escape repaying debts.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the provision would encourage credit card
companies and other businesses to put into fine print waivers
requiring consumers to forfeit pensions and other retirement assets
in the event of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The debt-collection provision would exempt collectors from
current law prohibiting harassment of debtors if the bounced checks
in question have been outstanding for 30 days or more. Creditors
would be allowed to use tactics such as late-night telephone calls
to debtors and repeated dunning over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he also was concerned that the legislation doesn't
adequately crack down on wealthy debtors who use homestead
exemptions in some states to shield their assets from creditors in
bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he was disturbed by the absence in the House bill of
a Senate provision that would prohibit people found to have
violated laws protecting abortion clinics from using bankruptcy
proceedings to escape fines and civil judgments.

<HEADLINE> Gore's Lead Shrinking in Tenn.  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Presidential candidates can usually
count on the support of their home states, but it may not be that
easy for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Although the former U.S. representative and senator has never
lost an election in Tennessee, his victory margins have been
dwindling -- to less than 2 percentage points in 1996 as President
Clinton's vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrat Gore's battle for the presidency against his
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is being fought just
as hard in Tennessee as in many other states.
</P>
<P>
   One main reason: Tennessee voters have grown progressively more
conservative, along with folks in most of the South. Republicans
have the governor's office, both Senate seats and control of the
House delegation.
</P>
<P>
   And many Tennesseans simply don't see Gore as one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not anymore,'' said Linda Smith, manager of a convenience
store in Franklin, about 30 miles south of Nashville. ''He doesn't
live here anymore. He doesn't represent Tennessee interests
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Danny Lancaster, a bellman at the Sheraton
Music City Hotel in Nashville, said, ''Any politician on the
national level has to be in Washington, but his heart is in
Tennessee. I don't think Bush can hold a candle to Gore in his home
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore was born in Washington and lived there most of his
childhood, he spent summers at his parents' farm in Carthage, about
50 miles east of Nashville. After serving in Vietnam, he lived,
worked and studied in Nashville for several years until 1976, when
he won the congressional seat his father had once held. Gore spent
eight years in the House and another eight in the Senate before
joining Clinton in a successful run for the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His visits to Tennessee have become less frequent, although he
does try to spend time with his mother, Pauline, who still lives on
her Carthage farm.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he has been back to Nashville several times since moving
his campaign headquarters here last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he hangs his hat, many Tennesseans don't like the way
Gore has changed his opinions over the years on issues important to
them -- including gun control and abortion, but particularly
tobacco, which is one of the state's top crops.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now he's against it. But he wasn't when he was making money
from it, when he had sharecroppers growing it on his land,'' Smith
said. ''He says one thing and does another. You can't have it both
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he win Tennessee in November? Many believe he will, but at
a cost of more money and time than 11 electoral votes might
normally warrant.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''He obviously wants to do well in Tennessee and throughout the
South,'' spokesman Doug Hattaway said. ''Al Gore will not take
anyone's votes for granted, certainly not folks in Tennessee. He
has worked very hard to represent Tennessee values in Washington,
while his roots have remained here. ''
</P>
<P>
   No recent polls on the Gore-Bush matchup in Tennessee have been
released, but one by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research Inc. a few days
after the March primaries gave Gore only a 47 percent to 41 percent
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mason-Dixon president Brad Coker said that without Gore on the
ticket, Tennessee would ''probably be in the Republican columns
pretty securely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my sense that Gore will win Tennessee, but it will be
close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, doesn't have to worry about losing
Texas to Gore. According to a May poll by the American Research
Group, Bush had a 70 percent-23 percent lead over his Democratic
foe
</P>
<P>
   Gore had planned to attend the Texas Democratic Party's
convention this weekend, but decided to go to states he actually
had a chance to win: California and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped message to delegates, the vice president
apologized for not being there, but he wished the struggling state
party well. ''If we keep fighting hard in this year's election we
can win some Texas-sized victories all across this country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush certainly isn't conceding Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped in the GOP stronghold of East Tennessee on Thursday,
and to the cheers of some 600 people outside the Knoxville Civic
Coliseum, he predicted he would carry the state in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''Make no mistake about it,'' Bush told the crowd, ''you are
going to see me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked about Bush staking a claim in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he enjoys himself,'' he replied. ''I've made half a
dozen visits to his home state.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Hopes Tour Will Attract Voters  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Talking about the national economic prosperity he
hopes will propel him into the White House, Vice President Al Gore
told the nation's mayors: ''All of us stand on the shoulders of
those who came before us.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he prepared to launch a ''prosperity tour'' next week
that is meant to win his presidential campaign a fresh look from
voters, Gore spoke nothing of the one who came before him or the
shoulders on which he stands -- President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In six speeches during an exhaustive 17-hour campaign swing in
Washington state on Friday, Gore previewed themes for his two-week
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've heard about the vicious circle -- where things start
going wrong and everything else starts going wrong? Well, now we're
in what they call a virtuous circle. Things are going right,
leading to other things going right. We want to keep that going,''
Gore told the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He made just one passing mention of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has asked Clinton's former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
to join the ''prosperity tour,'' which begins Tuesday in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign hopes the swing through battleground states will
prompt voters to give him some credit for the longest economic
expansion in American history -- and cast him as the only choice for
keeping it going.
</P>
<P>
   Gore warned the mayors that bad decisions about how to handle
budget surpluses are just as dangerous as bad decisions about
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could kill the golden goose. We could end up damaging our
prosperity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing Gore to the bipartisan assembly, Denver Mayor
Wellington Webb, a Democrat, said Gore -- not Republican rival
George W. Bush -- was the better pick for America's cities because
the vice president has worked so closely with the mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Webb joked that Clinton and Gore have had the mayors at the
White House so many times that they no longer swipe napkins from
the mess or other souvenirs with the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll say, it's not so funny around the White House,'' Gore
countered.

<HEADLINE> EPA fines Kodak for faulty record-keeping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The federal Environmental Protection
Agency has fined Eastman Kodak Co. $51,491 for violations in its
chemical reporting from 1995 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA discovered discrepancies in the Toxic Release Inventory
records during a 1998 inspection of Kodak Park. The penalty comes
three months after the EPA lodged a complaint with the
multi-billion-dollar photo company.
</P>
<P>
   Among the EPA charges that Kodak underreported the amount of
nitrate compounds it discharged into the Genesee River in 1995 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak spokesman James Blamphin said the errors consisted of bad
calculations or misunderstandings of reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are record-keeping errors and they shouldn't have
occurred,'' said Blamphin.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the misinterpretation of reporting requirements
for nitrate compounds meant the company initially didn't report the
discharge of about 300,000 pounds of nitrates into the Genesee,
according to Blamphin.
</P>
<P>
   But later when the company discovered its own error, it was
reported to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak submits 60 toxic release reports a year to the EPA, each
one on a different toxic chemical the company makes, uses or
disposes.
</P>
<P>
   The high number of reports required, and their complexity,
probably led to the reporting errors, said EPA regional spokeswoman
Nina Habib Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not expect to see these errors repeated,'' said Spencer,
who characterized Kodak's reporting missteps as ''oversights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kodak-watcher Judy Robinson, Buffalo-based regional director
of the Citizens' Environmental Coalition, called the incident
''very disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judy Robinson, Buffalo-based regional director of the
Citizens' Environmental Coalition, called the incident disturbing.
She said it casts doubt on the quality of information in the Toxic
Release Inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the only tool citizens have to understand what
facilities are putting into the environment,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The inventory, established by the 1984 federal Emergency
Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and in effect since 1987,
requires industries to report chemical releases to the air, land
and water.

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Fly To Solomons  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Diplomats from Australia and New
Zealand flew to the troubled Solomon Islands today, hoping to help
resolve the political crisis there and seek peace between warring
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A delegation led by Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
and New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff landed this morning in
Honiara, the capital. The officials met with Solomon Islands Prime
Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu and planned to hold talks with the
rebels later, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit comes after five days of heightened unrest in this
South Pacific nation that has seen 18 months of fighting between
rival rebel groups from different islands.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, efforts to reach a 14-day truce between the Malaita
Eagle Force and the Isatabu Freedom Movement collapsed when the
better-armed Malaita group declined to sign on, New Zealand High
Commissioner Nick Hurley said. But the rebels agreed to a two-day
cease-fire so the ministers could come and go without any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Honiara appeared calm this afternoon. There was little activity
around one of the rebel bases near the airport, which is quite
close to the front line in the fighting. Elsewhere, people were out
shopping and golfing.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands are located 2,230 miles northwest of
Wellington, New Zealand and 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia. Tensions here erupted Monday when the Malaita rebels
seized Prime Minister Ulufa'alu, placed him under house arrest and
demanded he resign. They held him for several days before
reportedly freeing him late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The move escalated a low-level conflict that has been playing
out here for a year and a half: The Isatabu rebels are indigenous
to the nation's main island of Guadalcanal and are trying to push
migrants from Malaita island off Guadalcanal, while the Malaita
rebels are resisting. The prime minister is a Malaitan, but some
Malaitans accuse him of being a turncoat.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people have been killed or are missing in the
fighting, and more than 20,000 have been forced out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   After the prime minister's seizure, the Malaita rebels took
newly captured machine guns and a stolen police gunboat and began
attacking their rivals from the Isatabu Freedom Movement. Both
sides claim to have inflicted casualties, but none of the claims
have been confirmed and no fresh fighting was reported Friday or
early today.
</P>
<P>
   Downer and Goff, in a delegation with representatives from
Botswana and Malaysia, hope to encourage a peaceful end to the
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that we will be able to help them resolve their
problems and get the peace process, which was pretty shaky before
this latest blowup ... back on track,'' Downer said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Munda, on the island of New Georgia, about 200 miles
northwest of Honiara, some residents said early today they had
their doubts about any peace efforts from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   One mine company employee said the rebels are probably too
entrenched in their dispute to take any advice from the foreign
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they'll listen,'' Albert Jacob told a reporter.
''Things have gotten way out of hand.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Split Up Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 mostly foreign
hostages in a southern Philippine jungle have separated their
captives into two groups because of fears of a possible military
rescue attempt, negotiators said today.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels have moved all 10 Caucasian hostages to a
new location, said Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a Libyan envoy who is
serving as a government negotiator. But the 11 captives from
Malaysia and the Philippines are still at the previous jungle camp,
where the government recently built a wooden shed for the hostages'
protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are holding talks with the rebels in an attempt to
win freedom for the hostages, who have been held for almost seven
weeks. This week, chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado
said the government would not rule out the option of a military
rescue if talks failed.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf criticized those comments in a communique
obtained today by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly condemn him for such irresponsible statements,''
the Abu Sayyaf said. The group warned that the lives of the
hostages ''will be exposed to extreme risks'' if any rescue
operation is launched.
</P>
<P>
   The developments appeared to be a setback to hopes for the
hostages' release. Nevertheless, Azzarouq and another government
negotiator, Farouk Hussein, headed back today to a village mosque
guarded heavily by hundreds of Abu Sayyaf rebels for more talks
with guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In several hours of talks Friday, the guerrillas refused to give
up their demand for an independent Islamic nation in the southern
Philippines, the negotiators said. The government has repeatedly
ruled out any breakup of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they cannot compromise on their position, probably we
cannot proceed,'' Hussein said of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is one of two main rebel groups fighting for an
independent Muslim nation here. The rebels seized the hostages --
three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a
Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- on April 23 from a
Malaysian diving resort and brought them to Jolo, an island at the
tip of the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting had been intended only as a preparatory session
for a second round of formal negotiations, but instead it focused
at length on all of the rebels' demands, the two negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides have held only one formal negotiating session, on
May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace has been bitterly criticized by the hostages,
whose psychological state has deteriorated in recent weeks as
prospects for their speedy release have dimmed. Several of the
hostages have threatened suicide, and a government doctor urged
Thursday that one, Stephane Loisy of France, be hospitalized for
psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada has ordered the negotiators to make
substantial progress by Monday, the Philippine independence day.
</P>
<P>
   A separate group of Abu Sayyaf rebels has been holding eight
Filipino hostages -- two teachers and six children -- on nearby
Basilan island. Rebel spokesman Abu Ahmad said Friday that those
rebels have slipped through a military dragnet and escaped to Jolo
with six of the hostages. It was not clear what happened to the
other two.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Olmedo Saenz hit a tiebreaking two-run homer
in the eighth inning Friday night, and the Oakland Athletics beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-1 for their sixth victory in seven
interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi drew a two-out walk off Antonio Osuna (0-3) before
Saenz lined his fifth homer into the left-field pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Tam (1-2) bailed Tim Hudson out of a seventh-inning jam and
went on to pitch 1 2-3 scoreless innings, allowing one hit and
striking out four. Jason Isringhausen pitched a perfect ninth for
his 15th save in 18 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The A's, held to one hit through 5 2-3 innings by Carlos Perez,
tied it in the sixth when Giambi walked with two outs, Saenz
singled and Ben Grieve doubled into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek's first-inning homer had given the Dodgers a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Perez held Oakland hitless until Miguel Tejada doubled sharply
into the left-field corner with two outs in the fifth. Before that,
Oakland's only runners had been Saenz -- who reached in both the
second and fourth innings on errors by third baseman Kevin Elster --
and Rudy Christensen, who walked leading off the game, then was
throw out attempting to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   In his sharpest outing of the season, Perez allowed one run
three hits in seven innings, lowering his ERA to 4.71.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson struck out eight in 6 1-3 innings, giving up one run,
four hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Dodgers have signed 11 of their draft selections, the
highest among them 7th-round pick C Jared Price. Others include Ps
Shane Nance, Jonathan Lorenzen, Jason Olson, Casey Kennedy, Steve
Langone and Clifton Glidewell; OFs Ronte Langs and Nicholas
Alvarez; and INFs Adrian Mendoza and Zachary Leske. ... The
Dodgers' Orel Hershiser went four-plus innings Friday night in the
latest start of his self-imposed exile to Single-A San Bernardino,
allowing three runs and six hits against Mudville. Hershiser, who
made 76 pitches, is on standby if Perez is yanked from the
rotation. ... Grieve had been 2-for-23 in interleague play until
his game-tying double. ... Matt Stairs was 0-for-3 off Perez and is
6-for-55 against left-handers this season, the worst mark in the AL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jeff Bagwell hit a two-run homer off Trevor
Hoffman in the ninth inning as the Houston Astros wasted a four-run
lead, then beat the San Diego Padres 7-6 Friday night to stop a
10-game road losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman (0-2) hung an 0-2 pitch that Bagwell drove over the
fence in left-center field for his 15th homer, then second time in
eight appearance Hoffman allowed a game-winning home run. Rookie
Julio Lugo was aboard on his third hit, an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner (2-3) had his seventh blown save in 12 chances but
got the win. He walked the bases loaded in the ninth, then gave up
a one-out RBI single to Tony Gwynn before striking out Phil Nevin
and retiring Ryan Klesko on a game-ending foulout to third. Klesko
had three doubles in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who trailed 4-0 and 5-3, tied the game at 5 with two
runs in the eighth, but ended up losing their fifth straight and
for the sixth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo went 3-for-4, drove in three runs, scored once and stole
two bases. Lugo, who made his major league debut as a pinch-runner
on April 15 at San Diego, hit a two-run single in the second inning
and a sacrifice fly in the fourth. In the sixth, he singled, stole
second and third and scored on Carlos Almanzar's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Up with the Astros for the second time this season, Lugo was
making just his sixth start at shortstop, where he made a diving
catch of Gwynn's liner in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres trailed 5-3 going into the eighth. Al Martin, who
finished 3-for-4 with a homer, doubled off Jay Powell and took
third on Gwynn's groundout. Nevin hit a chopper that third baseman
Ken Caminiti couldn't get a handle on, allowing Martin to score and
Nevin to reach on an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner came on and Klesko doubled into the gap in left-center
field to score Nevin from first. Klesko took third on Bret Boone's
fly out but the rally ended when Carlos Hernandez flied out to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou had his 1,000th career hit, a double into the left
field corner in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Octavio Dotel got a no-decision despite being
given a 4-0 lead. He allowed three runs and six hits in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took a 4-0 lead after four innings against Stan Spencer
(2-2). Lugo's two-out, two-run single highlighted the three-run
second inning, and he hit his sacrifice fly in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Martin homered leading off the fourth as the Padres began to
close the gap. Gwynn hit an RBI single in the sixth and scored on
Klesko's two-out double into the left-center field gap. Alou's
throw was way off the mark and almost went into the Padres' dugout,
allowing Klesko to take third.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer allowed four runs and seven hits in five innings, walked
five and struck out none.
</P>
<P>
Notes: RHP Carlos Reyes began his third stint with the Padres when
his contract was purchased from Triple-A Las Vegas. To make room on
the 40-man roster, the Padres transferred LHP Sterling Hitchcock
from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day DL. To make room on the
25-man roster, right-hander Domingo Guzman was optioned to Las
Vegas. ... Until this season, the Astros had won the season series
against the Expos every year since 1992. The Padres clinched the
2000 season series by sweeping the Astros in Houston in April. ...
Astros RHP Scott Elarton, scheduled to start Saturday night, has no
decisions and a 5.27 ERA in four career appearances against San
Diego. He will make his second start against San Diego this season
and the third in his career.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 3, Rangers 2, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Terry Shumpert hit a two-run single off John
Wetteland in the 12th inning to give the Colorado Rockies a 3-2
victory over the Texas Rangers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez had given the Rangers a 2-1 lead in the top of
the inning with a run-scoring single, but Wetteland (3-2) couldn't
get an out and blew his first save in his last 15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Tavarez (4-2) pitched two innings in relief as Colorado's
bullpen improved to 18-5 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo started the game-winning rally with a leadoff walk,
and Todd Helton followed with a single to left. Cirillo moved to
third and Helton went to second when Rusty Greer bobbled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland intentionally walked Jeffrey Hammonds to load the
bases, but Shumpert foiled the strategy when he hit an 0-1 pitch
into left-center field, scoring Cirillo and Helton without a play
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who have won 14 of 16 at home, missed an
opportunity in the eighth when Mike Lansing could not get Tom
Goodwin home from third with one out and Larry Walker grounded out
sharply to third.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, activated from the disabled list before the game, went
0-for-5 in his first career start in left field. The six-time Gold
Glove right fielder had been sidelined with an elbow injury since
May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Kenny Rogers, who has pitched into the seventh in
all 12 starts this season, retired 14 straight hitters before
Cirillo doubled with one out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers escaped the threat by getting Helton to pop out and Scott
Servais to ground weakly to third. He gave up just one run and
three hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   While Rogers held the Rockies in check with mostly offspeed
pitches, Pedro Astacio kept Texas off-balance with a lively
fastball and sharp curve.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second pitcher's duel at Coors Field this season.
Pittsburgh's Francisco Cordova beat Masato Yoshii and the Rockies
2-1 on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, who is 6-0 in his last 11 starts, was never in much
trouble after the second. He gave up one run in seven innings,
while walking three and striking out 10.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 1-0 lead on Palmeiro's two-out homer, his 18th, in
the first, and Colorado tied the game on Servais' double in the
second.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Palmeiro's homer was the 379th of his career, moving him
into a tie with Orlando Cepeda and Tony Perez for 42nd on the
career list. ... OF Gabe Kapler returned from the 15-day DL and
went 2-for-5. ... Eight of Palmeiro's last 15 hits are homers. ...
Colorado plays 18 of its next 24 games at home. ... Astacio became
Colorado's career leader in innings pitched with 580. ... Texas SS
Royce Clayton ended an 0-for-17 slide with a single in the 11th.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Bryant Hurts Ankle  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A frightening sight for the Los Angeles
Lakers: Kobe Bryant on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, half the Lakers' super duo, sprained his left ankle in
the first quarter of Friday night's NBA Finals and did not return,
although Los Angeles still beat the Indiana Pacers 111-104 to take
a 2-0 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling and joking afterward, Bryant said he wasn't sure he
would be able to play by Sunday's Game 3 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good thing we have a cushion, having gone up 2-0, so
it's not a do-or-die thing if the doctors don't think I should play
Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bryant's absence, league MVP Shaquille O'Neal again led the
Lakers -- this time with 40 points and 24 rebounds. Glen Rice and
Ron Harper also helped fill the void by scoring 21 points each.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kobe going down in the first quarter put a real crimp in our
attack,'' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson, who noted that O'Neal
still was dominant again and that the other Lakers players also
stepped up.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also said that, when he heard Bryant was not
returning, he figured he might also be unable to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the Lakers' second-leading scorer and assists leader,
hurt his ankle when he made a 12-foot jumper and landed on the foot
of Indiana's Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' guard remained on the floor briefly, clutching his
ankle. He got to his feet and hopped on his right foot, the pain
obvious when he touched his left foot to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had sprained ankles before and I thought I was going to
get up and keep playing. But there was just pain, flat-out pain,''
said Bryant, who despite his injury came to the interview room --
relatively agile on his shiny new crutches -- smiled and said,
''Wassup?''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, still just 21, laughed and added, ''I played on sprained
ankles when I was younger, like when I was in high school. But
then, I just shot the ball every time. Here they want you to also
play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 22-20 at the time, then made another basket
before timeout was called and Bryant went to the locker room with
3:05 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   A two-time NBA All-Star, Bryant had two points and four assists
when he left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw and Derek Fisher shared the playing time at Bryant's
guard spot afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is averaging 22.3 points and a team-high 4.5 assists for
the Lakers during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He had missed the first 15 games of the season with a broken
right hand, suffered during an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, Bryant
sprained his right foot early in the Lakers' 96-88 loss to the
Trail Blazers in Game 5 at Staples Center as Portland trimmed Los
Angles' lead to 3-2 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant was questionable for Game 6 in Portland. But he played
the entire game and played extremely well, scoring 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Trail Blazers still beat L.A. 103-93 to force a
seventh game.
</P>
<P>
   In that dramatic showdown for the trip to the Finals, Bryant
scored 25 points, had 11 rebounds and seven assists and blocked
four shots. He also keyed a dramatic comeback as the Lakers rallied
from 15 down in the fourth quarter, putting them ahead to stay with
two free throws with 1:34 remaining in their 89-84 victory.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Sosa Wants To Stay in Chi.  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa's agent said he doesn't have a gut
feeling one way or the other whether the slugger will stay in
Chicago but said Sosa wants to remain in a Cubs uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Katz, Sosa's agent, met with Cubs president Andy MacPhail
on Thursday as part of ongoing talks about a possible contract
extension. Sosa is signed through 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''His preference is to stay,'' Katz said Friday before the Cubs
began their Crosstown Series with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're jumping ahead,'' he said when asked if Sosa would
approve a trade. ''The Cubs have to decide if they want to go that
direction. I'm not sure they've made that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa said he's going to concentrate on the game and let his
agent worry about his contract. But he made it clear he doesn't
want to leave the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never said I wanted to leave,'' he said. ''I'm still here. I
want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his contract doesn't expire for another 1{ years, Sosa is
looking for an extension that could pay him as much as $15
million-$20 million a year. If the Cubs decide they don't want to
spend that kind of money, they might look to trade Sosa and kick
start their rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
   As a player with 10 years in the majors and five with the same
team, Sosa has veto power over any trade. But if the Cubs make it
clear they feel a trade would be the best for the organization,
Katz said Sosa would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   All of this could be premature, though. Cubs general manager Ed
Lynch said the team isn't shopping Sosa or looking to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was asked yesterday, would I consider trading Sammy Sosa. I
said I would trade anybody if it helped make this organization a
better organization,'' Lynch said. ''I think any general manager
would tell you (that).
</P>
<P>
   ''The way our pitching's been over the last 2{ weeks, we feel
like we've got a chance to make some noise in the division,'' Lynch
said. ''We want to keep the team intact and see where we're going
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade rumors come on the heels of Sosa's much-publicized
spat earlier this week with Cubs manager Don Baylor. Sosa, unhappy
about what he perceived as negative comments about his playing by
Baylor, lashed out at the manager in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The two met after Wednesday's game and cleared the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''With both guys, yes, it's resolved,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   And Katz said this week's blowup has nothing to do with Sosa's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not some orchestrated or contrived thing,'' Katz said.
''Baylor is a terrific manager and Sammy knows that. They can get
along just fine.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 9, Mariners 2  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Kirk Rueter pitched 6 2-3 strong innings
for his first win in more than six weeks, and Ellis Burks and J.T.
Snow homered as the San Francisco Giants broke out of their
interleague slump by beating the Seattle Mariners 9-2 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The win was Dusty Baker's 586th, tying him with Roger Craig for
most victories by a San Francisco manager. Baker is 586-540.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter (3-4) gave up two runs and seven hits and even got his
first two hits of the season in stopping a personal three-game
skid. He continued his dominating pitching in interleague play,
improving to 8-1, including a seven-game winning streak against AL
teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rueter's first win since April 22, when he beat Arizona
8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis, who spent the previous four seasons in Seattle, Jeff
Kent and Snow each had three hits and drove in a run and Giants'
leadoff man Calvin Murray scored from first on Frankie Rodriguez's
errant pickoff throw in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama (6-2) lost his second straight since becoming the
third Mariner starter to open a season 6-0. He went just three
innings, his second-shortest outing of the year, and allowed five
runs and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle fell to 3-8 against the Giants, including a 1-5 mark in
San Francisco. The Mariners' runs came on Alex Rodriguez's first
inning homer and Rickey Henderson's RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants snapped a 1-1 tie with a four-run third inning that
was fueled in part by two Mariners error.
</P>
<P>
   Kent singled to open the inning and reached third when catcher
Dan Wilson's throw trying to catch him stealing bounced into center
field. Rich Aurilia's sacrifice fly scored Kent, and Doug Mirabelli
and Davis each added RBI singles with the last run coming home on
third baseman David Bell's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie Rodriguez started the fourth and one out later, Burks
connected for his sixth homer of the year. Snow had a two-out,
opposite field shot that reached the bleachers in left. Armando
Rios drove in another San Francisco run with a one-out single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bonds went 0-2 to snap a season-high nine-game hitting
streak. ... The Giants have won 15 of their last 19 home games. ...
Rueter has not lost an interleague contest since July 2, 1997,
against Oakland. ... Seattle fell to 4-3 in interleague play this
season. ... The Mariners have 85 home runs in interleague play,
more than any other major league team.. ... Seattle, which was
making its debut at Pacific Bell Park, fell to 7-22 overall in its
first games in a stadium.

<HEADLINE> Court Reverses Makah Whaling Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Makah whaling canoes are likely to be beached for
only a few months by an appeals court ruling that ordered another
environmental review of the tribe's gray whale hunts, a tribal
lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, anti-whaling activists said they were elated by the
ruling Friday from a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, which they hope will lead to a permanent halt of
the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The case now goes back to federal court in Tacoma for additional
proceedings, including the new environmental study by the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to recognize that this is really a
temporary setback for the tribe. The court in no way questioned the
fact that the Makah have a treaty right to take whales,'' said John
Arum, Seattle-based attorney for the tribe, whose reservation lies
at the extreme northwestern tip of Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Arum said the tribe may ask the full 9th Circuit to review the
panel's 2-1 ruling. But even if it does not, he expected any new
environmental study will find the Makah hunt would not hurt whale
populations, likely clearing the way for the tribe's fall hunt to
begin as scheduled in November.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the San Francisco appellate judges said the
government's environmental assessment was biased in favor of
approving Makah whaling, because the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration had earlier signed an accord with the
Makah promising to support their efforts to resume whaling.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Gorman, a Seattle spokesman for the National Marine
Fisheries Service, which is a co-defendant in the case, said the
government had not decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But if the agency does do another environmental assessment, it
would make ''extremely sure that we are extremely careful and
forthright,'' Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah had hunted whales for generations until the 1920s,
when commercial whaling decimated the whale population. But the
tribe moved to resume the hunt after gray whales were removed from
the Endangered Species List in 1994 and received approval, with the
backing of the federal government, from the International Whaling
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members killed their first and only gray whale in May
1999, after U.S. District Judge Franklin Burgess in Tacoma rejected
a challenge by environmentalists and Rep. Jack Metcalf, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt that we were right all the time,'' Metcalf said Friday,
adding that he expected the tribe or government to appeal the
panel's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Makah whalers this spring have come close enough to hurl a
harpoon at whales, but they have made no kills. The tribe will not
hunt whales again until cleared by the courts, Keith Johnson, head
of the Makah Tribal Whaling Commission, told KIRO-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-whaling activists will remain ''on standby'' at Neah Bay,
the launch site for tribal canoes, at least through the end of
June, said Jonathan Paul, president of Williams, Ore.-based Ocean
Defense International, which has attempted to disrupt several Makah
hunts.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Defense activist Erin Abbott, 23, who buzzed a Makah canoe
with a personal watercraft and was in turn run over by a Coast
Guard inflatable boat April 20, pleaded guilty Friday in U.S.
District Court in Tacoma to negligent operation of a vessel. She
faces a maximum year behind bars and a $100,000 fine when she is
sentenced Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was hospitalized with shoulder and other injuries in the
boat incident.

N.M. Park Superintendent To Retire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Roy Weaver, the park superintendent who approved a
prescribed burn that blew out of control and rolled through Los Alamos last
month, said Friday he will retire in July. Weaver, superintendent of Bandelier
National Monument for nearly 10 years, said he believed conditions had been just
right for the park's annual regimen of burning brush May 4 to stave off a
potentially disastrous fire. But after the burn was started, it became the
largest wildfire in state history, destroying more than 200 homes in Los Alamos
and forcing 25,000 people to evacuate.

Philippine Rebels Split Up Hostages

   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 mostly foreign hostages in
a southern Philippine jungle have separated their captives into two groups
because of fears of a possible military rescue attempt, negotiators said today.
The Abu Sayyaf rebels have moved all 10 Caucasian hostages to a new location,
said Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a Libyan envoy who is serving as a government
negotiator. But the 11 captives from Malaysia and the Philippines are still at
the previous jungle camp, where the government recently built a wooden shed for
the hostages' protection, he said.

Alaska Airlines Submits Plans

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines on Friday filed its response to the Federal
Aviation Administration's concerns over the company's maintenance practices. A
recent audit and inspection by the FAA turned up more than 150 cases of missing
or incomplete maintenance records, the agency announced last week. The
inspection was launched after the Jan. 31 crash of an Alaska Airlines jet off
the California coast. Although further investigation found that the maintenance
in question had been adequately performed, the FAA is considering stripping
Alaska of the right to perform heavy maintenance -- work that requires an
aircraft be removed from service while major components are repaired or
replaced.

   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean officials reached an
agreement Friday to immediately resume the search for more than 8,000 U.S.
soldiers missing in action from the Korean War. The first search mission is
scheduled for June 25, the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War.
The agreement to conduct five joint operations between June and November was
reached after three days of talks between the U.S. Defense Department and the
North Korean People's Liberation Army. As a result of previous negotiations,
U.S. teams have conducted 12 recovery operations inside North Korea since 1996

Jalen Rose scored 30 to lead Indiana, Austin Croshere added 24 and Reggie Miller

<HEADLINE> Women as War Targets Addressed  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Even though few women engage in combat,
many are targeted in war: They are raped, abducted, forced to
become pregnant and used as slaves to cook and clean for fighters
across the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The woman's body has become the battlefield,'' said Sanam
Anderlini of the British-based group International Alert, which
tries to focus world attention on the effects of war.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of a U.N. conference to accelerate progress
toward women's equality, activists denounced the lack of concrete
action to help innocent women caught in armed conflicts -- even
though a landmark gathering in Beijing five years ago identified
women in conflicts as one of the main areas of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Smythe, former minister of gender and women's affairs in
Sierra Leone, said Friday that women in the west African country
wracked by civil war are often ''abducted as sex slaves, or as
cooks or carriers of luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   During eight years of fighting, rebel forces led by Foday Sankoh
have killed tens of thousands of civilians and systematically
maimed many more, including women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels attack women ''to fragment the community,'' said Isha
Diafan of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Although recent research shows that some women have actively
supported violent organizations and uprisings, women and children
make up 80 percent of refugees and displaced people.
</P>
<P>
   With ethnic, religious and tribal identities playing a key role
in many of today's conflicts, activists say women have become
strategic targets.
</P>
<P>
   ''You rape them, you force them into pregnancy, you totally
dishonor them ... you are breaking up the fabric of a family, so
you are going right to the heart and soul of a community,''
Anderlini said, citing the use of rape in the Bosnian war and in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Gender-based violence also is used to terrorize the general
population, grass-roots groups said.
</P>
<P>
   Bhutanese women who fled to Nepal said they were raped in Bhutan
in front of their families ''to create fear'' and force the
population to flee, said Anjana Shakya, a member of the South Asia
Beijing Plus Five Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 people of Nepalese origin were evicted or
encouraged to emigrate from Bhutan in the early 1990s when the
kingdom's ethnic Drukpas cracked down on what they called illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Women also are at the mercy of whichever side takes over their
territory, as is the case in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the strict Islamic rule of the Taliban militia that
controls 90 percent of the country, women are not allowed to work,
girls older than 8 may not attend school and women in public must
wear a burqa, or a head-to-toe shroud that covers their body. State
officials roam the streets looking for women violating the edicts
and they are publicly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-based Feminist Majority Foundation urged world leaders
-- in particular U.S. and U.N. officials -- to put more pressure on
the Taliban and nations supporting them to abolish the restrictions
imposed on women. The foundation also called on the United States
and other countries to increase their asylum quotas for women from
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Salvadoran War Victim Returns Home  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Fifteen years after she was
separated from her family during El Salvador's civil war, Maria
Esperanza de Jesus Casco Lopez -- now known as Sara Rabanne -- has
returned to be reunited with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Rabanne, now a 20-year-old French citizen, was tracked down in
February by a humanitarian group that searches for children who
disappeared during the civil war. She said she was surprised to
find out her biological mother was alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have much to gain from seeing her,'' she told The Associated
Press after arriving in El Salvador this week. ''I want to be with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, pro-government paramilitaries arrived at her family's
small house and killed her father and oldest brother. The rest of
the family fled, joining the rebel Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, or FMLN.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother, Albertina Lopez Arevalo, became a cook for
the rebels, often fleeing helicopter and plane attacks. In 1985,
she sent her young daughter to a church so that she would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   But because of an error when she arrived in Zaragoza village, 12
miles south of San Salvador, the girl was registered as an orphan
and named Sara. Her papers said her parents were killed in one of
the civil war's many massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Arino, a French architect who arrived with the group
Doctors of the World to help build houses, became attached to Sara
and brought her back to France, where she was adopted by a family.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this February, her biological mother brought the case to a
humanitarian group, and the group tracked Rabanne down in France.
</P>
<P>
   She was reunited with her mother Friday in rural Suchitoto, 27
miles north of the capital, in the province of Cuscatlan, where she
spent the first five years of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am content,'' she said. ''I am very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 75,000 people were killed during El Salvador's civil
war. Peace accords signed in 1992 ended the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Association to Support the Search for Children,
the group that helped Lopez, most children disappeared between 1980
and 1984, when soldiers captured them during military operations
and passed them along for adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the association has found 90 children out of 557
cases it has investigated.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Park Superintendent To Retire  </HEADLINE>
By CHAKA FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The national park superintendent who
approved a brush-clearing fire that raged out of control and
scorched 47,000 acres to become the worst wildfire in state history
is retiring because of the controversy over his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Weaver said he will retire on July 2 after 33 years with the
National Park Service, the last 10 as superintendent at Bandelier
National Monument.
</P>
<P>
   ''You wouldn't want to end it this way, that's for sure,''
Weaver said Friday in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press from his home in White Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver had planned to retire next April and move back to his
hometown in Grand Junction, Colo. But the fire changed that
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have had a successful career overall,'' Weaver said. ''I
have the respect from my co-workers and my staff. That's important
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver had said he believed conditions were right last month for
the park to begin its annual regimen of prescribed burning --
designed to burn off underbrush to keep the park's backcountry from
becoming a tinder box.
</P>
<P>
   The prescribed burn was started May 4. Fueled by low humidity
and high winds, it quickly raged out of control. By May 10, the
blaze spread into Los Alamos, forcing the evacuation of more than
20,000 people from the town where the atomic bomb was built.
Residents in neighboring White Rock also were forced to leave as
more than 200 homes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver was placed on paid administrative leave in mid-May, and a
government report blamed Park Service officials for poor planning
and several mistakes in carrying out the prescribed fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would approve a prescribed burn again,'' he said. ''If I
knew this would happen, I wouldn't. But we made the best decision
we could with the information we had at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Weaver's comments Friday were his first publicly since the leave
was imposed. He said he could not discuss the fire because of the
ongoing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess heartsick would be the best adjective,'' to describe
how he felt after the fire, Weaver said. ''I was just feeling for
those people, what they must be going through. I was worried about
their property and keepsakes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said some of his friends lost their homes in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bless their hearts, they are still friends,'' he said. ''And
when someone who lost their home says, 'Don't beat up yourself,'
that really says something about the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Weaver and his wife received some abusive messages,
''we've received close to 200 letters, cards and e-mail messages of
encouragement and support from all over,'' he said. ''A big portion
came from Los Alamos, including folks that lost their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, the damage total to the storied Los Alamos
National Laboratory could reach $300 million, said Jim Holt, the
lab's program director.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, six postdoctoral employees lost valuable
information stored in computers that were in mobile buildings at
the edge of the lab. The lost research was part of a three-year
fellowship for the workers that determines their career paths.
</P>
<P>
   The lab is trying to extend the fellowships to allow the
employees to complete their work, Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 8,000 acres of the lab property were burned.
Officials said 39 temporary structures, including trailer and small
storage units, were destroyed but no major structures were
significantly damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an underground dump used in the early days of the lab
remains ablaze, though it's unclear how deep the fire is burning,
said Lee McAtee, the lab's deputy director for environmental and
health safety. There is no apparent public health threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Frost, a park service spokesman, said it would be up to the
agency's board of inquiry to decide if any disciplinary action
would be taken against Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said he has spent the last month preparing to appear
before the board.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, he said he wasn't sure what retirement might
hold for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea, I haven't thought that far yet,'' he said.
''It happened all of a sudden.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Miller Doesn't Produce  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Reggie Miller started strongly, determined to
shoot his way out of a horrific 1-for-16 performance two nights
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He hit three of his first four shots, helping the Indiana Pacers
to a quick five-point lead against the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Pacers needed him most in the fourth quarter of a
close game, Miller again failed to produce any heroics. The Pacers
lost 111-104 Friday night and trail 2-0 in the best-of-seven NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 21 points on 7-of-16 shooting, far fewer shots
than he said he wanted to take after Indiana lost Game 1. Miller
had a playoff career-low seven points Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a golden opportunity that slipped through our
fingers,'' Miller said. ''I thought I had a couple of good looks, a
couple of open 3s.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who's made a career of thriving under the pressure of
games decided in the final quarter, scored just two points on free
throws in the fourth, when the offense went through Austin
Croshere.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere came up with his second solid game of the series,
scoring 24 points and hitting all 12 of his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to have some punch coming off the bench. He gives
the opposing team some type of problems because he can take them
out on the floor,'' Miller said. ''When he gets it going like that,
it's a big plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, Croshere and Jalen Rose, who had 30 points, played all
12 minutes of a fourth quarter that dragged on for 56 minutes,
mostly because the Pacers repeatedly fouled Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal responded with 40 points -- including 18-of-39 free
throws, an NBA record for attempts in a game -- and 24 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did a good job double-teaming, but he still was just
getting the ball so close to the basket on the post entry, and he
just looked like a man among boys,'' Croshere said.
</P>
<P>
   After Kobe Bryant sprained his left ankle landing on Rose's foot
and had to leave nine minutes into the game, the Pacers focused on
O'Neal. But the 7-foot-1 center required so much attention, Ron
Harper and Glen Rice burned the Pacers for 21 points each.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's when you get hurt by the other guys,'' coach Larry Bird
said. ''When Kobe was out, Glen Rice was going to try to score more
and he got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal went mostly unchallenged in the post against Dale Davis
and Sam Perkins after Rik Smits picked up his fifth foul with 7:09
remaining in the third. Smits didn't return until the final minute
and finished with four points in 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping the double-team would keep the ball out of his
hands, but he was still able to get some shots off,'' Smits said of
O'Neal. ''Once he would go up for a shot, everybody was down too
low and we'd foul him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers hurt themselves with 37.5 percent field-goal
shooting, then were forced to go to the Hack-a-Shaq strategy that
Bird said he wanted to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a game's that tight and you get down four or five, I
think it's the best opportunity to get the ball back,'' Bird said.
''He was struggling early. The more you put him at the line, the
better he gets.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 12, Yankees 2  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - By the time Roger Clemens walked off the mound,
almost every Yankees fan in the ballpark was booing except Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza once again derailed the Rocket, hitting a grand slam
Friday night that sent the New York Mets over the New York Yankees
12-2 in the opener of this year's Subway Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always enjoyed the tradition of Yankee Stadium,'' Piazza
said. ''Just getting your name read over the public-address system
gives you a shot of adrenaline.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's slam silenced the Yankees rooters in the sellout crowd
of 55,822. But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (4-6) was tagged for nine runs - matching the most he's
allowed in 492 career starts - and was jeered after Edgardo
Alfonzo's two-run homer made it 9-2 with no outs in the sixth
inning. That was Clemens' final pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boos, I was as hacked off as anybody else was,'' Clemens
said. ''I felt I had better stuff than the final score says it was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was trying to keep the ball in the yard, gave up too many
homers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, wearing a Yankees cap, stood and applauded from next
to his favorite team's dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was ashamed that any Yankee fan would boo him. He's pitched
some great games for us,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't my happiest night here tonight, but I'll be back
Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, who began the night in a 3-for-53 slump, hit a
homer, double and single and drove in five runs. The Mets closed
their deficit to 7-6 against the Yankees in four seasons of
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Al Leiter (7-1) beat Clemens for the third time in two years.
And in all three games, Piazza provided a big home run - this time,
launching a long drive to dead center field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been fortunate to have some success in this series,''
Piazza said. ''These games are exciting and electric.''
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd standing and chanting, cheering and booing,
Piazza slowly strode to the plate with the bases loaded and no outs
in the third inning of a scoreless game.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-0 pitch, he unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza stood to watch the ball sail for his 11th career slam and
second this year, while Clemens kicked at the rubber. It was only
the second slam Clemens had ever given up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very frightening guy to have on the other side,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ''Not too many guys can hit a ball
to center field and flip the bat knowing it's a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Piazza's third home run in 11 career at-bats against
Clemens. The first homer came last June and helped reverse the
fortunes of both the Mets and Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets ended an eight-game losing streak that night, a day
after firing three coaches, and reached the .500 mark on their way
toward making the NL playoffs. Clemens, meanwhile, had his
AL-record 20-game winning streak stopped and has been a sub-.500
pitcher since.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, originally selected by the Mets in the June 1981
amateur draft, fell to 1-4 with a 9.10 ERA against them. He also
started against them twice for Boston in the 1986 World Series, and
did not get a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has allowed nine runs on five occasions, mostly recently
on May 18, 1998, for Toronto against Seattle. The Mets tagged him
for eight earned runs and 10 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, the only Mets player who also spent time with the
Yankees, allowed two runs in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jason Tyner led off the game with a double and later
singled, scored twice and made a diving catch in left field.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stepped in the box and looked up and it was like, 'Geez,
that's Roger Clemens,''' said Tyner, who grew up in Texas, where
the Rocket is revered. ''My first week in the big leagues and I'm
facing Roger Clemens at Yankee Stadium.''

<HEADLINE> Prison guard accused of beating inmate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A 41-year-old state prison guard has been
charged with beating an inmate, setting-up an inmate-on-inmate
confrontation and planting a knife in a maximum security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carroll, a correction officer at Coxsackie Correctional
Facility, was suspended from duty on May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has not yet been arrested and has appealed the proposed
discipline - dismissal and loss of accrued leave.
</P>
<P>
   According to a notice of discipline sent to Carroll by the state
Department of Correctional Services, alleged crimes include
illegally giving an Albany FBI special agent a document taken from
a prisoner's cell.
</P>
<P>
   The notice also says Carroll failed to stop Sam Hall from
attempting to assault Justin Eldred during a lunchtime encounter on
July 24.
</P>
<P>
   The corrections department alleges that on the day of the
encounter between Eldred and Hall, Carroll struck Eldred
unnecessarily. Using his baton, he allegedly hit Eldred on his
back, legs and head while Eldred lay stomach-down on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day as those incidents, Carroll allegedly planted a
7-inch ''shank,'' or knife, where Eldred encountered Hall, the
notice says.
</P>
<P>
   The charges also state that Carroll filed a false ''inmate
misbehavior report'' on Eldred and lied to Special FBI Agent Marc
Promutico and the Inspector General's Office investigators about
the events of that day.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the alleged actions, the notice of discipline said,
constituted misdemeanors, while the introduction of a knife into
the prison would be a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Foglia, a department spokeswoman, confirmed that a notice
of discipline was sent to Carroll and that he has been suspended
without pay since May 10.

<HEADLINE> Joe Puma, jazz guitarist, dead at 72  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Joe Puma, a jazz guitarist whose reflective
style placed him in demand as both a soloist and ensemble member,
died in the Bronx on May 31 of cancer. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Puma earned accolades across a half century for his versatility,
from his light, restrained sound and jaunty persona as a soloist to
his exceptional collaborative technique as an accompanist.
</P>
<P>
   A self-taught guitarist, Puma's career began in 1948, with his
first major job the following year with the vibraphonist Joe
Roland. He went on to record with jazz artists including Louie
Bellson, Artie Shaw's Gramercy Five, Eddie Bert, Herbie Mann, Mat
Mathews and Chris Connor. He later recorded with Bobby Hackett,
Gary Burton and Carmen McRae.
</P>
<P>
   Puma was a favorite accompanist of singers like Peggy Lee,
Morgana King, Helen Merrill and Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he formed a duo with Chuck Wayne, and they appeared at
the 1973 Newport Jazz Festival in New York. Puma later led his own
trio, and remained musically active until the late 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded on his own for the Bethlehem, Dawn Jubilee and
Columbia labels in the 1950s and 1960s, and led a later session for
Reservoir in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Among his recordings are ''Like Tweet,'' with songs based on
bird calls.

<HEADLINE> Long Island telemarketer alerted police of Mamaroneck attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - When an alleged rapist entered the Mamaroneck
lingerie shop where his ex-girlfriend works, she was on the phone
with a telemarketer on Long Island who notified police.
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Greene called Nassau police after hearing William Milligan
threaten the woman Thursday afternoon, Newsday reported Saturday.
She was referred to the New Rochelle police, who in turn alerted
police in Mamaroneck. As a result, authorities arrived on scene
before Milligan could escape.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a rifle, Milligan, 56, of Gardiner, held off police
for half an hour and then was coaxed into surrendering as
sharpshooters lined the village's main street and perched on
rooftops above.
</P>
<P>
   Milligan was ordered to the psychiatric unit of the Westchester
County Jail after his arraignment Thursday night on a rape charge.
</P>
<P>
   Milligan had walked into Sheer Perfection on Mamaroneck Avenue,
where his former girlfriend works, at 12:19 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Milligan released the 49-year-old woman, who was taken to an
ambulance with a bandage on her knee. But he stayed in the shop as
police blocked off streets and ordered merchants to lock their
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Sgt. Robert Holland of the Mamaroneck police reached
Milligan by phone and told him, ''this wasn't worth dying for,''
Holland said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's over an ex-girlfriend and they had some problems,''
Holland said. ''I told him they might be able to work it out. He
was really bent on suicide.'' Milligan emerged, dropped to one knee
and surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of first-degree rape, Milligan could be sentenced
to up to 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The victim had ordered a catalog from American Royal Arts in
Westbury, where Greene works. Armed with the victim's home address,
Mamaroneck police found the woman's daughter, who directed them to
the lingerie store.

health safety. There is no apparent public health threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Frost, a park service spokesman, said it would be up to the
agency's board of inquiry to decide if any disciplinary action
would be taken against Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said he has spent the last month preparing to appear
before the board.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, he said he wasn't sure what retirement might
hold for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea, I haven't thought that far yet,'' he said.
''It happened all of a sudden.''

<HEADLINE> Ben Shahn Art Exhibit Opens  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ben Shahn, a foremost artist of the 1930s,
made his reputation painting realistic New York scenes from the
Great Depression, but a new exhibit at the Phillips Collection
shows that he found his photographs just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a social painter or photographer,'' he once told an
interviewer. ''I find difficulty in making distinctions between
photography and painting. Both are pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 easel paintings and 112 photos in the show, which
opened Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Turner, curator of the show, called Shahn ''one of
America's greatest artists.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked doing paintings that closely followed the photos he had
snapped himself or found in newspapers. He based one painting on an
Associated Press photo of a demonstration in New York's Union
Square on May 1, 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a right angle viewfinder on his 35 mm. Leica camera
enabled Shahn to shoot faces while appearing to focus in a
different direction. That gave him candid shots without his
subjects knowing they were being pictured. His painting called
''Myself Among the Churchgoers'' depicts him doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Some photographers think such deception unethical. That didn't
bother Shahn, though he called flash bulbs ''immoral'' because he
felt they destroyed the natural darkness and mystery of a scene.
</P>
<P>
   Shahn got his first and only lessons from Walker Evans, the
classic photographer. They worked together both in lower Manhattan
and picturing poverty in the southeast for the New Deal's Farm
Security Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Giving instructions on how to set his photo exposure, ''F/9 on
the sunny side of the street, F/4.5 on the shady side of the
street,'' was all Walker told Shahn. ''For a 20th of a second hold
your camera steady.''

   ''Ben Shahn's New York: The Photography of Modern Times'' will
be at the Phillips Collection through Aug. 27. Weekend admission:
Adults $7.50; Seniors $4; 18 and under free. On weekdays
contributions are suggested in the same amounts.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit moves to the Grey Art Gallery, New York University,

<HEADLINE> Police arrest 12 in New York-Philadelphia crack ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A federal prosecutor said a Jamaican
drug ring that brought more than a pound of crack cocaine a week to
upstate New York from Philadelphia was cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people were arrested in a series of raids Friday in the
southern tier and in Philadelphia. Three more are sought in the
18-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the Jamaican drug ring operated in Broome County for
more than a year, moving large amounts of crack. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Miroslav Lovric said the investigation began in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Charged in the federal indictment with conspiracy to distribute
and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine were: Roger
Beecham, 40, and Regina Williams, 34, of Johnson City; Elaine
Shannon, 47, and Tislam DuPont, 23, also known as James Douglas, of
Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth suspect named in the federal indictment, Walik Skeete,
23, of Binghamton, remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested was Norris C. Taylor, 47, of Binghamton, charged
with eight counts of third-degree criminal sale of a controlled
substance, one count of third-degree criminal possession of a
controlled substance and one count of fourth-degree conspiracy, all
felonies. Taylor also is charged with unlawful possession of
marijuana, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Philadelphia arrested Alvin Jordan, 21, of
Philadelphia, charging him with two counts of third-degree criminal
sales of a controlled substance, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation continues, with two other people still being
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Beecham, Williams, Shannon, Taylor, Jordan and DuPont were
arraigned either in federal or local court and held in jail Friday.
Others were released on bail.

<HEADLINE> Five sentenced in $35 million upstate theft ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW HARTFORD, N.Y. (AP) - Five more members of an organized
shoplifting ring that operated in 11 counties to steal more than
$35 million in merchandise have been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   The massive and organized shoplifting case was broken with
eavesdropping devices, said Alan Blumenkopf, an assistant deputy
attorney general with the state Organized Crime Task Force. Now, 13
of more than 25 members of the ring have been sentenced as a result
of the theft and distribution of goods in central New York. The
arrests were made in February.
</P>
<P>
   Among stores targeted were national retail chains, such as
Wal-Mart, K-Mart, CVS, Eckerd Drugs, Ames, BJs Wholesale Club,
Sears, J.C. Penney, Staples, Office Max and Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the ring are alleged to have worked in teams and
targeted specific items that were believed to be easy to re-sell,
including videos, razor blades, batteries, compact discs, video
games, Texas calculators, over-the-counter medications, film,
disposable cameras, electric razors, tools, compact radios and CD
players.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Joseph J. Tebsherany, 67, of Oneida Street, Utica,
was sentenced to a year in Oneida County jail.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Alberico, 39, of Walker Road, Deerfield, who previously
pleaded guilty to a charge of fourth-degree criminal possession of
stolen goods, told Dwyer he made ''a terrible choice'' in becoming
involved in the theft ring and asked for the court's leniency.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're someone who really upsets me,'' Dwyer replied,
according to the Utica Observer-Dispatch. ''You have the
intelligence and the means to support yourself legally, like
everyone else. There is no reason for you to get involved in this
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a responsibility by Alberico to care for his children,
Dwyer decided not to place him in jail. Instead, Alberico received
five years' probation, a $3,500 fine and was ordered to perform 100
hours of community service. As a condition of his probation,
Alberico must maintain ''suitable employment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will give you one more chance,'' Dwyer added. ''But, believe
me, if you let me down, you will regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   Also sentenced to five years probation were Robert Lavalla, 51,
of Frankfort, and Frank Meola, 35, and Joel M. Galinn 62, of Utica.

<HEADLINE> No fish tale: fishermen illegally catch 100 pounds of bass in afternoon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENFIELD, N.Y. (AP) - It's a fishermen's nightmare: catching 98
bass in four hours and not being able to tell anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But after trying to sell the catch to an undercover officer for
sale despite a health concern, they talked.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gerald Locurcio, 50, and Gary Holtz, 47, of Rochester have
each been fined $750 for the illegal sale, possession and
transportation of the 115 pounds of bass from Lake Ontario. They
pleaded guilty to the violations after police say they tried to
sell the catch for $250 to an undercover officer.
</P>
<P>
   They could be banned from game fishing in New York for up to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Environmental Conservation officials say Locurcio
and Holtz used rods and reels to catch the fish off Sodus Point in
Wayne County during a four-hour span last summer. The daily limit
is five per person during the season, which runs from mid-June
through November.
</P>
<P>
   Selling game fish such as black bass and lake trout is illegal.
Despite the ban, grocers who serve poor neighborhoods sometimes buy
them.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the DEC has charged several Rochester stores during
the past 18 months with offering game fish for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Markets can buy black-market fish for $2 or $3 a pound and
double the price to customers and still undercut supermarket
prices.
</P>
<P>
   But black-market fish are health risk. The state recommends
eating no more than half a pound of Lake Ontario bass a month.
Pregnant women and children should avoid them completely.
</P>
<P>
   ''The upside is: That's how good the fishing is,'' said Lt. Dave
Baker, a DEC enforcement officer. ''The downside is, it creates the
ability for people to take large quantities to sell them.''

<HEADLINE> 4 Die in Japan Chemical Plant Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A chemical plant exploded Saturday north of Tokyo,
killing four workers, injuring at least 27 people and shattering
the windows of nearby homes.
</P>
<P>
   The four workers killed were inside the plant run by Nisshin
Chemical Co., and four other workers in the plant at the time of
the blast were hospitalized, police said.
</P>
<P>
   One person lost an ear in the accident in Gunma Prefecture, 65
miles north of Tokyo, they said. Many were cut by flying pieces of
glass.
</P>
<P>
   The fumes were not toxic, Ojima city official Eiichi Kanai said.
The explosion took place during the mixing of hydroxylamine with a
water solution, Kanai said. Hydroxylamine is used to remove oxygen
from other substances.
</P>
<P>
   A fire set off by the blast was brought under control late
Saturday, police said. The cause of the explosion was under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were processing semiconductors, an electronic part
used in transistors and computers, Kyodo News agency said. The
explosion also caused power failures at more than 200 households,
Kyodo said.

<HEADLINE> Inmate's death on work detail raises concern over inmate safety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILTON, N.Y. (AP) - An inmate working on a church during a work
detail died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Clark, 34, of Brooklyn was in a crew of nine inmates and a
corrections officer from the Mt. McGregor Correctional Facility's
minimum security camp. They were refurbishing a church in the
Saratoga County town of Wilton when Clark touched an aluminum
ladder as a gust of wind knocked it into a 7,600-volt overhead
power line. The jolt was fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is the first inmate to die in a work-related crew accident
in at least 15 years, a state official said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison system critic Alice Green, however, said inmates have
little protection during community work projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they were free people, they would have all kinds of
protections under the Department of Labor. Here, because they are
exploited slave labor, there is very little concern about their
safety,'' said Green, director of the Center for Law and Justice
based in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   While an official for the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration said the agency has no jurisdiction in the case, a
state official said those safety rules are followed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told we follow the OSHA standards for inmates,'' said
corrections spokesman James Flateau. ''One of the reasons we do
that is that inmates are out there supervised by officers, and we
can't send the inmates to do things the officers can't.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Split Up Hostages  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels, fearing a military raid,
have moved 10 Caucasian hostages to a new hiding place in the
southern Philippine jungle, negotiators said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels, who have been holding 21 mostly foreign
hostages, kept the 11 captives from Malaysia and the Philippines at
the previous jungle camp, where the government recently built a
wooden shed for the hostages' protection, said Abdul Rajab
Azzarouq, a Libyan envoy who is serving as a government negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also announced they will no longer talk to chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado, who suggested earlier in
the week that the government might consider a military rescue if
talks for the hostages' release break down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly condemn him for such irresponsible statements,''
the Abu Sayyaf said in a communique. The group warned that the
lives of the hostages ''will be exposed to extreme risks'' if any
rescue operation is launched.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado said today that his comment was taken out of context.
''The government panel does not consider, much less endorse, an
armed response to the hostage crisis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the developments appeared to be a considerable
setback to hopes for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to start again from the beginning,'' said Farouk
Hussein, another government negotiator. ''This is a very sad
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein and Azzarouq headed back Saturday to a village mosque
guarded by hundreds of rebels for a second day of talks with
guerrilla leaders. ''The talks are going on, but it's a tough
one,'' Azzarouq said after their return.
</P>
<P>
   During the latest talks, the guerrillas refused to give up their
demand for an independent Islamic nation in the southern
Philippines, the negotiators said. The government has repeatedly
ruled out any breakup of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is one of two main rebel groups fighting for an
independent Muslim nation here. The rebels seized the hostages --
three Germans, two French, two Finns, two South Africans, a
Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos -- on April 23 from a
Malaysian diving resort and brought them to Jolo, an island at the
tip of the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace of negotiations has been bitterly criticized by
the hostages, whose psychological state has deteriorated in recent
weeks as prospects for their speedy release have dimmed. Several of
the hostages have threatened suicide, and a government doctor urged
Thursday that one, Stephane Loisy of France, be hospitalized for
psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada has ordered the negotiators to make
substantial progress by Monday, the Philippine independence day.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the southern Philippines, at least six Muslim
rebels belonging to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front were killed
and two civilian militiamen wounded Saturday after guerrillas
attacked a village, said Maj. Lito Aso of the army's 6th Infantry
Division.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Attack Russian Positions  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Chechen guerrillas attacked Russian
positions in Chechnya six times overnight, the military command
said Saturday, while police in the capital Grozny searched for
gunmen who killed three Russian medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   A group of epidemiologists were riding in an Emergency
Situations Ministry car near a Grozny hospital Friday when gunmen
opened fire on them. Three of the specialists were killed and three
were wounded, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police carried out selective passport checks in the Zavodskoi
district of Grozny, where the attack took place, and were searching
through the rubble of destroyed buildings nearby, where the rebels
could be hiding out, the military's press center said.
</P>
<P>
   The military concedes that as many as 500 rebels are still in
Grozny, even though the Russians took control of the Chechen
capital more than four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels opened fire on six units of Russian Interior
Ministry troops overnight in different parts of the breakaway
republic, the press center said. It said there were no Russian
casualties in the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an interview with Germany's
ARD and ZDF television, said his decision to impose direct
presidential rule on Chechnya and suspend local elections was
legal. Putin's decision still must be approved by the Russian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything we are saying and doing to strengthen legality is
absolutely in keeping with the Constitution,'' he said in the
interview aired on Russian television Saturday. ''Not a single step
of the government or the president is intended to abolish
democratic institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's move formalized the Kremlin's control of the republic.
Direct presidential rule means a suspension of Chechnya's right as
part of the Russian federation to elect its own officials,
legislature and regional government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Chechnya would be run by a provisional
administration headed by a Putin-appointed chief. Putin said the
appointment of the administrator would be made soon.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he said, ''we shall go over to normal democratic
procedures, to elections, as soon as the social sphere is
restored.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who want independence, show no sign of giving up the
war.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian offensive against Chechnya, which began in late
September, has stalled for months in the rugged southern mountains.
The rebels have kept up ambushes and bombings in the northern
lowlands that have inflicted a steady stream of losses on Russian
forces and sapped troop morale.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 2,000 rebels remain in the mountains and many of them
are spreading into other parts of the republic, Gen. Viktor
Kazantsev, a top commander in the Caucasus, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were driven out of Chechnya in a 1994-96 war. They
re-entered in September after Islamic militants based there seized
several villages in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, and
after about 300 people died in apartment bombings the government
blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Fear in Israel-Free South Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOULA, Lebanon (AP) -- Prone on a mattress with a slightly
bloodied bandage on his forehead, Mohammed Ayoub is too scared to
say much about the beating he suffered when he returned to his
village.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbors are nearly as reticent, only hinting that the
unidentified assailants had decided that a Beirut court was wrong
in ruling that Ayoub was too old to prosecute for any links to a
pro-Israeli militia, the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   In their fearful silence is a warning of a new cycle of violence
now that Israeli troops have pulled out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's hasty May 24 withdrawal and the collapse of the
SLA, there has been little violence against those who once worked
with the Jewish state. The restraint is all the more remarkable
considering Lebanon's long years of sectarian civil war, but it is
clear the veil of calm could easily be torn away.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of harassment and up to 30
extra-judicial arrests by Shiite Muslim guerrillas in dozens of
southern villages, targeting people for alleged pro-Israeli
activities during the 18-year occupation of the area set up as a
buffer zone against cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli army left, the guerrillas have been the main
security presence in a region that is a patchwork of Muslim and
Christian villages.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police officers, State Security and military
intelligence agents have been dispatched to the area, which makes
up 10 percent of Lebanon and is home to 120,000 people, but no
serious Lebanese army presence.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of U.N. peacekeepers along the border awaits
official verification of the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of harassment, in addition to widespread anger over
what many perceive to be light sentences for people they describe
as former tormentors, have fed concerns about the future in the
south.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the 2,500-strong SLA fled to Israel with the
retreat of the Israeli troops. Up to 1,500, however, surrendered to
Lebanese authorities and await trial for treason. A Beirut military
court has already ruled in more than 130 cases, sentencing most of
the former militiamen to one year in jail. Other sentences ranged
from one month to 10 years. In the toughest sentence, one received
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, elderly defendants or those with health problems
were released on humanitarian grounds, including Mohammed Ayoub
from Houla. The 60-year-old father of 14 was let go last week
during preliminary interrogations to return to this Shiite Muslim
village just a few miles from the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how Ayoub was linked to the SLA. Some of those
who surrendered were just cooks or doorkeepers or people who had
gone to Israel for jobs because work was scarce in economically
depressed south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was injured in a fight with my neighbor that was started by
our kids,'' the visibly distraught man said, denying he was ever a
member of the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   Ayoub's fate is proof Hassan Rizk has reason to worry. His son
Osama, who he says was coerced into joining the SLA in 1995, was
sentenced last week to 18 months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''What if some crazy guy decides my son deserves to die and
kills him when he returns to the village?'' asks Rizk, 62, a Shiite
like the dominant Hezbollah and Amal guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Hijazi, a former guerrilla who fought against Israel with
a small Communist party, was tortured in the SLA-run Khiam
detention center and says he cannot forgive his captors -- now in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hijazi says he was paralyzed when he was caught in a shoot-out
between a friend and robbers in Paraguay, where he fled upon his
release from Khiam. Now the green-eyed, bearded Hijazi sits in a
wheelchair and drags slowly on a cigarette at his father's grocery
store as he contemplates the possible return of his SLA torturer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would slit his throat,'' he said thoughtfully.
</P>
<P>
   Zeinab Abbas, modest in a black robe and headscarf, feels the
same. She says her 28-year-old brother, Khalil Asaad, was shot and
killed on the streets of their town by an SLA militiaman who now
awaits trial. Her brother, who she says was not a guerrilla, has
been dead 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   If her brother's killer returns to her village, ''I will take
matters into my own hands . ... If the government does not recover
our dignity, we will have to do it ourselves,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas have warned of violence if former
militiamen return even after serving sentences. Mindful of the
volatility, the military court ordered some ex-militiamen it
sentenced to prison terms to stay away from their villages for up
to 15 years.

<HEADLINE> Spending Bills Help GOP Donors  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Less money for a federal lawsuit against the
tobacco industry. No pressure for more fuel-efficient cars. Delayed
mining regulations. Free tests for egg producers.
</P>
<P>
   Big Republican donors are getting all sorts of help in their
battles against Clinton administration regulations, thanks to
special measures the GOP-controlled Congress has buried in agency
spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is hoping to make the special measures, called
riders, election-year issues.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., is trying to persuade his
Republican troops to limit the provisions and avoid an impasse on
spending bills like the ones that shut down the government in 1995
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to take riders off the bills,'' Hastert spokesman
John Feehery said. ''We want to get these bills done as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the special-interest provisions are piling up in the
legislation to fund federal agencies in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president simply cannot and will not sign bills so
burdened by riders that they do serious harm to the environment and
otherwise damage the interests of the American people,'' said Jack
Lew, President Clinton's budget director.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, the House refused to drop one of them -- a
provision to quash new workplace regulations for preventing
repetitive stress injuries. Companies reviled the regulations,
fearing new costs. Unions, the biggest financial backers of
Democrats, backed the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides have identified at least 40 such provisions
in spending bills and are drawing parallels to 1995. ''They're back
to their old tricks,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans counter that their measures are needed to fix a
government too eager to impose regulations without considering the
financial impact.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., has inserted a provision in an
agriculture spending bill that would block the Food and Drug
Administration's plan to require egg producers to pay the cost of
federal tests for salmonella in eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shouldn't be putting this on the backs of the farmer,''
Kingston said, noting the government pays for similar meat and
poultry inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Critics note many of the measures help large GOP donors in an
election year when both the White House and control of Congress are
up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, egg and poultry farms have given $174,000 to
federal candidates this election cycle, two-thirds of it to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''These appropriations bills have become laden down with
language to protect the wealthiest and most influential special
interests in the country,'' said Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y., a
member of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions would:
</P>
<P>
   --Delay any Environmental Protection Agency decision on cleaning
up PCBs until after the National Academy of Sciences completes a
study due this fall. The legislation was championed by Rep. John
Sweeney, R-N.Y., whose district includes a General Electric plant
that disposed of PCBs in the Hudson River. GE has contributed
$356,600 to federal candidates, more than 80 percent to
Republicans. Scientific studies have linked PCBs, or
polychlorinated biphenyls, to cancer. They have been banned in the
U.S. manufacture of products since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   --Prevent other federal agencies, like the Veterans
Administration, from helping finance the Justice Department's
lawsuit against big tobacco. The industry has been among the top
contributors to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco PACs have contributed $670,869 to Republicans, compared
with $300,806 to Democrats. The industry also has contributed $1.7
million in unregulated soft money donations to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Justice Department wants to proceed with a lawsuit,
that's fine,'' said Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee that oversees veterans and housing
funds. ''But don't let them take it out of veterans' medical
care.''
</P>
<P>
   --Stop the government from forcing automakers to produce more
fuel-efficient vehicles. The auto industry has contributed $2.8
million to congressional candidates, almost three-fourths to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes a lot more sense to let the marketplace determine the
kind of vehicles consumers want and not a government mandate,''
said the GOP sponsor, Rep. Joe Knollenberg, who is from the Big
Three automakers' home state of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   --Restrict federal efforts to limit waste produced at gold and
copper mines. The mining industry has given $484,713 to GOP
candidates, more than three times the $140,965 contributed to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say that in some cases Republicans are simply undoing
help the Clinton administration gave to its biggest donors, such as
the Labor Department's repetitive stress injury rules that were
pushed by labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear they want to get it out while Clinton is still
president,'' said Dan Danner, a National Federation of Independent
Business vice president. ''If George W. Bush is elected, this will
quickly die on the vine.''
</P>
<P>
   Danner's group has given $274,600 of its $283,100 in political
action committee contributions to Republicans. Labor PACs have
contributed $17.8 million to Democrats and just $1.9 million to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans say the special provisions offer them
bargaining chips for negotiations with the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, there are some things that are given
up,'' said Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee. ''The more things you have in,
the more you can give up in exchange.''

<HEADLINE> Iran Hard-Liners Launch Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By ALI AKBAR DAREINI
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iranian hard-liners are expanding a
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement to include student
activists, a board member of Iran's largest student organization
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Five members of the student group Office for Fostering Unity
have been summoned by courts since Wednesday and released only
after signing ''pledges not to take part in protest rallies and
demonstrations,'' Akbar Atri, one of seven members of the group's
board of trustees, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal newspapers and university students have strongly
supported President Mohammad Khatami's efforts to loosen social
controls in place since the 1979 Islamic revolution installed
clerical rule in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners -- who still control the judiciary -- began fighting
back in April by banning nearly every publication that supported
the presidential reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''After closing down almost all pro-reform newspapers, the
judiciary has now concentrated on student groups in its crackdown
on the popular reform program,'' Atri said. ''We are ready to pay
the price for our activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Atri described the forced pledges, newspaper closures and recent
detentions as ''part of a plan to frighten the public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   February elections gave reformists their first -- and
overwhelming -- majority in Iran's parliament, a clear sign of the
swelling public support for reform-minded politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, students demonstrated at Tehran University against
hard-liners who were seen to be trying to manipulate the
long-delayed results of the legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
   Following the protests, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani
forfeited his seat. A change in results had given Rafsanjani, who
is more closely aligned with hard-liners, a far better showing in
the polls than the initial vote count.
</P>
<P>
   Atri also said he was summoned Thursday to the press court, and
that he was charged with ''spreading lies and disturbing public
opinion'' in his speeches at student gatherings.'' No trial date
has been set.

<HEADLINE> Veterans getting diplomas, thanks to new law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) - Colleen Fenn and Charles Connerton are
generations apart.
</P>
<P>
   Fenn is a 13-year-old student at Ledyard Middle School
completing the seventh grade. Connerton is a 76-year-old retiree
who lives in East Lyme. They've never met; never once talked.
</P>
<P>
   But next week, Connerton will be the beneficiary of a campaign
by Fenn in support of legislation to grant diplomas to World War II
veterans who left high school to join the service. The measure last
month passed the Legislature unanimously, and was signed into law
by Gov. John G. Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to thank that little girl,'' said Connerton, who left
East Lyme High School in 1944 to serve three years in the Merchant
Marines. ''I didn't know it was someone so young. It feels great.
It brings faith in human nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Fenn wrote 41 letters to legislators, the
governor's office and state agencies seeking to amend the criteria
for receiving a high school diploma in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''My grandfather was kind of embarrassed for not having his,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fenn first learned about Operation Recognition, a national
campaign to win high school diplomas for World War II vets, from a
newspaper article about a similar program enacted in Massachusetts.
She contacted Robert McKeon, the Massachusetts commissioner of
Veteran Services, for information and then began lobbying
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   She testified at a public hearing in favor of the bill when an
amendment was offered that would award only honorary diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want it to be honorary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be. Fenn, and her grandfather, Hudson Pelton Jr., of
Old Saybrook, attended the ceremony when Rowland signed the
legislation into law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's going to help a lot of veterans,'' Pelton said.
''It was embarrassing when the question came up. You let it quietly
slide by. I think it means a lot to a lot of veterans, not just
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerton and at least seven World War II vets will receive
their diplomas at the East Lyme High School graduation Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Another 10 veterans are scheduled to receive diplomas at the
Milford High School graduation Wednesday. In Berlin, arrangements
are being made for a special ceremony later this year, which could
be attended by as many as 20 World War II vets.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 Connecticut men and women served in World War
II. No one knows exactly how many are eligible to receive high
school diplomas under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Several school districts have enthusiastically embraced the
idea. Milford began planning to include World War II vets in next
week's graduation exercises months before the bill was passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called senior centers and convalescent homes asking for
people to come forward,'' Superintendent Mary Jo Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether simply giving out the diplomas weakens
their significance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a tremendous opportunity for our community,''
East Lyme High School Principal Gerald Mistretta said. ''It's a
chance to recognize these men who left high school at age 16, 17,
to go and defend our country.''

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes shipping industry hurting from drop in water levels  </HEADLINE>
By PETER WOODALL
The Buffalo News
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Giant freighters carrying coal, grain and
iron ore floated easily across the Great Lakes only three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ships were filled to capacity without worry about scraping lake
bottoms. Water levels then were among the highest they had been in
the last century.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Water levels on four of the five Great Lakes have
dropped between one and three feet in just two years, forcing ships
to lighten loads and cutting profit margins at a time when the
industry is already pinched by high fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Indiana Harbor,'' a freighter owned by Williamsville's
American Steamship Co. is currently carrying only 55,000 tons of
iron pellets, instead of the 60,000 tons it tows under normal
conditions. That hurts when you multiply by the 45 trips the ship
will take this year, said Michael Scheidt, American Steamship's
senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   American Steamship accounts for about 25 percent of the dry bulk
cargo shipped in the Great Lakes by American companies. Its 11-ship
fleet normally carries 25 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had more ships available we would use them, but we
don't,'' Scheidt said. There is no way to increase the number of
trips because the shipping season runs only from March to January
on a fixed navigation system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members have all suffered losses in cargo carried this
season,'' said George Ryan, president of the Cleveland-based Great
Lakes Carriers' Association. ''Almost every ship is in service and
the overall tonnage is still down from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest ships have to drop 270 tons for every inch of water
in draft, Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some members estimate that they are losing from $25,000 to
$40,000 per trip in revenue,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation isn't as bad as it might have been. ''Because we
had a mild winter, ships were able to begin moving coal in March.
It helped keep the flow of cargo to the customers moving,'' Ryan
said. ''We can only hope we have a mild winter so we can continue
carrying as late in January as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But a mild winter is a double-edged sword. Less snow fall means
less spring runoff to fill the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Snowfall above Lake Superior this winter was so minimal - only
about an inch of water - that it could be called a drought,
according to Roger Gauthier, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
hydrologist. ''Snowfall was almost nonexistent for half of the
watershed. That is so unusual,'' he said. ''That is why we say low
water levels will continue through this summer and likely be below
average next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Lake Ontario - the only one of the five Great
Lakes which has a water level higher than the June average.
</P>
<P>
   Last August Lake Ontario's level stood at 7 inches below
average, posing problems for recreational cruisers but not
affecting commercial shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Lake St. Clair, south of Lake Huron, measures 11 inches below
average.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reason for the dropping water level in most of the
lakes is higher temperatures since the El Nino winter of 1997 and
summer of 1998, Gauthier said. There's also been very little ice
cover on the Great Lakes, resulting in increased evaporation. All
has added up to the quickest decline in the 150 years since Great
Lakes water levels have been recorded. A total of 63 trillion
gallons have been lost among all the Great Lakes since 1997,
Gauthier said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how a prolonged drop in water levels would affect
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't intend to suffer through,'' said Scheidt. American
Steamship will try to recoup revenues by increasing freight rates,
he said. If low water levels continue, surcharges may have to be
levied, much as higher gasoline prices have already been passed
along to consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those consumers include the construction industry that buys
stone and cement. Utilities like Niagara Mohawk and other power
producers get coal from Great Lakes shipping.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged drop in water levels wouldn't be unprecedented,
Gauthier said. ''We have seen Lake Erie lower than we are today,
about six or seven times since we've been recording water levels,
so this is by no means a near record low on the lakes. The lake
level on Lake Erie has been lower than it is today for almost 45
years (in a row). So in many respects, Lake Erie may be returning
to the elevation in normally has been at.''
</P>
<P>
   That's no consolation to Ryan. He's asked Congress to study
dredging channels and ports. Failing that, he says that all the
industry can do is work hard and pray for rain.

<HEADLINE> America's favorite orphan gets a makeover and a new creative team.  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Gone are the little red dress and the unruly mop
of curls. With her platform sneakers, blue jeans and slicked-back
hair, Little Orphan Annie is now, in the lexicon of her 11-year-old
modern peers - mad sick.
</P>
<P>
   Translation for those who don't speak tween: Leapin' Lizards!
America's favorite orphan has gotten a makeover and is suddenly
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Her new do and duds were shown off for the first time last week
when artist Andrew Pepoy and writer Jay Maeder officially took over
the strip from longtime ''Annie'' cartoonist Leonard Starr, who
retired in February. The strip was in reruns until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Pepoy, a free-lance cartoonist who has drawn characters for
Marvel (Mutant X), DC (Sonic the Hedgehog and Scooby-Doo) and
Archie comics, said both he and Tribune Media Services, the
Chicago-based company that syndicates the 75-year-old strip,
thought Annie looked dated next to her new companion, the sexy and
edgy Hispanic aviator Amelia Santiago. So a few pencil strokes
later, out went Annie's tired old red dress, black Maryjanes and
ankle socks; in came jeans, a red T-shirt and platform sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Her hair is different, too. But not drastically so, says Pepoy.
</P>
<P>
   The artist imagines Annie, like many 11-year-olds, standing
daily at the bathroom mirror with gobs of gel in her hand, slicking
back her mane of unruly red curls. The result is a sleeker looking
hairdo, complete with two barrettes (non-matching, of course.)
</P>
<P>
   But fans of America's favorite blank-eyed youngster - yes, she's
still pupil-less - shouldn't worry. Underneath, Annie hasn't
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's some kind of feeling out there that Little Orphan
Annie is now a typical 11-year-old who goes to rock concerts and
has pictures of 'N Sync on her wall, no, this is not happening,''
said writer Maeder. ''In fact, if you ask me what kind of music
she'd listen to, I'd say Tommy Dorsey.''
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Maeder, a journalist for the Daily News and a
comic historian, doesn't understand the fuss about Annie's updated
look.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't changed her fundamental character in any way. Anyone
who ever loved Little Orphan Annie will not look at this and say
this is a totally different person.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, she's worn jeans before. Starr drew Annie in
jeans many times, but readers tend to associate her with the little
red dress with white cuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Maeder says he has no plans to turn Annie or any other character
into modern day valley girls. She'll still exclaim, ''Leapin'
Lizards,'' and Sandy will still say, ''Arf,'' Maeder says.
</P>
<P>
   The intent, says Pepoy, is to make her look ''more like a real
11-year-old ... without straying too far from the Annie everyone
loved.'' He said reaction so far has been positive.
</P>
<P>
   The strip, created by Harold Gray, first appeared in the Daily
News, Aug. 5, 1924. Annie is said to have been modeled after silent
screen star Mary Pickford. During Gray's four-decade reign - he
died in 1968 - Annie and her millionaire guardian Daddy Warbucks
battled everything from big government during the Depression to
Communism in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Starr took over the strip in 1979 - after interest in it was
revived by the Broadway musical ''Annie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the updated version, Even Warbucks has a new, more casual
look. He has lost his perennial penguin suit and will be seen in
stylish, tie-less suits, sweaters and (Yikes!) even shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Annie will also experiment with fashion, wearing her hair in a
ponytail occasionally and donning Capri pants. But don't expect her
in a halter top. ''We don't want her to be too trendy,'' says
Pepoy, whose wife, Chris, helps him stay up to date on preteen
styles.
</P>
<P>
   As for the story line, Maeder says Warbucks' paid assassins,
Punjab and the Asp, are out, as is Warbucks' high-tech research
laboratory, which has fallen into legal difficulty after a toxic
spill.
</P>
<P>
   Warbucks will soon withdraw for a while, and the action will
center on pilot Santiago and Annie, who will act as her co-pilot
for encounters with lost tribes, underwater cities, train wrecks
and mountain bandits.
</P>
<P>
   And what will become of Sandy, Annie's shaggy companion?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry loyal readers. ''The dog never goes away,'' says
Maeder. ''He's like Old Faithful himself. He'll be right there with
them during their adventures around the world.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Despite the departure of Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani from the closely watched U.S. Senate race in New York,
Hillary Rodham Clinton has been unable to open up a gap over the
Republican opposition, according to three independent polls.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani pulled out of the race on May 19 to deal with his
prostate cancer, Republican leaders put on game faces and predicted
that by late summer or early fall their new candidate, Rep. Rick
Lazio, would be running even with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take anywhere near that long for the little-known
congressman from Long Island to become competitive. In fact, it
didn't really take any time at all.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio formally announced his candidacy on May 20. A pre-Memorial
Day poll released May 25 by the Zogby International Group had the
race a statistical dead heat with Clinton at 46 percent and Lazio
at 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a poll conducted by Blum &AMP; Weprin for the New York
Daily News and cable television's New York 1 all-news channel
reported Clinton was at 46 percent and Lazio at 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7, the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute came out
with its offering. It showed Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent
each.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he'd draw even by Labor Day. I feel badly I was off
by a full holiday - two if you count the Fourth'' of July, said
Kieran Mahoney, a New York-based GOP operative.
</P>
<P>
   While Lazio has attributes that make him an attractive candidate
in his own right - young, telegenic and eight years in Congress -
his almost instant closing of the gap with the first lady added
credence to the theory that no matter who the Republicans run
against Clinton, it will be a close race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her high negatives don't change,'' said pollster Lee Miringoff
of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion. ''And, apparently
that's fairly easily transferrable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you run against Hillary Clinton, and if you pass a fairly
low hurdle of respectability, a lot of people are going to like you
because they dislike her so much,'' said Mahoney.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Quinnipiac poll, four in 10 voters said they had
an unfavorable opinion of Clinton. Her negatives have been running
at that level for months.
</P>
<P>
   That poll also found, however, that 58 percent of voters
surveyed didn't know enough about Lazio to form a favorable or
unfavorable opinion.
</P>
<P>
   With less than five months until the election, political
veterans say the key to the race is how Lazio gets defined for the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers may not like her, but she's got to make them like
him less,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who has
worked on many New York campaigns and was part of President
Clinton's successful 1996 re-election campaign team.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp and his allies are working hard at presenting him
as a moderate Republican in tune with mainstream New Yorkers. His
campaign bus is called ''The Mainstream Express.'' The candidate
has T-shirts emblazoned with a ''Made in New York'' logo aimed at
reminding voters that Clinton didn't even live in the state until
January. He also repeatedly stresses that he has an eight-year
record in Congress while the first lady has no record and has never
been an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Clinton camp argues that Lazio is a Newt
Gingrich-loving conservative who voted for most of the ''Contract
with America,'' to shut down the federal government in 1995 and to
slash funding for education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   With Lazio replacing Giuliani in the race, political veterans
are beginning to re-examine recent New York races in which a
high-profile, polarizing figure, such as Hillary Clinton, faced a
little-known, but reasonably well-funded opponent, such as Rick
Lazio. Such models include Republican George Pataki against
three-term Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994 and Democrat Charles
Schumer vs. three-term Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. In
both cases, the well-known, but polarizing figures, Cuomo and
D'Amato, respectively, lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York state politics teaches us a very important lesson,
which is that the candidate who becomes the issue is the candidate
who loses,'' said Sheinkopf. ''Her strategic mission is to make him
the issue.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Syria To Stay in Peace Search  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- President Clinton expressed condolences
today to Syrian President Hafez Assad's family and said he expects
to continue working with Syria's leaders toward a comprehensive
Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   The president was told of reports of Assad's death while Clinton
flew on Air Force One to Minnesota, where he gave the commencement
speech at Carleton College. An aide handed Clinton a note
confirming the death as Clinton sat on the dais before delivering
the speech. He did not mention the Assad's death in his brief talk.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement issued after the address, Clinton said:
''Over the past seven years, I have met him many times and gotten
to know him very well. We had our differences, but I always
respected him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the Madrid Conference, he made a strategic choice for
peace and we worked together to achieve that goal. Throughout my
contacts with him, including our last meeting, he made clear
Syria's continued commitment to the path of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1991 peace conference in Spain, sponsored by the United
States and Russia, brought together Israel, the Palestinians, Syria
and other major Middle East parties.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first such all-encompassing gathering and led to
other meetings and a general relaxation of tensions between the
Israelis and their Arab neighbors, although negotiations between
Israel and Syria have been difficult to sustain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look forward to working with Syria to achieve the goal of a
comprehensive peace,'' Clinton said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in Minneapolis, Clinton said it was too early to say what
impact Assad's death would have on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a period of sorting out and the Syrian people
will make some decisions and then we'll see what happens,'' Clinton
said. ''But you know, we've been at this for years because of the
decision he made to go back to negotiations and to try to move away
from conflict. and it's certainly a path I hope the country will
stay on.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also expressed her
condolences and said that ''in all our talks he remained
committed'' to peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly believe that was the right choice and we expect
that Syria will continue on the path of peace,'' she said in a
statement issued in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Albright met with Syria's foreign minister in
Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Syria showed interest in reopening peace talks with Israel, but
Farouk al-Sharaa did not signal any shift in his country's
territorial demands. Assad has steadfastly demanded return from
Israel of all the Golan Heights, a border plateau that Israel took
in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not get any indication of a change,'' Albright said of
her meeting with al-Sharaa. She also said that after talks this
coming week in the Washington area between senior Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators, she will decide whether to return to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's constitution says the vice president succeeds to the
presidency, but the process is expected to be less clear-cut in
practice and could take some time to clarify itself.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said al-Sharaa told Albright
his government would like to remain in touch.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has offered to return the Golan. But Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak balked at Syria's demand for a sliver of land
along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, the source of about 40
percent of Israel's water.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was unable to change Assad's mind when he renewed the
Israeli offer at a March meeting with Assad in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Statement on Assad's Death  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   President Clinton's statements Saturday on the death
of Syrian
President Hafez Assad:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Written statement issued in Northfield, Minn., where Clinton
gave the commencement address at Carleton College:
</P>
<P>
   ''I am saddened by the news of President Assad's death and want

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Statement Clinton gave later at the Minneapolis airport:
</P>
<P>
   ''As you know, I received word not very long ago of President
Assad's death in Syria today. I was very saddened by it, and I want
to offer condolences to his son, his family and the people of
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, over the last seven years, I had the occasion to
meet with President Assad many times, and I believe I got to know
him well. And while we had our disagreements, I always respected
him because I felt he was open and straightforward with me and
because I felt he meant it when he said he had made a strategic
choice for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that that peace was not achieved in his lifetime, and
I hope that it can still be achieved in no small measure because of
the commitment that he made.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think today rather than speculate about the future it would
be best for all of us just to extend our condolences and our best
thoughts to the family and the people of Syria.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Assad's death would affect the peace process, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's premature to say. There will be a period of
mourning in Syria. There will be a period of sorting out, and the
Syrian people will make some decisions. And then we'll see what
happens.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you know, we've been at this for years because of the
decision he made to go back to negotiations and to try to move away
from conflict. And it's certainly a path I hope the country will
stay on.''

<HEADLINE> Accused rabbi deals with pain of wife's murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - His jaw clenches whenever Rabbi Fred J.
Neulander is asked about the 1994 murder of his wife Carol, a
brutal bludgeoning authorities say he arranged so he could continue
an affair with a congregant.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in the home here where they raised a daughter and two
sons, the rabbi tells the story he has stuck to ever since: Police
and prosecutors have framed him. Two men who claim he offered them
$30,000 to kill her are lying. Robbers killed his wife of 29 years,
whom he loved and misses ''very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too painful, emotionally painful'' to discuss her, the
58-year-old Neulander told The Philadelphia Inquirer in its Sunday
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, a seventh-generation rabbi, is charged with
accomplice murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He could become
the first New Jersey clergyman to face the death penalty when he is
eventually tried. Free on $400,000 bail, he admits only to
committing adultery, but knows he is under a cloud of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have done some things I am not proud of,'' he said in
October after a court hearing in Camden. ''But I have not done all
the things they have said I have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege Neulander planned the murder because
Philadelphia radio host Elaine Soncini, with whom he had been
having an affair, was threatening to end it if he didn't leave his
wife. Neulander was worried a divorce would cost him his job as
senior rabbi at Congregation M'kor Shalom, the Cherry Hill
synagogue he and Carol had founded in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fallout from the murder did, including the disclosure
that Neulander had had an affair with another congregant. When the
board of the 900-family synagogue asked him to resign in February
1995, Neulander complied, saying, ''it was the right thing for me
and the congregation.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 5 1/2-year investigation, two men came forward to say
they had carried out the murder: Len Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood
and Paul Michael Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken. Both have pleaded
guilty to aggravated manslaughter charges in the past 10 days,
admitting they struck Carol Neulander several times with a pipe;
Jenoff, who was once counseled by the rabbi, has promised to
testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   At his lawyers' instruction, Neulander refused to discuss the
murder or charges against him during a half-dozen meetings since
January with Inquirer reporter Barbara Boyer; he only allowed her
to take notes at the final two sessions, after Jenoff and Daniels
were arrested. During one meeting, the rabbi and reporter sat on
his living room floor - on new carpet that had replaced the
bloodied one where Carol Neulander died.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to integrate death into your life,'' Neulander said.
''There are moments of happiness, laughter and moments of sadness.
But there's never closure. How can there be closure for someone who
was such a large part of my life?''
</P>
<P>
   That changed the night of Nov. 1, 1994, when Neulander returned
home from the synagogue. The rabbi found his wife beaten to death
on the living room floor and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's middle child, Matthew, now 27, had been working as
an emergency medical technician that night and rushed home when he
heard the call; his father had him kept outside so Matthew wouldn't
see the body.
</P>
<P>
   In initial interviews with police, Soncini and Neulander both
denied they were having an affair, but she later told authorities
and a grand jury that she and Neulander were in love.
</P>
<P>
   ''I truly regret the things I have done, the people I have hurt
and those I have disappointed,'' Neulander said during one of a
half-dozen interviews with Boyer since January. ''That's something
I'm going to have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Neulander said he enjoys his new job writing curricula for
educational field trips. He also tutors a friend's children and, on
request, officiates at funerals and weddings.
</P>
<P>
   He is writing a book about his experiences as a rabbi - and
mulling another one about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to reinvent yourself,'' he said. ''It's either that
or suicide or staying under the covers all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi has resisted pressure to move out of the house from
his children: Matthew, Rebecca, 29, and Ben, 24.
</P>
<P>
   There's ''a lot of beautiful memories in this house. There's
happiness, birthdays, bat mitzvahs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All three children called him one evening as he watched a
favorite television program in the family room, where a picture of
Carol and the rest of the family is displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the last conversation, with Ben, Neulander said,
''I love you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of counseling and comforting congregants, Neulander
said there still are no words to explain why innocent people must
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is during my private moments that I allow myself to break
down. In fact, I need to break down, for my heart crumbles also,''
Neulander said. ''I, too, raise my fist against heaven and I demand
answers, just like everyone else.''

<HEADLINE> S. Koreans Focus on Summit Symbolism  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the first-ever meeting between
leaders of South Korea and North Korea, a South Korean official is
warning against high expectations. He says a mere photo opportunity
would make this week's summit a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The picture of two leaders smiling and shaking hands, the
picture itself is a great message for world peace,'' South Korean
Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won said.
</P>
<P>
   Fissures between the two countries are so great that prospects
for reconciliation remain unclear, despite their biggest diplomatic
breakthrough since they waged war a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The divide is so entrenched that hundreds of thousands of troops
line either side of the Demilitarized Zone, thousands of separated
families have lost contact and there are no means of direct travel
or communication between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean conflict has shown extraordinary longevity, surviving
the end of the Cold War as well as 1990s predictions that the
communist North would collapse amid deadly famine and economic
ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang remains outwardly defiant, reliant on international
food aid but capable of launching long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, North Korea has decided to engage the world -- although
for now on its own, limited terms.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, which starts Monday in
Pyongyang, caps six months of vigorous diplomacy with China, Italy,
Australia, the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's agreement to host a summit is a notable compromise
because it previously disdained most attempts at dialogue by Seoul,
a government it considered illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the North felt obligated to talk out of desperation for
economic aid from the rich South, the summit is a spectacular
validation of Kim Dae-jung's so-called ''sunshine'' policy of
engaging Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting of the leaders and having candid exchanges of
opinions and ideas will be the achievement of the summit itself,''
said Moon Jung-in, a politics professor at Seoul's Yonsei
University who will travel to Pyongyang in the president's
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Moon predicted the two countries' stated goal of reunification
could require three or four decades of trust-building measures such
as arms reduction and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim has also warned against expecting too much from
the summit, saying he wants to arrange more meetings that might
yield deals on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of 37,000 American troops in South Korea and
Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs are among the most
contentious topics.
</P>
<P>
   An obstacle to reconciliation lies in North Korea's persistence
in defining itself as a bulwark against a trio of imperialist
aggressors: Japan, South Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''That residue is still there despite the Cold War being over,''
said Victor Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Without a perceived threat from the outside, North Korea might
be pressed to justify its totalitarian system.
</P>
<P>
   The former military-led governments of South Korea, which is now
a democracy, used to defend their authoritarian ways by warning of
the menace from the North.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for an improvement in ties have been dashed before. In
1972, huge crowds lined the streets of Seoul to welcome a North
Korean Red Cross delegation, but those talks ended inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers of both nations met in 1991 and agreed to
promote reconciliation, yet concern that North Korea was developing
nuclear weapons plunged the peninsula into crisis three years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tension, the two countries agreed to a summit in
1994. But North Korean leader Kim Il Sung died at age 82 only weeks
before he was to meet his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
   His son and successor, Kim Jong Il, consolidated his power in
the years that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most anxious for the summit's success is 71-year-old
Choi Byong-yool, who fled from the North to the South with his
family shortly after the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea what happened to the relatives he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want most urgently is to find out whether our loved
ones are still alive.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Observers To Carry On  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- The withdrawal of U.N. observers from
Zimbabwe will not affect the role of other foreign observers who
are in the southern African nation to make sure that upcoming
parliamentary elections are free and fair, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said Friday that President Robert Mugabe had
reneged on an agreement to permit the world body's observers to
coordinate all foreign observer missions and that there was not
enough time for the United Nations to renegotiate its role there.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we are not doing the coordination, there is no point in us
being there,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said in New York.
</P>
<P>
   However, observers from the Commonwealth of former British
territories, the European Union and the 14-nation Southern Africa
Development Community will remain in place to monitor the June
24-25 poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to see whether conditions exist for a free
expression of will by electors,'' said Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar of
Nigeria, chairman of the 44-member Commonwealth group.
</P>
<P>
   Sanna Jonson, a spokeswoman for the 210-member EU observer
group, said the U.N. pullout was regrettable but ''we will carry
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition party in Zimbabwe, the Movement for
Democratic Change, criticized the decision by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to withdraw U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   ''For any electoral process to receive the stamp of moral
authority from the international community, it needs recognition
from the United Nations,'' said party leader Morgan Tsvangirai.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar said the presence of international observers and about
14,000 domestic election monitors from church, human rights and
civic groups at 4,000 polling stations across the country aimed to
ensure voters' security and give them confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group Amnesty International said Thursday it
doubted that free and fair elections were possible because of a
wave of land takeovers spearheaded by veterans of the war that led
to independence from white minority rule in 1980. The government
has ignored constitutional ownership rights and laws protecting
private property during the often-violent occupations of more than
1,400 white-owned farms that began in February.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the government announced the state would
immediately begin seizing 804 mostly white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 cases of political violence have been reported
in Zimbabwe since February, when a government-sponsored referendum
on a new constitution was defeated. At least 30 people, mainly
opposition supporters, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The election poses the biggest challenge to Mugabe since he led
the nation to independence from Britain in 1980. Opponents say his
support for the farm occupations is a ploy to increase his vote in
the poll.

<HEADLINE> Residents who repaired flood-damaged homes may lose them to redevelopment </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOUND BROOK, N.J. (AP) - Sophie Dachnowski is 80 now. Her
husband of 54 years died last year, a few months before last
September's flood filled their home with water.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had to come get me out,'' Dachnowski said, pointing to a
window high on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   Dachnowski spent $30,000 to repair the insides of her sturdy
white house, where she spends afternoons sitting on the porch,
talking to neighbors in the breeze. She was born in it, and lived
there with her parents and three siblings, who all have died. Her
only child died in 1981. Still, she has her house.
</P>
<P>
   But under a plan approved this week by the borough council,
Dachnowski's home may be condemned by the city and given over to a
developer with plans to create a new business district for the
flood-ravaged town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was born here and where am I going to go now?'' said
Dachnowski, dabbing tears from her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 properties on a 150-acre tract of land are vulnerable
to condemnation a few years down the road, under a contract
approved this week with The Advance Group of Bedminster. The
developer and the town have visions of a corporate village
surrounding expanded train service, a hotel-conference center and
perhaps a satellite campus to turn around the fortunes of Somerset
County's oldest town after Hurricane Floyd-related flooding turned
its streets into a brown river.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need upkeep here. We need to spruce up the town,'' said
Mayor Frank Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Borough administrator Thomas Brodbeck says the town needs
''ratables right now, and I don't really care what kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9,000-resident town's property values have dropped $45
million since the flood, and Ryan says that without new
development, the tax rate will skyrocket for residents.
</P>
<P>
   So the borough passed a redevelopment plan earlier this year
that gives it the right to use the power of eminent domain to
condemn houses to make way for development. The contract with
Advance allows the developer to ask Bound Brook to take possession
of the properties it is unable to buy.
</P>
<P>
   For residents who suffered through the worst flood in the town's
history, the irony is acute. After spending thousands to rebuild
the homes the water took away, they might have to leave anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''All our hard work put in here,'' said Jenny Jeskie, sitting in
a living room that has been rebuilt from top to bottom since the
flood. ''They better not come in and rip it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeskie and her husband, Stanley, spent 45 years in the modest,
two-story brown house, raising six children. They spent more than
$30,000 to recreate their bedroom, living room, kitchen and
bathroom, and got hand-me-down replacement furniture from family.
</P>
<P>
   ''You put all your years in here,'' Jenny Jeskie said.
''Forty-five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Relax, say Ryan and other borough officials. No one may lose
their home. The Advance Group hasn't submitted a development
proposal yet for the land, and the proposal might not require the
removal of homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the time to yell and scream,'' said Phyllis
Pournaras, a restaurant owner who sits on a redevelopment advisory
committee. She said two property owners in the redevelopment area
have 23 acres between them and want to sell. The land might be
enough for Advance, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And homeowners would receive a fair price for their property and
be relocated, whether their homes are condemned or not, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, many believe that the developer's interest in
the town is spurring the beginning of a long-overdue flood control
project that the low-lying city on the Raritan River desperately
needs. In September, construction will begin on a 15- to 17-foot
berm along one of the town's borders and a bridge that crosses
Green Brook will be raised.
</P>
<P>
   The contract with Advance has the developer promising to develop
10 percent of the land every year from the time the flood control
project is finished in 2003 or 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the flood, Bound Brook had begun redevelopment plans
to revitalize a business district that has had to compete with the
Bridgewater shopping mall and strip malls along Route 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only restaurants'' along the town's Main Street, said
Dachnowski. Years ago, the streets were lined with drug stores,
clothing stores and other shops, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who has lived here for 68 of his 69 years and was not
flooded out last year, acknowledged that some people may have to
lose their homes for the greater good of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to look to the future,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But residents, who filed a lawsuit earlier this year to block
the redevelopment plan, say their lives in Bound Brook are the only
ones they've known. The residential area outlined for redevelopment
has many of the town's oldest inhabitants, many coming from Polish,
Italian and German immigrant families.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, the streets of these neighborhoods were strewn with
mud, garbage, furniture and chunks of people's homes. Now the
streets are clean, many homes are freshly painted and plants are
growing outside Dachnowski's one and only home.
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't want to live anywhere else. When told that
homes wouldn't be vulnerable to condemnation for another three or
four years, she shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be dead by then.''

	   MOHAWK, N.Y. (AP) - A huge fire at a sprawling old factory
brightened the night sky for miles Friday and forced the evacuation
of a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported, although a couple of
firefighters were overcome by heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out about 7 p.m. at the brick building commonly
known as the old Duofold building, in recent years called the
Mohawk Valley Warehouse. Flames poured from windows and a tower
roof and walls collapsed. Inside, fire silhouetted the stairwells
and large beams.
</P>
<P>
   The old factory is in a residential area, and officials ordered
residents to leave. Thirty-five to 40 homes were evacuated, Mohawk
Assistant Fire Chief Rob Phillips told the Utica Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips wouldn't speculate on what might have caused the fire
in the former textile mill, which once employed hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Leo Kinville declared a state of emergency, which allowed
the village to request state aid.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Morse, who lives on East Main and Elizabeth streets, three
houses from the fire, said neighbors were fearful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our back door was hot. Our cars were hot,'' Morse said from
the other side of East Main Street. ''My kids were in the back; I
told them to get in the house ... I started dragging all the kids
in the house. Then they came and told us to evacuate.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents said they were surprised at how fast -
merely seconds - the whole building went from being cloaked in
billowing smoke to a full-blown fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Blais of Warren Street was in his back yard. When he got to
the front, smoke started pouring out of the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then it went,'' Blais said. ''And when it went, it went - with
a boom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's lucky there's no wind, or this would have been a lot
worse,'' said Mitchell Reale, owner of Warren Street Antiques and
Collectibles, as he watched the fire from his porch.
</P>
<P>
   At least one owner had high hopes for the old building, once the
home of long underwear manufacturer Duofold, which also had sites
in Ilion and Utica. But environmental problems dogged the property.
And any renovations would have incurred a large expense.
</P>
<P>
   It fell into Herkimer County's hands in the late 1990s and had
been sold to Paula Cogen of Fitchburg, Mass. She could not be
reached late Friday.

<HEADLINE> Corzine ads confuse Pennsylvanians, overshadow their Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By CLAUDE R. MARX
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - No presidential spouse is in the race and no
one spent millions of dollars of his own money to win the party
nomination. So it is no surprise that Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate
race has dropped off the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Democratic nominee, U.S. Rep. Ron Klink.
</P>
<P>
   Some voters in the Philadelphia area told Klink's staff they
could not help him because they are committed to Jon Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Those voters have it half right.
</P>
<P>
   The former Goldman Sachs chairman saturated the Philadelphia
television market while spending $33 million, mostly from his own
pocket, to win the Democratic senate nomination in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Pennsylvania Democrats, Klink's financial
situation is worlds away from Corzine's.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, a television newscaster turned four-term congressman from
suburban Pittsburgh, had to take a second mortgage on his house to
finance his primary win. He was so cash-strapped that he did no
advertising on Philadelphia television.
</P>
<P>
   Through March 31, Klink raised $1.5 million and had only
$119,162.17 in the bank. Klink's funds include $300,000 he lent his
campaign by putting a second mortgage on his house.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., had raised $6
million through the end of March and had $3.7 million in the bank.
He benefits from the Corzine-Klink confusion. Several people have
told Pennsylvania's junior senator they want to help him because
they resent that Corzine is trying to buy a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   The financial gap, the Klink-Corzine mix-up, and Santorum's
efforts to move to the center on a range of issues, have prompted
many so-called experts to declare the election a done deal. Neither
major national party ranks the race among its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But before declaring Santorum's re-election a fait accompli, one
would do well to remember the words of the sage philosopher and New
York Yankee great Yogi Berra: ''It ain't over till it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, most voters are more concerned about where they
are going on their summer vacation than whom they will support in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Klink has made only a handful of appearances since winning
the April 4 primary. He has spent most of his time getting ready
for the fall by engaging in that time-honored political pastime,
''dialing for dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   If Klink's efforts to rebuild his bank account are successful,
he and Santorum will so saturate the airwaves in the fall that
voters will think they have known both of them for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also counting on what they call the public's
strong dislike of Santorum to help turn the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Labor Secretary Tom Foley, who finished third in
the six-candidate Democratic senate primary, said Santorum is
extremely polarizing.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he annoys people, he doesn't just annoy them, he annoys
their whole family. That's all to the good for Klink,'' Foley said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, most voters have not formed a strong opinion of
Klink, who has never run a statewide race. In Pittsburgh, he is
remembered as an amiable talking head who had a
moderate-conservative record in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That record, which includes strong opposition to both gun
control and abortion rights, will make it hard for Santorum to
portray Klink as a liberal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it is risky at best to predict in June what will
happen in November.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Plans To Curb Extremists  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan, hard pressed by the United
States to curb Islamic militants, plans to take gradual action
against extremist groups involved in religious killings and
regulate Islamic schools accused of fanning sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are doing everything to contain sectarian organizations and
also those groups which are suspected of terrorism,'' Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider told The Associated Press on Saturday.
''We have to clean our country and bring our house in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a U.S. Congressional advisory commission
asked Washington to designate Pakistan and Greece as nations ''not
cooperating fully'' with anti-terrorism efforts. Washington has
also asked Islamabad to ban extremist religious groups, including
Harakat-ul-Mujahedeen, which was declared a terrorist organization
by the United States two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of people have been killed throughout Pakistan in recent
months in tit-for-tat killings between rival Sunni Muslim and
Shiite Muslim extremists groups. Sunni Muslims, who are a majority
in Pakistan, live peacefully with their Shiite Muslim brethren. But
small extremist groups of both sects regularly clash.
</P>
<P>
   Haider, a retired general, said that the 8-month-old
military-led government has already taken several tough steps to
curb religious violence, including a ban on carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''These steps are being taken not to please the outside world,
but in the larger national interest. We want to remove the
impression that we are a soft state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to regulate an estimated 60,000
religious schools, he said. The government will introduce modern
education of science, mathematics and computers in their
curriculum, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has asked Pakistan to help persuade Afghanistan's
Taliban rulers to hand over Osama bin Laden, who is accused of
masterminding the deadly bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in
1998. Washington says he runs an international terrorist network
from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistan, one of only three countries to recognize the
Taliban government, says its influence on the Taliban is limited.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan Taliban have closed two militant training camps in
their war-battered country at Pakistan's request, Haider said.
Pakistani extremists groups' members received military training in
those camps. But he gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also started expelling foreign Muslim nationals who
came to the region fight the former Soviet Union during its
occupation of Afghanistan in 1980s, Haider said.
</P>
<P>
   Islamabad also plans to curb the free flow of people across the
border that separates Afghanistan and Pakistan by gradually
introducing travel restrictions, Haider said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no quick solutions to the problem of militancy and
terrorism, he said. ''We have to move gradually and reinforce the
authority of the law for the country's good,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspects Israel-Lebanon Border  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- A team of United Nations and Lebanese
officials verifying Israel's troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon
Saturday worked slowly along the international border, despite
pressure for a speedy conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The officials drove out in 10 U.N. vehicles in the morning to
survey the border. They stopped at points off a road near the
border on the Lebanese side and walked to the border fence or drove
along it in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Seven hours later, they had covered only three miles of terrain
beyond the 12 miles surveyed Thursday, the first day of the
verification process of the 140-mile border.
</P>
<P>
   The slow progress pushes back the deployment of U.N.
peacekeepers to the turbulent border region, where armed
anti-Israeli guerrillas have been the only real authority since
Israel pulled out last month. The 4,500-member U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon is required to secure the border under a Security
Council resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But before that happens, U.N. experts must make sure Israeli
troops are behind the new international border drawn by U.N.
cartographers following the Israeli withdrawal. No work was
conducted Friday because Lebanon objected to some parts of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The verification process resumed Saturday after the United
Nations agreed to Lebanon's demand to have a U.N. cartographer at
hand. A Russian, Vladimir Bessarabov, was assigned the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just here for technical questions if anybody has'' them,
Bessarabov told The Associated Press. But he said he was getting
few clarification requests from the Lebanese army officers who
accompanied the U.N. officials during the inspection of two
positions near the village of Yarin.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan instructed UNIFIL
to complete the verification urgently, within 24 hours, if
possible. Annan is planning a visit to the Middle East beginning
next Thursday, according to diplomatic sources at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But a Lebanese member of the verification team shrugged off
Annan's comment, saying accuracy, not speed, is required.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lebanese protesters hurled stones at the U.N. team
verifying the border on the Israeli side of the fence. But the team
did not stop the verification process, which began simultaneously
on both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   The new border, which sliced in half the Arab village of Ghajar,
has angered residents who have threatened to evict peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal ended an 18-year occupation of southern
Lebanon and the almost daily battles with Lebanese resistance
guerrillas. The occupation was aimed at protecting northern Israeli
towns from cross-border guerrilla raids.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, however, have refrained from attacking Israel
since the withdrawal. But Lebanese civilians have frequently
thronged at the border fence and hurled stones at Israeli soldiers
on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run National News Agency reported that the Lebanese
government plans to form a strike force of 1,000 army and police
troops to maintain security in areas vacated by the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
   In a Friday night report, the agency said 500 army soldiers will
be drawn from anti-terrorism and anti-espionage units as well as
military police. The rest of the force will be made up of 500
Internal Security policemen and will be under Interior Ministry
command, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Ballot Decides Who Is for Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The bottom line for municipal
elections in Montenegro's two key cities boils down to one simple
question -- who supports Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
who does not.
</P>
<P>
   A day before voters go to the polls in the capital Podgorica and
the coastal resort of Herceg Novi to choose municipal officials,
fear of an emotional explosion remained high Saturday in
Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in the two-state Yugoslav
federation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Divisions are deep in Montenegro where the least spark can
trigger a blood bath,'' said historian Rados Ratkovic. ''Our
biggest danger is our emotional creed.''
</P>
<P>
   The test comes Sunday when voters in the two key cities --
comprising almost a third of Montenegro's 600,000 population -- cast
their ballots. Although local, the elections will measure the
extent of support for Montenegro's pro-Western government under
President Milo Djukanovic, a bitter Milosevic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first challenge to Djukanovic's government since
he won 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition comprises hardline Milosevic allies who advocate
Yugoslav patriotism and closer ties with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins -- proud highlanders bound by tradition and tribal
history -- are known for feuds started by less than a difference in
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is taken far too seriously,'' says Melita Rastoder,
19, a student volunteer in an independent monitoring group, CEMI.
Her generation, she claims, is pressured by the elderly and parents
for whom politics is a matter of ''catastrophic importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratkovic, a political science professor, estimates that 49
percent of the voters unwaveringly back Djukanovic. The Montenegrin
president has steered a tentative course to independence in
everything but name, falling short of outright secession to avoid a
possible armed conflict with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Ratkovic says the votes of about 30 percent of the electorate
still undecided are needed to solidify Djukanovic's grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up to the election has been characterized by a heated
campaign by Milosevic's allies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montenegro's only future is one of togetherness with Serbia,''
says Predrag Bulatovic, the pro-Belgrade camp's candidate for
Podgorica mayor. His group has pushed the ''historic brotherhood''
of Serbs and Montenegrins and has echoed Milosevic's defiance of
the West, which bombed Yugoslavia during NATO's 78-day bombing
campaign last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government claims Milosevic's supporters are
fomenting the divisions, pitting locally stationed federal army
troops loyal to Milosevic against the police, who answer to
Djukanovic.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups have had previous close calls. Last Wednesday, in
the village of Berane, the army positioned a platoon outside the
local police station after the arrest of two soldiers who had
reportedly harassed villagers. The soldiers were later released and
the army withdrew.

<HEADLINE> London Pedestrian Bridge Holds Sway  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- London opened its first footbridge across the
Thames River Saturday, a graceful suspension structure designed to
sway in the wind. For some walkers, it turned out to be more like a
thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you need to take your seasickness pills before
crossing,'' said Margaret Vint, 60. ''I wouldn't recommend it if
you are feeling at all tipsy.''
</P>
<P>
   Police restricted access to the Millennium Bridge Saturday
afternoon to give the bridge a chance to settle down, and engineers
checked whether the 1,090-foot suspension bridge was moving more
than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Somerville, 52, who crossed with her 11-year-old daughter,
Rachel, said the bridge was beautiful but ''the walk across was
very hair-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like doing the cake walk -- we were looking at each
other asking 'Is it supposed to do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   The engineering firm of Ove Arup and Partners said the bridge
was designed to stand up to gales of 85 mph, with a lateral motion
of no more than about 14 inches at the center. On Saturday, winds
in London were about 11 mph, the Meteorological Office said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awful this morning when there were hundreds of people
on it,'' said Alison Buckley, 37. ''It's taken me a full hour to
get my balance back.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge is the heart of a new pedestrian corridor starting
outside the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral and crossing the river to
the Tate Modern art gallery, which recently opened inside a
converted power station. Planners expect it to carry 4 million
people per year.
</P>
<P>
   Before its opening, the Millennium Bridge had been praised for
its innovative design.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial published Saturday in The Guardian newspaper
delighted in the lightness of the span: ''You hover above the water
as if hanging in the basket of a hot-air balloon. And you realize
what a beautiful city London can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Road bridges across the Thames have walkways, but visitors may
find it difficult to find the access. Once on a bridge they have to
contend with the noise and fumes of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The new Millennium Bridge was a cooperative effort among Foster
and Partners architects, sculptor Sir Anthony Caro and Ove Arup and
Partners. It was the winning entry among 226 entries in a worldwide
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for the $27.3 million project included a grant of $5.2
million from the Bridge House Estates Trust Fund. It traces its
origins to the 11th century when a tax was imposed to help repair
London Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   That wooden bridge was replaced in the 12th century by a stone
structure which not only carried traffic, but was jammed with shops
and houses. Rents from those properties, bridge tolls and tolls
from ships passing under the bridge were collected by the fund,
along with bequests ''to God and the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bridge House Estates Trust Fund was tapped for the
construction of Tower Bridge, which was completed in 1894 and was
the last Thames bridge before this one.

on Saturday praised Lithuania's efforts in bidding for NATO
membership, and stressed the importance of a good relationship with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lithuania's determination to lift its military capability to
work productively with NATO and improve relations with Russia are
very important steps on a long and difficult staircase to possible
NATO membership,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, for a one-day
meeting with defense ministers from the Baltic region -- an annual
event focusing on security issues, including NATO expansion and
regional security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen outlined Washington's tentative plans for a limited
missile defense system to protect against attacks by ''rogue
nations,'' the meeting's press officer Jolanda Andriuekiene said.
The Russians and some NATO allies have opposed the missile defense
plan, saying it would breach the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
and tip the world balance of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is important that the Baltic states, the European community
and NATO itself seek to find ways in which we can collaborate on
many levels with Russia,'' Cohen told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's European tour, which included stops in Belgium and
Sweden, was to culminate next week in Moscow, where he planned to
meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania -- along with its Baltic neighbors, Latvia and Estonia
-- have made NATO membership a top priority, and hoped to win
invitations to the defense alliance by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has vigorously opposed the Baltics' membership in NATO,
saying it would consider NATO's relationship with the three former
Soviet republics a threat to Russian security. Critics have said
the tiny countries, nestled between the northern Baltic Sea and
Russia, are too vulnerable militarily and would weaken the
19-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to keeping NATO's door
open, but offered no specifics.
</P>
<P>
   ''No nation should be excluded from NATO membership because of
the geography or history. It should be clear that Russia does not
have a veto over NATO decisions,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Mob Boss Recaptured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy (AP) -- Police have recaptured one of Italy's
most-wanted criminals -- a convicted mob boss who escaped from a
crowded courtroom two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Police stormed a fortified villa outside Naples during the night
and surprised Ferdinando Cesarano as he was eating dinner on the
terrace.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, announced Saturday, was hailed as a victory in the
long battle against the Neapolitan mob, the Camorra. Interior
Minister Enzo Bianco flew to Naples on Saturday to congratulate the
officers who captured Cesarano.
</P>
<P>
   The head of one of the most powerful Camorra clans, Cesarano
escaped from a courtroom in the southern city of Salerno two years
ago while court was in session.
</P>
<P>
   The escape was stunning. A hole had been cut in the floor of the
high-security cage inside the courtroom where the defendants sat
during their trial. The hole led to a tunnel -- and freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Already serving life sentences for mob-related crimes, Cesarano
was one of dozens of defendants in the trial.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs Mark Bombing Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By DRAGAN ILIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Vowing to prevent further wars in
Yugoslavia, an army general and several officials on Saturday
marked the first anniversary of the end of NATO's 78-day air attack
in this mining town, where Allied bombs killed 19 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 people attended the ceremony -- called ''Memory and
Hope'' -- which is to become an annual event commemorating the day
NATO suspended its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the crowd, the Yugoslav army's chief of staff, Gen.
Nebojsa Pavkovic, blasted the United States and NATO for their
''cowardly aggression'' in the air raids, and promised his troops
would prevent any further wars in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The army ''is united, firm and combat-ready to prevent any
secessionist scenarios from Yugoslavia,'' he said, referring to
Montenegro, Serbia's pro-Western partner in today's Yugoslavia.
''We will do our utmost to stop the civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   Pavkovic also announced a reorganization of the army, seriously
crippled during the bombing. ''Our armed forces will be reformed
into a smaller, modern and ubiquitous force,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic attended the
service, including his wife, Mirjana Markovic, Serbia's Premier
Mirko Marjanovic and Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic. The state
sponsored several other anniversary ceremonies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1999 bombing campaign, Aleksinac was hit on seven
different occasions, including an April 5 attack on an apartment
complex that killed 17 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched its air war to stop Milosevic's crackdown on armed
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. After more than two months of daily
bombing raids, Milosevic caved in to NATO demands and pulled Serb
troops and police out of the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a NATO-led peace force entered Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Serbia's largest opposition party, Vuk Draskovic's
Serbian Renewal Movement, announced Saturday it would not
participate in this year's elections unless Milosevic's regime
stopped its crackdown against the opposition, student groups and
independent media.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the cessation of state terror, violence, lawlessness,
and without the return of all independent media to its rightful
owners, there will be preconditions for democratic elections in
Serbia,'' a party statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Saturday arrested dozens of opposition activists in
several Serbian towns, Beta news agency reported. Ten activists of
the opposition Democratic Party were detained in the southeastern
town of Zajecar, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Though all but two were released after one hour of
interrogation, police beat one activist and harassed a female
lawyer who was seven months pregnant, said Cedomir Jovanovic, of
the Democratic Party.

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges Web in Rural Areas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the world increasingly reliant on high
technology, Republican-led efforts in Congress to ensure access
have improved the lives of Americans who live in rural areas,
Montana Sen. Conrad Burns said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''No question about it -- high tech touches virtually every area
of our daily lives,'' the Republican chairman of the Senate
Commerce communications subcommittee said in the weekly GOP radio
address. ''The surest way for my home state of Montana, and for the
rest of rural America, to participate in the country's economic
prosperity is through high tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is close to passing legislation that would make it
easier to authenticate online signatures, he said. ''That will make
it easier for any American who wants to transact business online,
but especially folks in rural America,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   When court decisions threatened the availability of local
television signals on satellite dishes in rural areas, Burns said
the Republicans stepped in with the Satellite Home Viewers act.
</P>
<P>
   ''With ... broadcasts and cable delivery limited by geography
and distance, many rural viewers depend on satellite TV,'' Burns
said. ''The satellite providers told us only the largest markets
would receive ... local-to-local service. Working together with
other high tech leaders in the House and Senate, we came up with a
commonsense response.''
</P>
<P>
   Touching on Internet privacy, Burns said the Federal
Communications Commission would be ''too restrictive'' if it
regulated online privacy, but he doubted the Internet industry can
regulate itself.
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans are working on ''a plan that will instill
consumer trust without cutting off the flow of electronic
commerce.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks at Last Commencement  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- It was President Clinton's last
commencement address, and he offered a sober message Saturday to
graduates of a private liberal arts college where annual costs
exceed $29,000: ''Our country cannot afford to leave any students
behind simply because they can't afford to pay for college.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past 20 years, the cost of college has quadrupled,''
Clinton told 423 graduates of Carleton College, about 40 miles
south of Minneapolis. ''I'll bet there are a lot of parents here
who have taken second mortgages or second jobs to help pay those
tuition bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, clad in cap and gown, strode before the crowd of about
6,000 people in this sleepy community whose motto is ''The City of
Cows, Colleges and Contentment.'' He threw his head back and
laughed when he noticed a life-sized cardboard cutout of himself
that someone waved in the audience. During his talk, he joked about
how someone had painted his likeness on a water tower. ''I still
kind of wish you hadn't painted it over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mood, however, was dampened by the news of the death of
Syrian President Hafez Assad. As he sat on the dais waiting to
deliver his speech, Clinton was handed a note, confirming Assad's
death on Saturday. But he did not mention the 69-year-old
president's death in his talk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he focused on his administration's work to make higher
education more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   He touted the administration's Direct Student Loan program,
saying it had lowered the cost of borrowing for students by
allowing them to get loans directly through the government without
a financial institution acting as a middle man. He boasted about
expanding the Pell Grant program and creating the $1,500 HOPE
Scholarship tax credit to make the first two years of college as
universal as high school.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on Congress to approve a measure that would let
families claim a tax deduction worth up to $2,800 for up to $10,000
in college tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''As student aid has increased, so has college attendance, now
to record levels,'' he said. ''Two-thirds of our high school
graduates go straight to college -- that's an all-time high. And for
the first time in history, a majority of young African Americans
are enrolling in higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce, said he was disappointed
that the president would use a commencement speech to advance a
''misguided political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said the Direct Student Loan program, for example, had
many administrative problems the president failed to mention in his
speech. And he said that Congress had not acted on the president's
elementary and secondary school proposals because of their ''big
government, Washington-knows-best mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's 23rd commencement address since taking office
in 1993, and his third this year. Clinton has already spoken this
year at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn. and at
Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   During his one-day Minnesota visit, Clinton also was to address
a Democratic National Convention luncheon and attend a Soul Asylum
rock concert and Democratic Party fund-raiser, both in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address on Saturday, Clinton announced new
regulations by the Labor Department that would allow states to
provide paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child. He also
announced a new regulation, effective June 20, that allows federal
employees to use up to 12 weeks of sick leave to care for a
seriously ill family member.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think no American should ever have to choose between the job
they need and the parent or child they love,'' Clinton said. ''The
actions we take today will help to ensure that they won't have to
make that choice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma
complained that the new regulations will ''shred the safety net for
the unemployed'' by raiding unemployment insurance trust funds.
''This is an ill-conceived plan,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rock Band Motorhead Members Arrested  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- To fans of the heavy-metal band Motorhead, louder
is better.
</P>
<P>
   But the racket the band made in the hallway of a hotel at 4:30
a.m. Friday had a less enthusiastic audience.
</P>
<P>
   Mikkey Dee and two members of the English band's entourage were
arrested after a disturbance at a Holiday Inn in downtown Denver.
</P>
<P>
   A guest at the hotel called security when he was awakened by
pounding on his door and screaming outside.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to be an isolated incident that resulted from the
band member's intoxication,'' explained a Holiday Inn spokewoman,
noting the band apparently was in the hotel bar until closing at 2
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they forgot which room they were in. They thought it
was their own.''

<HEADLINE> Man in Eminem Flap Files Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mich. (AP) -- The man who Grammy-winning rapper Eminem
allegedly pulled a gun on for kissing his wife has sued the
musician, saying he still fears for his life, days after the
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   John Guerra said Friday, ''It was the scariest moment of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerra's lawsuit, which seeks an unspecified amount in damages,
accuses Eminem of hitting him in the head and face in the June 4
encounter. Guerra alleges that the rapper told him twice ''I'm
going to kill you'' as they struggled for control of the gun, which
wasn't loaded.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutors charged Eminem, whose real name is Marshall
Bruce Mathers III, with carrying a concealed weapon and assault
with a deadly weapon, both felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Guerra told reporters that he was on the receiving end of the
kiss from Kimberly Mathers, which he described as ''rather
intimate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were embracing. She gave me a kiss and the next thing I
hear is 'Gun, gun, gun!''' Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, Eminem was charged in a nearby county with
felony possession of a concealed weapon and misdemeanor brandishing
of a firearm. Prosecutors say he pulled a handgun during a dispute
with a member of another rap group outside a stereo shop.
</P>
<P>
   Eminem is free on bond in both cases.

<HEADLINE> Ebert Lauds School on Siskel Center  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The decision by the The School of the Art
Institute of Chicago to rename its film center after the late film
critic Gene Siskel has received two thumbs up from Roger Ebert, his
former partner.
</P>
<P>
   Ebert, who is leading a $5 million campaign to pay for new
facilities at the center, says Siskel also would have given the
decision rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gene Siskel loved movies and he loved the Film Center of the
School of the Art Institute,'' Ebert said. ''A cinematheque in the
heart of the Loop would have had his enthusiastic support.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will include two theaters equipped with Dolby
surround sound, custom-designed lighting and teleconferencing
capabilities. It also will have a restaurant, a lobby gallery and a
concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   Siskel died last year at age 53 from complications following
surgery to remove a growth from his brain in May.
</P>
<P>
   The Film Center, founded in 1972, presents premieres of new
American and foreign films, revivals of classics, retrospectives
and festivals.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Rages on in Congo  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Ugandan and Rwandan troops fought street
battles and traded artillery rounds in this Congo River port on
Saturday, as U.N. military observers tried to secure yet another
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan forces requested a truce starting Saturday evening,
apparently so their troops could withdraw across the Tshopo River
Bridge north of Kisangani, where they have tried for six days
unsuccessfully to mount a siege.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan troops controlled most of the port, including two
airports and the city center. Rwandan army officials said they had
pushed Ugandan units away from the city's Tshopo district and
toward the bridge. The claim could not be confirmed by U.N.
military observers.
</P>
<P>
   A cease-fire would give both armies enough time to withdraw and
spare the 200,000 trapped Congolese civilians further death and
destruction. At least 150 people have been killed and 700 wounded
since Monday, the Red Cross said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a humanitarian crisis. We want to have a cease-fire
with a compromise by the both local commanders to withdraw their
troops,'' said Lt. Col. Danilo Paiva, head of the 22-strong U.N.
observer team. ''A cease-fire without a withdrawal cannot hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan Col. Karenzi Karake said his troops were ready to quit
Kisangani, but not under fire from the Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, dawn on Saturday signaled a renewed battle for
survival in the besieged city, as residents scurried to fetch water
from the chocolate-colored Congo River, and others scrounged for
food amid the rising din of mortar and machine-gun fire. Running
water and power have been cut off for six days.
</P>
<P>
   Thick smoke billowed up from the barrels of Rwandan guns firing
from the Congo River bank, drawing occasional response from the
Ugandans, who fired back at the city. Both sides used multiple
rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. observers blamed local Rwandan and Ugandan army commanders
for failing to heed a cease-fire they had agreed to at least 20
times since Monday. On Thursday, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, ordered the armies to
stop firing, but the clashes have continued.
</P>
<P>
   ''African armies are like that. They fight for their chiefs, not
for their nations,'' said U.N. Maj. Ramadan Sissoko, of Mali.
</P>
<P>
   Both armies were withdrawing from the city under a prearranged
plan Monday when the fighting broke out. Since then, 6,000 mortar
shells have fallen on the city, U.N. observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda are both in Congo because of their involvement
in the central African country's 22-month civil war. The two were
nominal allies, backing rival rebel factions fighting to oust Congo
President Laurent Kabila. But since August they have clashed with
each other in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's peace accord, signed by the various armies in
Congo's civil war, U.N. observers are to be reinforced by a
5,537-strong peacekeeping force. So far, though, only 100 U.N.
personnel have been deployed.

<HEADLINE> With BC-CT--Snack Tax-Glance  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Like fat creeping up on a person's
thighs, a penny tax on junk food and soda would be little-noticed
at first but have long-term impact, two researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The tax could generate $1.8 billion annually for programs in
schools and communities to teach people to eat healthy and
exercise, according to Yale professor Kelly Brownell and Michael
Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest.
</P>
<P>
   A paper by the researchers in the June issue of the American
Journal of Public Health notes that dozens of states and
municipalities already tax snacks and soft drinks, although most of
the money does not pay for health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The food industry derides the notion of junk food taxes, never
even realizing or acknowledging more than a dozen states already
collect these taxes, and the states collect a billion dollars a
year,'' said Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''snack tax'' or ''Twinkie tax'' is opposed by the
food industry and by grocers, who have to collect the tax. Some
states that have enacted such taxes later repealed them.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of candy, baked snacks, soda and other goodies that would
fall under the tax say their products are perfectly all right for
someone to consume in moderation, as part of a balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is inherently wrong about eating an Oreo?'' asked Hank
Sandbach, vice president of public relations for cookiemaker
Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe moderation and balance and variety are key to good
nutrition, not selecting certain foods and giving them labels,''
Sandbach said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax revenue would help counter ads for junk food, sodas and
candy that bombard consumers, said Brownell, a psychology professor
who heads the Yale Center for Eating and Weight Disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are tipping the scales at ever-heavier weights - a
situation that calls for bold measures, Brownell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're facing is a crisis with respect to poor diet and
weight. The prevalence of obesity in the U.S. is rapidly rising,
and there's no sign of the prevalence slowing,'' he said. ''The
disease and death caused by this is staggering, and I haven't heard
a single good idea of how to turn this around other than through
public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper proposes a penny tax per 12-ounce can of soda, and a
penny tax per pound of candy, chips, snack foods and fats and oils.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike large sin taxes on alcohol or cigarettes that are
designed to discourage consumption, a small tax may be more
politically feasible and would mostly go unnoticed by the public,
the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   This approach seems to work in states such as Arkansas, where a
two-cent tax per can of soda and $2 per gallon tax of soft drink
syrup generates $40 million annually for Medicaid, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The study leaves legislatures to decide exactly what could be
taxed and how the revenue would be collected.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a question of whether the public would go for such
a tax.
</P>
<P>
   Brownell said the public would be more willing to accept the tax
if they knew the money was going toward public health. Taxes in
some states have failed, in part because the tax was enacted just
to find another way for the government to make money.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone poll last year conducted for the Washington
D.C.-based Center for Science in the Public Interest found that 45
percent of those polled would favor a one-cent or five-cent tax to
fund a national health program. About 53 percent of those polled
opposed the tax at either amount.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't imagine that for somebody who likes their snacks, a
nutrition program is something they're going to vote for,'' said
Nabisco's Sandbach.
</P>
<P>
   Lunchtime eaters were divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Ullman of Hamden, an occupational therapist, said people
in the inner city need nutrition information to help them live
better, but she did not know if a snack tax would have other
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they better do a pilot study first, because lots of
inner city people have problems getting healthful food - they have
enough money for a bag of chips, but they may not have enough for
other food,'' Ullman said.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Brown, a New Haven truck driver, was puzzled by the very
idea of a snack tax as he picked up a bag of chips and a large Coke
for lunch at a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tax my chips? Tax my Coke? I don't like the sound of that,''
Brown said.

<HEADLINE> 14 Detained on Vieques Bombing Range  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Military security agents detained
14 people Saturday morning for trespassing on the U.S. Navy bombing
range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The group was taken to Naval station Roosevelt Roads on the main
island of Puerto Rico, Navy spokesman Robert Nelson said. They were
not charged, but were cited to appear before a federal judge at an
undetermined date before being released a few hours later, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested was a former director of the U.S.
territory's local Administration of Courts, Euladio Torres.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the group entered the bombing range at about 9:45 p.m.
Friday, and were walking on the main road of the Navy's Camp Garcia
base when they were detained, said Vieques activist Robert Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   The activity was meant to draw attention to opposition of Navy
bombing on the island and ''make the normal functioning of military
activities inside Camp Garcia impossible,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, protesters had camped out on the bombing range
for nearly a year following a bombing accident that killed a
civilian security guard. On May 4, U.S. marshals raided the camps
and arrested more than 200 protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Since then dozens have been detained for trespassing, including
a group of 25 protesters and six journalists detained June 1 and
charged with trespassing on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy resumed bombing with concrete-filled dummy bombs
shortly after the May 4 raid. Islanders are to decide in a
referendum whether the Navy should leave in 2003, or stay longer
and resume using live ammunition. The referendum has yet to be
scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Bodies Said Found at Mexico Border  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Authorities recovered the bodies of two
people who drowned in the Rio Grande just yards from U.S. border
agents in a dramatic scene captured on Mexican television, the
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews on Friday found the bodies of 26-year-old Walter
Maria Sandoval, of San Lucas, Michoacan, and another victim who has
not been identified yet, the government news agency Notimex
reported.
</P>
<P>
   A Televisa TV crew was filming in Matamoros on Thursday, when
three men plunged into the Rio Grande and tried to swim back to
Mexico after a Border Patrol squad apparently blocked their entry
into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men quickly began flailing and sinking, as the
river's current swept them away. The third man made it ashore on
the Mexican side and ran off, Televisa reported.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. border patrol agents and Mexican authorities both saw the
men drown -- but none knew how to swim, the Mexico City newspaper
Reforma reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Border Patrol and Mexican migrant protection patrol,
Grupo Beta, met Friday in Matamoros, across the border from
Brownsville, Texas, to talk about better rescue training for
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Mexicans have drowned in recent years in the Rio
Grande, a point of entry for thousands of illegal immigrants to the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Confident on Burundi Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Former President Nelson
Mandela, who is acting as a peace mediator in Burundi, said
Saturday he was confident that some of the problems still plaguing
the war-torn country will be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela was scheduled to travel Monday to Burundi for three days
to meet political dissidents and visit so-called regroupment camps,
where the Tutsi-led government has herded Hutu villagers displaced
by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with Mandela on Wednesday in Johannesburg,
Burundi president Pierre Buyoya agreed to close down the
regroupment camps by July 31. The camps have garnered international
condemnation, and Mandela had called them concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue of political prisoners remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said Saturday he was confident the political prisoners
would be released. Mandela, himself a former political prisoner,
said he strongly disapproved of the ongoing incarceration of
''innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela also said that Wednesday's agreement to give Tutsis and
Hutus equal representation in the army might need some tweaking. As
of now the army is Tutsi-dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu rebels originally demanded that they make up 70 percent
of the military, a demand Mandela called impractical.
</P>
<P>
   At least 200,000 people -- Hutus and Tutsis -- have been killed in
Burundi since October 1993, when paratroopers from the minority
Tutsi community assassinated the county's first democratically
elected president, a Hutu.

<HEADLINE> Down the drain: pinball machines disappearing  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - TILT! Game over?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. But the venerable pinball machine, once the
undisputed arcade king from the Jersey Shore boardwalks to the
Santa Monica Pier, is certainly down to its last ball.
</P>
<P>
   In the computerized, digitalized world of high-tech
entertainment, the pinball machine now clings to a diminishing
niche. Of the big four companies that once cranked out 100,000
glitzy machines a year, only one survives - and it produces a
fraction of that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the proudly made-in-the-U.S.A. pinball machine -
''as American as apple pie,'' as one arcade owner notes - now finds
its biggest market in France, where it's as popular as snails and
Jerry Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   What is the world coming to?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame,'' says Walt Levine, a 25-year industry veteran,
offering an oft-echoed opinion. ''This could be a thing of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't say that around the last bastion of pinball optimism:
suburban Melrose Park, Ill., home of the family-owned Stern
Pinball. Company president Gary Stern believes his business can
keep the flippers flailing where others have failed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We no longer talk about how we're the last man standing,''
says Stern, a friendly sort who's quick with a quip or a wisecrack.
''Now we just talk about how we intend to be around for a long time
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's is a lonely voice above the revving motors, soaring
spacecraft and Dolby sounds that accompany the new generation of
arcade games. Many in the industry wonder if the pinball machine's
future is draining away, its silver ball headed south toward
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Haim, co-owner of the Long Island-based pinball distributor
R.H. Belam company, has watched pinball's steady decline. His
father founded the business in 1946; his son, Daniel, is a law
school student and unlikely successor to the clan's pinball
wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt he'll go into this business,'' the elder Haim says.
''His generation is part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a generation raised on virtual reality and Sony
PlayStation, a generation that views the pinball machine as an
anachronism - a '58 Edsel barely putt-putt-putting into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a new generation brought up on games off their
computers,'' shrugs Levine. ''The pinball player maybe played in
college, or in a local bar. That's in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine speaks while standing inside the future - Broadway City,
a three-level collection of more than 200 high-tech arcade games.
In a cramped second-floor room, obscured by the new big-ticket
games, sit a half-dozen pinball machines.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekday afternoon, the machines are idle. And stay that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an accommodation to the past,'' Levine acknowledges,
standing alongside a vintage ''Addams Family'' machine and a newer
''South Park'' game. ''It doesn't make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The pinball game was never merely about money. To die-hard
players, it was the stuff of both poetry and patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ''As American as apple pie,'' says Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside songwriter Bruce Springsteen, once a regular at the
Casino Amusements in Asbury Park, recalled the halcyon days of
pinball in his 1974 song ''4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy).''
</P>
<P>
   The ''wizards play down on Pinball Way,'' the Boss sang
wistfully, ''on the boardwalk way past dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days. These days, the Asbury boardwalk is devoid
of both people and pinball.
</P>
<P>
   The pinball machine debuted in 1931, a hardy device initially
named ''Ballyhoo.''
</P>
<P>
   It quickly became a hit in most places. That didn't include New
York, where the game was illegal until 1976. In 1941, Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia made headlines when he supervised the dumping of
pinball machines into the East River.
</P>
<P>
   Over the seven decades that followed its invention, pinball's
popularity waxed and waned. The late '70s were a boom time, the
mid-'80s a rough stretch, the early '90s a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Epstein, founder of the Professional and Amateur Pinball
Association, began hosting a national pinball championship in 1990.
Competitors vied for thousands in prize money inside Manhattan's
funky Lone Star Roadhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the good times, there were already bad signs for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each time it peaked, it peaked a little less,'' Haim says.
''And the valleys started to become a little deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when the pinball machine was successfully fighting the
video challenge, 100,000 pinball machines were sold worldwide. Last
year, that figure was about 12,000 - a near-90 percent drop-off in
just seven years.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, like targets zapped with a quick wrist flick, the
pinball makers disappeared. Bally Manufacturing sold off its
pinball division in 1988. Last November, WMS Industries said
goodbye after its pinball division lost $17.8 million in the last
three fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   The pinball championships quietly disappeared, too.
</P>
<P>
   Where did it all go wrong? Folks in the business offer these
explanations:
</P>
<P>
   - Rather than staying old school, the companies tried to compete
with video games. ''They gave pinball lots of glitz and gizmos,''
Levine offers. ''But they had games with very little soul.''
</P>
<P>
   - The new, souped-up machines required expensive, time-consuming
repairs when they broke. A video game ordinarily needed just a
quick wipe with a dust rag.
</P>
<P>
   - The return on the games was insufficient. In 1976, a game of
pinball cost 25 cents and a machine ran about $2,000. In 1990, the
cost was still 25 cents; the price of a machine had doubled to
$4,000.
</P>
<P>
   When all the arcade dust settled, Stern was the last pinball
production company in the world. But when Gary Stern looks into the
future, he sees a vision of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pinball is sort of retro, which is a big word these days,''
Stern says. ''Retro is the 'in' thing. Think of a cool 1978 VW
Beetle - that's nostalgia. But a brand-new Beetle - that's retro.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine, despite his doubts about the future of the games, agrees
with Stern's vision: ''If he's saying retro, he's on the right
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern no longer sees his business selling to places like
Broadway City, which bills itself as ''a family entertainment
center.'' He believes the new mantra for pinball machines is
''street locations'' - movie theaters, bars, restaurants, cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Haim agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''In bars, especially in shot-and-a-beer joints, they still have
pinball machines,'' said Haim - places like the subterranean
Siberia bar, tucked inside the 50th Street subway station in
midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There, in a dank back room, owner Tracy Westmoreland oversees a
steady stream of ''pinheads'' lining up to bang away at a vintage
Addams Family machine.
</P>
<P>
   Targets fall, lights flash, and Westmoreland smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes a lot of money,'' the bar owner says. ''People come
in from all over the place to play it all the time. They say it's
the best machine.''

<HEADLINE> Greece Seeks Ex-CIA Chief Testimony  </HEADLINE>
By DEREK GATOPOULOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek court summoned a former Central
Intelligence Agency director to testify, as efforts to track down
the killers of a British diplomat generated little success,
authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A public prosecutor wants to interview James Woolsey after the
former spymaster reportedly suggested that members of Greece's
Socialist government could identify terrorists in the November 17
group, but had done nothing to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   The November 17 group claimed responsibility for slaying Brig.
Stephen Saunders in Athens on Thursday, prompting strong U.S.
criticism over Greece's dismal record of catching urban guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorist group has killed 22 people, including four
American officials, since 1975, but none of its members have ever
been caught.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey, who ran the CIA from 1993 to 1995, said in the weekly
satirical newspaper Pontiki on Thursday: ''I believe there are
people in the Greek government who know certain members of November
17. Absolutely nothing has been done.''
</P>
<P>
   State spokesman Dimitris Reppas described Woolsey's summons as
''a very significant step'' in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever turns against the Greek government in this manner must
be called upon to produce (evidence) so that we know why such
claims are being made against our country,'' Reppas told state-run
NET television.
</P>
<P>
   NET television said prosecutor Yannis Diotis, who issued the
summons, was ready to travel to the United States to interview
Woolsey.
</P>
<P>
   Police sources said Saturday that witness and evidence
examinations had failed to produce results on Saunders' shooting.
The motorcycle used by the two attackers has not been found.
Anti-terrorism investigators from Britain's Scotland Yard were in
Athens to help with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Public Order Minister Michalis Chrisohoidis denied media reports
that American agencies had given him a list of possible November 17
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The government has shown willingness to change court procedure
in terrorism trials and to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement
agencies -- a move Greek critics have said could give Washington too
much involvement in Greek affairs.

<HEADLINE> State, union agree to tentative contract long overdue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki announced Saturday that
the state and the Public Employees Federation have agreed to a
tentative contract.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for a 3-percent raise retroactive to
October, another 3 percent retroactive to April, another 3.5
percent in April and 3.5 percent more in April 2002, according to
the state. The pact would include a $500 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The deal still must be approved by the executive board and
members of the union that represents more than 50,000 state
workers. Those votes could take a month, PEF officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to thank the PEF membership, and the leaders of our
union, as well as our international unions the American Federation
of Teachers (AFT) and the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU), who stood shoulder to shoulder with us during these long
negotiations,'' said PEF President Roger E. Benson. ''This
agreement meets the unique needs of our members.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that PEF is now expected to join the Civil Service
Employees Association to support legislation Pataki seeks to amend
the retirement law. The law change would allow for no contribution
by employees to Tier 3 and Tier 4 after 10 years of service
effective Oct. 1. It would also provide Tier 1 and Tier 2 employees
(most of the state's oldest retirees) with one month of retirement
service credit per year worked, up to 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   PEF officials said the major sticking point in negotiations
involved the use of electronic timekeeping methods.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement would preserve the members protections against
the use of such records for disciplinary purposes, according to PEF
officials. The proposed pact also includes some changes in health
benefits, including an increase in office visit co-pays from $8 to
$10 to $12 per visit, and a reduction in the cost of generic
prescription drugs from $8 to $5. The cost for brand name
prescriptions would increase from $8 to $15. Dental benefits would
also be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   PEF and the state have been without a contract since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The union represents 54,000 white-collar workers - in
professional, scientific and technical fields.

<HEADLINE> Taliban: Afghanistan Needs Aid  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- The ruling Taliban criticized the
United States and Russia on Saturday for considering new
U.N.-sponsored sanctions against Afghanistan, which it said was
suffering enough from drought and war.
</P>
<P>
   A Taliban Foreign Ministry statement said Afghanistan's people
need international aid, not more sanctions -- which were proposed
because of the country's alleged support of terrorist networks and
continued refusal to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden
for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations imposed limited sanctions in November to
punish Taliban rulers for refusing to hand bin Laden to the United
States or a third country to stand trial for allegedly
masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have refused to budge so far, saying bin Laden is a
guest and fellow Muslim. They have, however, assured that bin Laden
has been prohibited from carrying out terrorist activities from
Afghan soil.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has accused Afghanistan of sponsoring terrorism and
helping rebels the separatist region of Chechnya. Last month,
Moscow threatened airstrikes against the Central Asian country.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban denied Russia's allegations, and Saturday's
statement reiterated that the Taliban were not sponsoring or
supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Afghans have been devastated by drought and economic hardship,
especially since the Soviet Union's invasion and foreign
interference in the 1980s, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand the reason of Russian hostilities,'' the
statement said. ''But the United States, which helped us in
defeating Russia, should refrain from any action against
Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in 1979 in an effort to prop
up a faltering pro-Moscow communist regime. Russian forces were
withdrawn a decade later after a bitter war with Afghan mujahedeen
-- or holy warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban rule almost 90 percent of the country, including its
capital, Kabul. Northern-based opposition forces control the
remainder of the country.

<HEADLINE> Ex Pro-Israelis Sentenced to Jail  </HEADLINE>
By HUSSEIN DAKROUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- A pro-Israeli militiaman who shot and
killed a guerrilla after capturing him and another who served in a
notorious prison camp in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon were
sentenced by military court to up to 15 years in jail, the toughest
punishment in the ongoing trials of Lebanese who dealt with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The court heard 72 cases Friday and decided on the cases of 36
suspects, eight of them women.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 36 was acquitted, and a woman was sentenced in
absentia to two years in jail. Thirty-four other defendants who
appeared in court were found guilty of charges of collaboration,
passing on information to the enemy, joining the South Lebanon Army
militia or entering Israel. They received prison terms ranging from
one month to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Still technically at war with Israel, Lebanon prohibits any
dealings with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers for the third group of militiamen to be tried
had called for acquittals or lenient sentences, saying their
clients were coerced or forced into collaborating with Israel,
court officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentences included the toughest since the trials began
Monday amid an uproar from guerrilla groups that the court went
soft on the first two batches of suspects.
</P>
<P>
   In the late Friday sentences, a former militiaman who shot dead
a guerrilla he captured during one of the attacks during the
18-year Israeli occupation received the toughest punishment -- 15
years in jail. He also was banned from returning to his hometown in
the former Israeli-occupied zone for 15 years after serving his
prison term.
</P>
<P>
   Another former militiaman received a 10-year prison sentence and
a 15-year banishment from his hometown after he serves his
sentence. He was convicted of collaboration, meeting with Israeli
military officers and passing information to the enemy. He also
served 18 months at the Khiam prison camp, where thousands of
people suspected of anti-Israeli or anti-SLA activities were held
without trial for years.
</P>
<P>
   The prison's 145 inmates were freed by villagers after the SLA
collapsed the day before Israeli troops withdrew from southern
Lebanon on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have long accused the SLA of using torture
to punish Khiam inmates or to extract information from them.
</P>
<P>
   Two other ex-militiamen, an officer and an intelligence agent,
received a seven-year prison sentence each.
</P>
<P>
   Two more were sentenced to three years imprisonment, nine got
two years in jail, two received an 18-month term each and 14 were
sent to prison for a year. An architect who worked with the
occupation's civil administration was sentenced to six months in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The court, whose verdicts cannot be appealed, already has
sentenced 101 former militiamen to jail terms of up to five years.
Anti-Israeli guerrillas have viewed the sentences as lenient;
relatives of the accused and some politicians have called them too
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,500 former SLA members surrendered to Lebanese
authorities during and after Israel's troop withdrawal last month
from southern Lebanon. About 7,000 Lebanese -- ex-militiamen and
their families -- sought refuge in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Paid Leave Guidelines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton opened the door Saturday for
states to provide unemployment pay to workers who take unpaid time
off to care for a newborn child or sick relative, expanding an
already popular Family Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton announced new regulations
by the Labor Department that would allow states to provide paid
leave after the birth or adoption of a child. He also announced a
new regulation, effective June 20, that allows federal employees to
use up to 12 weeks of sick leave to care for a seriously ill family
member.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he sought the changes because many workers cannot
afford to take time off without pay as stipulated under the 1993
Family and Medical Leave Act, the first bill he signed as
president.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that 20 million people have taken advantage of the law
to care for a newborn or a sick relative, and said more might do so
if they didn't have to lose pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many families that aren't making use of the law
because they simply can't afford to take the time off if it means
sacrificing a paycheck,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen states are considering legislation to provide paid leave
through means such as unemployment insurance, and the president
said he hopes more states will join them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe those which do can provide this new benefit while
still preserving the fiscal soundness of their unemployment
insurance programs,'' Clinton said. ''The first few months with a
newborn are precious ones, and no parent should have to miss
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, whose state is
considering a proposal to provide paid leave through unemployment
insurance, said Clinton's announcement ''gives hope to families
that cannot afford to take time off to spend time with their
newborn or newly adopted children.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National Partnership
for Women and Families: ''It is time -- past time -- to update our
policies to fit today's work force and today's families.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, chairman of the House
Republican Conference, said the plan was ''ill-conceived.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Under Clinton's proposal, there will be nothing there if we
have an economic downturn and more Americans are suddenly
unemployed,'' Watts said. ''Clinton's proposal will shred the
safety net for the unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Labor Department regulations, states would have the
option to amend unemployment compensation systems to provide paid
leave for new parents. States that do opt to offer paid leave would
receive help from federal labor officials in assessing the
long-term fiscal impact of that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited a federal study that found the number of married
mothers working outside the home has increased from 38 percent to
68 percent over the past 30 years, and the average parent has 22
fewer hours per week at home compared with a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are working more jobs and longer hours than ever
before, forcing many of them to make the unacceptable choice
between being good workers and the best parents or caregivers,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Some state unemployment insurance programs are financially flush
because the booming economy has put more people to work than at any
time in 30 years. But employers, who provide those funds, oppose
using the money for purposes other than unemployment.

<HEADLINE> 21 horses dead in fire at Brooklyn stable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Twenty-one mostly privately owned horses died in
a fire that engulfed a Brooklyn stable, but three other animals
were rescued unharmed early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze in the single-story Bergan Beach Stables in the Mill
Basin neighborhood started at about 11:45 p.m. Friday, fire
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were at the scene Saturday, trying to determine
the cause of the blaze, which left many of the horses fatally
burned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the horses were very badly burned,'' said James
Spollen, a fire department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 that died, two were owned by the New York City Parks
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Three horses survived; two were taken to an NYPD horse facility,
and the third was transported by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   The flames, which totally destroyed the stable, were under
control by 1 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Touts Higher Education  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- In his final commencement address,
President Clinton offered a message Saturday to graduates of a
private liberal arts college where annual costs exceed $29,000:
''Our country cannot afford to leave any students behind simply
because they can't afford to pay for college.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the past 20 years, the cost of college has quadrupled,''
Clinton told 423 graduates of Carleton College, about 40 miles
south of Minneapolis. ''I'll bet there are a lot of parents here
who have taken second mortgages or second jobs to help pay those
tuition bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, clad in cap and gown, strode before the crowd of about
6,000 people in this sleepy community whose motto is ''The City of
Cows, Colleges and Contentment.'' He threw his head back and
laughed when he noticed a life-sized cardboard cutout of himself
that someone waved in the audience. During his talk, he joked about
how someone had painted his likeness on a water tower. ''I still
kind of wish you hadn't painted it over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His mood, however, was dampened by the news of the death of
Syrian President Hafez Assad. As he sat on the dais waiting to
deliver his speech, Clinton was handed a note, confirming Assad's
death on Saturday. But he did not mention the 69-year-old
president's death in his talk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he focused on his administration's work to make higher
education more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   He touted the administration's Direct Student Loan program,
saying it had lowered the cost of borrowing for students by
allowing them to get loans directly through the government without
a financial institution acting as a middle man. He boasted about
expanding the Pell Grant program and creating the $1,500 HOPE
Scholarship tax credit to make the first two years of college as
universal as high school.
</P>
<P>
   He also called on Congress to approve a measure that would let
families claim a tax deduction worth up to $2,800 for up to $10,000
in college tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''As student aid has increased, so has college attendance, now
to record levels,'' he said. ''Two-thirds of our high school
graduates go straight to college -- that's an all-time high. And for
the first time in history, a majority of young African Americans
are enrolling in higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Committee on Education and the Workforce, said he was disappointed
that the president would use a commencement speech to advance a
''misguided political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodling said the Direct Student Loan program, for example, had
many administrative problems the president failed to mention in his
speech. And he said that Congress had not acted on the president's
elementary and secondary school proposals because of their ''big
government, Washington-knows-best mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's 23rd commencement address since taking office
in 1993, and his third this year. Clinton has already spoken at the
U.S. Coast Guard Academy in New London, Conn. and at Eastern
Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   After the commencement, Clinton attended a $10,000-a-couple
luncheon hosted by the Democratic National Committee, which was
expected to raise $300,000. At a second fund-raiser, he spoke at a
Soul Asylum rock concert, an event aimed at younger voters that the
DNC said would raise an estimated $200,000.

<HEADLINE> Israel Sees Risks, Chances in Syria  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA KING
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- For Israel, the death of Syrian President Hafez
Assad carries great risk -- and enormous opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The risk: that the sudden passing of a strongman who ruled Syria
single-handedly for three decades will deal a heavy blow to peace
prospects by ushering in a prolonged period of instability, even
chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity: that a bit of Syria's implacable enmity toward
Israel -- if only a bit -- might have died along with its hard-line
leader.
</P>
<P>
   For the 69-year-old Assad, hating Israel was something personal
-- a bitter and long-nursed grievance. But for the 34-year-old son
Assad had groomed as his heir in recent years, Syria's state of war
with Israel -- which continues to this day -- is more of an
abstraction, a chain of historical events that played themselves
out while he was still only a child.
</P>
<P>
   Assad never got over his fury at losing the Golan Heights to
Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. Defense minister at the time,
he viewed it as an affront to his personal pride. When Syria
regained a bit of the territory in bloody fighting six years later,
the Syrian leader traveled there himself to raise the flag.
</P>
<P>
   As Syria entered into negotiations with Israel in December,
centering on the all-but-assured return of the Golan Heights, Assad
radiated mistrust and suspicion. He would not even allow his top
diplomat, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, to shake the hand of
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The talks broke down within weeks amid Assad's insistence that
Israel commit -- even before the negotiations could progress -- to
returning to prewar 1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long kept a watchful eye on Assad's likely successor:
his son Bashar, an ophthalmologist by profession.
</P>
<P>
   Although a political neophyte, he is known to be an enthusiastic
supporter of economic reform -- something that could bode well for
restarting peace talks. Reviving Syria's moribund, isolated economy
would require much greater engagement with the outside world than
the elder Assad ever allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Barak extended condolences to the Syrian people, his
aides were rushing to offer flattering assessments of Bashar Assad.
Within hours of the announcement of Assad's death, Israeli media
were citing senior Barak associates as calling his son intelligent
and thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest peril posed by Assad's death lies in its
timing: a scant three weeks after Israel withdrew its troops from
south Lebanon. Because Syria essentially runs Lebanon's affairs,
the big question in the wake of Israel's pullout has been whether
Assad would keep a tight rein on the Hezbollah guerrillas who led
the fight to drive Israel out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The belief that quiet will reign in Lebanon after the
withdrawal from there depends on the desire of Syria to influence,
to ensure that quiet and the stability,'' said Itamar Rabinovich, a
former ambassador to the United States who served as head of
Israel's earlier negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as a result of Assad's death, ''there are question marks
over both the desire and the ability (of Syria)'' to keep fighting
from breaking out, he told Israel's Channel One.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has said previously that any renewal of Hezbollah's
cross-border attacks would bring an extremely harsh response,
possibly targeting Syrian troops in Lebanon -- and raising the risk
of a larger regional conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we need to see is ... that the new Syrian leadership does
not permit Hezbollah or any other organization to renew their
actions in south Lebanon,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh
told Channel Two.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet minister Amnon Lipkin Shahak, a former army chief who
was deeply involved in past negotiations with Syria, told Israel
television it could be a long time before the succession question
is worked out and Bashar Assad's intentions become clear.
</P>
<P>
   Others echoed that view. ''We can only guess and estimate what
will happen now, because internal politics and changes and the
ability to take charge and take the leadership are things that
cannot be known beforehand,'' said Rabinovich, who has written
books on Assad.
</P>
<P>
   To some Palestinians, Assad's death meant the possibility of
improved Syrian-Palestinian relations.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wasn't popular among us because throughout the years he has
taken the hard line against us, against the Palestinian
Authority,'' said Hiyam Nasserdin, a 45-year-old math teacher from
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Jabari, 47, said he would refuse to close his shop to
mark the three days of mourning called for by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I won't close for Hafez Assad because he was bad to the
Palestinians and he always attacked our leaders and did not support
us at all,'' Jabari said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the very real fears of a potential power struggle in
Syria, the death of so unrelenting a foe could not help but bring a
few sighs of relief in Israel's official circles. Implicitly
acknowledging that, Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami chose
to remind his compatriots of a biblical injunction.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rejoice not,'' he said, ''in your enemy's death.''

<HEADLINE> Iraq: UN Mishandled Program Revenue  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq on Saturday accused the United Nations
of mismanaging billions of dollars in revenues from the
oil-for-food program, saying the money could have been well spent
combating the country's drought.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Agriculture Minister Basil al-Dalali spoke of the
government's frustration at not being able to access the money when
''Iraq needs badly many things related to its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to circumvent U.N. economic
sanctions and sell oil under U.N. supervision. However, the
revenues must be deposited in an escrow account in a French bank,
and can only be spent buying food and humanitarian goods on
contracts approved by the U.N. sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Dalali said Saturday that Iraq had more than $7 billion in
the French account, but that ''the money is frozen.'' Though he
didn't say why, he was apparently referring to the committee's
having either rejected contracts or put them on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq often has accused the United States and Britain -- who
dominate the sanctions committee -- of creating hurdles for
contracts. The two countries have said they were only trying to
ensure the goods could not be used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Contracts are still on hold while our suffering is on the
increase,'' al-Dalali said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
have said Iraq lost 70 percent of its crops in the country's
breadbasket last year due to a drought.
</P>
<P>
   No forecasts were available for this year's drought, but
al-Dalali predicted it would be the worst in a century. U.N. relief
officials said the drought would have a devastating impact on the
country's animals, crops and power-generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Agriculture Organization said it was preparing
''for another serious crisis,'' and urged the U.N. committee to
approve Iraq's spending $154 million on irrigation equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's Al-Khalis and Diyala rivers, which water some of Iraq's
most fertile land and orchards, have almost dried up. The
government is considering digging a canal to feed them from the
Tigris River, though that too has hit dangerously low levels in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
cannot be lifted until the U.N. Security Council certifies that the
country is free of weapons of mass destruction and the means to
make them.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea, Russian Officials Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- North Korea's ambassador to Russia met Saturday
with Russia's deputy foreign minister to discuss President Vladimir
Putin's upcoming visit to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin announced Friday that Putin will visit North Korea
shortly, but did not give a date. The visit would be the first by a
Russian leader to North Korea and comes at a time when Moscow and
Washington disagree over the possible threat posed by the communist
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassador Pak Ul Chun and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Georgy Mamedov discussed ''strategic stability, including the topic
of nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of
their delivery,'' the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is considering building a limited anti-missile
defense system against ''rogue states'' such as North Korea, a
proposal strongly opposed by Russia, which sees it as a threat to
its own nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Friday that Putin
would not be urging North Korea to curb its missile program when he
meets with leader Kim Jong Il.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Putin is coming on a visit to a friendly country and
he does not intend to talk anybody out of anything,'' Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Although a date for the visit has not been announced, Putin's
foreign policy aide Sergei Prikhodko said the visit would be before
the July 21-23 meeting in Japan of the Group of Eight, Russia and
the world's leading industrialized nations.

<HEADLINE> Text Of Obituary For Hafez Assad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Text of the official obituary of
President Hafez Assad, read on state-run television and translated
from Arabic by The Associated Press:
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Of the believers are men who are true to that which they
covenanted with Allah. Some of them have paid their vow by death
(in battle), and some of them still are waiting; and they have not
altered in the least.'' (From the Koran: Surah, The Clans, verse
23.)
</P>
<P>
   Fellow citizens, Arabs everywhere, the National and Regional
Commands of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, the Central Command of
the Progressive Democratic Front, People's Assembly, Council of
Ministers, the Armed Forces Command, Vocational Syndicates and
Popular Organizations in Syria, the children of the great who
departed, Bashar, Maher, Majd and Bushra, the Assad and Makhlouf
families, announce to the Arab Nation, the Syrian Arab People, the
Secretary-general of the Arab Socialist Baath Party, President of
the Republic commander Hafez Assad (has died). In the morning of
today, the 10th of June 2000, death has taken a unique commander
and wise man.
</P>
<P>
   Oh Syrians and Arabs, the steadfast commander who defended the
nation has passed away. The commander who rose with his values,
policies, methods has gone. The commander who struggled for more
than half a century for the honor of the Arabs, the unity of the
Arabs and freedom of the Arabs, protecting their dignity and
restoring their rights, has gone. The commander who wrestled
hurricanes and was the most courageous in decision-making and
strongest in confronting the enemies of the nation and its
opponents has gone.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the planet that shone in the sky of Syria and the Arabs
for more than three decades has fallen, having given from his
brain, body and heart so that the banner of the nation would rise,
and having fought, struggled and suffered a lot for his nation. He
was a lion in facing misfortunes, difficulties and storms. He was a
fighting soldier who believed that a nation without freedom and
unity has no value.
</P>
<P>
   Sadness is in the heart of every man, woman and child because
the person who died was a piece of the heart, and the legacy of his
accomplishments and ideas is a planet that will shine not just on
this generation, but also on coming generations.
</P>
<P>
   Peace be upon you president commander. Peace be upon you
struggling comrade. Peace be upon you the example of honesty,
faithfulness, work and struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''But ah! thou soul at peace! Return unto the Lord, content in
His good pleasure! Enter thou among My bondsmen! Enter thou My
Garden.'' (Surah, The Dawn, verses 27-30)

<HEADLINE> The writing's on the wall: Guernsey's to hold auction of graffiti art </HEADLINE>
By DEEPTI HAJELA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The writing started out small in the late 1960s
- names scribbled on walls, subway cars, doors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1970s, the letters got bigger, more colorful,
more stylized. The spray-painted monikers like Tracy 168 WILDSTYLE
and Phase 2 began taking up sides of whole subway cars. Then, into
the 1980s, came the murals, often running along the length of whole
trains, showcasing their creators' visions throughout the five
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   The subway art in New York is mostly gone now, cleaned up and
painted over and replaced by other trains. But for two days next
week, the spotlight will be back on graffiti art, at an auction
believed to be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Guernsey's, the auction house that sold Mark McGwire's 70th
home-run baseball and a controversial collection of Kennedy
memorabilia, will feature the works of about 100 graffiti artists
during a two-day sale on Wednesday and Thursday nights at the Puck
Building. Previews start at noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Arlan Ettinger, the auction house's president, said he had been
interested in graffiti ever since the late 1960s, when he noticed
that Taki 183, considered one of the first known ''taggers,'' had
written his name on spots all over the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something for years had been gnawing at me ... that would have
been an interesting auction to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger assumed it had already been done, but said Guernsey's
research couldn't find any evidence of any other auction of this
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the works for sale are spray paint on canvas, but there
are the more unusual items: A door from the apartment above 51 X
Gallery, tagged by the likes of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith
Haring, a pinball machine, a subway map. There are also photographs
of the painted subway trains that used to run through the city.
</P>
<P>
   Tagging trains was more of a status-builder in the graffiti art
community than anything else, because the trains were seen by
millions, said Tracy 168 WILDSTYLE.
</P>
<P>
   ''If your name led the train, you were the man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the artists involved in the auction, many of them longtime
taggers who have graduated from subway cars to displaying their
pieces in galleries and collections, it's good to see graffiti art
getting such recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The auction is neat,'' said Taki 183, who has long since left
his tagging days behind him and is reluctant to give out much of
his current personal information. ''You never think that is going
to happen in a million years.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are one of the few arts that originated in America,'' said
Lady Pink, one of the few well-known women artists in the heavily
male-dominated graffiti world.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, she said, ''This is a piece of New York history that you
can no longer see.''

Clinton Regrets Assad Missed Peace
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- President Clinton said today he is disappointed a
peace agreement between Israel and Syria was not achieved while President Hafez
Assad was alive. The 69-year-old Assad had steadfastly demanded return from
Israel of all the Golan Heights, a border plateau that Israel took in the 1967
Six-Day War. Israel has offered to return the Golan. But Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak balked at Syria's demand for a sliver of land along the shores of the
Sea of Galilee, the source of about 40 percent of Israel's water. The president
said it was too early to assess the impact Assad's death will have on Middle
East peace negotiations. The autocratic leader, who suffered from heart
problems, died Saturday.

Clinton Delivers Final Commencement Address
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- President Clinton today told graduates of a private
liberal arts college where annual costs exceed $29,000 that the United States
can't afford to deny college to students just because they don't have the money
for it. ''Over the past 20 years, the cost of college has quadrupled,'' Clinton
told 423 graduates of Carleton College, about 40 miles south of Minneapolis.
''I'll bet there are a lot of parents here who have taken second mortgages or
second jobs to help pay those tuition bills.''

Yugoslavs Mark Bombing Anniversary

   ALEKSINAC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Vowing to prevent further wars in Yugoslavia,
an army general and several officials on Saturday marked the first anniversary
of the end of NATO's 78-day air attack in this mining town, where Allied bombs
killed 19 civilians. About 2,000 people attended the ceremony -- called ''Memory
and Hope'' -- which is to become an annual event commemorating the day NATO
suspended its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Addressing the crowd, the
Yugoslav army's chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, blasted the United States
and NATO for their ''cowardly aggression'' in the air raids, and promised his
troops would prevent any further wars in Yugoslavia.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite the departure of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from the
closely watched U.S. Senate race in New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been
unable to open up a gap over the Republican opposition, according to three
independent polls. When Giuliani pulled out of the race on May 19, Republican
leaders predicted that by late summer or early fall their new candidate, Rep.
Rick Lazio, would be running even with the first lady. But on June 7, the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute came out with its offering. It showed
Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent each.

Greece Seeks Ex-CIA Chief Testimony

   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A Greek court summoned a former Central Intelligence
Agency director to testify, as efforts to track down the killers of a British
diplomat generated little success, authorities said today. A public prosecutor
wants to interview James Woolsey after the former spymaster reportedly suggested
that members of Greece's Socialist government could identify terrorists in the
November 17 group, but had done nothing to arrest them. The terrorist group has
killed 22 people, including four American officials, since 1975, but none of its
members have ever been caught.

Commendable Wins Belmont Stakes

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Commendable, whose only previous victory was a maiden race
last August, snapped a six-race losing streak and won the Belmont Stakes on a
sweltering Saturday. The victory was the fourth Belmont win for D. Wayne Lukas
and the 13th victory in a Triple Crown race for the Hall of Fame trainer.
Commendable, ridden by Pat Day, who won the Belmont for the third time, took
charge on the final turn and turned back all challengers. Missing from the
11-horse field were Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness winner
Red Bullet. It was the first time since 1970 that the Derby and Preakness winner
both missed the Belmont.

behind to beat the Mets 13-5 today in the Bronx and even this year's Subway
Series at a game apiece. A day after routing the two-time World Series champs
12-2 in their first meeting this season, the Mets led 3-2 and 5-3 before the
Yankees took over. Before a raucous sellout of 55,839, Bernie Williams and Tino
Martinez hit consecutive RBI doubles in the first -- right fielder Derek Bell
let Martinez's catchable fly fall behind him.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Death May Halt Peace Effort  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The death of Syrian President Hafez Assad is
likely to set already stalled U.S. peace efforts further back as
his successor takes hold and decides whether to show more
flexibility in dealing with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declined in a statement Saturday to
''speculate about the future'' but said he hoped peace still could
be achieved because of Assad's strategic commitment to it.
</P>
<P>
   Battling severe ailments for years, Assad had been grooming his
son, Bashar, to succeed him and presumably in the process was
imbuing him with the father's determination to recover all
territory lost to Israel in Syria's humiliating defeat in the 1967
Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was unwilling to bend. A major question is whether his
successor will bend -- or will feel strong enough to soften Assad's
position -- for the sake of a deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question whether Israel would have the
confidence to count on a new and untried leader from the minority
Alawite sect to follow through.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, chosen by the
president to lead the U.S. delegation to Assad's funeral, stressed
in statements of condolence that Assad made a decision for peace
with Israel, and they would proceed on the assumption it would
survive him.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass, vice president of the Brookings Institution,
said: ''I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Haass, who was Middle East adviser to former President Bush,
said Assad's commitment to peace was incomplete. ''He may have had
a commitment in principle, but it did not translate into
practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Haass said in an interview, ''in order to make peace
you've got to be strong internally, and it's inconceivable his
successor will have a domestic position of strength for some time
to come, if ever.''
</P>
<P>
   On a similar note, Samuel W. Lewis, a former U.S. ambassador to
Israel and assistant secretary of state, said, ''For the next few
months, and probably a good deal longer, the problem of settling in
a new leadership in Damascus will be all-consuming, in great
likelihood.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis added: ''There is really no chance you can have a serious
return to the negotiating table until quite a lot of time has
elapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking an entirely different view, Richard Perle, an assistant
secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, said Assad's
death ''should in time open the way for a much more constructive
Syrian policy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a country that supports terrorism,'' Perle said in an
interview. ''Assad was personally responsible for the murder of
thousands of people, and it's hard to imagine that he could ever
become an instrument for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   For the right peace terms, Assad could have regained from
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak virtually all the Golan Heights,
a militarily valuable border highland. Assad insisted also on a
strip of land on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, the source of
some 40 percent of Israel's water. Barak balked and turned his
attention to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to Geneva, Switzerland, in March to renew Israel's
offer. Assad turned him down. Still, Clinton stressed in Saturday's
condolence statement that Assad had made a ''strategic choice'' for
peace and had made clear to him ''Syria's continued commitment to
the path of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate statement, Albright said, ''We strongly believe
that was the right choice and expect that Syria will continue on
the path of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Progress on a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians is
slow, as well. Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due
in Washington to resume talks on Tuesday after a two-week lapse,
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is scheduled to see Clinton on
Wednesday at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate indication that Assad's death would
affect the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Only last Wednesday, while in Cairo, Albright tested Syria's
disposition toward reopening negotiations with Israel that were
held under U.S. auspices last January.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, she told
reporters that Syria was interested but that he had not signaled a
shift in his country's territorial demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not get any indication of a change,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister said in Cairo, meanwhile, that his one-hour
talk with Albright had cleared the air and ''removed much of the
misunderstanding that occurred in the past few months, particularly
that concerning the Geneva summit'' between Assad and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sharaa also said Syria would not sacrifice its rights --
presumably referring to every last bit on land it once held.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Man Bluffs Into Hospital  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A homeless man carrying fake credentials
bluffed his way into a hospital emergency room and worked through
the night shift as a physician's assistant before revealing he is
HIV-positive and had sneaked into other hospitals before, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who identified himself as Gary Lee Stearley, 26, was
closely supervised throughout the shift at Mercy Hospital and no
patients were hurt, police Sgt. Charles Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   He always wore gloves, Mercy spokeswoman Linda Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Stearley carried identification cards for two other
hospitals, but they had not yet verified his story, whether he is
indeed HIV-positive, or even his name.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Stearley told him he had a history of mental
illness and had once studied to be a paramedic in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do I think he had any malicious intentions? No,'' Rodriguez
said. ''It more seemed he was acting out his passion to be an ER
person, to be in that setting helping people medically.''
</P>
<P>
   Stearley was charged with trespassing and false impersonation
and was being held Saturday in lieu of $25,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the man carried ID cards with the name Joshua A.
Caldwell for Virginia Commonwealth University hospital in Richmond,
Va., and Howard University hospital in Washington, D.C. He said
Stearley told him he got photo ID cards by pretending to be a new
worker.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the two hospitals did not return calls for comment
Saturday, but police said neither listed him as an employee.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy employees said Stearley arrived early Thursday wearing
surgical scrubs and apologized for being late for the midnight to 8
a.m. shift. He said he had arranged to complete a two-week study
program and presented the Virginia ID.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said hospital workers questioned him because they had not
expected him, but allowed him to work the shift because he was
dressed like an assistant, gave the name of the doctor with whom he
had supposedly arranged to study, and ''spoke medical jargon.''
</P>
<P>
   Stearley made the rounds with doctors, and treated at least one
patient. Police said one witness saw him apply stitches, but Ross
said he only tied stitches that a hospital employee had applied.
</P>
<P>
   Stearley was caught when a secretary discovered the phone
numbers and addresses he gave on a registration form were false,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Security officers confronted him when he returned to the
hospital Thursday night for another shift. He voluntarily checked
into the hospital's psychiatric ward and was arrested when he tried
to leave Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said no hospital employees would be disciplined for
allowing him access to the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   Stearley is also wanted in Richmond in connection with the
disappearance of a laptop computer from the medical college, and in
Seattle for missing a court date on a charge of possessing stolen
property, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Stearley said he had been traveling the country since he ran
away from home somewhere in Michigan at age 14, police said.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Newswoman Shot And Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOULTRIE, Ga. (AP) -- A newswoman with The Moultrie Observer was
killed while sitting in her car, and hours later her estranged
husband died of a gunshot wound that police said may have been
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Zeigler Nunez, 39, was shot once in the head with a 9 mm
pistol Friday night at a traffic light, police said.
</P>
<P>
   She apparently was driving back to the newspaper office to work
on Sunday's edition after taking her son to a skating rink,
Observer managing editor Dwain Walden said.
</P>
<P>
   Her estranged husband, Raul Nunez, was later found wounded in
his pickup in nearby Funston and died on the way to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A 9 mm pistol and a spent shell casing were found with him, and
police said he may have shot himself. Raul Nunez had been charged a
week earlier with making terroristic threats against his wife.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Recalls Syria's Assad  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- Despite his disagreements with Syrian
President Hafez Assad, President Clinton said the Arab leader who
died Saturday was ''open and straightforward'' and desired a
lasting peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart announced later that
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would represent the United
States at Assad's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Lockhart confirmed that neither Clinton nor
Vice President Al Gore would attend the service. ''I think the
president believes that Secretary Albright is the appropriate
person to attend,'' he said. He declined to say whether Clinton had
been advised not to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''I regret that peace was not achieved in his lifetime, and I
hope that it can still be achieved, in no small measure because of
the commitment he made,'' Clinton told reporters at Minneapolis-St.
Paul International Airport after giving a commencement speech at
Carleton College, 40 miles to the south in Northfield.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak telephoned
Clinton and they spoke for about 10 minutes, touching on all areas
of the peace process but not dwelling on Assad's death. ''We are
obviously in a very critical part of the peace process,'' the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
   On his trip to Minnesota, Clinton was told on Air Force One of
reports that Assad had died. He didn't know for sure until an aide
passed a folded note to the president as he sat, wearing cap and
gown, waiting to make the last commencement speech of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He read it and let go a sigh, holding the note up to his chin to
reflect on the news. Clinton didn't mention the 69-year-old Assad
in his speech but issued a written statement afterward and spoke to
reporters at the airport before heading to two fund-raising events
in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the occasion to meet with President Assad many times,
and I believe I got to know him well,'' Clinton said. ''And while
we had our disagreements, I always respected him because I felt
that he was open and straightforward with me, and because I felt he
meant it when he said he had made a strategic choice for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad has steadfastly demanded return from Israel of all the
Golan Heights, a border plateau that Israel took in the 1967
Six-Day War. Israel has offered to return the Golan. But Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak balked at Syria's demand for a sliver of
land along the shores of the Sea of Galilee, the source of about 40
percent of Israel's water.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton failed to change Assad's mind when he reiterated the
Israeli offer in March at a meeting with Assad in Geneva,
Switzerland, their last meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The president said it was too early to assess the impact Assad's
death will have on Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are scheduled this week in Washington between senior
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators. On Wednesday, Clinton is to
meet at the White House with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a period of mourning in Syria, there will be a
period of sorting out, and the Syrian people will make some
decisions, and then we'll see what happens,'' Clinton said. ''But,
you know, we've been at this now for years because of the decision
that he made to go back to negotiations and try to move away from
conflict, and it's certainly a path I hope the country will stay
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Wednesday with Syria's
foreign minister in Cairo, Egypt. She said Syria showed interest in
reopening talks with Israel, but Farouk al-Sharaa did not signal
any shift in his country's territorial demands.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Leader Accuses Liberian Pres  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A senior military official accused
Liberia's president Saturday of hiring mercenaries to bolster
Sierra Leone's feared rebel movement. Liberian officials denied the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Alfred Claude Nelson-Williams, operations director for the
military, said Liberian President Charles Taylor hired mercenaries
from the now disbanded South African security firm, Executive
Outcomes, as well as from nearby Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   The mercenaries were to secure diamond fields controlled by the
Revolutionary United Front and boost the rebel campaign against the
government, Nelson-Williams said, citing military intelligence
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF is determined to hold on to the country's
breadbasket,'' he told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   His accusations could not be verified independently, and were
rejected by the Liberian deputy information minister, Nathan
Teahjay, as ''sweeping, illogical statements that do not have
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed as a government to remain engaged
constructively in the process to end the Sierra Leone crisis,''
Teahjay said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who helped negotiate the release of 500 U.N.
peacekeepers taken captive by the rebels last month, is a close
ally of rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   A British-sponsored draft U.N. resolution on Thursday singled
out Liberia as the key conduit for illicit diamond sales, which
have allowed the rebels to buy weapons. The draft proposes a ban on
the sale of Sierra Leonean diamonds and seeks to tighten a 1998
arms embargo on the country.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the South African Foreign Ministry said,
however, that he had no information about a deal between Taylor and
mercenaries from his country.
</P>
<P>
   South Africans who want to provide military assistance abroad
must get authorization from their country's National Conventional
Arms Control Committee, spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's government hired Executive Outcomes in 1996 to
provide military training and assistance, but terminated the
contract that year because it reportedly cost about $1.8 million a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which recruited personnel from African and European
countries, announced in December 1998 it was closing down. The move
came months after Pretoria passed strict laws banning South African
participation in mercenary operations.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF rebels have killed tens of thousands of civilians and
systematically maimed many more during an eight-year civil war.
They signed a peace accord in July 1999 with the government, but
reignited the conflict last month, seizing U.N. hostages and
advancing toward the capital.

<HEADLINE> Fire Risk Makes for Unusual Summer  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALONG THE GUNFLINT TRAIL, Minn. (AP) -- In the nation's most
popular wilderness area, people can canoe, hike, fish and camp to
their heart's content. This summer, though, they can't enjoy one of
the enduring traditions of the North Woods -- sitting around an open
campfire.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is more
than 1,000 miles removed from parts of the West and Southeast that
have been charred by wildfires in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But despite some recent rain and more than 1,000 lakes and
streams, much of the northern wilderness area has been experiencing
very dry conditions at a particularly bad time.
</P>
<P>
   This wild, beautiful stretch of country near the Canadian border
became a tinderbox full of kindling when a ferocious wind storm
last July 4 knocked down millions of trees on about a third of the
1.1 million-acre BWCA, which lies within the Superior National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say fires are inevitable. In some places, fallen trees
make up as much as 150 tons of fuel per acre.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service has banned open fires in roughly half of
the wilderness area, which draws more than 200,000 adventurers from
around the world every year. This summer, those people are doing
their cooking on portable camp stoves if they're in the fire zone.
Similar restrictions affect a relatively small slice of the
adjoining 1.2 million-acre Quetico Provincial Park in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   National Geographic Traveler magazine recently listed the
Boundary Waters as one of the 50 ''must-see spots'' that every
''real traveler'' should visit at least once his or her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   And it was one of the favorite spots of the late CBS newsman
Charles Kuralt.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is absolute solitude you want, you have only to paddle
far enough,'' he wrote in his 1995 book, ''Charles Kuralt's
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In two or three days of paddling and portaging, you can be
reasonably assured of reaching the beautiful lake of your fondest
dreams, where you can set up camp for a week or two without hearing
another human voice.''
</P>
<P>
   On days when the wind is still, the silence is as stunning as
the rugged scenery. People are often few and far between, even
though there are about 6,000 to 12,000 visitors within the
wilderness on any given summer day. There are no roads, and motors
are banned except for storm cleanup and firefighting.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and tanker aircraft will be on alert all of this
summer and probably for several summers. Prescribed burns and
salvage logging are being done just outside the BWCA to reduce the
wildfire danger. And the Forest Service is planning controlled
burns inside the BWCA starting next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruined trees and the restrictions, many canoeists
who have trekked through the Boundary Waters recently say it's
still well worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''The power of God was neat to see,'' said Emily Slinger, one of
a group of seven young people from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some areas up there where there's not a tree
standing,'' said David Fink, another member of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the damage has been covered up by this year's new
growth. And even in severely affected areas, trees right along the
lakes often managed to withstand the storm as the flattened areas
are often patchy, interspersed with intact stands of timber.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy enough to route a trip away from the blowdown area
into zones where campfires are still allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm damage was part of the attraction for Charlie Cole
and Cliff Pomeroy, who traveled from Indiana to retrace a route
they had covered on a previous trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the only reason we came, but it was part of it,''
Pomeroy said at his journey's end at Round Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ''And it was pretty awesome,'' Cole agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One of their favorite campsites, on Gabimichigami Lake, was
still beautiful despite the loss of about 20 big trees, they said.
Pine trees were snapped off midway up, while birches had been
knocked on their sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall I'm really pleased with the way everything still
looks,'' Cole said. ''It's not destroyed. ... There's a few spots
that are total devastation, but they're small and few. Mostly it
looks about like it did before.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Hopes for Political Revival  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The loyal sidekick to a self-styled ''Comeback
Kid,'' Vice President Al Gore hopes he is in the midst of a
political revival of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After a week in which he launched a multimillion-dollar TV ad
campaign, released the first in a series of economic initiatives
and announced a lengthy ''progress and prosperity tour,'' Gore said
this may be a turning point in his campaign against George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor kept a steady pace in battleground states,
promising in government reform speeches to usher in an era of
political civility. It was a high-minded, poll-tested tone designed
to capitalize on voter disgust with partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ''In just seven months ... we will leave our current president
to the judgment of history,'' Bush said Thursday. ''What matters
now is whether the bitterness that now prevails in Washington will
continue after this term.''
</P>
<P>
   For both Bush and Gore, this is the season to tinker with themes
and shore up political standing for the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   National polls show the race is tight, after Bush held slight
leads in recent weeks. Bush remains ahead in the more important
state-by-state battle, however, with leads in enough states to give
him more than two-thirds of the 270 electoral votes required to win
the White House. Gore is ahead in enough states to give him fewer
than half the votes he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats believe Gore has allowed Bush to get the upper hand in
the battle to court moderate and ticket-splitting voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''What you're going to see out of Gore this month is whether you
can jump-start this race with an electorate that still has little
interest in the campaign,'' Democratic consultant Jim Duffy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an important time because the policy positions of
both candidates are becoming more clear with each passing day,''
said Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, a Bush adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday in New York, the vice president will begin
rolling out a series of economic initiatives in battleground
states. His goal: take credit for the largest economic surge in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his top policy advisers met Saturday in an all-day wonk
session to hash out the announcements the vice president will make
on his tour.
</P>
<P>
   Gore jumped the gun last week, announcing his support of a
''lock box'' to protect Medicare surpluses from budgetary raids.
Aides said Gore feared that Republicans or fellow Democrats would
beat him to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   In a private meeting, President Clinton, who called himself the
''Comeback Kid'' in the 1992 campaign, gave Gore the go-ahead to
embrace the initiative, one that had been discussed by Clinton's
own advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that this is a turning point -- more for the country
than the campaign -- because it's time to start the discussion of
what we're going to do with the surplus and how we can safeguard
our prosperity,'' Gore said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are not giving Gore much credit for the unprecedented
economic boom. Polls indicate voters are about evenly divided on
whether Gore or Bush is the best candidate to continue the surge.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will take Gore to a number of key states -- including
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Wisconsin -- where analysts say he
is not getting credit for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only possible thing to do, is say 'Hey, folks, I'm part of
this administration. Look at how good things are; look at how
pleased you are with the president. I'm part of that team,''' said
Charles Jones, a political science professor emeritus at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even Pennsylvania, which suffered the most in the transition
from the industrial to the information age, has come around. We are
enjoying unprecedented levels of employment,'' said Mark Singel, a
former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. ''Al Gore rightfully
can take some of the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Gore will have a hard time getting heard when
voters are planning summer vacations and not watching the White
House race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming to the state is probably the most effective way to
communicate with people who aren't interested in being communicated
with about the presidential campaign,'' said Paul Tipps, former
state chairman of the Democratic Party in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush are running even in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
Gore is slightly behind in Ohio and behind by double digits in
Kentucky, state polls show.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to help Gore, the Democratic ad campaign unveiled last
week reflects the vice president's problems. Not only are the ads
running in traditional swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania,
but Gore has been forced to spend his limited money in Democratic
bastions.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the 15 states airing the ads voted for Democratic
candidates in the past three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we have to fight in Oregon and Washington, it's not a
good sign,'' consultant Duffy said. ''You can conclude from their
(ad) buy that they felt they could not wait, especially in
Washington, Oregon, Iowa and Wisconsin, where he needs to go and
define who he is and move this campaign in another direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush will spend a chunk of this week at his family's retreat in
Kennebunkport, Maine. His senior advisers will present their
recommendations for the Republican National Convention, which
begins July 31 in Philadelphia, and Bush may work on his list of
about 12 vice presidential prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's team already has spread the word that the convention will
be less partisan than past gatherings. Though Gore will surely be
criticized, Bush is intent on keeping the focus on his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Let Gore suffer the wrath of voters weary of partisan attacks,
Bush seems to be saying.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans look upon the spectacle of Washington and they do
not like what they see,'' he said in a speech last week. ''I agree
with them.''

<HEADLINE> Liberian Leader Accused in S. Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- A senior military official accused
Liberia's president Saturday of hiring mercenaries to bolster
Sierra Leone's feared rebel movement. Liberian officials denied the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Alfred Claude Nelson-Williams, operations director for the
military, said Liberian President Charles Taylor hired mercenaries
from the now disbanded South African security firm, Executive
Outcomes, as well as from nearby Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   The mercenaries were to secure diamond fields controlled by the
Revolutionary United Front and boost the rebel campaign against the
government, Nelson-Williams said, citing military intelligence
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ''The RUF is determined to hold on to the country's
breadbasket,'' he told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
   His accusations could not be verified independently, and were
rejected by the Liberian deputy information minister, Nathan
Teahjay, as ''sweeping, illogical statements that do not have
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are committed as a government to remain engaged
constructively in the process to end the Sierra Leone crisis,''
Teahjay said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who helped negotiate the release of 500 U.N.
peacekeepers taken captive by the rebels last month, is a close
ally of rebel leader Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   A British-sponsored draft U.N. resolution on Thursday singled
out Liberia as the key conduit for illicit diamond sales, which
have allowed the rebels to buy weapons. The draft proposes a ban on
the sale of Sierra Leonean diamonds and seeks to tighten a 1998
arms embargo on the country.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the South African Foreign Ministry said,
however, that he had no information about a deal between Taylor and
mercenaries from his country.
</P>
<P>
   South Africans who want to provide military assistance abroad
must get authorization from their country's National Conventional
Arms Control Committee, spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone's government hired Executive Outcomes in 1996 to
provide military training and assistance, but terminated the
contract that year because it reportedly cost about $1.8 million a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which recruited personnel from African and European
countries, announced in December 1998 it was closing down. The move
came months after Pretoria passed strict laws banning South African
participation in mercenary operations.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF rebels have killed tens of thousands of civilians and
systematically maimed many more during an eight-year civil war.
They signed a peace accord in July 1999 with the government, but
reignited the conflict last month, seizing U.N. hostages and
advancing toward the capital.

<HEADLINE> Syria Mourns Death of Its Leader  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Damascus erupted in shouts, honks and
tears Saturday as hundreds of bereaved Syrians poured out into the
streets to mourn the death of President Hafez Assad, the only
leader many have ever known.
</P>
<P>
   At least one man fainted, overcome by emotions. Young men, many
of them wearing black clothes and black bands on their foreheads,
circled the streets leading up to the presidential palace and
Assad's private residence.
</P>
<P>
   As police looked on, the crowd cried ''Allahu Akbar!'' or God is
great, and shouted slogans expressing support for Bashar Assad, the
late leader's son and heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   ''With our souls, with our blood, we will protect you, Oh
Bashar,'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   The government declared a 40-day mourning period. Syria's
red-black-and-white flags were lowered to half-staff in mourning.
Stores quickly shuttered. Secondary school exams were postponed
until next week. Loudspeakers at government buildings, hotels and
other establishments resounded with verses from the Koran, Islam's
holy book, in the traditional Islamic way of mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, who died at the age of 69 on Saturday, is the only leader
the younger generation has ever known, having ruled Syria for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father died today, our beloved president has left us. There
are no words to describe my sorrow,'' said Bassem Soudan, a
university student in his 20s who had taken off his shirt and taped
a picture of Assad to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought I would see another leader. I thought he was
immortal,'' said Mohammed Kurdi, a 30-year-old taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cars with pictures of Assad and Bashar on their
windshields drove around town, honking. About a 100 policemen kept
watch, ringing intersections to keep people from walking onto the
palace grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Some quietly mourned by flying black ribbons on the antennas of
their cars. Long black flags were draped on cars and hung on
government buildings and homes.
</P>
<P>
   One woman wept as she kissed a picture of the late president.
Another danced as she waved a picture of his 34-year-old son. The
man who fainted was bundled into an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our only consolation is Dr. Bashar. He is our hope,'' Amal
Srour, an 18-year-old woman, said about the British-educated
ophthalmologist expected to succeed his father.

Syrian President Hafez Assad Dies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syrian Presiden Hafez Assad died Saturday before he
was able to win back the treasured Golan Heights he lost to the Jewish state 33
years ago. Assad, 69, had been suffering from heart problems. No funeral plans
were immediately announced. The skillful and ruthless leader's death could deal
a blow to Mideast peace prospects by triggering a prolonged period of
instability. But it could also mean an opportunity for Syria to forsake at least
part of its enmity toward Israel. The Syrian parliament moved to clear the way
for Assad's son, Bashar, to assume the presidency, amending the constitution to
lower the minimum age for presidents to 34 -- Bashar's age.

Region Sorrowful Over Assad's Death
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Syria's neighbors mourned the death of President Hafez
Assad, saying that it robbed the region of a visionary who stood unwavering in
the face of challenges to the Arab nations. Around the Arab world, including the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Libya, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority,
Morocco and Bahrain, a three-day mourning period was declared. In Lebanon, where
Syria has 30,000 troops stationed and has served as the main power-broker for
more than two decades, a one-week mourning period was declared during which
flags would be flown at half-staff. Jordan declared a 40-day mourning period.

expectations. ''The picture of two leaders smiling and shaking hands, the
picture itself is a great message for world peace,'' South Korean Culture and
Tourism Minister Park Jie-won said. The three-day summit between South Korean

Australia, the United States and other countries. Prospects for reconciliation

Clinton Urges Higher Education for All

   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- President Clinton today told graduates of a private
liberal arts college where annual costs exceed $29,000 that the United States
can't afford to deny college to students just because they don't have the money
for it. ''Over the past 20 years, the cost of college has quadrupled,'' Clinton
told 423 graduates of Carleton College, about 40 miles south of Minneapolis.
''I'll bet there are a lot of parents here who have taken second mortgages or
second jobs to help pay those tuition bills.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite the departure of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani from the
closely watched U.S. Senate race in New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has been
unable to open up a gap over the Republican opposition, according to three
independent polls. When Giuliani pulled out of the race on May 19, Republican
leaders predicted that by late summer or early fall their new candidate, Rep.
Rick Lazio, would be running even with the first lady. But on June 7, the
Quinnipiac University Polling Institute came out with its offering. It showed
Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent each.

Stearley, 26, was closely supervised throughout the shift at Mercy Hospital and
no patients were hurt, police Sgt. Charles Rodriguez said. He always wore
gloves, Mercy spokeswoman Linda Ross said. Stearley was charged with trespassing

Commendable Wins the Belmont Stakes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Commendable, whose only previous victory was a maiden race
last August, snapped a six-race losing streak and won the Belmont Stakes on a
sweltering Saturday. The victory was the fourth Belmont win for D. Wayne Lukas
and the 13th victory in a Triple Crown race for the Hall of Fame trainer.
Commendable, ridden by Pat Day, who won the Belmont for the third time, took
charge on the final turn and turned back all challengers. Missing from the
11-horse field were Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness winner
Red Bullet. It was the first time since 1970 that the Derby and Preakness winner
both missed the Belmont.

<HEADLINE> Judge Pays Rent for Deaf Couple  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Judge Donald McDonough handles about 150
landlord-tenant disputes a day, but the verdict he gave a deaf
couple facing eviction was something unique.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved Deborah Morris and Louis Swann, who were taken
to court by their landlord because they were $250 short on their
rent. After hearing arguments, the judge abruptly left the
courtroom, then returned a minute later holding two $100 bills and
a $50 bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consider it paid,'' he said, leaning over the bench and
handing his own money to the landlord's stunned attorney Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign-language interpreter translated, Morris pressed her
hands to her chest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't say a word,'' said Morris, 48. ''It just blew me
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, married in October, learned only recently that their
married status meant a drop in Morris' disability benefits. Without
the aid, they couldn't pay their $630 monthly rent, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough, 55, declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only in America,'' said Fairfax prosecutor Robert F. Horan Jr.
''I've heard of judges suspending judgments. I've never heard of a
judge chipping in.''

	   BETHLEHEM, N.Y. (AP) - A 90-foot roadside cliff that last month
lost a 300-foot chunk of itself in a landslide again shifted
Saturday, covering two bulldozers with dirt.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in what state Department of Transportation
officials termed a ''readjustment'' of the slope.
</P>
<P>
   DOT engineers have been working since the May 16 landslide to be
able to reopen the roadway, a crucial link between the city of
Albany and the Delmar community in the suburban town of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the slide, two families evacuated, business has slumped
and thousands of commuters have been detoured. A produce market
became a pile of timber when it toppled from the cliff two days
after the slide.
</P>
<P>
   The bulldozers are the property of a subcontractor hired by the
DOT to assist in stability tests, which spokesman Michael Fleischer
said was the first step in reopening at least part of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide is blamed on a combination of heavy rains and the
Normans Kill creek below, which cut into the base of the weak
clay-soiled hill.

<HEADLINE> AMA Holds Annual Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Doctors want the American Medical Association to
sharpen its attacks against managed care and take the lead in
shaping Internet medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nation's largest group of physicians debates those
issues at its annual meeting beginning Sunday, the AMA's leaders
have another pressing concern on their minds: Find a remedy for
anemic membership and ailing finances.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that without a cure, the AMA could lose the clout it
needs to address physicians' and patients' worries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Membership must be a prime consideration in everything the AMA
does,'' AMA leaders said in a recent letter to meeting delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA gained nearly 3,000 new members last year -- its first
increase in five years. But about two-thirds of the nation's
800,000-plus doctors, residents and medical students have not
joined.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the recruitment effort focuses on students and new
doctors eligible for substantial discounts on the $420 annual dues.
</P>
<P>
   Membership revenue fell by $4.8 million in 1999 and expenses
exceeded revenues by $9.2 million -- nearly $3 million more than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA is in the midst of a restructuring it hopes will show
members ''that their dues dollars are wisely and strategically
spent on the programs most meaningful to them,'' the letter to
delegates said.
</P>
<P>
   But the AMA's focus on managed care and e-medicine also may help
it win support from patients, who share the frustration and worry
about the privacy of health records in the electronic age, said
Lawrence Gostin, the health, law and ethics editor of the Journal
of the American Medical Association, the AMA's weekly medical
journal.
</P>
<P>
   At last year's annual meeting, the AMA responded to doctors'
frustration with managed care in a landmark vote to form a union
for doctors, the Physicians for Responsible Negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking ''a new direction'' in the fight, Missouri delegates to
this year's meeting want the AMA to work with states to find
grounds for class-action lawsuits against insurers who deny or
delay payment of legitimate claims.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first such actions by a state medical society, the
California Medical Association last month filed a federal lawsuit
against the three largest for-profit national health plans in
California for allegedly forcing doctors to provide
less-than-adequate health care to patients.
</P>
<P>
   C.C. Swarens of the Missouri State Medical Association said
lawsuits may be the best recourse ''if insurers are going to put up
roadblocks at every occasion, instead of trying to work with the
medical community.''
</P>
<P>
   A managed-care industry spokeswoman said focusing on lawsuits
would be misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many other and better avenues for problem-solving
that don't involve sending things to the courts,'' said Susan
Pisano of the American Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   In related resolutions before the 550-member policy-making House
of Delegates, the AMA is being asked to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Back legislation that would prevent managed care from giving
doctors financial incentives to limit care and to allow patients
unrestricted access to any doctor in a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   -- Develop model legislation banning ''all-products clauses''
that require doctors to accept patients from all health plans
offered by an insurer instead of allowing them to pick and choose
the least restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   -- Launch a publicity campaign urging Congress to amend antitrust
laws to give doctors new rights to bargain collectively with health
maintenance organizations. The House Rules Committee delayed action
on the legislation late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would lift federal antitrust laws banning collective
bargaining by the self-employed -- doctors not employed by a
hospital or a municipality. The AMA says that would benefit
patients by allowing doctors to fight as a group against
restrictions such as limits on testing imposed by managed-care
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say it could disrupt patient care and result in higher
costs. But, like the Physicians for Responsible Negotiations, it
would not give doctors the right to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Several proposals at the meeting address e-medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates will discuss the growing challenge to the AMA as a
provider of medical information, given the rapid growth in
competing health-news sites on the Internet. Dr. E. Ratcliffe
Anderson, Jr., the AMA's executive vice president, said proceeds
from the AMA's $20 million sale of its former headquarters site in
downtown Chicago will go to e-commerce -- ''areas that serve the
public and doctors better.''
</P>
<P>
   One resolution would put the association on the offensive by
asking it to consider launching a grading system for medical
information on the Net. Others seek to protect the privacy of
electronic health records and e-mail between doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   Such issues ''may not currently be the most important thing to
doctors, but they will be in the next five years'' as the transfer
of medical records from paper to electronics becomes complete,
Gostin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really will affect how doctors gain access to medical
information'' and, he said, will affect ''their relationship to
patients in terms of confidentiality.''

<HEADLINE> Rutgers raising housing, dining, student fees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - The Rutgers University Board of
Governors has voted to increase the cost of annual room, board and
fees, and created a new charge for campus residents who will have
access to a campus-wide communications network.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Friday vote, housing costs will increase 4
percent, bringing the cost of a double-occupancy dormitory room up
$134 to $3,482.
</P>
<P>
   Dining services will go up 3 percent, increasing the cost of the
most popular meal plan for first-year students $70 to $2,550.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in student fees will vary from campus to campus,
ranging from 1.9 percent to 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said fees for students at the Camden campus would
increase between 4.3 percent and 6.9 percent to pay for new
athletic programs.
</P>
<P>
   A new fee will be added for dormitory and apartment residents,
who will have access to services through RUNet, a communications
network that eventually will connect all academic and residential
buildings with audio, video and data links.
</P>
<P>
   The network has been installed in 12 academic buildings and 27
residence halls, according to university President Francis L.
Lawrence.

<HEADLINE> Perot Supporters Ousted From Party  </HEADLINE>
By MARY LEE GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- In a coup described by longtime Texas Reform
Party leaders as a ''storming by the Pat Buchanan brigade,''
several supporters of national party founder Ross Perot were
unseated Saturday after hours of infighting before a meeting of
state party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Buchanan brigade has unseated the black and Hispanic
delegates of Bexar County,'' said Paul Truax, founder of the Reform
Party of Texas and a national committee member. ''Apart from being
highly illegal, this is a terrible political blunder.''
</P>
<P>
   As Buchanan's backers fought off Perot loyalists in Texas,
Buchanan himself was on hand in Langhorne, Pa., to accept the
nomination of the Pennsylvania Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative commentator accepted the nomination amid chants
of ''Go, Pat, go'' from 150 delegates after giving a speech in
which he renewed calls for tougher trade restrictions on China.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters in Texas faced a more hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   Ousted delegates from Bexar and Dallas said they were unseated
because Buchanan supporters wanted more power. Buchanan supporters
said they were simply trying to follow the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've just seen the most stupid political move of my life,''
said Truax. He said he plans to contact the Texas Election
Commission on Monday to report violations by Buchanan supporters
and to investigate whether violations of the Voting Rights Act
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But Tim Haley, director of Buchanan's presidential campaign,
said: ''I think those accusations are outrageous. These people are
just trying to go by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Perot nor Buchanan were expected to attend the
convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who bolted from the Republican Party last year,
defeated two other candidates for the Reform Party nomination in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But his campaign to secure his new party's national nomination
has been met with increasing opposition from Perot supporters, who
fear the fiery conservative could make the party's platform more
right-wing.
</P>
<P>
   Perot loyalists have also launched a petition drive to get
Perot's name on the Reform Party ballot. Aides to Perot say the
Texas billionaire has not said what he would do if wins the
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Assad's Death Saddens Israel, U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and Israel expressed sorrow on the death
Saturday of Syrian President Hafez Assad, who faced them across the
Arab-Jewish divide and across the negotiating table for so many
painful years.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli government understands the sorrow of the Syrian
people over the passing of President Hafez Assad,'' said a
statement from the office of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose
moderate government had sought peace with Syria before talks broke
down in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel worked in the past to achieve peace and will continue
to do so in the future,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, too, focused on Assad's moves toward the
peaceful settlement of its long fight with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a strategic choice for peace,'' at the 1991 Madrid
Conference, Clinton said, ''and we worked together to achieve that
goal. ... He made clear Syria's continued commitment to the path of
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our differences, but I always respected him,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The president offered his condolences to the Syrian people and
said, ''We look forward to working with Syria to achieve the goal
of a comprehensive peace.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis, Syria had put aside its
enmity with the United States, Israel's major supporter, to join
the U.S.-led coalition against longtime rival Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where Syria has been unquestioned power since its
soldiers moved in during the 1975-90 civil war, Assad's loss was
described by Prime Minister Salim Hoss as a ''tragedy that struck
Lebanon in the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat declared three days of mourning
in Palestinian areas and sent a telegram to the Damascus government
saying his people ''will stand with their brothers, the Syrian
people, to overcome this difficult moment.''
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac said his nation supported
Assad's vision for stability, security and prosperity and would
''spare no effort to help (future) leaders fulfill this strong and
generous ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said Assad's most
important goal in the last year of his life was achieving a peace
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately he didn't experience this,'' Persson said. ''I
wish his successor prosperity in his new role and hope that he will
succeed in bringing the peace process to a successful close.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad, credited with bringing political stability to a country
that experienced a series of coups after independence from France
in 1946, dreamed of becoming the unchallenged leader of the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
   His attempts to rally other Arab leaders to present a unified
front against Israel gained little ground, and Assad has clashed
with Arafat for control of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent peace talks between Israel and Syria broke down
over Assad's insistence on Israel's withdrawal from the strategic
Golan Heights, which it captured during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war,
and Israel's refusal to make that commitment before security
arrangements and normalization were spelled out.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, which withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon on May
24 after an 18-year-occupation, said Saturday it hoped quiet would
be maintained along the border with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair called Assad ''a figure of
stability in the Middle East and much respected in the Arab world
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best testimony to President Assad's memory would be for
all involved to redouble their efforts to bring a just and lasting
peace to the region and I will do everything I can to support their
efforts,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said his country's relations
with Syria had been improving.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am confident that the positive improvement will continue,''
he told television news.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and Syria have been at odds for years over Turkish
charges that Syria was harboring Kurdish rebels. Relations improved
after Ankara forced Damascus to expel Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan two years ago. But the two countries are still at
loggerheads over sharing the waters of the Euphrates River.
</P>
<P>
   ''We share in the grief of our brothers, the Syrian people,''
Cem said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin called Assad ''a friend of our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Assad was one of the most outstanding figures of our time''
who had played ''a historic role in the development of Syria,''
Putin said.

   LONDON (AP) -- Police raided the kitchen of Buckingham Palace and
found a small amount of marijuana, Scotland Yard said Saturday. No
arrests were made.
</P>
<P>
   ''A very small quantity of a cannabis plant was discovered and
has been taken away by police for examination,'' a Yard spokesman
said on condition of anonymity. The amount involved was minute, he
said, and it was uncertain if further action would be taken.

Albright To Attend Assad Funeral
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- The White House announced today that Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright would represent the United States at Syrian President
Hafez Assad's funeral. Spokesman Joe Lockhart confirmed that neither President
Clinton nor Vice President Al Gore would attend the service. ''I think the
president believes that Secretary Albright is the appropriate person to
attend,'' he said. He declined to say whether Clinton had been advised not to
make the trip. Assad, 69, died Saturday before he was able to win back the
treasured Golan Heights he lost to the Jewish state 33 years ago. The skillful
and ruthless leader had been suffering from heart problems.

Strong Quake Jolts Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook central Taiwan on Sunday,
causing rock slides and injuring more than a dozen people, officials and
seismologists said. No deaths were reported. The quake, with a preliminary
magnitude of 6.7, was centered about 30 miles north of Mount Yu, Taiwan's
highest mountain, about 180 miles south of the capital, Taipei, the Central
Weather Bureau said. A 7.6-magnitude quake devastated the region in September,
killing 2,400 people and destroying thousands of homes. Since the earthquake,
more than 12,000 aftershocks and minor tremors have rattled Taiwan. Most have
been harmless.

expectations. ''The picture of two leaders smiling and shaking hands, the
picture itself is a great message for world peace,'' South Korean Culture and
Tourism Minister Park Jie-won said. The three-day summit between South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, which starts Monday
in Pyongyang, caps six months of vigorous diplomacy with China, Italy,
Australia, the United States and other countries. Prospects for reconciliation
remain unclear.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Five years after a landmark U.N. conference set
women's equality as an achievable goal, more than 180 nations agreed today on
new measures to accelerate the international campaign to reach it. The new
document included tougher measures to combat domestic violence and sex
trafficking, and to tackle the impact of HIV/AIDS and globalization on women.
Despite an all-night session, virtually no progress was made on the most
contentious issues -- including access to safe abortion, sexual rights, sexual

one of its kind among the major airlines. The discount begins Thursday and will
be based on a sliding scale, starting at $25 and depending on the price of the
passenger's ticket, Northwest spokeswoman Mary Beth Schubert said Saturday. In
addition to the discount, a letter of apology from Northwest will be attached to
the handle of delayed luggage, she said.

Commendable Wins the Belmont Stakes

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Commendable, whose only previous victory was a maiden race
last August, snapped a six-race losing streak and won the Belmont Stakes on a
sweltering Saturday. The victory was the fourth Belmont win for D. Wayne Lukas
and the 13th victory in a Triple Crown race for the Hall of Fame trainer.
Commendable, ridden by Pat Day, who won the Belmont for the third time, took
charge on the final turn and turned back all challengers. Missing from the
11-horse field were Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness winner
Red Bullet. It was the first time since 1970 that the Derby and Preakness winner
both missed the Belmont.

<HEADLINE> Massive fire at vacant factory evacuates neighborhoods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOHAWK, N.Y. (AP) - A huge fire at a sprawling old factory
brightened the night sky for miles Friday and forced the evacuation
of a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported, although a couple of
firefighters were overcome by heat.
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out about 7 p.m. at the brick building commonly
known as the old Duofold building, in recent years called the
Mohawk Valley Warehouse. Flames poured from windows and a tower
roof and walls collapsed. Inside, fire silhouetted the stairwells
and large beams.
</P>
<P>
   The old factory is in a residential area, and officials ordered
residents to leave. Thirty-five to 40 homes were evacuated, Mohawk
Assistant Fire Chief Rob Phillips told the Utica Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips wouldn't speculate on what might have caused the fire
in the former textile mill, which once employed hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Leo Kinville declared a state of emergency, which allowed
the village to request state aid.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Morse, who lives on East Main and Elizabeth streets, three
houses from the fire, said neighbors were fearful.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our back door was hot. Our cars were hot,'' Morse said from
the other side of East Main Street. ''My kids were in the back; I
told them to get in the house ... I started dragging all the kids
in the house. Then they came and told us to evacuate.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents said they were surprised at how fast -
merely seconds - the whole building went from being cloaked in
billowing smoke to a full-blown fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Blais of Warren Street was in his back yard. When he got to
the front, smoke started pouring out of the factory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then it went,'' Blais said. ''And when it went, it went - with
a boom.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's lucky there's no wind, or this would have been a lot
worse,'' said Mitchell Reale, owner of Warren Street Antiques and
Collectibles, as he watched the fire from his porch.
</P>
<P>
   At least one owner had high hopes for the old building, once the
home of long underwear manufacturer Duofold, which also had sites
in Ilion and Utica. But environmental problems dogged the property.
And any renovations would have incurred a large expense.
</P>
<P>
   It fell into Herkimer County's hands in the late 1990s and had
been sold to Paula Cogen of Fitchburg, Mass. She could not be
reached late Friday.

state that are AP members.
</P>
<P>
   The honors were given out Saturday night at the NYSAPBA's annual
awards banquet held at a Saratoga Springs hotel.

<HEADLINE> Fan Shot at Royals-Pirates Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A fan was shot and wounded in the stands
at Kauffman Stadium during a Kansas City Royals-Pittsburgh Pirates
game, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a second shot struck another fan's chair in the
upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they don't know whether the shots came from inside
or outside the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The fan, Virginia Olsthoorn, 64, of Haysville, Kan., was sitting
in the lower level along the right-field line about 10 p.m. Friday
when she was hit by a bullet that passed through part of her
abdomen and hit her left elbow, said Royals spokesman Jim Lachimia.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was able to walk to the stadium's first-aid station
and was taken to Truman Medical Center. The woman was hospitalized
overnight and released early Saturday, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City police spokesman Sgt. Floyd Mitchell said witnesses
reported hearing a ''pop'' and then the woman was hit by the
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said a second shot was reported just after 10 p.m. A
woman leaning forward in her upper deck seat also heard a loud pop.
When she looked back, she saw a hole in her seat and a bullet on
the ground behind her. She was uninjured.
</P>
<P>
   Police initially believed the first shot came from a hillside
outside the stadium, behind right and center field. But both shots
are now under investigation to determine if they were fired from
inside or outside the stadium, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests had been made Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Hatfields and McCoys Play Softball  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY HEFLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIKEVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Softball bats were the weapons of choice
Saturday as the Hatfields and McCoys took each other on during a
friendly game of softball.
</P>
<P>
   ''We kind of took a beating in the last one, so we kind of
wanted to win,'' said Billy Jack McCoy, referring to the bitter
post-Civil War feud that look the lives of five of family patriarch
Randolph McCoy's children.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfields and McCoys sat next to each other in the stands during
the event touted as a way to end the feud once and for all. They
cheered, booed and even made a few jokes about getting their guns
following a bad call.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't be shooting anybody, but we'll sure be giving the
jabs,'' said Pam McCoy Brooks, of Harold, explaining before the
game what she'd do if the McCoys were victorious.
</P>
<P>
   The McCoys came away with bragging rights, winning the
five-inning game 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 feud descendants and curious members of the public
gathered in Pikeville for the second day of the first mass
gathering between the historic enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion has also had a serious tone. Many descendants said
they want to use their last names to promote tourism in the
economically depressed region, and to help debunk stereotypes about
mountain folk that stem partially from coverage of the feud.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to a group photo with the two families, Gov. Paul Patton
praised the descendants for coming to Pikeville, and advised them
to ''take pride in the fact that you are descended from a hearty
mountain stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Patton's speech, a teary-eyed Ron McCoy, a reunion
organizer from Durham, N.C., read the names of the 12 people who
died as a result of the feud, and then directed the crowd to take a
moment of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many men and women gave their lives and shed their blood as
part of this feud and they all did it in the name of family and
honor, family honor was above all the most important thing to them
and to us here,'' Ron McCoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict associated with the feud between the McCoys of Kentucky
and the Hatfields of West Virginia ended by 1900. It's not clear
what exactly initiated the gunfire, but competition over timber
resources and a trial over a stolen pig escalated tensions between
the two families.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the event provided an opportunity for members of both
families to meet each other. Others grew up together.
</P>
<P>
   Diana McCoy, who grew up in West Virginia near the Hatfield
homeplace, said she attended school with some Hatfields. When she
found out one had a crush on her, she said she didn't return the
affection.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said it's good to be friends, but not that good of
friends,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Assad Son Clears Leadership Hurdle  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- President Hafez Assad had two vice
presidents to fill in for him, but within hours of his death
Saturday, the Syrian parliament pushed them aside and voted to
clear the way for the ascension of the 34-year-old son who had been
groomed for power.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has held no political office, no senior party post
and no significant military position -- the usual requirements for
leadership in authoritarian Syria. But the late president had given
Bashar several tasks, both at home and in neighboring Lebanon, to
thrust him into public roles and recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The president died exactly one week before a Baath Party
congress that was expected to give Bashar a senior party position
and set him on the path to higher office. Instead, less than two
hours after the public announcement of the president's death,
parliament amended the constitution to lower the age limit for the
presidency from 40 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the Syrian constitution provides for a vice
president to take over if the presidency becomes vacant. But there
was little doubt Saturday that the late president's wish was being
honored and that Bashar Assad, a British-educated ophthalmologist,
was headed for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing of Assad's death, a few hundred people gathered in
the streets near the presidential palace, chanting ''With our
souls, with our blood, we will protect you, O Bashar.''
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Lebanon, where Syria wields enormous influence,
some leaders were already referring to Bashar on Saturday night as
''the next president'' of Syria and ''the bearer of his father's
message.''
</P>
<P>
   The late president started preparing Bashar for leadership after
the death of his eldest son, Basil, in a traffic accident in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He had sent him abroad on official visits, giving Bashar a forum
for international exposure. At home, Bashar was proclaimed the
leader of a campaign to fight corruption in the government -- which
also gave him a platform to eliminate potential rivals within the
old guard of the military and civilian establishments.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar holds the rank of colonel in the army. Syria's armed
forces and intelligence branches are at the heart of control in
this nation of 15 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, several senior army officers have been retired
and powerful intelligence chiefs were sent packing. Former
intelligence chief Brig. Bashir Najjar was sentenced to 12 years in
jail for corruption. Mahmoud el-Zoubi, prime minister since 1987,
was fired in March and committed suicide two months later rather
than face arrest in a corruption investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar was expected to receive his first formal leadership job
at the party congress June 17 that would, in turn, have paved the
way to name him a vice president in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, another route was quickly opened. Bashar cleared a
major constitutional hurdle Saturday when parliament members, some
weeping over Assad's death, overwhelmingly voted to amend an
article in the constitution that requires the head of state to be
at least 40 years old. The legislators voted to lower the age to 34
and then adjourned until June 25. Bashar turns 35 in August.
</P>
<P>
   Syria currently has two vice presidents, both of whom have
served since 1984: Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Zuheir Masharqa.
Khaddam, a former foreign minister and longtime Assad aide, is
first vice president but reportedly fell out of favor in the past
two years as Bashar's star rose amid the anti-corruption campaign
that engulfed Syria's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether Assad specified that his other vice
president should take over in an interim period. Masharqa has been
in charge of political and Baath Party affairs and is thought to
have little influence with the military.
</P>
<P>
   While the president was hospitalized and recovering from a heart
attack in 1983, Assad's younger brother, Rifaat, attempted a coup.
Despite the failed take over bid, Rifaat was named a vice president
the following year, but exiled soon thereafter. Since then, he has
lived in France.

<HEADLINE> N.H. Crisis May Warrant Impeachment  </HEADLINE>
By NORMA LOVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Alleged improprieties by New Hampshire's
chief justice more than a decade ago appear serious enough to
warrant impeachment, two top lawmakers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Donna Sytek and Deputy Speaker Donnalee Lozeau
said newly released documents appear to show Chief Justice David
Brock guilty of maladministration -- one of four impeachable
offenses listed in the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Sytek and Lozeau said they would make their final judgments
after six days of public questioning, scheduled to begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be able to look him in the eye,'' Lozeau said.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's actions were revealed in depositions made public Friday
by the House Judiciary Committee. The committee began investigating
the state Supreme Court in April, after Attorney General Philip
McLaughlin accused four of its five members of ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four, Justice Stephen Thayer, resigned March 31
rather than face criminal prosecution for trying to influence his
own divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   Brock, the chief justice, is accused of calling a lower court
judge in 1987 about a case involving then-Senate Majority Leader
Edward Dupont. Brock allegedly reminded the judge that Dupont could
help win pay raises for the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Brock has denied making the call.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation came to light when Dupont complained that the
lower-court judge, Douglas Gray, made improper comments about his
position on judicial pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   The other Supreme Court justices, including now-U.S. Supreme
Court Justice David Souter, determined that Brock had made the call
and that Gray could reasonably assume Brock was trying to influence
him.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than report Gray immediately to the Judicial Conduct
Committee, the justices held onto the complaint -- missing the
one-year deadline for considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Brock said the matter ''slipped through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Brock told the Judiciary Committee that in 1989 ''a
lightbulb went off and I remembered we hadn't followed up on
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it was too late for the Conduct Committee to consider the
complaint, the court asked a Superior Court judge to look into it.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Upton, committee chairman at the time, said the call
was ''the most innocuous thing you can imagine,'' and that the
justices' handling of it was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition, made public Friday, Brock said the justices
did not file Dupont's complaint immediately with the Conduct
Committee because it came from a politician involved in the court's
budget. They did not want to appear to be partial, Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not a unilateral decision by Justice Brock,'' Brock's
lawyer, David Barry, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Mock said he had not
heard a good reason for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''Collectively, it presents a very troubling picture of the
court,'' Sytek said.
</P>
<P>
   To impeach any of the justices, the House Judiciary Committee
would have to recommend impeachment, the House would have to vote
on the recommendation, and the Senate would then hold a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to make its recommendation this
summer.

<HEADLINE> Haiti Opposition Candidate Released  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Haitian authorities released an
opposition candidate and four associates Saturday, nearly three
weeks after they were arrested following regional elections, an
opposition leader said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities dropped charges of incitement to violence against
candidate Jean Limongy and the four others, said Evans Paul of
Limongy's Space for Concord five-party coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Limongy, a candidate for a lower house seat, and the others were
arrested May 23, two days after local and legislative elections.
More than 2 million Haitian voters, about 60 percent of the
electorate, cast their ballots in the violence-free elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Lavalas Family party of former President Jean-Bertrand
Aristide gained control of the upper house and was leading in most
lower-house races as vote counting continued this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since the vote, police have arrested at least 37 opposition
candidates and activists. Sixteen have been released.
</P>
<P>
   Space for Concord militant Laurore Noel, who was arrested with
Limongy, remained in prison in Petit-Goave jail, about 35 miles
southwest of the capital, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, three candidates projected as the winners for
seats on the Port-au-Prince city council under Aristide's Lavalas
Family banner were arrested on charges of having false police
identification cards.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for legislative seats in Haiti's troubled Grand'-Anse
district, where the vote was delayed due to technical difficulties,
are set for Sunday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a Parliament since President Rene Preval
dismissed legislators in 1999 to resolve a power struggle.

<HEADLINE> Farmer stages library sit-in to protest public library's e-mail policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALONE, N.Y. (AP) - A farmer staged a one-man sit-in to protest
a public library's e-mail ban on its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ritchie says the policy violates his First Amendment rights
and prevents struggling businesses from communicating.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Chateaugay resident was charged Friday afternoon
with trespassing and disorderly conduct at the Wead Library in this
rural village, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The library's Board of Directors decided not to allow e-mail use
''as long as there are chat rooms and with what goes on with
enticing youngsters,'' said David Minnick, library director.
Libraries that allow e-mail use, he said, ''are occasionally in
trouble because of individuals who misuse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, who says he is also a high school English teacher, says
the policy may be intended to prevent Internet predators, but he
was engaged in business - communicating with other farmers about
sheep and goat marketing - when Minnick told him to stop using
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without this kind of access, none of us could do this,'' he
said. ''It's expensive for us as farmers to use computer equipment
and the service is so lousy in rural areas in the first place. I've
got drawers full of burned-out modems.''
</P>
<P>
   The library, Ritchie said, is ''standing in the way of poor
people and businessman to look for jobs and use online services.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnick asked Ritchie to leave, both said, but Ritchie refused
as what he called an act of civil disobedience. He told Minnick he
wanted to be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In 43 years of library work, Minnick said it's the first time
he's asked police to arrest a patron.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is located in Franklin County about 10 miles south of the
Canadian border.

<HEADLINE> Four Die in Baltimore Rowhouse Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A burning candle in the hallway of a home
without electricity caused a fire that killed three children and
their grandmother in a rowhouse early Saturday, fire officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth child was hospitalized, fire department spokesman Mike
Maybin said.
</P>
<P>
   A Baltimore Gas &AMP; Electric Co. spokeswoman said power had been
cut off to the home since July for failure to pay the utility. The
home did not have smoke detectors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials identified the victims as Lily Bell Posley, 53;
Marquan Williams, 6; Nigerra McCray, 4; and Shydein Scott, 2.
Dominique Derrico, 10, was listed in critical condition. The
children's mother was not home when the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the fire was extinguished, neighbors wrote messages
on plywood that covered the front door and left stuffed dolls at
the home.
</P>
<P>
   One message read: ''I will always keep yall in my heart no
matter where I go and what I do.''

<HEADLINE> Irish tenor Frank Patterson dead at 58  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Frank Patterson, the Irish tenor who sang to
worldwide audiences including presidents and the pope, died
Saturday at a New York hospital. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson had been diagnosed with cancer last month and had been
undergoing radiation therapy, said his manager, Vincent Mitchell.
He had been at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center since
Tuesday, after his condition took an unexpected turn for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a Westchester County resident, sang on some of the
world's most famous stages, including the Royal Albert Hall in
London and Carnegie Hall in New York. He performed at the White
House twice, along with wife Eily O'Grady, for Ronald Reagan and
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a great friend of the Irish-American community,'' said
former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, who said he had been friends with
Patterson for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   '' He's been a great figure, almost a symbol of success of the
Irish in America.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sang twice for Pope John Paul II, in Ireland and in New
York. He was also a favorite of Cardinal John O'Connor, and had
been scheduled to perform at O'Connor's funeral last month. But
that day, he was rushed to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a good relationship with the archdiocese and with the
cardinal personally,'' said Joe Zwilling, a spokesman for the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of New York. ''He was always ready to donate
his time and his talent to church activities. ... He was one of the
cardinal's favorite singers.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson took his talent to the silver screen, playing a tenor
in the films ''The Dead'' and ''Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tipperary County, Ireland, Patterson started his vocal
studies in 1962. Those skills took him to Paris, where a radio
broadcast caught the attention of the Philips Record Company.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson went on to record 36 albums in six languages, covering
opera, inspirational songs, and Irish ballads.
</P>
<P>
   His last performance was June 4, at Regis College in Boston,
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife, Patterson is survived by his mother and his
son, Eamon.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said a Mass for Patterson will be celebrated at 10 a.m.
Wednesday at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He said Patterson will be
buried in Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Union Activists, Immigrants Rally  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chanting and waving flags of every color, a
crowd of union activists and church leaders joined forces with
thousands of illegal immigrants Saturday to push for rights for
undocumented workers.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of demonstrators marched around the Los Angeles Sports
Arena, then crammed inside until fire officials locked the doors to
prevent a safety hazard, leaving an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people
outside.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere inside seemed more like a fiesta than a
conference as 13,000 people feasted on tacos and burritos while a
band played Mexican music.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was sponsored by the AFL-CIO in an effort to
repeal a 14-year-old federal law banning employers from hiring
illegal immigrants. The nation's estimated 6 million undocumented
laborers could be a large new power base for unions.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor officials have called for amnesty for
undocumented workers, saying the 1986 law only punishes laborers,
not the businesses that exploit them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are on the side of working people everywhere,'' Linda
Chavez-Thompson, an AFL-CIO executive vice president, told the
crowd. ''We don't care whether their families came here on the
Mayflower or slave ships 400 years ago, or 100 years ago through
Ellis Island, or 25 years ago on a plane from Manila, or last year
across the Mexican border.''
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Sepulveda, an undocumented worker at a Los Angeles auto
repair shop, attended the rally wearing a Statue of Liberty crown
on his head and handcuffs. His white T-shirt was emblazoned with
the words: ''Do you know where the liberty is?''
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes they take one look at you, see you are Latino and
know this is someone who gets low pay,'' he said. ''But this is the
United States. We're supposed to have rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Peru, Mexico, Thailand, Korea and numerous other
countries filled the arena waving their home country flags and
American flags. Many said they were illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Rally organizers hoped to generate support for their cause and
get suggestions for an alternative U.S. policy on immigrant
workers. The current law can be used to deport or fire illegal
workers if they complain about labor violations, low wages or lax
safety standards, Chavez-Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders want a new policy that would make it easier to
unionize undocumented laborers and harder for employers to punish
workplace whistleblowers, she said. It also would help eradicate
so-called sweatshop conditions and improve safety and wages for
undocumented laborers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO still objects to increasing the number of immigrants
allowed to work in the country legally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The system is broken and we're here to fix it,'' she said.
''In Los Angeles, they know what those problems are, and we're
hoping that people here can tell us what would work best for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion has been to form worker centers where immigrants
could go to learn about their rights, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant and hotel cleaning woman in
Salinas, told the crowd her employer tried to fire workers who
formed a union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bosses will use immigration against us when they can't beat us
other ways,'' she said. ''Amnesty will give all workers the right
to win respect.''

By The Associated PressPhilip ''Bing'' Adams
<TEXT>
<P>
   KITTERY, Maine (AP) -- Philip ''Bing'' Adams, who founded the
Kittery Trading Post and was an avid sportsman who loved the Maine
woods, died Friday after a brief illness. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, Adams, then 22, established the trading post, a
360-square-foot building on two acres of what was then a sparsely
settled U.S. 1 in Kittery. The business featured a set of gas pumps
and a large sign advertising ''clean rest rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The family business, which in its early years sold moccasins,
guns, ammunition and sporting goods, became a popular stop-off for
Maine-bound tourists. Its retail space expanded over the years to
45,000 square feet and the business now has a work force of more
than 300.
</P>
<P>
   Adams couldn't resist a good bargain -- at one time supplementing
his stock with straw hats and old-fashioned, ladies' button-down
shoes -- and wasn't past trading the boots on his feet for a good
gun someone brought in, said his daughter, Lisa J. Adams.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, he also raised mink in the back yard and
started accepting deer hides in trade for merchandise -- a practice
the Trading Post continues today.
</P>
<P>
   For 35 years, Adams, his wife, Mary, and many of their 14
children lived in apartments above the Trading Post.
</P>
<P>
   Adams retired in 1961 at age 45, selling the business to his
21-year-old son, Kevin Q. Adams, who retired in 1986. At that
point, brothers Gary, Philip and Kim, and Kevin's son, Kevin Jr.,
took over.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the store was an informal community center and
gathering place where horse traders and Adams' pals would gather
around the woodstove swapping gossip and hunting stories late into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't minding the store, Adams practiced the sports he
specialized in, searching for prize fish or game.
Hafez Assad
</P>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Hafez Assad, Syria's autocratic president
who dreamed of Arab unity but watched his neighbors sign peace
deals with Israel, died Saturday before he was able to win back the
treasured Golan Heights he lost to the Jewish state 33 years ago.
He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the skillful and ruthless leader could deal a blow
to Mideast peace prospects by ushering in a prolonged period of
instability, but it could also mean an opportunity for Syria to
forsake at least part of its implacable enmity toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian parliament moved to clear the way for Assad's son,
Bashar, to assume the presidency, amending the constitution to
lower the minimum age for presidents to 34 -- Bashar's age.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a career air force officer who took power in a bloodless
coup in 1970, has been grooming Bashar for future leadership, but
the British-educated ophthalmologist has held no major political
office.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had suffered from heart problems, lymphoma and kidney
failure, according to a Lebanese heart surgeon close to the Assad
family. The surgeon, who insisted on anonymity, said Assad died of
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   The country Assad led was isolated and economically troubled.
But Syria's president for three decades never hinted he saw himself
as a man defeated.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point were on-again, off-again negotiations with
archenemy Israel. Analysts had said the 1999 election of moderate
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was Assad's last chance to win
back the strategic Golan Heights captured in 1967, when Assad was
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   When his army regained a slice of the Golan in 1973 fighting,
Assad went himself to raise the Syrian flag there, demonstrating
the area's political importance.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad was not to be hurried or pressured in talks that
resumed in December after a hiatus of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   Assad built a Soviet-style personality cult at home and his
portrait was plastered everywhere. His rise was an extraordinary
feat for a man who began life as a peasant boy from the minority
Alawite Muslim sect, born Oct. 6, 1930 in Syria's coastal hills. He
plotted his way to power through the ranks of the military and the
socialist Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
   He worked long hours and prided himself on managing the most
minute details of his administration. His discipline extended to
his private life -- he was a vegetarian who abstained from alcohol,
but rumors about ill health have dogged him since a heart attack in
1983.
Joseph Cooley
</P>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. (AP) -- Joseph Cooley, who rose from reporter to top
editor in his 44 years at The Record in Troy, died Thursday. He was
83.
</P>
<P>
   He was top editor for 11 years until his retirement in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known him all my life. He was a wonderful man, generous,
warm,'' said Lisa Robert Lewis, the current editor who started in
1976 as an intern. ''He truly set the standard for community
journalism. He was probably the best example I've seen of that in
my 24-year career in this market.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the U.S. Harness Writers' Association and a
past president of the New York State Society of Newspaper Editors.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley left the newspaper in World War II to serve in the Army
from 1942 to 1945. He was stationed in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, he wrote a weekly column for the newspaper
for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Dorothy Reed Cooley and seven
children.
Frank Patterson
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Frank Patterson, the Irish tenor who sang to
worldwide audiences including presidents and the pope, died
Saturday. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was diagnosed with cancer last month and had been
undergoing radiation therapy, said his manager, Vincent Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a Westchester County resident, sang on some of the
world's most famous stages, including the Royal Albert Hall in
London and Carnegie Hall in New York. He performed at the White
House twice, along with wife Eily O'Grady, for Ronald Reagan and
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also sang twice for Pope John Paul II, in Ireland and in New
York. He was also a favorite of Cardinal John O'Connor, and had
been scheduled to perform at O'Connor's funeral last month. But
that day, he was rushed to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson took his talent to the silver screen, playing a tenor
in the films ''The Dead'' and ''Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tipperary County, Ireland, Patterson started his vocal
studies in 1962. Those skills took him to Paris, where a radio
broadcast caught the attention of the Philips Record Company.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson went on to record 36 albums in six languages, covering
opera, inspirational songs, and Irish ballads.
Judd Rose
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Judd Rose, an Emmy-winning investigative
reporter for CNN and ABC whose stories ranged from war and
corruption to irreverent takes on pop culture, died Saturday. He
was 45.
</P>
<P>
   Rose died of brain cancer Saturday morning at his home, CNN
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rose won four Emmy awards, including honors for his coverage of
Princess Diana's funeral and the fall of Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   He was an anchor of ''NewsStand,'' a joint venture of CNN and
Time magazine and the cable network's most prominent magazine
program.
</P>
<P>
   As an anchor of ''CNN &AMP; Entertainment Weekly,'' which preceded
''NewsStand,'' Rose combined a love for the entertainment industry
and an irreverent style to report on film, television and music.
His work for CNN included profiles of Frank Sinatra, actor Ian
McKellan and director Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC, Rose contributed reports to several magazine programs,
including ''Nightline.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Irish Tenor Patterson Dies at 58  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Frank Patterson, the Irish tenor who sang to
worldwide audiences including presidents and the pope, died
Saturday at a New York hospital. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was diagnosed with cancer last month and had been
undergoing radiation therapy, said his manager, Vincent Mitchell.
He had been hospitalized at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson, a Westchester County resident, sang on some of the
world's most famous stages, including the Royal Albert Hall in
London and Carnegie Hall in New York. He performed at the White
House twice, along with wife Eily O'Grady.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a great friend of the Irish-American community,'' said
former Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, who said he had been friends with
Patterson for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a great figure,'' Flynn said, ''almost a symbol of
success of the Irish in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson also took his talent to the silver screen, playing a
tenor in the films ''The Dead'' and ''Michael Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   He sang twice for Pope John Paul II, in Ireland and in New York.
And he had been scheduled to sing at the funeral of New York's
Cardinal John O'Connor on May 8, but that day, he was rushed to the
hospital where doctors diagnosed his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tipperary County, Ireland, Patterson started his vocal
studies in 1962. Those skills took him to Paris, where a radio
broadcast caught the attention of the Philips Record Company.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson went on to record 36 albums in six languages, covering
opera, inspirational songs and Irish ballads.
</P>
<P>
   His last performance was June 4, at Regis College in Boston,
Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his wife, Patterson is survived by his mother and his
son, Eamon. A Mass for Patterson was scheduled for Wednesday at St.
Patrick's Cathedral, and Patterson will be buried in Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Federal probe ordered into Buffalo-area rail problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y.(AP) - Federal officials gave the two companies
controlling Buffalo-area rail transport 90 days to offer a solution
to service problems said to be crippling local industry.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Surface Transportation Board, responding to a request
from Rep. Jack Quinn, R-Hamburg, ordered CSX Corp. and Norfolk
Southern railroads to ''meet with shippers,railroads, and other
interested parties'' to propose solutions, estimate costs and offer
a timetable for improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said he hoped the order would result in better movement of
goods in and out of the region, ''allowing our economy to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations with plants in western New York say CSX's ongoing
computer problems mean cars going over their rails en route to
Norfolk Southern lines are bumped back and forth and getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they criticize Norfolk Southern for lacking adequate
local track space.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Paul Tokasz, D-Cheektowaga, said the state
Legislature is poised to pass $35 million in railroad property tax
relief over five years. In exchange, Tokasz said, the railroads
would be expected to make investments in area infrastructure such
as a new draw bridge over the Buffalo River and an intermodal
rail-truck transfer point.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sullivan, spokesman for CSX, said the company plans to spend
$65 million through 2003 in New York State, with nearly a quarter
of the money going to the Buffalo area.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Norfolk Southern, Ron Husband, said his company
continues to support construction of a new rail span across the
Buffalo River, but cautioned ''we have not made any firm financial
commitment yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The state has informally committed spending $10 million to
building a replacement for the closed CP Draw bridge.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Corp. and the rail unit of rival Norfolk Southern Corp. have
been troubled by service and safety problems - as well as
plummeting stock prices - resulting from their June 1, 1999 breakup
of Conrail Inc., the Philadelphia-based freight railroad.
</P>
<P>
   In April, CSX President Ronald Conway was removed by John W.
Snow, chairman and chief executive of the company, who took the
helm of the $10.8 billion company's rail unit himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conway seemed to underestimate the challenges of taking over
CSX's 42 percent of Conrail. Last fall, he told analysts CSX had
resolved its Conrail breakup problems and was ready to reap the
benefits of serving the key Northeastern markets it gained. But at
a January forum in Philadelphia, 300 shippers protested that
breakup problems persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Shippers have also expressed outrage over service delays and
disruptions since the 1996 Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints led the transportation board to approve a moratorium
on new rail mergers in March.

<HEADLINE> Dave Winfield Returns To San Diego  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Dave Winfield was back in uniform in San Diego
on Saturday night, 27 years after starting his major league career
with the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced earlier in the day as the newest member of the
Padres' Hall of Fame, Winfield then took batting practice in a
group that included Tony Gwynn, a fellow member of the 3,000-hit
club.
</P>
<P>
   Winfield, sweating heavily after his session, hit one home run
but otherwise looked like a 48-year-old who's been out of baseball
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little tired,'' Winfield said. ''Baseball players work
hard. That's what I did for 22 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfield received warm applause from the fans who were in the
stands two hours before the Padres' game against the Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the first you've seen me swing the bat in five years
with a guy throwing it in there,'' Winfield said. ''But that's all
right. I was just glad to be out here as part of a really good day
for me. It's an honor to be selected for the Hall of Fame down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfield will be inducted into the Padres' Hall of Fame on Aug.
19, joining Randy Jones, Nate Colbert and the late Ray Kroc.
</P>
<P>
   Winfield, who'll be eligible for election to the baseball Hall
of Fame in 2001, joined the Padres straight out of college in 1973
and played with the Padres for eight seasons before signing as a
free agent with the New York Yankees. He also played with the
California Angels, Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He retired following the 1995 season with 3,110 hits, 465 home
runs, 1,833 RBIs and a .283 average.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Hafez Assad Dies  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Hafez Assad, Syria's autocratic president
who dreamed of Arab unity but watched his neighbors sign peace
deals with Israel, died Saturday before he was able to win back the
treasured Golan Heights he lost to the Jewish state 33 years ago.
Assad, 69, had been suffering from heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the skillful and ruthless leader could deal a blow
to Mideast peace prospects by ushering in a prolonged period of
instability, but it could also mean an opportunity for Syria to
forsake at least part of its implacable enmity toward Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian parliament moved to clear the way for Assad's son,
Bashar, to assume the presidency, amending the constitution to
lower the minimum age for presidents to 34 -- Bashar's age. Then
parliament adjourned until June 25. No funeral plans were
immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread in Syria, a few hundred people gathered in the
streets near the presidential palace, chanting: ''With our souls,
with our blood, we will protect you, O Bashar.'' More police than
usual were on the streets in this heavily policed state.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's red-black-and-white flags were lowered to half-staff.
Stores closed. Secondary school exams, scheduled this weekend, were
postponed until next week. Loudspeakers at government buildings,
hotels and other establishments resounded with verses from the
Koran, Islam's holy scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a day of sadness and sorrow in every home, school,
university, farm, factory and quarry,'' an announcer on state-run
television said. ''Sadness is in the heart of every man, woman and
child. ... The legacy of his accomplishments and ideas is a planet
that will shine not just on this generation, but also on coming
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Israel, two countries with which Syria
often is at odds, expressed sorrow, and condolences poured from the
Middle East and capitals around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our differences, but I always respected him,''
President Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, a career air force officer who took power in a bloodless
coup in 1970, has been grooming Bashar for future leadership, but
the British-educated ophthalmologist has held no major political
office.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bashar has been going abroad as his father's special
envoy. At home, he has been waging an anti-corruption campaign. He
was expected to be brought into the ruling Baath Party leadership
at a congress to open June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's constitution provides for a vice president to take over
if the presidency is vacated. Syria currently has two vice
presidents: Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Zuheir Masharqa. Khaddam is
first vice president, but reportedly fell out of favor in the past
two years as Bashar's star rose.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known whether Assad specified that Masharqa take over
in an interim period. He has been in charge of political and Baath
Party affairs and is thought to have little influence with the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had suffered from heart problems, lymphoma and kidney
failure, according to a Lebanese heart surgeon close to the Assad
family. The surgeon, who insisted on anonymity, said Assad died of
heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian television showed members of the nation's parliament
standing, heads bowed in the chamber for a moment of silence,
wiping away tears. Soon after, the television switched to Koranic
recitations, a standard practice in the Muslim world following a
leader's death.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, somber new posters showing the late president with
Bashar appeared on car windows; black ribbons were tied to car
radio antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese President Emil Lahoud, in a letter to Bashar, wrote
that he was the last to speak to the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last phrase he told me was that our fate is to build for
our children an assuring future and it is our duty to make sure
they inherit better than what we inherited,'' Lahoud said in a
letter distributed by his office. ''Then there was a sudden silence
and the line broke off.''
</P>
<P>
   The country Assad led was isolated and economically troubled.
But Syria's president for three decades never hinted he saw himself
as a man defeated.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point was on-again, off-again negotiations with
archenemy Israel. Analysts had said the 1999 election of moderate
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was Assad's last chance to win
back the strategic Golan Heights, captured in 1967. The loss of the
Heights, which occurred while Assad was defense minister, was a
blow to his pride.
</P>
<P>
   When his army regained a slice of the Golan in 1973 fighting,
Assad went himself to raise the Syrian flag there, demonstrating
the area's political importance.
</P>
<P>
   But Assad was not to be hurried or pressured in talks that
resumed in December after a hiatus of nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were suspended in January when Syria insisted
Israel commit to returning to prewar 1967 borders. Israel sought
lines closer to the 1923 colonial border and insisted on retaining
sovereignty over a strip of land also claimed by Syria along the
shores of the Sea of Galilee, a key water source.
</P>
<P>
   The wily Assad often succeeded by keeping both foes and friends
guessing, reversing course suddenly when he saw an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Syria put aside enmity with the United States to join the
U.S.-led coalition against its longtime rival Iraq during the
1990-91 Gulf crisis. Assad sent troops to help drive Iraq out of
Kuwait, and later reaped diplomatic and financial benefits that
included $2 billion from Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Assad could never be discounted in the Middle East equation.
''The Lion of Damascus'' -- his family name means lion in Arabic --
was one of the Middle East's longest serving leaders. He was
credited with bringing political stability to a country of 9
million that saw repeated coups after independence from France in
1946.
</P>
<P>
   Assad built a Soviet-style personality cult at home and his
portrait was plastered everywhere. His rise was an extraordinary
feat for a man who began life as a peasant boy from the minority
Alawite Muslim sect, born Oct. 6, 1930 in Syria's coastal hills. He
plotted his way to power through the ranks of the military and the
socialist Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
   He worked long hours and prided himself on managing the most
minute details of his administration. His discipline extended to
his private life -- he was a vegetarian who abstained from alcohol,
but rumors about ill health have dogged him since a heart attack in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   He survived several reported coup attempts, including a 1984
effort by his ambitious brother Rifaat.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's attempts to rally other Arab leaders to present a
unified front against Israel gained little ground. He derided Egypt
for signing a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Syria and its
client state Lebanon faced the prospect of being the last of
Israel's neighbors to work out a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, Assad had close ties with Moscow, and the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was a blow.
</P>
<P>
   Assad maintained a vast army of secret police and informers. His
government jailed thousands of political prisoners without trial
during his rule, according to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, discussion of economic problems in recent years
began to appear in Syria's state-controlled media. Occasionally,
even some government ministers have been criticized, though no one
ever dared target Assad himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's elder brother, Basil, had been groomed as heir
until his death in a 1994 car crash. Assad had three other sons and
a daughter. He married an Alawite woman from a prominent clan. The
presidential family was rarely seen in public.

<HEADLINE> Devils, Stars Scoreless After First  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- There were injuries and scoring chances but no
goals again in the first period Saturday night as the New Jersey
Devils tried for the second time to take the Stanley Cup away from
the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey holds a 3-2 advantage in the best-of seven Stanley
Cup finals, after losing 1-0 to the defending champion Stars in
triple overtime Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that played scoreless hockey for 106 minutes, 21
seconds in Game 5, picked up where they left off. There has not
been a first-period goal in the series since Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had opportunities, but no one could beat Dallas' Ed
Belfour or New Jersey's Martin Brodeur. The Devils held a shots
advantage of 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has not been scored on in 104:13.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora, a forward on the Devils' top line, was the most
seriously injured of three players that had to leave the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora was leveled by Dallas captain Derian Hatcher, who caught
him high with a forearm that Sykora never saw coming. After a delay
of approximately five minutes, Sykora was wheeled off the ice with
his head and back immobilized.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sydor, who left with a leg injury, and Joe Nieuwendyk,
who was dumped on his head, were lost to the Stars 28 seconds
apart. Sydor was hurt 3:20 when he fell back and got his leg pinned
after checking Scott Gomez in the defensive left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk was forced to leave when he was dropped by Jason
Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   After the two matched up in a faceoff, Arnott slipped his stick
between Nieuwendyk's legs and flipped him back. Nieuwendyk look
shaky as he headed to the bench, but returned shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor was being evaluated and was lost for the game. No
penalties were called on any of the plays.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Patrik Elias was stopped twice on one shift in
front by Belfour. Dallas' best chance came when Brett Hull streaked
in on a partial breakaway about five minutes in.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was slashed on the play by Ken Daneyko, drawing a power
play that was unsuccessful. The Stars failed on both man-advantages
in the first and are 2-for-14 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had one power-play chance when Jon Sim went off for
elbowing and recorded no shots.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Jolts Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook central Taiwan
on Sunday, causing rock slides and injuring more than 20 people,
officials and seismologists said. No deaths were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 6.7, was centered
about 30 miles north of Mount Yu, Taiwan's highest mountain, about
180 miles south of the capital, Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau
said. The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., which uses a
different scale than the Central Weather Bureau, measured the quake
at 6.2.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's Disaster Rescue Center said more than 20 people were
injured in the early morning quake, with many hit by falling rocks
on mountainous highways or falling objects at home.
</P>
<P>
   State radio reported that a baby was injured when it was thrown
out of his cradle by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The quake was followed by seven aftershocks with magnitudes
between 4 and 5, the Central Weather Bureau said. All the quakes,
including the first, were considered aftershocks of a 7.6-magnitude
earthquake that devastated the region in September, killing 2,400
people and destroying thousands of homes.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists at the bureau said it is not unusual for
aftershocks from a major earthquake to continue for a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Located along the earthquake-prone Pacific Rim and crisscrossed
by 51 fault lines, Taiwan is hit by scores of earthquakes each
year, but few cause serious damage.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Fusion scored three
second-half goals Saturday night to defeat the Chicago Fire 4-2 in
a Major League Soccer match.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was Miami's first in four matches against the Fire
this season and also ended a string of three consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (5-6) took a 1-0 lead at the 43rd minute on when Jay Heaps
took an indirect kick from Henry Gutierrez and headed in a shot
from 10 yards that beat Chicago goalkeeper Chris Snitko.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago (9-6-1), playing without the league's leading scorer,
Ante Razov, who is representing the United States in the USA Cup,
failed to tie the match two minutes later when Dema Kovalenko's
penalty kick went left off the Fusion goal. The penalty kick was
set up when Fusion midfielder Jim Rooney fouled the Fire's Josh
Wolf inside the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Miami increased its lead to 2-0 at the 62nd minute when Rooney
headed a crossing pass from Welton into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago finally scored in the 70th minute when Peter Nowak fed
Kovalenko with a free kick and his shot deep inside the box beat
Miami goalkeeper Nick Rimando.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fusion retaliated on Martin Machon's goal at the 73rd
minute. Diego Serna fed Nelson Vargas with a crossing pass and
Vargas then centered a pass to an open Machon, who flicked in a
shot deep inside the box.
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored again in the 76th minute when Serna leaped to
receive a pass from Welton, then drilled a 16-yard shot inside the
right post.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago added a late goal by Evan Whitfield at the 88th minute.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 11, Phillies 4  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle homered and drove in four runs and
Sidney Ponson pitched eight strong innings as the Baltimore Orioles
beat Curt Schilling and the Philadelphia Phillies 11-4 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken homered and drove in three runs for the Orioles, who
won for only the second time in 10 games. Ripken went 3-for-4 to
boost his batting average to .261, his highest since April 26.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Ripken, Baltimore led 7-1 after five innings and chased
Schilling in the sixth. Belle also had three hits in extending his
season-high hitting streak to 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ponson (4-3) allowed five hits, two walks and four runs. He took
a two-hitter into the sixth and overcame a three-run homer by Bobby
Abreu to win for only the second time in nine starts.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lieberthal also homered for Philadelphia, which fell to 5-9
against Baltimore in four years of interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (1-4) continued to struggle as he strives to rebound
from offseason surgery on his right shoulder. The right-hander
allowed seven runs and 10 hits in five-plus innings in his third
straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Delino DeShields and B.J. Surhoff hit RBI doubles before Ripken
singled in a run to give Baltimore a 3-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal hit his ninth homer in the second for Philadelphia,
but Belle hit a two-run, two-out single in the Orioles' half to
make it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's team-high 13th home run, after a single by Belle, put
Baltimore up 7-1 in the fifth. Abreu connected in the sixth,
extending his hitting streak to a team-high 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles stretched the lead in the eighth, scoring four
unearned runs after an error by shortstop Desi Relaford. The key
blow was a two-run homer by Belle, his 10th.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Baltimore's Harold Baines batted eighth for the first time
since April 24, 1982. The slumping DH went 0-for-1 with two walks
before being lifted for a pinch runner. ... Lieberthal has reached
base in 13 straight games and 19 of 20. ... Ripken passed Goose
Goslin and moved into 20th place on the career RBI list (1,610) ...
The sellout crowd of 48,443 boosted the Orioles' home attendance to
1,037,879 after 25 dates. ... Schilling struck out Mike Bordick in
the first inning, his 1,500th strikeout with the Phillies.

   CALGARY (AP) -- Anti-trade protesters who targeted the World
Trade Organization and the Organization of American States in
recent months were preparing to disrupt a World Petroleum Congress
meeting that begins here on Sunday, police and activists said.
</P>
<P>
   The congress, comprising 3,000 delegates from 87 countries
representing the oil industry, is the next target of an
anti-globalization movement that combines mainstream activists with
more radical groups, Calgary police Insp. Murray Stooke said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers will have pepper spray and stun guns in case the
demonstrations turn violent, like the street clashes that disrupted
a December WTO meeting in Seattle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been training our people for what we call protest
awareness,'' Stooke said. ''We have a number of options available --
from negotiations, to warnings to lift and carry, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said a security zone has been set up around the meeting
side, similar to the fenced-in area at the OAS assembly in Windsor,
Ontario, last week. More than 40 people were arrested in minor
scuffles with police in Windsor, but the protests were mostly
peaceful and the OAS meeting continued.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters called the security response an overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   Groups planning to demonstrate in Calgary include Greenpeace
International, Friends of the Earth, Oil Watch Network and the
Sierra Club of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1933 by major energy nations, the World Petroleum
Congress meets every three years to discuss industry issues.
</P>
<P>
   John Sellers, director of the Ruckus Society, a group that
offers courses in effective protesting, said the demonstrations
planned for Calgary intended to spread a message, not shut down the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to base our success or our failure on tactics,''
he said. ''We want to frame our message of exploitation by oil
companies in a peaceful manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some shopowners in Calgary have prepared for rioting, cutting
plywood to replace any windows that get broken and bolstering doors
with extra locks.

<HEADLINE> Lions To Sign QB Stoney Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Lions have agreed to sign
quarterback Stoney Case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have agreed to terms with him on a contract,'' Lions
spokesman Steve Reaven said. ''The intent is to have him on the
field by Tuesday'' for the final week of the Lions' voluntary
summer workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Case, 27, was expected to sign Monday, Reaven said. He would not
disclose contract terms.
</P>
<P>
   According to an item on ESPN's Web site, the former Baltimore
Ravens quarterback would agree to a one-year contract worth
$465,000, including a $25,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Saturday with Case's agent, Gary Wichard, was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Charlie Batch suffered a leg injury Monday that will
keep him sidelined for three months.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Ross has said he wanted another quarterback signed
by Tuesday to share the workload with Mike Tomczak and Steve
Stenstrom during the last three voluntary workouts and in training
camp, the Detroit Free Press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions contacted former Detroit quarterback Rodney Peete and
his agent after Batch's injury, but did not make him a formal
offer, Reaven said.

<HEADLINE> Braves SS Furcal Charged With DUI  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Less than a week after sending closer John Rocker
to the minors, the Atlanta Braves had to deal with another problem
Saturday: Rookie shortstop Rafael Furcal was charged with drunken
driving and underage alcohol consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Police in suburban Cobb County said Furcal, 19 and the youngest
player in the majors, was arrested early Saturday morning after
failing a sobriety test in the parking lot of a Kroger grocery
store.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb police spokesman Dana Pierce said Furcal's car swerved into
a median about 5 a.m. EDT, springing an oil leak. Kroger employees
called police to report a suspicious person in the parking lot, and
officers found Furcal there.
</P>
<P>
   ''He looked like he had been drinking,'' Pierce said. ''He had
all the signs of being intoxicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal paid a $400 bond in cash and was released from Cobb
County Jail about 9:30 a.m. Saturday, authorities said. Georgia law
mandates an automatic six-month license suspension for underage
drinkers convicted of DUI.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves said they would not decide on possible disciplinary
action against Furcal until his case was resolved by authorities.
No court date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal was not in the starting lineup for Saturday night's game
at home against the Boston Red Sox. But he entered the game in the
fourth inning after Walt Weiss injured his right thumb. Furcal went
0-for-1 with a run scored as Atlanta won 6-0. He is hitting .306
with 12 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   General manager John Schuerholz met with Furcal before the game.
First baseman Andres Galarraga, a leader of the team's large Latin
contingent, also took part to ensure the shortstop understood what
was being said.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, a native of the Dominican Republic, has limited
knowledge of English.
</P>
<P>
   ''Raffy apologized,'' Schuerholz said. ''He's very sincere when
he says it will not happen again. I'm satisfied with that response.
He realizes he made a mistake, he admits to it and he's sorry for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal declined comment, but Galarraga played down the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not really a big deal,'' the first baseman said. ''He had
a problem with his car and police made a big deal about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Furcal is one of baseball's most exciting young players. After
playing in Class-A a year ago, the teen-ager made the major league
roster with an impressive spring.
</P>
<P>
   He was 3-for-4 with two doubles and a stolen base in Atlanta's
6-4 victory over the Red Sox on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no doubt he's a great kid. He seems like he feels bad
about it,'' Galarraga said. ''We told him to forget about it.
Forget what everybody is saying. Just play the game. We need him.
We need him to keep impressing everybody like he's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, normally one of baseball's most trouble-free teams,
have faced a couple of off-field incidents in the past week. Last
Sunday, Rocker was accused of threatening the Sports Illustrated
reporter who revealed the pitcher's bigoted comments about gays,
minorities and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was fined $5,000 and sent to the minors the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal was returning from taking a friend home when he struck
the median, said his agent, Paul Kinzer. Kinzer pointed out that
Furcal's native Dominican Republic is a ''different culture'' where
''a 15-year-old might drink a beer or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said a breath test showed Furcal's blood-alcohol level at
.11 percent. Under Georgia law, underage drivers are considered
legally drunk if their level is .02 percent; the standard is .08
for drivers who are 21 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, he needs to understand the responsibility he had
to make good decisions, and not only as a player with an exciting
future,'' Schuerholz said. ''He also has to make good decisions off
the field.''

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The first-ever summit between leaders of North
Korea and South Korea has been delayed by one day and will start Tuesday, the
Seoul government announced. The summit was delayed for ''unavoidable technical
reasons,'' the office of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said in a news
release. No further details were released. Kim had planned to fly Monday to
Pyongyang to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, in a summit that
offers hopes for gradual reconciliation on the Korean peninsula after decades of

Assad's Son Clears Leadership Hurdle

   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- President Hafez Assad had two vice presidents to fill
in for him, but within hours of his death Saturday, the Syrian parliament pushed
them aside and voted to clear the way for the ascension of his 34-year-old son.
Bashar Assad has held no political office, no senior party post and no
significant military position, but the late president had given Bashar several
tasks to thrust him into public roles and recognition. Bashar cleared a major
constitutional hurdle Saturday when parliament members overwhelmingly voted to
amend an article in the constitution that requires the head of state to be at
least 40 years old. The legislators voted to lower the age to 34.

   KISANGANI, Congo (AP) -- Ugandan and Rwandan troops fought street battles and

observers tried to secure yet another cease-fire. A cease-fire would give both
armies enough time to withdraw and spare the 200,000 trapped Congolese civilians
further death and destruction. At least 150 people have been killed and 700
wounded since Monday, the Red Cross said. Rwanda and Uganda are both in Congo

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook central Taiwan on Sunday,
causing rock slides and injuring more than a dozen people, officials and

magnitude of 6.7, was centered about 30 miles north of Mount Yu, Taiwan's
highest mountain, about 180 miles south of the capital, Taipei, the Central
Weather Bureau said. The quake was followed by seven aftershocks with magnitudes
of 4 and 5. All the quakes were considered aftershocks of a 7.6-magnitude
earthquake that devastated the region September, killing 2,400 people.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 5, Twins 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Jimmy Haynes won his fourth straight road
start and Marquis Grissom homered as the Milwaukee Brewers beat the
Minnesota Twins 5-3 on Saturday night to snap a five-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew LeCroy and Cristian Guzman homered for the Twins, who
had won three straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes (7-4) allowed two runs and six hits in seven innings to
improve to 5-1 on the road this season. He struck out one and did
not walk a batter as Milwaukee won for the first time in five
interleague games. Bob Wickman pitched the ninth for his sixth save
in seven opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Redman (4-1) lost for the first time in 20 career
appearances, including eight starts. He allowed three runs and
eight hits in seven innings, while striking out eight and walking
two.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, playing its eighth straight game against the National
League, fell to 3-5 in interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, who went 3-for-5, led off the fourth inning with a home
run off Redman to make it 1-0. It was Grissom's second homer of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins hit a two-run single in the sixth to give
Milwaukee a 3-0 lead. Grissom led off with a single and Jose
Hernandez doubled, before Jenkins singled up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota cut the deficit to 3-1 in the sixth on Matt Lawton's
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   LeCroy hit a a 402-foot homer, his fifth, off Haynes in the
seventh to make it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago Perez hit a run-scoring single in the eighth off Hector
Carrasco to make it 4-2. It was the rookie's first career RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman homered off Valerio De Los Santos in the eighth to make
it 4-3. It was Guzman's sixth home run. Jeromy Burnitz hit an RBI
single in the ninth to make it 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual play in the seventh, James Mouton hit a foul pop
that appeared to be going into the stands. But, the ball hit the
Metrodome roof and a speaker and stayed in play.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Corey Koskie caught the ball in foul territory
after bumping into third-base coach Chris Speier, who thought the
ball was going out of play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Twins and Brewers wore replica jerseys from 1969 for
the Turn Back the Clock game. Milwaukee wore Seattle Pilots
uniforms and the scoreboard at the Metrodome said Pilots instead of
Brewers. ... Haynes won seven games last season with Oaklannation
wins.

<HEADLINE> Monorail Riders Injured in Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   APPLE VALLEY, Minn. (AP) -- Two monorail trains crashed at the
Minnesota Zoo on Saturday, injuring more than a dozen people, zoo
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One train carrying 80 passengers rear-ended the other as about
70 passengers were disembarking about 1:30 p.m. Neither train left
the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   One person was airlifted to Regions Hospital in St. Paul and was
listed in stable condition. Three adults were treated at another
hospital for minor injuries and released, and at least a dozen
other people were treated at the scene, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Braziel, the zoo's acting director, said the train
operator radioed that she was having trouble with the controls and
couldn't get the train to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knew that she was going faster than she should and she
radioed,'' Braziel said. ''That's why we believe there was
mechanical failure because the train did not slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   The trains usually run at about 3 to 4 mph but can achieve
speeds of 9 mph. It wasn't immediately clear how fast the train was
traveling before the impact.
</P>
<P>
   Braziel said the monorail, which carries passengers through the
zoo, will remain closed until the cause of the crash has been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''The train's been in operation for 22 years. We've never had an
accident like this happen,'' Braziel said.

<HEADLINE> Castro Meets With US Business Execs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro told visiting American business
executives that moves in the U.S. Congress to ease trade sanctions
against his nation are a small but important step forward, state
media reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand it as a first step, as a necessary step to move
forward what is only just and correct: the disappearance of the
blockade,'' Juventud Rebelde, the daily of Cuba's communist youth
quoted Castro as saying Saturday. The Cuban president's comments
were also carried by the official Prensa Latina news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Castro met late Friday with a small group of about 60 executives
who traveled to Havana for a two-day trip to explore future trade
opportunities in the Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old U.S. embargo currently restricts Americans who
want to do business with Cuba, but Congress currently is studying a
measure to allow U.S. sales of food and medicine to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the fourth annual US-Cuba Business Summit
arrived in Havana Friday morning from Cancun, Mexico, where they
had met with senior Cuban officials. They met later Friday with
more officials in Havana, and visited with representatives of a
variety of economic sectors, such as communications, petroleum and
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   A group of the entrepreneurs toured Old Havana Saturday morning
before catching a noon flight back to Cancun. They walked along
cobblestone streets and stopped by the Bodeguito del Medio, once a
favorite drinking spot of the late American writer Ernest
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   The business people represented firms including Caterpillar farm
equipment, Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of New York, United Airlines,
Wygth Ayerst Labs, the Port of Houston Authority and Silverado
Foods Inc., according to a list provided by summit organizers.

<HEADLINE> Miracle 74, Sting 71  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Shannon Johnson hit a 3-pointer as time
expired Saturday night, lifting the Orlando Miracle to a 74-71
victory over the winless Charlotte Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte (0-5) is the only WNBA team without a victory this
season, and has lost 10 consecutive regular-season games, dating
back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando (4-3) led 68-61 with 1:01 to play, but saw the lead
evaporate as Charlotte picked up the intensity in a desperate
attempt to earn its first win.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Mapp scored on a layup, but missed the chance to make it
a three-point play when she failed to convert her free-throw
attempt. But Charlotte got the rebound and Summer Erb made it 68-65
on a layup with 29 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting immediately fouled Johnson, who made both free throws
to give the Miracle a 70-65 lead with 27.6 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte's Tiffany Travis then hit a long 3-pointer with 14
seconds left to cut it to 70-68. Another free throw by Johnson made
it 71-68, but the Sting tied it on Mapp's desperation 3-pointer
with 1.5 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the game was headed to overtime, but Orlando came
out of a timeout and inbounded the ball to Johnson, who turned and
tossed it straight into the hoop as the final buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was costly for Charlotte, which lost starting forward
Charlotte Smith with 15:47 to play in the second half because of a
twisted right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Taj McWilliams and Nykesha Sales led Orlando with 20 points
each. Shannon Johnson finished with 11, seven in the final 28
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Stinson led Charlotte with 18 points. Mapp added 15 and
Travis scored 11.

<HEADLINE> Women's Delegates Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Five years after a landmark U.N.
conference set women's equality as an achievable goal, more than
180 nations agreed Saturday on new measures to accelerate the
international campaign to reach it.
</P>
<P>
   But women's rights activists and several countries including the
United States, South Africa and Norway said the new initiatives
didn't go far enough to speed implementation of the 150-page
platform of action adopted in Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fears that delegates would chip away at the Beijing
platform, the weeklong U.N. Women's Conference ended Saturday with
no backtracking -- a fact welcomed by Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
who urged delegates earlier in the week to protect and advance the
gains made by women five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates on Saturday approved the new plan to implement the
Beijing platform, as well as an accompanying political declaration,
following all-night negotiations that delayed the wrap-up of the
conference by a day. Both documents were approved by consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Before General Assembly President Theo-Ben Gurirab called for a
decision, two dozen nations expressed reservations on specific
points in the new document. A dozen more commented after consensus
was approved.
</P>
<P>
   Gurirab, who is Namibia's foreign minister, declared that the
documents moved the global agenda for women forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''If governments demonstate the necessary political will and
allocate the human and financial resources required, I am convinced
that the goals of gender equality, development and peace will
become a reality very early in the 21st century,'' he said before
gaveling the conference to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The new action document includes tougher measures to combat
domestic violence and sex trafficking, and to tackle the impact of
HIV/AIDS and globalization on women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an all-night session, however, virtually no progress was
made on the most contentious issues -- including access to safe
abortion, sexual rights, sexual orientation, and equal rights of
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   That disappointed grass-roots groups, which had lobbied for more
specific goals and stronger action.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement issued by the Center for Women's Global
Leadership at Rutgers University and the Women's Environment and
Development Organization lamented the lack of agreement ''on a
stronger document with more concrete benchmarks, numerical goals,
time-bound targets, indicators, and resources aimed at implementing
the Beijing platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Angela King, a special
adviser on the advancement of women, said she was encouraged by the
progress made.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those millions of women who are looking at us are totally
vindicated, and they have something to grasp to assist them for
their battles for equality,'' she said, after delegates reached
agreement after 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a very strong document which not only reaffirms
Beijing and other relevant conferences on human rights and social
development, but also moves forward,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference brought together about 2,300 international
delegates and 2,000 representatives of grass-roots organizations.
Aside from closed-door negotiations on the final document, dozens
of panel discussions were held on subjects ranging from women
crossing the digital divide to rituals of widowhood.
</P>
<P>
   The first U.N. women's conference, in Mexico City in 1975,
launched a movement toward women's equality that was still gaining
momentum, King said, adding there would be another progress review
in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The battle lines for the current conference -- known as Beijing
Plus Five -- mirrored those at Beijing: the Vatican and a handful of
Islamic and Catholic countries -- including Libya, Algeria, Iran,
Sudan and Nicaragua -- against the West and hundreds of women's
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   But Jyoti Shankar Singh, executive coordinator of this week's
General Assembly session, said issues relating to sex and
reproduction didn't have the same intensity they did at the 1994
population conference in Cairo or the 1995 Beijing conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were concerned with a lot of other issues -- violence
against women, trafficking, HIV/AIDS, the impact of globalization,
women's human rights and how much power they hold or share in the
economy and politics,'' he said, and this is reflected in the final
document.
</P>
<P>
   Although attempts for stronger language on access to abortions
failed and references to sexual rights and sexual orientation were
dropped, the platform does say women have the right to ''decide
freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality ...
free of coercion, discrimination and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A dispute between the United States and Cuba over Havana's
insistence on referring to the negative effect of U.S. sanctions
was also resolved early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   King said both countries agreed to compromise language.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates noted strong planks calling for prosecution of all
forms of domestic violence, including marital rape. For the first
time in an international consensus document, forced marriage and
so-called honor killings were addressed, with governments being
urged to eradicate these human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   The document also calls for implementation and increased
international cooperation to eliminate ''commercial sexual
exploitation,'' as well as economic exploitation, including sex
trafficking.

<HEADLINE> LA's Bryant Uncertain For Game 3  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Some say Shaquille O'Neal has been carrying
the Los Angeles Lakers all season. On Saturday, Kobe Bryant's
sprained left ankle prompted him to assume that role quite
literally.
</P>
<P>
   The league MVP gave Bryant a piggyback ride into Conseco
Fieldhouse as Los Angeles began preparations for Game 3 of the NBA
Finals. The 21-year-old star is quite a load, but he's nothing
compared to the burden Shaq will be forced to shoulder if Bryant is
in street clothes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said no decision has been made on whether he will play,
but his coaches and teammates made it clear they don't expect him
to be in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've played without players who have missed games or been
thrown out of games, and we've won those games,'' Lakers coach Phil
Jackson said. ''Now, playing a 48-minute game possibly without Kobe
Bryant will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Shaq led the Lakers to a win in Friday's Game 2 without
Bryant, his likely absence from Sunday's game could change the
nature of a series that appeared headed toward a quick resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, an All-NBA second-teamer and the Lakers' second-leading
scorer, rolled his ankle when he landed on Jalen Rose's foot while
attempting a jumper midway through the first quarter of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't return, but the Lakers rallied behind O'Neal's 40
points and 24 rebounds to win 111-104 and take a 2-0 lead in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   After X-rays taken at Staples Center were negative, Bryant said
he spent a fitful, sleepless night receiving electrical stimulus on
the ankle. The electrodes were still hooked up when the Lakers flew
to Indianapolis on Saturday morning, and he did stretching
exercises with trainers Gary Vitti and Chip Schaefer while on the
charter flight.
</P>
<P>
   ''How does it feel? It feels sprained,'' said Bryant, who was
wearing a heavy wrap on the ankle and negotiating the Conseco court
on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just trying to take care of it as well as possible, and
hopefully get me ready for Game 3, or if not, for Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers still were confident about their chances without
Kobe, who is averaging 22.3 points and a team-high 4.5 assists per
game in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Game 2's encouraging result, several players
noted that when Bryant missed the season's first 15 games with a
broken hand, the team still flourished in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've gotten used to playing without Kobe,'' O'Neal said.
''But when Kobe's not in the game, other guys have a chance to
shine -- guys like Glen Rice, who people don't realize is still one
of the best shooters in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Kobe's not there, the other guys are going to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   They did just that on Friday night. Rice and Ron Harper scored
21 points apiece, while Robert Horry accounted for some of Bryant's
strong defensive presence by blocking four shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''In (Sunday's) game we're going to be short one guy, a key guy
to our basketball team,'' Rice said. ''When he goes down, the first
thing we said was everybody has to step up and do more of what they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Pacers admitted they blew a golden opportunity to
even the series, they praised the Lakers' role players for stepping
into Bryant's shoes. Indiana's supporting cast has had trouble
picking up the slack for shooting guard Reggie Miller, who went
1-for-16 in Game 1 and had just two points in the fourth quarter on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously they picked up the pace of their game with Kobe
out,'' Indiana coach Larry Bird said. ''They've got weapons. Just
because one guy goes out, they're not going to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers all but declared Bryant out of Sunday's game,
their hopes are higher for Game 4, when Bryant will have three
additional days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this concerns Shaq, who is averaging a fearsome 41.5
points and 21.5 rebounds in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't really change things at all,'' O'Neal said.
''Having Kobe is an advantage, but I think we're still good enough
to do certain things when he's not in the ballgame.''

<HEADLINE> Liberty 70, Fever 62  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Crystal Robinson scored five of her 19
points during a second-half burst that carried the New York Liberty
to a 70-62 WNBA win over the Indiana Fever on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York extended a one-point lead into an 11-point cushion by
outscoring Indiana 13-3 over a 6:13 stretch of the second half.
Robinson's 3-pointer from the right side gave the Liberty a 66-55
lead with 1:35 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Hammon scored 16 points, Tari Phillips 15 and Vickie
Johnson 12 for New York (3-4). The Liberty, who hit 12 of their
first 15 shots in the second half, finished at 54 percent
(27-for-50) for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie McCarty led Indiana (2-3) with 15 points and eight
assists. Kara Wolters, the Fever's 6-foot-7 center, added 13 points
and nine rebounds. Indiana shot 26-for-66 (39 percent) from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson scored 14 points as the teams spent the first half
trading scoring runs, with New York leading 31-30 at intermission.
Robinson shot 8-for-12 for the game, including 3-for-5 from 3-point
range.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Saturday's BB Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressINTERLEAGUE:
Pirates-Royals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Saturday was Salute to the Negro Leagues Night. The
Pirates wore the uniforms of the 1945 Homestead Grays and the
Royals wore those of the 1945 Kansas City Monarchs. The Grays and
the Monarchs met in the 1942 Negro Leagues World Series. ...
Pittsburgh's last eight home runs have been solo shots.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The fan who was injured from a gunshot wound during
Friday's game was released from the hospital. Virginia Olsthoorn,
64, of Haysville, Kan., apparently was shot during the ninth inning
from beyond the stadium grounds, Royals spokesman Jim Lachimia
said. ... The Royals gave away Monarchs replica caps to the first
25,000 fans attending the game. ... The Royals, 31-28 going into
Saturday, are guaranteed of reaching the 60-game mark with a
winning record for the first time in five seasons. From 1995
through 1999, the Royals were a combined 134-166 through 60 games.
Mets-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   METS: GM Steve Phillips danced around questions on whether his
team would be interested in the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, if he's
available. ''I'm going to get in on everything, find out what the
price is,'' he said of the mid-summer trade market. But he refused
to discuss specific players. ... Dennis Cook gave up four runs and
six hits in two-thirds of an inning. ... The Mets had runners on in
13 of the first 14 innings of the series but avoided a 1-2-3 inning
just once in the last four Saturday. ... The first four batters in
the Mets' lineup were 9-for-18 with nine runs scored Friday, just
3-for-18 with no runs Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   YANKEES: 2B Chuck Knoblauch, who has missed five straight games
and is trying to avoid going on the DL for the first time in his
career, took 40-50 swings before the game in a batting cage
underneath the stands. ''I think there's a chance he will play
tomorrow,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. Knoblauch has been
bothered by a strained left forearm. ... New York has been
successful on 26 of its last 28 stolen-base attempts, including one
by Derek Jeter in the first inning. He swiped second and scored New
York's first run on Bernie Williams' two-out double. ... Since
coming of the DL on May 28, Jeter is 30-for-61 (.492) in 13 games,
including nine multihit games.
Red Sox-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: One day late, 2B Jose Offerman was activated from the
disabled list for Saturday's game. He went on the 15-day DL on May
27 with a strained left groin, but the team overlooked that the
move was retroactive to May 25, which would have allowed Offerman
to be activated Friday. He had a 12-game hitting streak when he
went on the DL and quickly extended it to 13, leading off with a
single against the Braves. ... The Red Sox optioned RHP Dan Smith
to Triple-A Pawtucket to clear a spot for Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Sign of the times: The Braves had a team ERA of 4.06
prior to Saturday's game -- the highest it's been this late in the
season since 1990, the year before the team began a streak of eight
straight playoff appearances. A decade ago, the Atlanta staff had a
5.30 ERA after 59 games with the team en route to a last-place
finish in the NL West. Despite this year's higher-than-normal
number, the Braves still ranked second in the NL behind Arizona
(3.76).
Phillies-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: RHP Andy Ashby, Sunday's starter, will face
Baltimore for the first time in his 11-year career. ... Saturday's
starter, RHP Curt Schilling, made his major league debut with the
Orioles on Sept. 7, 1988, and pitched for the team from 1988-90.
... Schilling recorded his 1,500th strikeout for the Phillies in
the first inning, fanning Mike Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: For the first time in his six seasons in an Orioles
uniform, DH Harold Baines hit eighth Saturday night. It was his
first start since May 31. ... Hall of Fame broadcaster Chuck
Thompson celebrated his 79th birthday. ... With a three-run first
inning Saturday, the Orioles have outscored their opponents 35-27
in the opening inning.
Brewers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers announced the signing of first-round pick
Dave Krynzel from the recent draft. Krynzel, an 18-year-old OF from
Nevada, was the 11th overall selection. He batted .438 for Green
Valley High School last season. ... In each of the last three
games, the Brewers and their opponents have had the same amount of
hits.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins and Brewers wore replica jerseys from 1969
for Saturday night's Turn Back the Clock game. ... The Twins
announced that they have signed seven draftees from the 2000 free
agent draft, including 18th-round selection Andy Persby. Persby, a
right-hander from Saint Paul, pitched for the University of
Minnesota and also played quarterback for the Gophers. ... Eric
Milton, who was struck on the left leg by Craig Biggio's line drive
on Tuesday, is expected to keep his spot in the rotation and start
Monday.
Cubs-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CUBS: Sammy Sosa insists his off-the-field distractions aren't
to blame for his eight strikeouts in the first two games of the
crosstown series. The slugger had a much-publicized blowup with
manager Don Baylor earlier in the week, and that was followed by
trade rumors. ''It just happens. It's part of the game,'' he said.
''I've just got to keep it continue and get ready, because I'm not
going to give up.'' ... Mark Grace fouled a pitch off his right
ankle before he homered in the sixth inning. ''When I did that, I
rolled it,'' he said. ''It basically hurts from my big toe to my
hip.'' ... Despite catching the entire 14-inning game Friday night,
C Joe Girardi was back in the lineup Saturday. ''I knew I was
going,'' said Girardi, who got about six hours of sleep. ''I can
rest Monday. And I will.''
</P>
<P>
   WHITE SOX: Though their next four series are against their
biggest AL rivals, the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians,
the White Sox aren't taking these three games with the Cubs
lightly. ''The Cleveland series is big, but there's something about
this one,'' Paul Konerko said. ''Two major league teams in the same
city. It's kind of like a high school game.'' ... Carlos Lee
extended his hitting streak to 11 games, four shy of his career
best. ... Frank Thomas finished 0-for-4 with three strikeouts.
Cardinals-Tigers:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Four members of the Cardinals had more than a casual
interest in the College World Series game between Southern
California and Florida State. Mark McGwire played baseball for USC
and J.D. Drew played for the Seminoles. Cardinals manager Tony La
Russa earned a law degree from Florida State after completing his
playing career. Strength and conditioning coach Pete Prinzi played
football for the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: 1B Tony Clark, who has been on the 15-day DL since May
13 with a strained left ribcage, went hitless in four at-bats
during his first rehab outing with Triple-A Toledo. Clark grounded
to first, hit two flyballs to center and grounded to shortstop in
the Mud Hens 10-5 win over Richmond. He didn't face John Rocker.
Reds-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: Saturday was the 56th anniversary of Reds radio
broadcaster Joe Nuxhall making his major league debut at age 15,
the youngest player in major league history. Nuxhall, who pitched
with the Reds for 15 years, has been broadcasting games since 1967.
... C Eddie Taubensee, who was not in the lineup Saturday, doesn't
have an RBI in his last 23 games, a span of 82 at-bats. Taubensee,
who has 13 RBIs this season, drove in a career-high 87 last year.
... The Reds five straight losses are a season-high and their most
since an eight-game slide from June 17-24, 1998. ''We hit some
shots and their defense took it away from us,'' Michael Tucker said
following Saturday's 6-5 loss to the Indians. ''That's what happens
to a team going through what we're going through right now.''
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: 2B Roberto Alomar didn't hit a grand slam on
Saturday, but his fiancee won one. While Mary Pierce was winning
the French Open in Paris, Alomar was taking batting practice before
facing the Reds. ''She did?'' Alomar said as he came off the field.
''I'm really happy for her. It's a great win for her after all
she's been through.'' ... Following Saturday's game, RHPs Jaret
Wright and Steve Karsay were to be guests at sports talk show host
Jim Rome's tour stop in Cleveland. Indians OF-1B Richie Sexson sent
an autographed bat for Rome, who was appearing at Blossom Music
Center. ... OF Kenny Lofton, in the option year of his contract,
said he is concerned about the future. It will cost the Indians
$7.5 million if they pick up the 33-year-old's contract, $1.5
million if they buy it out. ''Sure it's on my mind,'' said Lofton,
who returned earlier than expected this year after undergoing
off-season shoulder surgery. ''I want to stay here. If I don't I'm
sure I can find a job elsewhere.''
Expos-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: The Expos are 5-3 in interleague play this season. ...
Montreal is 6-3 overall in June. ... Vladimir Guerrero has six home
runs in his last 10 games. ... Tony Armas Jr. has pitched five or
more innings in each of his six starts. ... Armas has allowed just
25 hits in 39 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays dropped below .500 at home (16-17). ...
Kelvim Escobar allowed the first four batters he faced to score.
... Carlos Delgado has 32 RBIs in his last 21 games. ... Tony
Batista homered off a left-hander for the first time this season.
... Attendance was 30,239.
Marlins-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Luis Castillo homered for the first time since
connecting off San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock on Aug. 8, 1998, a
span of 211 games, 783 at-bats. All three of the switch-hitter's
career homers have come from the right side of the plate ... Cliff
Floyd is hitting .333 during the stretch in which he's reached base
by hit, walk or being hit by a pitch in 37 consecutive games ...
RHP Reid Cornelius, who didn't allow a hit until Greg Vaughn's
seventh-inning single, fell two outs short of the most consecutive
hitless innings against the Devil Rays to start a game. Rick Reed
of the New York Mets didn't allow a hit against Tampa Bay for 6 2-3
innings on June 8, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Juan Guzman, on the disabled list with right
shoulder tendinitis, threw six innings in a rehab start for
Triple-A Durham on Friday night. He allowed four earned runs, nine
hits, no walks and struck out five. He threw 94 pitches. ''The
report on him was very good. He threw the ball well,'' manager
Larry Rothschild said, adding that Guzman probably will make at
least one more minor league start before returning to the rotation
... Devil Rays starting pitchers have worked five innings or more
in 14 consecutive games. The staff accomplished that only 26 times
in the team's first 46 games ... LHP Doug Creek pitched three
innings, matching the longest relief appearance of his career.
Rangers-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: The Rangers designated DH-OF Jason McDonald for
assignment to free a roster spot for OF Dave Martinez, who was
acquired Friday from the Chicago Cubs in a three-team trade. The
Rangers have 10 days to decide whether to trade McDonald, release
him or assign him to a minor league affiliate. ... Rafael Palmeiro
is tied with Orlando Cepeda and Tony Perez for 42nd place on the
all-time home run list with 379.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: 2B Mike Lansing was held out of the starting lineup
with soreness in his back and tailbone, but was available if
needed. ... LHP Gabe White is within 5 1-3 innings of Curtis
Leskanic's franchise consecutive scoreless innings streak of 21 1-3
for the Rockies.
Angels-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Jarrod Washburn is 5-0 in his career in June. ... Darin
Erstad's second-inning double gave him 100 hits in 61 games. He's
the fastest to reach 100 hits since Heinie Manush reached the
century mark in 60 games with the Washington Senators in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Luis Gonzalez has homered in three straight games and
five of his last six games. He's the fifth Diamondback to homer in
three straight games. ... Gonzalez's four-hit game was his second
of the season and 12th of his career. It came with his brother,
Rex, in attendance. Rex Gonzalez manages the Feather River Mudcats
of the independent Western League, who are in town to face the
local Valley Vipers. ... Omar Daal has lasted less than four
innings in two of his last five starts. ... Bernard Gilkey flied
out in a pinch-hitting appearance to extend his hitless streak to
21 at-bats. Gilkey is 1-for-40 in his last 19 games. ... Danny
Bautista, acquired from the Florida Marlins on Friday, was 0-for-2
in his Diamondbacks debut.
Mariners-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: It didn't take Mariners pitcher Paul Abbott long to get
his first big league hit. The starter in Saturday's interleague
game at the NL's San Francisco Giants, Abbott doubled off Shawn
Estes in his first career at bat. He eventually scored on a
groundout. ... Seattle's pinch-hitters are slumping. After an
0-for-4 performance Friday night, the team's pinch-hitters are
batting a collective .118 (4-for-34) with just one RBI. They are
0-for-10 with two walks in their last 12 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Terrell Lowery, designated for assignment
earlier this week, cleared waivers and on Saturday accepted an
outright assignment to Triple-A Fresno. San Francisco manager Dusty
Baker was pleasantly surprised Lowery had gone unclaimed. Lowery
was batting .556 in limited duty but was bumped from the 25-man
roster because of a numbers squeeze after pitcher Joe Nathan's
reinstatement from the DL. ''We're glad to have him back in our
system,'' Baker said. ''He not only has experience up here. He has
done well.''
Athletics-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Reliever Mike Magnante, scheduled to come off the DL
Monday from a strained left hamstring, had a rehab start on
Saturday with Triple-A Sacramento. Barring any complications, the
left-hander is expected to be activated on Monday for the start of
a series at Minnesota. ... This year's All-Star game will mark 30
years since Athletics broadcaster and former Cleveland catcher Ray
Fosse took the brunt of a violent collision at home plate with Pete
Rose, who scored the winning run for the NL. Fosse sustained a
fractured and separated left shoulder. But X-rays didn't reveal the
injuries because of inflammation already in that shoulder -- and he
did not miss a game. The physical pain is still there, said Fosse,
who declined to say whether or not Rose belongs in the Hall of
Fame. ''I don't have a vote and I've never been one to really say
yes or no, because the only thing that's going to happen if I say
it is that it's going to create a mess,'' Fosse said. ''So I've
never touched that (subject), and I really don't plan to.''
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The strained right hamstring CF Todd Hollandsworth
sustained while running down Tim Salmon's fly ball in the gap on
June 3 against Anaheim isn't improving as quickly as the Dodgers
had anticipated. ''He definitely needs more time,'' manager Davey
Johnson said Friday. ''He's already been out a week; and if it
looks like it's going to be another four or five days before he's
even at 80 percent, then possibly we might retroactive him to the
DL.'' ... The Dodgers will probably decide by the middle of the
week what to do next with former Cy Young winner Orel Hershiser,
who already has made three starts for Class-A San Bernardino in an
attempt to regain his form. ''He suggested we move him up to
Double-A,'' Johnson joked. ... Even though Jeff Shaw is pitching
again and ready for his first save opportunity since getting a few
days off to rest his tender right shoulder, Mike Fetters will be
sharing the closing duties with Shaw until further notice. ''I've
got two guys who can both close, so I'm not going to go to the whip
(with Shaw),'' Johnson said.
Astros-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: Jose Lima, scheduled to start Sunday's series finale
against San Diego, is 1-3 with a 7.40 ERA in his four career starts
against the Padres. He's 1-2 with a 9.22 ERA in three appearances
(two starts) at San Diego. ... With his two-run shot in the ninth
inning Friday, Jeff Bagwell joined an impressive group of players
who've hit game-winning homers off Padres closer Trevor Hoffman the
last two seasons. Besides Bagwell, the list includes Mike Piazza
(twice), Matt Williams and Sammy Sosa. ... Billy Wagner has allowed
16 earned runs this year compared to 13 all of last year. He blew
his seventh save Friday night. Last year he blew only three.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: After being the Padres' DH on a six-game trip to
Seattle and Oakland, Tony Gwynn is back to his schedule of one game
on, one game off to rest his degenerative left knee. Gwynn was out
of the lineup Saturday night after going 2-for-5 on Friday night to
push his average up to a season-high .306. ... Of Gwynn's 3,100
career hits, 317 have come off the Astros, his most against any
team.

<HEADLINE> New Set Debuts At Grand Ole Opry  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The homey red barn backdrop that has set
the tone for the Grand Ole Opry for years has been updated with
some fancy stage lighting and a more modern, high-tech touch.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Clark, Steve Wariner and Little Jimmy Dickens joined dozens
of Opry cast members in christening the new set before an audience
of 4,000 Saturday with a rendition of ''Will The Circle Be
Unbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   The new set advertises its web site -- ''www.Opry.com'' -- along
with ''650 WSM,'' the AM radio station which has aired the program
for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   The wooden facade of the old barn is replaced with projection
screens that can turn the barn red or many other colors. There are
also three large video screens at center stage and four large
columns.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Ole Opry -- the longest continuously running radio show
in the country -- began in the downtown studios of WSM Radio in
1925, and moved to the Grand Ole Opry House in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The old barn set, which had remained unchanged since 1978, will
be displayed in the new Country Music Hall of Fame, set to open in
Nashville next May.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stars in country music have played the Opry show
over the years, including Roy Acuff, Hank Williams, Patsy Cline,
and Minnie Pearl. Current cast members include Garth Brooks, Trisha
Yearwood and Vince Gill.
</P>
<P>
   Terry London, president of Gaylord Entertainment, which owns the
Opry, called the Opry an American treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal in life is to see that the property lasts another 75
years, paying attention to the tradition, but also allowing for all
of the opportunities and technology,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Braves 6, Red Sox 0  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Terry Mulholland pitched five shutout innings
despite a strained hamstring, and the Atlanta Braves made it two in
a row over the Boston Red Sox with a 6-0 victory Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves broke open the game with four runs in the fourth,
including Andres Galarraga's 17th homer and a two-run triple by
Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss started instead of rookie Rafael Furcal, who was arrested
early Saturday on charges on drunken driving and underage alcohol
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal, at 19 the youngest player in the majors, later got into
the game after Weiss injured his right thumb on a slide. Furcal
scored a run and also committed his team-high 13th error.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland (6-5) scored Atlanta's first run, leading off the
third with a double and coming around to score on Andruw Jones'
two-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland apparently strained his right hamstring on the way
around the bases. In the fourth, after throwing a strike to Nomar
Garciaparra, the pitcher kneeled over and seemed to be struggling
to catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a couple of warmup pitches while manager Bobby Cox and
assistant trainer Jeff Porter looked on, then remained in the game.
Garciaparra singled, but Mulholland got out of the inning when Mike
Stanley hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland batted again in the fourth and pitched the fifth
before leaving, having allowed just three hits. He hopes to be able
to make his next start, and the Braves bullpen shut down the Red
Sox on two hits the rest of the way, including two scoreless
innings by Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Remlinger got the final three outs after Don Wengert walked
the first two hitters in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta relievers have allowed only three earned runs in their
last 27 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga homered for the second night in a row, beginning the
fourth with a mammoth, 421-foot shot into the right-center
bleachers against Pete Schourek (2-6). Brian Jordan and Javy Lopez
followed with consecutive singles before Weiss tripled to the gap
in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss sprained his thumb on the slide and left the game three
batters later, after Tim Wakefield came in to pitch. X-rays were
negative, but he may have to go on the disabled list if the
swelling doesn't subside by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Furcal raced home when catcher Jason Varitek couldn't handle a
knuckler, the pitch slipping through his legs for a passed ball.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek lost his third straight decision. He went 3 2-3
innings, allowing seven hits and all five runs. Four were earned.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves finally got a strong outing from a starting pitcher.
For the first seven games of the interleague homestand, the
starters' ERA was a combined 9.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves added a run in the eighth on Jordan's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Boston 2B Jose Offerman, returning from the DL, led off the
game with a single to extend his hitting streak to 13 games. ... On
May 7, Mulholland had to leave a game against Phillies after 3 1-3
innings because of a bronchial spasm. The cause is still unknown.
... Interleague is helping the Braves at the turnstiles. They have
sold out five of their eight games against AL opponents, including
Saturday's crowd of 49,420 -- the second-largest of the year at
Turner Field. Before interleague play, the Braves had only two
sellouts in 24 home games.

<HEADLINE> Korean Summit Delayed by One Day  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For the first-ever meeting between
leaders of South Korea and North Korea, a South Korean official is
warning against high expectations. He says a mere photo opportunity
would make this week's summit a success.
</P>
<P>
   ''The picture of two leaders smiling and shaking hands, the
picture itself is a great message for world peace,'' South Korean
Culture and Tourism Minister Park Jie-won said.
</P>
<P>
   Fissures between the two countries are so great that prospects
for reconciliation remain unclear, despite their biggest diplomatic
breakthrough since they waged war a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The divide is so entrenched that hundreds of thousands of troops
line either side of the Demilitarized Zone, thousands of separated
families have lost contact and there are no means of direct travel
or communication between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean conflict has shown extraordinary longevity, surviving
the end of the Cold War as well as 1990s predictions that the
communist North would collapse amid deadly famine and economic
ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang remains outwardly defiant, reliant on international
food aid but capable of launching long-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, North Korea has decided to engage the world -- although
for now on its own, limited terms.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day summit between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, which starts Tuesday in
Pyongyang, caps six months of vigorous diplomacy with China, Italy,
Australia, the United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The summit, scheduled to begin Monday, was delayed a day for
''unavoidable technical reasons,'' Kim's office said in a news
release. No further details were released.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's Unification Minister Park Jae-kyu said the delay
does not mean the summit is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The North side requested the delay to make thorough
preparations, so there will be no problems with President Kim's
visit to and stay in Pyongyang,'' the national Yonhap news agency
quoted Park as saying.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's agreement to host a summit is a notable compromise
because it previously disdained most attempts at dialogue by Seoul,
a government it considered illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the North felt obligated to talk out of desperation for
economic aid from the rich South, the summit is a spectacular
validation of Kim Dae-jung's so-called ''sunshine'' policy of
engaging Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting of the leaders and having candid exchanges of
opinions and ideas will be the achievement of the summit itself,''
said Moon Jung-in, a politics professor at Seoul's Yonsei
University who will travel to Pyongyang in the president's
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Moon predicted the two countries' stated goal of reunification
could require three or four decades of trust-building measures such
as arms reduction and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim has also warned against expecting too much from
the summit, saying he wants to arrange more meetings that might
yield deals on major issues.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of 37,000 American troops in South Korea and
Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs are among the most
contentious topics.
</P>
<P>
   An obstacle to reconciliation lies in North Korea's persistence
in defining itself as a bulwark against a trio of imperialist
aggressors: Japan, South Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''That residue is still there despite the Cold War being over,''
said Victor Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Without a perceived threat from the outside, North Korea might
be pressed to justify its totalitarian system.
</P>
<P>
   The former military-led governments of South Korea, which is now
a democracy, used to defend their authoritarian ways by warning of
the menace from the North.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for an improvement in ties have been dashed before. In
1972, huge crowds lined the streets of Seoul to welcome a North
Korean Red Cross delegation, but those talks ended inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers of both nations met in 1991 and agreed to
promote reconciliation, yet concern that North Korea was developing
nuclear weapons plunged the peninsula into crisis three years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tension, the two countries agreed to a summit in
1994. But North Korean leader Kim Il Sung died at age 82 only weeks
before he was to meet his South Korean counterpart, Kim Young-sam.
</P>
<P>
   His son and successor, Kim Jong Il, consolidated his power in
the years that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most anxious for the summit's success is 71-year-old
Choi Byong-yool, who fled from the North to the South with his
family shortly after the Korean peninsula was divided in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea what happened to the relatives he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want most urgently is to find out whether our loved
ones are still alive.''

<HEADLINE> Lynx 66, Sol 55  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Katie Smith scored 28 points to lead the Minnesota
Lynx to a 66-55 victory over the Miami Sol on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (4-2) won its third straight, despite the absence of
starting center Kristin Folkl for most of the game. Folkl banged
heads with teammate Marla Brumfield three minutes in and didn't
return.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the WNBA's leading scorer, made 14-of-16 free throws,
including eight straight in the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lennox scored nine of her 12 points in the first half, and
Grace Daley added eight for Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Sheri Sam scored 15, and Katrina Colleton and Jameka
Jones added 10 each for the Sol (1-4), who are still looking for
their first franchise victory at home after three losses at the
AmericanAirlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota hit six straight free throws, with Smith converting
four, to boost its lead to 56-39 with 4:14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Sam scored nine straight points, including a 3-pointer, but
Smith countered with a 3-pointer to boost Minnesota's lead to 59-48
with 2:17 left.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' runner in the lane made it 60-51, but Smith made four
straight free throws to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Lennox scored nine points in the first half and Smith added
eight, including a 3-pointer with 50 seconds left to help the Lynx
take a 30-17 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech standout Kisha Ford, signed on Friday,
scored the first seven points of an 11-1 Sol spurt to cut the
deficit to 45-36 with 8:03 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams shot under 37 percent from the field for the game,
but the Lynx went 22-for-29 from the free-throw line, to Miami's
13-for-22.
</P>
<P>
   Daley hit two driving layups, and Smith added a 3-pointer and
two free throws to cap an 11-0 run, giving the Lynx a 19-11 lead
they wouldn't relinquish. Miami was scoreless for 6:38 during the
spurt.

<HEADLINE> Region Sorrowful Over Assad's Death  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Syria's neighbors mourned the death of
President Hafez Assad, saying that it robbed the region of a
visionary who stood unwavering in the face of challenges to the
Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Arab world, including the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Egypt, Libya, Kuwait, the Palestinian Authority, Morocco and
Bahrain, a three-day mourning period was declared.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, where Syria has 30,000 troops stationed and has
served as the main power-broker for more than two decades, a
one-week mourning period was declared during which flags would be
flown at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Assad's death is a ''tragedy that struck Lebanon in the heart,''
said Prime Minister Salim Hoss. President Emil Lahoud, in a letter
to Assad's son and heir-apparent, Bashar, wrote that he was the
last to speak to the Syrian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last phrase he told me was that our fate is to build for
our children an assuring future and it is our duty to make sure
they inherit better than what we inherited,'' Lahoud said. ''Then
there was a sudden silence and the line broke off.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Arab officials reflected on the life of a man who, in
three decades of autocratic leadership, came to be dubbed the
''Lion of Damascus.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In the peace process we will continue to stand behind our
brothers in Syria until they reach all their rights and get back
all their occupied territories,'' Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdur-Ra'uf S. Rawabdeh said after an emergency Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had been engaged in negotiations, suspended since January,
with Israel to secure the return of the Golan Heights, taken by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Palace in Amman, the Jordanian capital, declared a
40-day mourning period and the government announced a three-day
mourning period during which schools and government offices would
be closed.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the office of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
a close friend of Assad, called him ''the most noble partner in
peace,'' according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, secretary-general of the 21-nation Arab
League based in Cairo, said he did not expect Assad's death to
change Syria's position vis-a-vis the peace process with Israel,
but warned the ''other side will capitalize on the catastrophe to
propose new matters or to try to benefit'' from the death.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Arab Iran extended its condolences, with Iranian radio late
Saturday airing messages from Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
and President Mohammad Khatami, both of whom addressed their
statements to Assad's son, Bashar.
</P>
<P>
   Khamenei said Assad was ''a great leader, and he had an
undeniable, important role in the recent victories in Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Iran were the chief backers of the Hezbollah
guerrillas who led the effort to oust Israel from southern Lebanon.
Israeli forces withdrew last month after 18 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's neighbor, Iraq, interrupted programing to briefly
announce Assad's death but issued no official reaction.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim Brotherhood, Syria's biggest opposition group, said
in a statement hours after Assad's death that what Syria needs is
''a peaceful change of power and a free and popular choosing of the
ruler in a way that preserves for the citizens their security and
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Sadreddine al-Beyanouni, the Brotherhood leader based in
Amman, Jordan, said ''no matter how long the life of a person is,
this will be his fate in the end. Let those alive learn and the
those who are strong stop being arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad's army crushed a 1982 uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood,
a Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement, in the city of Hama. Syrian
troops killed thousands of people and flattened much of the city.

Syrian President Hafez Assad Dies
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syrian President Hafez Assad died Saturday before he
was able to win back the treasured Golan Heights he lost to Israel 33 years ago.
Assad, 69, had been suffering from heart problems, lymphoma and kidney failure,
according to a Lebanese heart surgeon close to the Assad family. The surgeon,
who insisted on anonymity, said Assad died of heart failure. The death of the
skillful and ruthless leader could deal a blow to Mideast peace prospects by
ushering in a prolonged period of instability, but it could also mean an
opportunity for Syria to forsake at least part of its implacable enmity toward
Israel.

   NORTHFIELD, Minn. (AP) -- President Clinton today told graduates of a private

for it. ''Over the past 20 years, the cost of college has quadrupled,'' Clinton
told 423 graduates of Carleton College, about 40 miles south of Minneapolis.
''I'll bet there are a lot of parents here who have taken second mortgages or
second jobs to help pay those tuition bills.''

Gore Hopes for Political Revival

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a week in which he launched a multimillion-dollar TV

says he has reached a turning point in his campaign against George W. Bush.
National polls show the race is tight, after Bush held slight leads in recent
weeks. The Texas governor remains ahead in the more important state-by-state
battle, however, with leads in enough states to give him more than two-thirds of
the 270 electoral votes required to win the White House.

Strong Quake Rocks Taiwan

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook central Taiwan on Sunday,

magnitude of 6.7, was centered about 30 miles north of Mount Yu, Taiwan's
highest mountain, about 180 miles south of the capital, Taipei, the Central
Weather Bureau said. The quake was followed by seven aftershocks with magnitudes
of 4 and 5. All the quakes were considered aftershocks of a 7.6-magnitude

the height of tourist season. Chuck Anderson, 44, a high school coach and vice
principal, lost his right arm above the elbow. And Richard Watley, a 55-year-old
Gulf Shores barber, was bitten on his right hip and right arm. They were among a

<HEADLINE> Wizards 0, United 0, Game Halted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saturday night's game between the Kansas City
Wizards and D.C. United was called after a scoreless first half
because four banks of lights were dark at RFK Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Under MLS rules, the game is official because at least one half
was played. United president Kevin Payne, a member of the league's
competition committee, said he will appeal the 0-0 tie because he
doesn't remember the league passing a rule declaring a game valid
after one half.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to appeal it,'' Payne said. ''If the match is not
replayed, we will honor these tickets at a future match.''
</P>
<P>
   RFK Stadium, built in 1961, has eight banks of lights, and half
of them -- all on the same side of the field -- were not functioning
all game. But since the first half was played in evening sunlight
and dusk, they had no effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the second half, one half of the field was
distinctly more shadowed than the other. Referee Marcel Yonan made
the decision not to resume the game because of concerns about
player safety.
</P>
<P>
   Officials then announced there would be a five-minute delay. One
hour later, the game was called at 9:37 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''We waited until the electrician couldn't get it fixed,'' Payne
said.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 p.m., when nearly all the 21,035 fans had departed, all
the lights finally came back on.
</P>
<P>
   John Ertmann, an MLS executive vice president and the league's
chief legal officer, confirmed the result would be official. He
also said the rules mandated a minimum 20-minute wait before
calling the game, with no maximum time stipulated.
</P>
<P>
   The outage could speed the push for a new soccer-only stadium to
replace RFK, which has also been the site of fan violence at some
United games.
</P>
<P>
   Neville Waters, marketing director for the D.C. Sports and
Entertainment Commission, which operates the stadium, said such a
power outage had not happened before ''in the 39 years the stadium
has been opened.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it was the karma of the season,'' said Waters, referring
to United's losing record.
</P>
<P>
   The result gives United (3-9-3) a modest three-game unbeaten
streak -- a win and two ties -- after the worst start in team
history. They dominated the first half, outshooting the Wizards
8-3, including 5-1 in shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Meola got credit for his league-leading 10th shutout for
just 45 minutes' work for the Wizards (10-1-3).
</P>
<P>
   The long delay before the game was called angered many fans, who
said there were no announcements made for some 55 minutes to inform
them of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very frustrated,'' Mark Brown of Arlington, Va., said
shortly before the game was called. ''They should just level with
us. We can't sit here all night.''

<HEADLINE> Diplomats Fly To Solomon Islands  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Militants seized a provincial
capital in the western Solomon Islands early Sunday, bringing a
third warring faction into the volatile crisis gripping this tiny
South Pacific nation, radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   One young person was killed in the attack in the city of Gizo,
according to a broadcast by New Zealand's National Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted provincial Solomon
Islands police as saying 45 armed men, some apparently from
neighboring Papua New Guinea, raided the Gizo police station and
telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The radio reports said some of the militants had apparently come
from Bougainville, an island in eastern Papua New Guinea that was
the scene of a 10-year secessionist war that took thousands of
lives before a cease-fire was signed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Papuan militants apparently teamed up with local forces,
adding a third armed group to the conflict, Australian radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone lines had been cut since early morning so little
information was available from Gizo, according to Solomon Islands
radio. Gizo is about 230 miles northwest of the national capital,
Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Islands police contacted by The Associated Press on
Sunday said they had no immediate information on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The latest troubles broke out as more Australians and New
Zealanders left the Solomon Islands on military airplanes that
evacuated them on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 480 foreigners had left Saturday on an Australian warship
taking them to Cairns on a voyage that would last several days.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand flew to
Honiara on Saturday to meet with government officials -- including
Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, who was seized at gunpoint by
rebels on Monday and now faces a vote of no confidence in the
parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and New Zealand
Foreign Minister Phil Goff, who were returning home Sunday, met
with leaders of the Malaita rebels who seized Ulufa'alu and also a
representative of rival Isatabu rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Isatabu Freedom Movement is run by natives of the main
island of Guadalcanal, who are trying to force Malaita people who

seized machine guns and ammunition to obtain an edge in weaponry
over the Isatabu rebels, who use mostly single-shot rifles and
homemade guns.

<HEADLINE> Militants Seize S. Islands Capital  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Militants seized a provincial
capital in the western Solomon Islands early Sunday, bringing a
third warring faction into the volatile crisis gripping this tiny
South Pacific nation, radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   One young person was killed in the attack in the city of Gizo,
according to a broadcast by New Zealand's National Radio.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Broadcasting Corp. quoted provincial Solomon
Islands police as saying 45 armed men, some apparently from
neighboring Papua New Guinea, raided the Gizo police station and
telecommunications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The radio reports said some of the militants had apparently come
from Bougainville, an island in eastern Papua New Guinea that was
the scene of a 10-year secessionist war that took thousands of
lives before a cease-fire was signed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Papuan militants apparently teamed up with local forces,
adding a third armed group to the conflict, Australian radio said.
</P>
<P>
   Phone lines had been cut since early morning so little
information was available from Gizo, according to Solomon Islands
radio. Gizo is about 230 miles northwest of the national capital,
Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon Islands police contacted by The Associated Press on
Sunday said they had no immediate information on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The latest troubles broke out as more Australians and New
Zealanders left the Solomon Islands on military airplanes that
evacuated them on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   About 480 foreigners had left Saturday on an Australian warship
taking them to Cairns on a voyage that would last several days.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Australia and New Zealand flew to
Honiara on Saturday to meet with government officials -- including
Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, who was seized at gunpoint by
rebels on Monday and now faces a vote of no confidence in the

<HEADLINE> Rockies 12, Rangers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Larry Walker hit a three-run homer for his first
home run since coming off the disabled list as the Colorado Rockies
won their seventh straight home game, beating the Texas Rangers
12-6 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shumpert went 3-for-4 with a home run and three RBIs.
Colorado reliever Gabe White hit his first career home run in his
25th career at-bat as the Rockies (33-25) moved eight games over
.500 for the first time since May 12, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez homered twice and drove in four runs for Texas.
Dave Martinez went 2-for-3 with a home run and scored two runs in
his first game with the Rangers, who lost for the fourth straight
time.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who came off the DL on Friday after a stress fracture in
his right elbow sidelined him for 30 days, homered with two on in
his first at bat, also had a double and was walked three times.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton lowered his batting average to .400 with a 1-for-5
night. Scott Karl (2-2), who had been demoted to the bullpen,
worked 2 2-3 scoreless innings for his first win since May 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers led 2-0 in the first inning on Rodriguez's 20th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Loaiza (3-4) immediately got in trouble walking Tom
Goodwin and Shumpert before Walker's first homer since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Texas took a 5-3 lead in the third inning when Martinez and
Rodriguez homered to right. Rodriguez's second homer of the game
came with Palmeiro aboard. It was Rodriguez's fourth multihomer
game of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies scored five runs in their half of the third to knock
out Loaiza. Hammonds had an RBI single, Goodwin had a sacrifice
fly, Shumpert had a two-run triple and scored on Matt Perisho's
wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton tripled and scored on Palmeiro's two-out single to
center off Jarvis getting the Rangers within 8-6. Karl relieved
Jarvis and got Rodriguez to ground out to end the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Doubles by Walker and Jeff Cirillo to open the sixth inning
increased Colorado's lead to 9-6. White and Shumpert hit solo home
runs in the seventh inning off Perisho.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas designated OF Jason McDonald for assignment on
Saturday to free a roster spot for OF Dave Martinez, who was
acquired Friday from the Cubs in a three-team trade. ... Walker
emphatically gave high-fives to teammates after hitting his first
inning home run. ... Loazia's 2 2-3 inning outing matched his
shortest outing of the season.

<HEADLINE> Devils, Stars Tied 1-1 In OT  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- For the second straight game, New Jersey and
Dallas went into overtime with the Devils trying to win the Stanley
Cup and the Stars fighting to hold on to it.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Niedermayer gave New Jersey a brief lead in the second
period before Mike Keane answered for Dallas, and the teams went
into the extra session tied 1-1 Saturday night in Game 6 of the
Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey leads the best-of-seven series 3-2 and is making its
second attempt to take the Stanley Cup away from the defending
champion Stars. Game 6 was made necessary when Dallas beat the
Devils 1-0 in triple overtime Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 5, the Devils -- trying for their second championship
-- played a team-record tying 22 straight games without needing
overtime. That was one short of the NHL record.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas also beat Colorado in overtime in Game 5 of the Western
Conference finals, the Stars' only other overtime playoff game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half of the third period, the pace picked up as
the teams fought to end it in regulation. But as has been the case
in the last two games, New Jersey goalie Martin Brodeur and Dallas'
Ed Belfour refused to give in.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur denied Scott Thornton and Brett Hull in close and
Belfour turned aside a good chance for Patrik Elias.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour made 30 saves -- 78 in two games -- to 28 for Brodeur in
regulation. The Devils goalie stopped all but two of 70 shots in
that span.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer scored the Devils' second short-handed goal of the
series 5:18 into the second, with Brian Rafalski off for holding.
Niedermayer's fifth of the playoffs snapped Belfour's scoreless
streak at 145:31, dating to early in the final period of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, 2-for-15 in the series with the man-advantage, have
allowed as many goals on their power plays as they've scored.
</P>
<P>
   Keane made it 1-1 just 1:09 later when he took a beautiful pass
in the right circle from Scott Thornton and wristed a shot over
Brodeur's glove. The teams have been tied for 165:12 of the last
166:21, covering over seven periods.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey almost retook the lead twice, but were denied by
Belfour and the goalposts.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie John Madden, who has the Devils' other short-handed goal
in the series, sent a shot off the post just past the midway point.
With just under five minutes remaining, Patrik Elias had his shot
from the slot hit Belfour and then the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a 3-on-1 late in the period, but Brodeur was able to
knock the puck into the stands with Brenden Morrow in front.
</P>
<P>
   The physical play picked up and the two captains traded punches
with 6:12 left in the period. Dallas' Derian Hatcher and New
Jersey's Scott Stevens were sent off for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions were high after a first period that saw three injuries
and no goals.
</P>
<P>
   The teams that played scoreless hockey for 106 minutes, 21
seconds in Game 5, picked up where they left off. There has not
been a first-period goal in the series since Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Sykora, a forward on the Devils' top line, was the most
seriously injured when he was leveled by Hatcher. The Dallas
captain caught him high with a forearm that Sykora never saw
coming. After a delay of about five minutes, Sykora was wheeled off
the ice with his head and back immobilized.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a CT scan that was normal and held overnight in the
hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sydor, who left with a leg injury, and Joe Nieuwendyk,
who was dumped on his head, were lost to the Stars 28 seconds
apart. Sydor was hurt at 3:20 when he fell back and got his leg
pinned after checking Scott Gomez in the defensive left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk was forced to leave when he was dropped by Jason
Arnott.
</P>
<P>
   After the two matched up in a faceoff, Arnott slipped his stick
between Nieuwendyk's legs and flipped him back. Nieuwendyk looked
shaky as he headed to the bench, but returned shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor was being evaluated and was ruled out for the game. No
penalties were called on any of the plays.
</P>
<P>
   Elias was stopped twice on one shift in front by Belfour.
Dallas' best chance came when Hull streaked in on a partial
breakaway about five minutes in.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was slashed on the play by Ken Daneyko, drawing a power
play that was unsuccessful. The Stars failed on both man-advantages
in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had one power-play chance when Jon Sim went off for
elbowing and recorded no shots.

<HEADLINE> New York farmers say federal aid measures leave them out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Lots of apples, little worth.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, New York's apple growers say, the federal
government doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   The growers are hoping their state and national representatives
will be able to push through emergency legislation to help
Northeast apple farmers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer backs the legislation, part of the
federal 2001 Agricultural Appropriations bill, as do Reps. James
Walsh, R- Onondaga, and Maurice Hinchey, D-Saugerties.
</P>
<P>
   After hail from the 1998 Labor Day storm wiped out $500,000
worth of Albion apple grower Bruce Krenning's crops, this past
fall's batch of New York apples had great volume, but too small a
size for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't keep doing this,'' Krenning said Friday at a meeting
of farmers, agriculture officials and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Krenning said, his loss reached
$700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Existing agricultural disaster relief has been geared toward
Southern and Midwestern crops that either grow or don't, said state
Department of Agriculture Deputy Commissioner Rick Zimmerman.
</P>
<P>
   The government says, ''You still have an apple, so what's the
problem?'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is stalled in the House of Representatives. It includes
trade provisions with Cuba, which have been strongly opposed.

Assad's Son Clears Leadership Hurdle
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Following the death of President Hafez Assad
Saturday, Syria's parliament overwhelmingly voted to amend an article in the
constitution that requires the head of state to be at least 40 years old,
clearing the way for Assad's son, Bashar, to assume the presidency. The
legislators voted to lower the age to 34. Bashar is 34. Then parliament
adjourned until June 25. Assad had been grooming Bashar for future leadership,
but the British-educated ophthalmologist has held no major political office. But
he was expected to be brought into the ruling Baath Party leadership at a
congress scheduled for later this month.

unable to open up a gap over the Republican opposition, according to three
independent polls. When Giuliani pulled out of the race on May 19, Republican
leaders predicted that by late summer or early fall their new candidate, Rep.

Quinnipiac University Polling Institute came out with its offering. It showed
Clinton and Lazio tied, at 44 percent each.
