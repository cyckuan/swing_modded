EDITORIAL: IN SURVIVAL MODE AT SHEA

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Oct. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Should the Mets win the next two games against the Atlanta
Braves, and wind up in the World Series, they would become the
first team in history to win a seven-game playoff series after
losing the first three. But if there is any team capable of defying
history, it is these Mets, a team that wins just when people least
expect it, a team that not only thrives on adversity but seems
absolutely to require it.
</P>
<P>
   Make these Mets play in a rainstorm. Send their normally
reliable hitters into a swoon. Rough up their all-star catcher so
that he plays at half speed. Entice their manager to make
unflattering remarks about his players' intelligence, thus creating
tension in the clubhouse. Do all of these things, and suddenly the
Mets are on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the last few weeks. With only a few days left in
the season, the Mets pulled out of a near-fatal tailspin to win a
wild-card spot. Last Saturday, down three games to the Braves, a
gutsy double-steal followed by a single from John Olerud gave the
Mets a 3-2 come-from-behind victory. Then came Sunday and a game
that seemed Wagnerian in length and ambience, a 5-hour-46-minute
marathon marked by intermittent drizzles, with the outcome
seemingly riding on each pitch. Again the Mets fell behind, this
time in the 15th inning, only to be rescued by a bases-loaded blast
over the right-field wall by Robin Ventura. On almost any other
team, Ventura would have been credited with a home run and four
runs batted in. But being a Met, he was mobbed by his jubilant
teammates before he could touch second base, so his hit goes into
the record book as a single.
</P>
<P>
   All this must be tough on the players. We know it is tough on
the fans, their nerves stretched thinner by the day. But who's
complaining? Not Ventura. Not us. Besides, Mets fans have always
paid a price. This time, at least, they are getting a return on
their emotional investment.

THEME OF THE SPRING SEASON: ANYONE CAN JOIN THE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ballyhoo and fashion writers tend to go together like ham and
eggs. Mention the looks that surfaced at the spring shows in New
York and Europe _ the new volume! Discreet chic! The return of
1970s glamour! _ and ordinary people start ducking into their
overcoats like so many Yertles.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them for wanting to drop out of fashion when a
lot of what has come down the runways in the 1990s, and much of the
burbling that has accompanied it, has seemed contrived to make
people feel like rejects? Not in the game at all!
</P>
<P>
   And when you think about it, most of the changes that have taken
place over the last couple of years were so marginal, yet
invariably described with such highfalutin preciousness, like
calling a plain-looking Prada bag a ``silent status symbol,'' or
equating a ruffled hem or dour poncho with a wider cultural
movement, that it's hardly any wonder that women have felt excluded
from fashion. There just hasn't been anything in it for them.
</P>
<P>
   Strange as it must seem, the new clothes for spring 2000 open
the door. One has only to consider the collections of Miuccia
Prada, Karl Lagerfeld, Hussein Chalayan, Ralph Lauren and Calvin
Klein, who in different ways put forth a look that was at once
glamorous and accessible. That was the message of the shows, more
than a trend toward ladylike sophistication, springtime polka dots
or the 1970s revivalist style of Yves Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it's the incredibly simple notion, nearly lost in an era
of awkward and ugly fashion, that anyone can join the club and at
least feel welcome. Herewith, a few of the big themes of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   That Discreet Charm: Although it was too early in September,
during the New York shows, to see where things were going, Mssrs.
Klein and Lauren (with a little help from Oscar de la Renta and
Michael Kors) signaled a more refined femininity with shirtwaist
dresses, slinky polo tops, more voluminous skirts and Palm Beach
colors.
</P>
<P>
   The laurels, though, went to Ms. Prada, whose many combinations
of the blouse and A-line skirt, worn just below the waist and
unexpectedly with stockings and round-toed pumps, amounted to a sea
change. After that, you couldn't look at other designers'
collections, especially if they were loaded with girlish ruffles
and other retreads from last season, without thinking they looked
glaringly out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Marc Jacobs sent out his sporty ``Girls Just Want to
Have Fun'' collection for Louis Vuitton, it seemed as if some
fashion deity were backstage pulling the strings. Just about
everybody had a trench coat, from Josephus Thimister's long white
versions with military buttons, to Jacobs' jaunty style
outrageously embellished with logos. It's intriguing that something
as practical, and potentially dowdy, as a trench coat was so
prevalent, but what that says is that designers are taking a more
realistic view of how modern women want to dress.
</P>
<P>
   It's a 1950s Thing: The fact that so many designers added volume
to skirts was another sign that fashion is moving away from boring
minimalism. Chalayan made the strongest statement with his simple
cotton dresses worn tight through the bodice and flaring out in
soft gathers over the knees. But Lauren was in a similar groove
with full gingham or polka-dot skirts, and in Paris it almost felt
like prom night, with petticoats rustling at Dries van Noten and
John Galliano.
</P>
<P>
   The look may evoke the glamorous 1950s, or an Iowa barn dance,
but suffice to say that where there is volume, there is more
sensuality. Take a cue from the moderate approach of Lagerfeld, who
balanced his bell-shaped skirts with tight camisole tops, and from
the low-slung style of Ms. Prada. Her box-pleated skirts, in
printed organdy, were worn with uncomplicated turtlenecks _ a mix
that anyone can adapt.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And a 1980s Thing: Whether because of the slinky, one-sleeved
dresses at Gucci, the revival of pearls and quilting at Chanel, or
the broad-shouldered blouson jackets at Balenciaga and Jeremy
Scott, there was a pronounced sense of the '80s in the collections
in Europe. And in a way, Scott now seems a prophet, rather than
strictly a misfit, because for the last couple of seasons he has
been telling people through his over-the-top collections that the
``Dynasty'' decade was coming.
</P>
<P>
   But don't take too much of that seriously. What Lagerfeld did at
Chanel, and at Fendi, was to give some of the shapes one identifies
with that decade a softer, lighter look. He may have brought back
the Chanel boucle suit, but now it's unlined, free of gold buttons
and with a printed chiffon blouse or lace T-shirt peaking out from
the lapels. His brilliance was to use such recognizable Chanel
symbols, like quilting, and tease the old ladies-who-lunch crowd
into believing that maybe they aren't passe after all.
</P>
<P>
   Python Isn't Just for Cowgirls: Judging from all the python,
real and printed, that turned up on the runways, one can't help
wondering who's supplying all this snakeskin. Tom Ford opened his
Gucci show with python print dresses, and then took the look even
further with python polo shirts worn over matching track pants with
stiletto shoes. (Alexander McQueen also showed towering high-heels
with silky trainer pants, a style that cleverly mixed '80s
fashion-magazine glamour with '90s rapper style.)
</P>
<P>
   What made the python work was how designers treated it like any
other feminine fabric. Klein utterly simplified it as an A-line
skirt in azure, while Alber Elbaz of Saint Laurent cut both a
shirtwaist dress and a trench coat from natural python skin, and
showed both looks with vivid suede pumps, as if to say, ``What more
do you need when you've got so much snake on your back?''
</P>
<P>
   Hot Color, Cool Denim: Nothing invites women to play the game
more than color. There were splashes of pink peony at Carolina
Herrera, hot-house blooms at de la Renta and intense carnival hues
at Junya Watanabe and Comme des Garcons. Jil Sander's pale pink
floral prints look faded, as if they had been left out in the
California sun, while Donatella Versace used lavish jungle prints
on her jersey dresses. At Fendi, Lagerfeld just kept layering on
the color _ now fuchsia, now sunflower yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Lang turned out to be prescient, not only with his
bloomers (yes, there were romper pants everywhere, from Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana to Marni), but also with his lewd palette of purples and
electric blues. The thing to remember about color is that it
typically signifies a rebelliousness. A slim skirt with a
stock-tied blouse and a scoop-neck sweater may look like the
squarest thing around, except when the colors have the wattage of a
Las Vegas sign. That was Ms. Prada's clever idea.
</P>
<P>
   As for denim, it continues to test designers' ingenuity. In some
ways, the fabric has become more deluxe, showing up as polished
shirtwaist dresses or emblazoned (at Christian Dior) with logos.
Either way, it may be the most accessible thing of all for spring.

ROOKIES COME TO STARS' DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC ZARATE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The defenders of the Stanley Cup have suffered
some casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Two raw recruits, fresh from basic training at Camp Hitchcock,
have suddenly been thrust into a front-line foxhole.
</P>
<P>
   Knee surgery on veteran defenseman Shawn Chambers will keep him
in sick bay until mid-January. Arthroscopic knee surgery will keep
Richard Matvichuk out for the next 10 days to two weeks. So newbies
Brad Lukowich and Alan Letang will get their chance to earn some
combat ribbons by helping the Stars' corps of defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be very critical for us,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``This is a great opportunity for them.''
</P>
<P>
   How Lukowich and Letang fare during an expected nightly barrage
of pucks from NHL shooters ready to win battles from the best team
of last season could greatly determine if this season's Stars are
up to the challenge of winning another lengthy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot more weight on me,'' Lukowich said. ``I can't
be a liability back there. I think it's more exciting than
nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Letang, ``It puts a little bit more responsibility on me
and Brad. When we get the responsibility of extra ice time, we're
going to have to show we deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich has played in six of the Stars' first eight games,
averaging 11 minutes, 38 seconds of playing time per contest.
Letang has played in three games, averaging 12:51 per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to make sure to play a lot more low-risk,'' Lukowich
said, ``and keep my game simple.''
</P>
<P>
   In defenseman-talk, that means keeping your body, or at least
your stick, between an opponent and the goalie. It also requires
the defenseman to unflinchingly drop to the ice to block a slap
shot, and to willingly hurl himself into body and boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``His game is a very simplistic defending game,'' coach Ken
Hitchcock said of Lukowich. ``When he plays that way he becomes a
very effective player for us. I think his play has improved on a
game-by-game basis to the point where he is more involved.
Physically, he's more tenacious. It's led to better play in every
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookies Lukowich, 23, and Letang, 24, have already proven
themselves to Hitchcock by making the 23-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   But NHL rookies usually get most of their playing time in
practice, learning the brand of hockey played at this level from
savvy veterans with speed and skills to burn.
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich and Letang have been paired most often with Matvichuk.
Darryl Sydor has been in a tandem with Jamie Pushor, and Sergei
Zubov has been paired with Derian Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a group of seven,'' Hitchcock said, ``and we'll
now base it on opposition and we'll now base it on the type of game
we've got to play. I really think all seven guys are going to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Letang, who was paired with Chambers most often in
training camp, isn't thrilled with how he's getting this
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough finding out because \RChambers\S helped me a
lot,'' Letang said. ``We'd talk after shifts. He'd help me with
positioning, or point out options in situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich learned some about positioning Wednesday night when he
was beaten by San Jose's Niklas Sundstrom for the first goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played my stick the wrong way, I slapped it onto the ice,''
Lukowich said after the game. ``If I would have left it there, the
puck wouldn't have went right through. It was my mistake, and it
cost us the game. I can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Lukowich said he replayed the mistake in his
mind the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't just forget about it,'' Lukowich said. ``It was a big
play, and I didn't meet the task. I don't feel pressure in what I
have to do, but there's proof in the minus one. It cost us the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukowich was a fourth-round pick (90th overall) by the New York
Islanders in 1994. The Stars acquired him two years later by giving
a third-round pick to the Islanders in 1997. Lukowich played 14
regular-season games with the Stars last season and eight playoff
games. He had one assist in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Letang spent most of last season with the Canadian National
team, then signed as a free agent with the Stars in March. He
appeared in 12 games with Michigan, the Stars' International Hockey
League affiliate, getting three goals and three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Finding their defensive roles on a team built to win the
low-scoring games is a challenge these two are ready to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going take a little bit of time to know where
guys are on the ice without even having to take a second look,''
Letang said. ``The more we play together, the stronger it's going
to get.''

INJURIES KEEP TEXAS TECH'S DYKES SCRAMBLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes is running out of options, but said
he will continue to try and utilize the talents of freshman Shaud
Williams and Sammy Morris at tailback.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders lost Kyle Allamon with a broken elbow last
Thursday. Dykes moved Allamon from tight end to fullback the week
before the Texas A&AMP;M game and shifted Morris to tailback in the
absence of Ricky Williams, who is out for the season. Morris led
Tech to a 21-19 upset of then-No. 5 Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Allamon's injury forced Morris' shift to fullback and the
insertion of Shaud Williams at tailback. Williams responded with a
Big 12 offensive player of the week performance: 230 yards and two
touchdowns in leading the Red Raiders over Colorado, 31-10. Dykes
said Morris will continue to play at tailback as long as 240-pound
senior Rudy Renda can continue to play at fullback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll continue to work in that fashion,'' Dykes
said. ``Shaud really gave us a shot in the arm with his performance
against Colorado. That may have been the best we've played with a
new lineup every week. It's been frustrating, not a lot of things
`gee' and `haw' when you're shuffling people in and out. But the
more we play together, the better we'll get. I hope that's the way
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Jason May (knee) was back in the lineup against Colorado
for the first time since the season opener. Tackle Matt Heider
(knee) may be back this week for Baylor, but Dykes said he'll have
a hard time reclaiming his position from freshman Rex Richards.
\Nsubheds:No decision from Dykes Spikes Dykes said that despite
speculation on his retirement at the end of the season, he hasn't
made a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens when \Rthe season\S is all over,'' he
said. ``I haven't thought about it. A lot of people have been
thinking about it for me. People have been talking about it before
the season started. We're still trying to win a championship and
that's all that's on my mind. I don't know why you would think
about \Rretiring\S now, even if you were going to. When the smoke
clears, we'll decided what's going on.'' \Nsubheds:Calling all
Williams Baylor coach Kevin Steele said that regardless of whether
the Bears have to contend with Sammy Morris or Shaud Williams on
Saturday, he's made up his mind about one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find a running back in the state of Texas that has the
last name of Williams, we're going to recruit him _ no matter
what,'' he said. \Nsubheds:Cyclones eye winning season Iowa State
(4-2, 1-2) hasn't been to a bowl game in 21 years and hasn't had a
winning season in a decade. Coach Dan McCarney said how his team
handles the rampant optimism that both streaks will soon come to an
end _ as did the 26-game conference road losing streak at Missouri
on Saturday _ will determine whether or not they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be one of the big keys,'' he said. ``We don't
want to hide the possibilities and opportunities that lie ahead.
This is all foreign ground to this team _ winning games, having a
winning season and the possibility of postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But every game is a dogfight ... and we have five major
challenges ahead. We're starting to gain some confidence in this
program and on this team and we're going to need it the remaining
weeks of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State plays Colorado on Saturday and finishes with Texas,
at Texas Tech, Oklahoma and at Kansas. \Nsubheds:Briefly Texas A&AMP;M
coach R.C. Slocum said running back Dante Hall (high ankle sprain)
is doubtful this week for Oklahoma, but that fullback Tiki Hardeman
(groin/ankle), linebacker Jason Glenn (ankle) and offensive tackle
Andy Vincent (concussion) could return.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Texas Tech's Shaud Williams, Big 12 players of
the week are Tech safety Kevin Curtis and Kansas State kicker Jamie
Rheem.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State runner and punt returner David Allen might be out
2-3 weeks with a sprained knee.

 &HT;    New York strikes early in quest to KO Boston
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At Babe Ruth's final resting place at the Gate of
Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, N.Y., somone had neatly placed a
Nomar Garciaparra Red Sox uniform top against the headstone.
</P>
<P>
   Along the first-base railing at Fenway Park, the club had seated
Julia Ruth Stevens, the Babe's 82-year-old daughter, who was
professing newfound affection for the Olde Towne team. Every
spiritual measure had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, behold how the Curse of the Bambino endures.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-one years after the Boston Red Sox traded away Ruth to
New York, the bad karma left in its wake continued Monday night,
New York ending Boston's season in Game 5 of the ALCS. Derek Jeter
struck a two-run homer in the first inning and the Sox allowed a
couple unearned runs in the seventh, leading to a 6-1 Yankees
victory and their third World Series date in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The AL champions returned to New York late Monday to await a
conclusion of the Atlanta-New York NLCS and their opponent for the
World Series, which opens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez threw seven
shutout innings with a postseason career-high nine strikeouts
before Jason Varitek opened the eighth with a home run. Nomar
Garciaparra doubled, chasing Hernandez after 138 pitches, and
Boston rallied, walks by Troy O'Leary and Butch Huskey loading the
bases. But Ramiro Mendonza struck out Scott Hatteberg and induced
an inning-ending foul-out from Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter and former Brave Kent Mercker succeeded in
placing the Red Sox in an immediate hole. After Chuck Knoblauch
opened the game with a single, Jeter, who began the night hitting
.385 this postseason, drilled a 2-1 fastball off the top of a
camera stand above the center field wall for his first home run of
the series and an instant 2-0 New York lead.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed two pairs of base-runners _ back-to-back
singles in the first inning and a pair of walks in the second _ but
the Sox went 0-for-6 behind them. By the third, Hernandez appeared
to have adjusted to the mid-40-degree temperatures. He struck out
five through the first three innings, and when Garciaparra, after
reaching base on a Jeter error, reached third base in the sixth,
Hernandez ended the inning with a Mike Stanley fly-out and a Brian
Daubach ground-out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees then broke out with a two-run seventh, aided by
Boston's LCS-record ninth and 10th errors (Mike Stanley and Jose
Offerman) which loaded the bases. Chili Davis and Tino each drove
in one run, both of them unearned.

BERTKA ATTENDING USC; HE WENT TO KENT STATE. 
BERTKA'S AT HOME WITH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 _ CORRECTION: REMOVING ERROR ABOUT(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Bertka has survived four decades in a
profession that eats its wise.
</P>
<P>
   It's little wonder why. Bertka is universally respected and
genuinely liked in pro basketball circles. He has friends
everywhere and not one adversary, which makes him about as rare in
the buck-passing, backside-covering, ego-levitating NBA as the
player who wins league titles in both scoring and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   His affiliation with the Lakers pre-dates Jack Nicholson's. He
has a better seat than Dyan Cannon, even if he is less visible.
</P>
<P>
   In two tours with the team, Bertka has outlasted nine head
coaches and the Forum, too. He has stories older than any of the
Laker girls, fond memories of a game predicated on passing and
defense and a mindset as obsolete as the set shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the privilege of earning a living in the NBA,''
said Bertka, the only assistant from the 1998-99 staff to be
retained by new coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka is joined by Frank Hamblen, Jim Cleamons and 76-year-old
Tex Winter. Contrary to popular belief, Jackson did not approach
Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon about the role of scout/stat man
before offering it to Bertka, who is 72 but, as far as we can tell,
as ageless as Ann-Margret.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the respect of everybody in this business,'' Hamblen
said of Bertka, who is in his 19th season with the Lakers. ``We're
happy to be associated with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all blended families should get along so famously.
</P>
<P>
   Over a late snack on the second day of training camp, Winter was
completing Bertka's thoughts and Bertka was finishing Hamblen's
sentences and their conversation flowed without the slightest
break. Oh what rejoicing there'd be if the Lakers could run the
triangle offense so seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Bertka's enduring place on the Lakers' bench attests to life's
weird geometry.
</P>
<P>
   He is close as kin to Winter. The two have known each other
since the 1940s. Bertka met Hamblen 20 years later when both were
scouting for NBA teams (the Lakers and San Diego Rockets,
respectively). In those years, Bertka and Hamblen spent more time
hanging out with each other than with their respective families.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players the Lakers drafted, based on Bertka's
legwork, was Cleamons in 1971. Another player Bertka evaluated went
on to have a decent career with the Knicks. He was a kid whose
effort far exceeded his talent. A fellow by the name of Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really ironic,'' Bertka said. ``It just goes to show you
never know how many times your path is going to cross with people.
You never know what your fate might be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers fired Del Harris in February and dismissed Kurt
Rambis three months later, Bertka figured the only organization in
his future might be AARP.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need his bifocals to see the writing on the wall. He
could understand Jackson wanting to bring in his own staff. Out
with the old, in with the new. Bertka braced himself to hear he was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Winter, though, had other ideas. No sooner had the longtime
assistant packed his bags for Southern California than he started
politicking on Bertka's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pushed hard for (retaining) Bill,'' Winter said. ``I thought
it was very important we utilize Bill's background and
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Bertka long had been the good solider, doing whatever was asked
of him without complaint. He assiduously kept all the statistics
only a defensive player could love (not surprisingly, Robert Horry
has a special place in his heart for Bertka). He kept the head
coach's seat warm for one game against the Clippers after Harris
was fired and before Rambis was promoted.
</P>
<P>
   And when he met with Jackson over the summer, Bertka kept it
real.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him know I've been with the Lakers all my adult life
(save for a seven-year stint with the expansion New Orleans
Jazz),'' Bertka said, ``and that they can bury me in the
organization as far as I'm concerned. I told him I've never looked
for a damn job anywhere else and I wasn't about to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have done whatever they wanted, though a
(front-office) position (such as the one Rambis was force-fed)
wasn't my preference. I enjoy working with the guys. I like to
teach. It's the thing I like to do the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He can instruct us all, this genial man who loves the life he
leads and has a kind word for everybody he meets. The lesson?
Ambition takes tricky bounces, but decency's rebound always comes
back to you. &QL;

KANSAS CITY ARCHITECTS DESIGN NOSTALGIC NBA FIELD HOUSE IN
INDIANAPOLIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Conseco Fieldhouse opens Nov. 6 in Indianapolis, its barrel
roof and old-fashioned steel scoreboard will seem ready for Friday
night battles among the state's high school basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the nod to nostalgia, this is no high school gym.
The $183 million field house will be home to the Indiana Pacers of
the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the latest handiwork of sports architects in the
Kansas City office of Ellerbe Becket. The Minneapolis-based firm
was allowed to design one of the few arenas built specifically for
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Construction began on the field house in July 1997. It stands 14
stories tall and has 18,500 seats. Some of the luxury suites will
be only 12 rows from courtside, and all seats have a clear view of
the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the arena's nod to Indiana's basketball heritage that
is getting much of the notice. The state has 17 out of 20 of the
largest high school field houses in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Its annual high school state tournament attracts hundreds of
thousands of spectators. Indiana was the locale for the basketball
movie ``Hoosiers,'' the story of a small-town team that won the
state championship.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco Fieldhouse, even with its 69 private suites, seeks to
pay homage to that heritage with the retro design that includes the
barrel roof. The field house includes a practice court that can be
seen from the street, a rare feature for an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-foot trophy case with artifacts of Indiana basketball
includes Larry Bird's jersey _ he played at Indiana State. Four
pavilions in the field house will tell the story of Indiana
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted this team (Pacers) to be a part of the tradition of
Indiana basketball...,'' said Donnie Walsh, president of the NBA
team. ``I think it culminates with Conseco Fieldhouse.''

YANKEES ELIMINATE RED SOX WITH A 6-1 VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Orlando Hernandez chuckled when asked if he had ever
pitched before fans as angry as those in Fenway Park. If you pitch
badly in Cuba, he said of his homeland, then your own fans will
kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Unaffected by the seething Red Sox fans, the cold or the
magnitude of Monday night's game, Hernandez shut out Boston over
the first seven innings on Monday night as the Yankees clinched
their 36th American League pennant early Tuesday morning with a 6-1
victory over Boston in Game 5 of the League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's first-inning, two-run home run off Kent Mercker
put the Yankees ahead and Boston, which chased the Yankees all
season before finishing second in the Eastern Division, never
caught up. Jorge Posada helped make sure Boston did not with a
two-run homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans will forever lament the role of the umpires in this
series, mistaken decisions that went against Boston in
consequential moments in Games 1 and 4. Still, it will be the
Yankees who will play Game 1 of the World Series either in Atlanta
or at Shea Stadium on Saturday night, in pursuit of their 25th
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lead the Mets three games to two and will play Game 6
in Atlanta on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the best-four-of-seven-game series against the Red
Sox in five games, the Yankees averted a possible Game 7 meeting
with Boston's Pedro Martinez, who dominated them _ and the rest of
the American League _ so thoroughly this season. The Yankees will
have the rest of the week to prepare for their third World Series
in four years under Joe Torre, time to line up their pitching
rotation and for some players to heal, particularly right fielder
Paul O'Neill, who is playing with a broken rib. They will have a
few moments, too, to marvel at what they have accomplished, through
a difficult season.
</P>
<P>
   They can reflect on Hernandez's post-season dominance. He has
started five games in October over the last two years, and the
Yankees have won all of them; Hernandez has been credited with the
victory in four. He has permitted only four runs in 37 innings, for
an earned run average of 0.97.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez finished warming up before the bottom half of the
first inning on Monday night and, as Boston's Jose Offerman was
introduced by the public address announcer, Hernandez stood behind
the mound, pointed at the center fielder Bernie Williams and
waggled his fingers, beckoning him: move in. Hernandez turned and
did the same thing with the left fielder Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers rarely ask their fielders to re-align this way in
Fenway Park, with its diminutive dimensions often exploited by
hitters. But the conditions were unique, the wind blowing hard from
left field to the first base line, flowing over the Charles River
and over the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   And it was very cold, by baseball standards, 48 degrees and
seemingly chillier because of the stiff breeze. David Cone walked
out of the dugout and into the cold early on Monday evening and
brayed, his voice shivering. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, watched the game in a heavy jacket with a Yankees'
logo, a hooded sweatshirt and baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Before his teammates took batting practice, however, Hernandez
strolled into the dugout wearing shorts, white stockings and a
sweatshirt, flouting the cold. Somebody reminded Torre that when
Hernandez pitched brilliantly and beat Cleveland in Game 4 of the
A.L. Championship Series last year, Jacobs Field had been freezing
and El Duque was unaffected. Torre hung onto this thought in the
hours before Monday night's game, hoping Hernandez would again
respond in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees traded David Wells for Roger Clemens before this
season, but it is Hernandez who has replaced Wells as the team's
best post-season pitcher. Hernandez struggled to command his
breaking ball in the first inning, and Offerman and John Valentin
hit back-to-back singles. The Yankees led by 2-0 after Jeter
managed to smash the ball through the teeth of the wind and beyond
the center field wall, an incredible feat of power. But the Red Sox
fans roared, sensing Boston was coming back, right away.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez blew away Jason Varitek with a fastball of 90 mph,
enticed Nomar Garciaparra to foul out _ the runners holding _ and
Troy O'Leary flied to right. No runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox can legitimately grip about umpires' failures in
this series, about opportunities they should have had. But when
Boston had runners in scoring position in its four losses, the Red
Sox rarely capitalized: 6 hits in 38 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked Mike Stanley and then Trot Nixon in the second
inning, but gradually, he began to gain control of his slider and
curveball. The Red Sox had two out and two on, the go-ahead run at
the plate in Offerman. Hernandez spun a slider over the plate and
Offerman waved futilely, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez kept the Red Sox at bay into the sixth inning, Boston
hardly threatening. Garciaparra opened the sixth with a ground ball
to short, which glanced off the heel of Jeter's glove, an error.
Taking advantage of Hernandez's deliberate delivery, Garciaparra
stole second and took third on O'Leary's ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley then lofted a fly ball down the right field line, where
O'Neill moved over, caught the ball in foul territory some 225 feet
from home plate and flung it homeward, assuming Garciaparra had
tagged up and tried to score.
</P>
<P>
   But Garciaparra had gone a few steps down the line and stopped;
O'Neill's throw, probably impacted by the broken rib in his side,
skipped off line and it was clear Garciaparra would have scored. It
was one of Boston's rare real sniffs of survival in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach grounded out to end the inning, and the Yankees
added two runs in the seventh. Jeter reached on an error when
Stanley dropped a throw to first, Boston's ninth error in the
five-game series, and he eventually scored when Offerman booted
Chili Davis's grounder, the 10th Red Sox error.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez's single to center pushed O'Neill across making it
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shut out the Red Sox through seven innings, but Jason
Varitek blasted a home run to open the eighth, and after
Garciaparra pulled a double into the left field corner, Mike
Stanton relieved.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanton walked Troy O'Leary, waving his arms disgustedly
after the final pitch. Jeff Nelson replaced Stanton and fell behind
in the count three balls and no strikes. Suddenly the possibility
of a comeback seemed very real.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley ripped a line drive to center _ right at Bernie
Williams. One out. Allen Watson replaced Nelson and walked the
pinch-hitter Butch Huskey. Bases loaded, potential lead run coming
to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Torre called for Ramiro Mendoza, who had been so integral to the
Game 2 victory, and Mendoza struck out the pinch-hitter Donnie
Sadler and then retired Trot Nixon on a pop out. Steinbrenner
clapped vociferously, while teammates spilled out of the dugout to
congratulate Mendoza.

EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE CONSIDERED INTEGRAL TO SUPERVISORY SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chuck Curtis, chief executive at Valentine Radford, figures
``hard charging'' was one of the nicer labels pinned on him by
co-workers at his Kansas City advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I overused an aggressive management style,'' Curtis admitted.
``Who knows where I got it. The movies? What? I don't know. But I
went through 30 years of trial-and-error management that was mostly
error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 53 now, and I'm so glad I found it before my career was
over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is emotional intelligence training.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional intelligence, sometimes abbreviated to EI or EQ, in a
takeoff from IQ, has become a hot human resource consulting area in
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   EI is rooted in the belief that success only partly depends on
one's intellect. More important is how one behaves and interacts
with others over time.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, studies of successful people repeatedly
showed researchers that qualities such as empathy, self-control and
mood management were better indicators of business success than
were brainpower or mastery of technical skills.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, Curtis faced a hard reality. He was losing
good workers. And he sensed that even those who stayed ``were
cowering like stray dogs on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the executive team at Valentine Radford went looking
for help. They found it through The Hay Group in Kansas City, one
of the consulting firms that advise individuals and organizations
on emotional intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Does the counseling work? Only time and perceptions of others
will tell, but at Valentine-Radford, an anonymous employee survey
measured a 20 percent improvement in morale since the EI training
began.
</P>
<P>
   Hay senior consultant Janelle Jones said she understood that
workers cowering under a raging boss might doubt the boss can
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the way we are because our brains are wired that way,''
Jones said. But, she added, research proves ``you don't always have
to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants such as Jones try to help individuals accurately
assess their counterproductive behaviors and practice new
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To begin with, that change must involve self-awareness,''
Jones said. ``That means you need feedback from others. Your own
self-assessments are not particularly valid. The only perception of
EI that counts is the perception of others.''
</P>
<P>
   For Curtis, EI assessments produced what he is not embarrassed
to call an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 180 degrees wrong in so many things I did,'' Curtis
said. ``I used to think it was the boss's job to tell his people
how to get there. Wrong. They have better ideas than I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously, I might have yelled, `Hey, I showed you how to do
it. Why don't you do it like I did? I was successful.' I learned
that was wrong. It doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants emphasize that EI, or behavioral, training works
only if the recipient admits change is needed and is willing to
work to change. Many equate it to the first step at an Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting, when a person says, ``I am an alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, change doesn't come immediately or easily. Curtis
said he sometimes stopped himself in mid-sentence _ ``I'll say,
`Oops, that's coercive. That's wrong.' _ or I'll kid outright,
`Wait, you know I'm a democratic leader.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was trying to spread throughout his organization
``emotional permission not to go on a witch hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to look for who caused the breakdown, blame them and
then go on,'' Curtis said. ``Now I've learned more how to look for
what caused the breakdown and figure out what we can do to make
things better from here on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Organizations and individuals seek EI training to fix different
problems, most of them connected to human interaction.
</P>
<P>
   The board of United Regional Healthcare System, created by a
merger of two hospitals in Wichita Falls, Texas, wanted its merged
executive group to work together more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The human relations department at Good Samaritan Health Systems
in Kearney, Neb., wanted to find and promote leaders who could move
its doctors and nurses toward a more collaborative approach to
patient care instead of responding to top-down orders.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine Radford sought a new management style that, by
extension, would improve employee retention and morale.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, consultants say, it's typical to encounter
cynics who reject EI analysis as the ``management fad of the
month.'' But for those who embrace it and commit to altering their
nonproductive behaviors, EI training produces change.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says EI training with executives usually begins when the
clients find out they are blind to the image they project. Some
vastly overrate themselves; others underrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're `really like' is not what we think we're really
like. It's how others see us,'' Jones said. ``Improving EI is all
about improving our relationships with others.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for accurate self-assessment is magnified in the
knowledge economy. Being a good worker isn't as much about turning
out the most or best widgets in the least amount of time as it is
about connecting with co-workers and customers and communicating
well.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Roth, an information technology specialist at Hallmark
Cards Inc., was among dozens of Hallmark workers who attended a
daylong EI seminar last month. The seminar was presented by Robert
K. Cooper, an organizational research consultant and author of a
book on leadership and emotional intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, who is working on Y2K projects at Hallmark, said much of
the EI presentation involved the ``old stuff about trust and
orchestrating solutions that involve multiple people.''

BUSH: NO COCAINE ARREST,
 ALLEGATIONS IN BOOK ARE
 `TOTALLY RIDICULOUS'
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 By KRIS MAYES 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  PHOENIX - Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
campaigning in Arizona on Oct. 18, flatly denied a published report
that he was arrested for cocaine possession in Texas in 1972 and
had his record expunged by a friendly Republican judge.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The allegations are made by Texas journalist J.H. Hatfield in a
book due out Oct. 20 from St. Martin's Press titled Fortunate Son:
George W. Bush and the Making of an American President.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally ridiculous what he sug gested and it's not
true,'' Bush said during a press conference at the Phoenician
resort. ``I would hope that reputable journalists . . . would not
respond to science fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations from the book by Hatfield, who formerly wrote a
biography of Patrick Stewart, an actor on the TV show Star Trek,
first surfaced Oct. 18 in an article in the online magazine Salon.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said Hatfield con firmed the cocaine incident with
three anonymous sources ``close to the Bush family.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged that he worked at a Houston public-service
organi zation in 1972, Project P.U.L.L., the magazine said.
Hatfield asserted that his sources told him Bush's stint there was
community service work that resulted from his cocaine con viction.
</P>
<P>
   Salon said that among other sources, Hatfield quotes ``a
high-ranking ad viser to Bush'' who alleged that Bush's record was
removed from the legal books by a judge who was ``a fellow
Republican and elected offi cial.'' The judge helped Bush get off
``with a little community service at a minority youth center
instead of having to pick cotton on a Texas prison farm,'' Salon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the magazine also quotes a spokesman for Bush as saying
there were no Republican judges in Harris County, where Houston is
located, until 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is not named in the book. Dogged by drug questions
Questions about youthful cocaine use have dogged Bush through much
of his campaign. At one point, he denied using cocaine for a period
going back 25 years, but refused to go beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   In his afterword describing the alle gations, Hatfield said he
began inves tigating the matter after reading a Salon article that
quoted the former head of the Martin Luther King Jr. Community
Center in Houston de nying that Bush had worked there.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said he recalled Bush had acknowledged working at
Project P.U.L.L., and wondered whether that might have been the
community service work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would the carousing Bush, whose life seemed nothing more
than one big party, abruptly quit behaving `young and
irresponsible' for a few months'' to go help poor kids in the inner
city? Hatfield wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to fending off questions about cocaine on Oct. 18,
Bush also sidestepped another opportunity to debate his opponents
in the GOP presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters, ``No, I won't be there,'' for a planned
Arizona debate on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made the comments prior to a meeting he had scheduled with
state GOP Chairman Mike Minnaugh, in which Minnaugh was to try to
get Bush to join the debate. Ducking a debate? Supporters of Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., also a GOP presidential candidate, quickly
slammed Bush for ducking the debate.
</P>
<P>
   They suggested that he is more interested in raising money in
Ari zona than facing its voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the people in this state are going to be overly
im pressed by someone who says he's going to spend $2 million here
but won't even give them two minutes to explain where he stands on
the issues,'' said Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, speaker of the Arizona
House and a paid consultant to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and conservative talk show host Alan Keyes have said they
will attend the debate, and publisher Steve Forbes is considering
attend ing. It's unknown whether Elizabeth Dole will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Gov. Jane Hull, who en dorsed Bush last month, defended
his decision not to debate, saying the timing was not right for a
show down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a time to debate and there's a time not to debate,''
Hull said. ``It's too early and you don't have anybody's
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has been criticized recently for refusing to
engage in debates. Last week, he announced he would attend his
first face-to-face meeting with other candidates in New Hampshire
on Dec. 2. Unveils Web upgrades Bush began his day in Tucson,
attending a fund-raiser at a private home. He then flew to Phoenix
where he unveiled a series of up grades to his Web site, including
a new Hispanic Web page and a function that allows voters to create
their own Bush-oriented Web pages. Later, Bush delivered an address
to a national gathering of technology executives.
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with reporters in Phoenix, Bush also
responded to the news that one of his chief supporters in New York
_ former Rep. Guy Molinari _ had defected to the McCain campaign.
Molinari said the Arizona senator more closely repre sents the
principles espoused by former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined to criticize Molinari, saying, ``I've known him
for a long time, he's a good man, and we just disagree. I think I
ought to be the party's nominee and he thinks the senator from
Arizona ought to be the party's nominee. Should I win the
nomination, I hope he'll (Moli nari) help me in the general elec
tion.'' 2nd trip in 3 weeks Oct. 18's campaign swing marked the
second trip by Bush to Arizona in the past three weeks. Last month,
the candidate cruised into Phoenix to pick up Hull's endorsement
and attend a fund-raiser at the Ritz Carlton hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Bush campaign has vowed to spend more than $2
million on ads and organizational efforts to win the state's Feb.
22 primary, an expenditure of resources that aides say was part of
a deal struck with Hull for her endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued to make good on his promise to organize the
state, an nouncing that he had named a state director, Hull's son,
Mike Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hull conceded that beating McCain on his own territory will
``be a tough challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hull also suggested that Bush does not have to beat McCain
to come away symbolically victorious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to win here,'' Hull said. ``If he comes in a
strong Number 2, that's as good as a win.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Hull, while Bush won't be attending the debate, he
will return to the state at least 13 more times more before the
primary _ a significant presence given his front-runner status.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he isn't fazed by Bush's focus on Arizona, and
has staked his own political future on capturing the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's efforts, the latest state poll, conducted by
researchers at Northern Arizona University, showed McCain leading
Bush 39 per cent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was in third place with 6 percent and former Red Cross
President Elizabeth Dole was fourth with 5 percent. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points.

EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE CONSIDERED INTEGRAL TO SUPERVISORY SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   But what was important to hear again, he said, was the
importance of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to say, `You need to build trusting relationships,'
'' Roth said. ``Fine. How do you actually show others you value
them. It's more than saying it. It's acting it. You can't just say,
`I believe this...' in a meeting if your actions speak otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The day away from work, Roth said, helped him focus on the way
he's ``wired'' and on what his personal values are.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, I looked at the difference between competing as
an individual and excelling as a team,'' Roth said. ``I realized we
can get lots of negative energy tied up in competing against
associates. It's better to focus on excelling as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth's one-day EI infusion and Curtis' long-term relationship
with EI counselors are two ways that EI awareness is seeping into
the workplace. Another way is through individual reading. Several
work-oriented EI books have been published in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for popularizing EI concepts generally goes to Daniel
Goleman, chief executive of Emotional Intelligence Services in
Massachusetts and a former Harvard educator.
</P>
<P>
   Goleman reached the best-seller list with Emotional
Intelligence, published in 1995. Last year, he followed up with
another EI book, this one centered on workplace relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation of all EI training, Goleman wrote, is that ``we
are being judged by a new yardstick _ not just how smart we are, or
by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle
ourselves and each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Hay counselor, said competency studies had pioneered
the measurement of such things as the ability to listen and social
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can we measure them, we can train people to practice
new behaviors and then get feedback as to how they're doing,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen again and again in 360-degree assessments that
people will open the data and just be blown away, both bad and
good. Self-assessment alone is just a delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   The 360-degree assessments are appraisal tools that collect
feedback from co-workers, up, down and across a workplace
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   When EI candidates get feedback that contradicts their
self-perceptions, they often need to undo years of behavior. Many
are scared or reluctant, Jones said. They figure the qualities they
have are the ones that got them where they are today.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it would be cost-prohibitive for all but
upper-echelon executives to have one-on-one EI counseling. But that
doesn't preclude lower levels of management and nonsupervisory
workers from having EI training.
</P>
<P>
   Costs vary widely. Some companies pay seminar fees of about $350
a person to send contingents of workers to a daylong seminar. Some
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on long-term executive
counseling. Some provide in-house activities at low or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   Workers can get a free peek at short EI assessments on the
Internet, but consultants caution that those questionnaires are
little more than ``fun parlor games,'' valuable only for exposing
interested people to the kinds of self-assessment questions
involved in EI training.
</P>
<P>
   By using professionally administered 360-degree feedback and
group training, entire departments or organizations can become
support groups, helping one another to alter behaviors that are
hurtful or counterproductive, consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of EI's guideposts were developed from research
into the traits of successful people, EI counselors caution against
using EI assessments as an exclusive measure for hiring or
promoting.
</P>
<P>
   ``EI itself isn't the best hiring tool,'' Jones said. ``It's
more about developing human relationships and human potential.''
</P>
<P>
   At Valentine-Radford, a University of Kansas professor has been
conducting anonymous surveys to measure workers' morale. Since
Curtis and his top management team began EI counseling, the
professor has measured a 20 percent jump in employee morale on the
annual survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to just get a 50 percent return on the survey, even
though it was anonymous,'' Curtis said. ``I wanted the names of the
people who didn't turn it in. I wanted to chase them down and make
them do it.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the agency formed a committee of a cross-section of
workers that was asked to be in charge of survey dissemination and
returns. The committee suggested an incentive: a half-day off work
for the entire agency if 100 percent of the surveys were returned.
</P>
<P>
   The bait worked. And the surveys showed improved perceptions of
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually heard from the senior account man who does most
of our recruiting that the word is getting out that we're doing
something different here,'' Curtis said.

CITY LAUNCHES CHILD-ABDUCTION ALERT MODELED AFTER TEXAS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 9-year-old girl is dumped on a highway,
traumatized, but alive, six hours after a man lured her into his
truck by talking about kittens.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old girl is found by police walking unharmed with her
abductor in a downtown parking lot, less than a day after she
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-week-old baby, abducted less than an hour before by a
babysitter, is spotted by a motorist who uses a cell phone to alert
police to stop the car.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these Texas cases and others nationally, the safe
return of the child is credited to versions of the Amber Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Amber Plan uses the emergency broadcast system to alert a
community when a child has been snatched, instantly adding
thousands to the search party.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases the abductors have released young girls unharmed
when they hear their descriptions and that of the child broadcast
on radio.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is spreading state to state, buoyed this year by
congressional support. There is even talk of making the program
national.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area is next in line.
</P>
<P>
   Police announced the plan here last Monday, one day before
Pamela Butler was kidnapped from her neighborhood in Kansas City,
Kan. Pamela's body was found Friday in Grain Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragically, her case is a perfect example of where the plan
could be most effective,'' said Maj. Vince McInerney of the Kansas
City Police Department. ``We were just about two steps away from
full implementation when she was taken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, McInerney put about 50 copies of the final procedures
for the plan in the mail to area police agencies, newspapers and
radio and television stations.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:The plan in action
</P>
<P>
   If a child is abducted, the Kansas City Police Department will
alert local media, who are then expected to stop broadcasts and
relay the information, just as they would to warn the public of a
tornado. The TIPS Hotline will take the community's calls.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, the Amber Plan can safely return children to their
families.
</P>
<P>
   At its worst, it can become ineffective with overuse and may
unleash community second-guessing of police decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where the plan originated,
television stations have been criticized for sensationalizing the
alerts, using them as teasers of what is coming on the evening
news.
</P>
<P>
   And worried parents have pressured police to put out alerts,
even when they suspected their children had run away and might not
be in immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   Police feared the public would become complacent if they
continuously heard the alert in cases that later turn out to be
false alerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We naively went into this thinking, `Hey, who could turn down
a plea to help children,' '' said Dee Anderson, spokesman for the
Arlington, Tex., Police Department, which formed the first plan.
``We had no idea how big of a commitment it would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Some police departments have been unable to handle the hundreds
of calls the alerts can bring from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington's plan has continuously been revised, and oversight
boards for it have been formed.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington two criteria must now be met to enact the plan. A
child must be 15 years of age or younger, or with a proven mental
or physical disability. And police must believe the child is in
danger of serious bodily harm or death.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City will use the same criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spends much of his time guiding other cities as they
formulate similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become almost a magic potion for missing children,''
Anderson said. ``But it can also become a double-edged sword. And I
tell any department attempting it, `You'd better be ready to make
some hard and fast decisions that are going to affect you for a
long, long time with every case.' ''  &LR; brk:The namesake
</P>
<P>
   Among the Amber Plan's biggest supporters is the family of the
little girl it is named for _ 9-year-old Amber Hagerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish they had it everywhere,'' said Glenda Whitson,
Amber's grandmother. ``And I wish it was in effect when Amber came
up missing. We might still have her now.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber and her then 5-year-old brother, Ricky, kept their
bicycles at their grandmother's house.
</P>
<P>
   One unseasonably warm day in January 1996, Amber and her brother
rode to a nearby abandoned grocery lot. Ricky came back, but Amber
stayed longer, perhaps to jump more on a ramp in the lot the
children liked to ride on, Whitson said.
</P>
<P>
   The family sent Ricky back to tell his ``sissy'' to come home.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't find her.
</P>
<P>
   Amber's grandfather jumped in his truck and sped to the lot. He
met a policeman there, standing over Amber's abandoned bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   A man had seen another man shove a kicking and screaming Amber
into a truck and drive off. The man called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Just nine minutes passed from the time Amber rode away from her
grandmother's home to the time the 911 call was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened that quick, and she was gone,'' Whitson said.
</P>
<P>
   A local television station had been filming Amber's family prior
to her kidnapping for a story on getting off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   While the search continued, the nightly news was filled with
footage of Amber: at a birthday party; going to bed; riding her
bike.
</P>
<P>
   Four days after she was abducted, a rainstorm washed Amber's
body out of a creek a few miles from where she was taken. Her
throat had been cut.
</P>
<P>
   Her killer has never been found, and police have investigated
7,000 leads.
</P>
<P>
   But her death galvanized the Dallas-Fort Worth community.
 &LR; brk:The plan's beginning
</P>
<P>
   Arlington police began thinking they might have saved Amber if
they could have alerted more people immediately. Like the case of
Pamela Butler, they immediately had a description of the truck and
were quick to decide she had been taken by a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Runaway cases and abductions of children in custody arguments
are much more common than stranger kidnappings and are less likely
to result in the child being harmed, police say.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year of Amber's death, Arlington had organized 42
police agencies in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and 32 radio
stations. Television stations joined the effort later, although the
plan was designed for radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard that 98 percent of the people driving around have
their radios turned on,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   When a police department has a case that fits the criteria, a
fax is sent to two radio stations designated as the primary
emergency broadcast stations for the Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   A fax machine at each of the two originating stations is
maintained just for an Amber Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The stations then send the information on to other stations
through emergency alert lines.
</P>
<P>
   Critical to getting the plan working was the support of the
Association of Radio Managers, which represents all of the area's
general managers, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City does not have such a group. But, radio stations have
agreed to interrupt broadcasts, McInerney said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington specifies that stations will interrupt their
broadcasts for the Amber Plan within 15 minutes of receiving it.
Also, they are to make the announcements every 15 minutes for the
first two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is leaving the broadcasts up to the discretion of
each station.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington has a committee of police and broadcasters who review
each activation after the process to ensure procedures were
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, at least two of the seven-member Metro Squad
board of directors have to OK releasing an alert. The board is made
up of area chiefs of police.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the increased national interest in the plan came after
Anderson went to Washington and explained the Amber Plan to
representatives of the Democratic Caucus in May. Rep. Martin Frost,
who represents the Dallas area, is caucus chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus sent out information to all its members. Kansas City
police learned of the plan through Reps. Karen McCarthy and Dennis
Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs really nothing because you are using emergency
procedures that are already in place,'' Anderson said. ``It costs
virtually nothing, and we know it works.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brfhed:How it works
</P>
<P>
   Once police officials have determined a that a missing-child
report meets the criteria for an abduction alert, the Kansas City
Police Department will send the notice to local media by fax.
Alerts will be broadcast on radio and television. Calls are taken
through the TIPS Hotline.

ORGANIZERS HOPE ARMED FORCES MUSEUM COULD BE INTERACTIVE TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Mo. _ A world-class museum could be built in rural
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   That is what organizers of the proposed Ike Skelton Museum of
the American Armed Forces, named for the veteran House of
Representatives member, envision for 78 acres facing the Missouri
River near downtown Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton described the proposed $70 million museum as a salute to
sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to educate young people about freedom. It is not
free,'' Skelton said in ceremonies Monday at Wentworth Military
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The project was presented to Skelton by Lexington and Lafayette
County leaders during 18 months of study. The museum would be a
fitting tribute to Skelton, a longtime friend of the nation's
military, said Bob Langdon, a Lexington lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike had two conditions, that the museum be educational and
that it be first-class,'' Langdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton set a high standard for the project, describing a recent
visit to the Imperial War Museum in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three ways to learn history: read it, see it and
experience it,'' Skelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors could do all three at the proposed Skelton museum.
</P>
<P>
   Among the planned attractions is a ``Life At War'' exhibit
offering a ``full-immersion'' tour of particular war environments.
That would include an attack on a World War II submarine featuring
dimming lights, vibrating floors and walls, and water spraying from
an overhead pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Other attractions would be a variety of interactive exhibits,
such as a training lab where visitors could strap themselves into
the cockpit of a flight simulator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not be a museum of glass cases,'' Langdon said.
``This will be a hands-on museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Drama also would come from the facility's site. A reproduction
of an aircraft carrier flight deck would hang over the edge of the
river bluffs. There also might be a living-history stadium that
could serve as a venue for re-enactments and staged demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the river itself would enable the museum to outfit a
small shipyard of various combat crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to generate $35 million in private-sector
donations and $35 million in state appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite a bit of money,'' Ed Quick of Liberty, state
Senate president pro tem, said after the ceremonies. ``You'd have
to make an analysis of the returns. It's also possible they could
raise more money from the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet $35 million could be doable, said state Sen. Joe Maxwell of
Mexico, a vice chairman of the state Senate Appropriations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes realistic when they talk of the money being phased
in over a period of years,'' Maxwell said. Tourism is now
Missouri's leading industry, Maxwell said, and the museum could
serve as a destination location, drawing visitors into the state.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon estimates the museum's annual economic effect at $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of $35 million in private donations, meanwhile,
has begun. About $12 million has been pledged by corporate sources,
some of them defense contractors, Langdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton is the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee. He said Monday that he personally would not solicit
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their baby,'' Skelton said, referring to museum
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers also see a synergy in the Lexington location. The
land is adjacent to the Battle of Lexington State Historic Site,
which details an 1861 Civil War encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Museum planners also hope to capitalize on a bridge scheduled to
be built over the Missouri River near the proposed site. That work
should be complete in about 2004, roughly the same time organizers
hope the museum will open.

MISSOURI ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUING PUBLISHERS CLEARING HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL WENSKE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon has sent his own direct-mail
message to Publishers Clearing House: The sweepstakes giant isn't a
big winner in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon has filed a lawsuit in Boone County Circuit Court alleging
that the company defrauded consumers of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon says hundreds of Missouri consumers were enticed by
deceptive mass mailings to send thousands of dollars to the
company. He said the company particularly focused on ``consumers
who are most vulnerable,'' including the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that sweepstakes promotions misled consumers
into thinking they were more likely to win than they actually were.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking unspecified damages on behalf of state consumers, the
lawsuit also alleges that consumers were deceived into thinking
that making a purchase would increase their chances.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Irving, director of consumer affairs for the New
York company, disputed Nixon's charges and expressed ``surprise and
disappointment'' that the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   He said Nixon was one of 35 attorneys general who had met as
part of a task force with the clearinghouse to resolve concerns. He
said it appeared that Nixon was dropping out of the task force
talks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Nixon said the state lawsuit was filed because
Nixon thought the $5.5 million settlement of a separate federal
class-action lawsuit in Illinois was inadequate to protect Missouri
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Steve Katz, one of the Belleville, Ill., lawyers who
filed the federal class-action case, said Nixon was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enough money for everyone,'' Katz said. ``And if
there isn't enough, the judge will disapprove of the settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential plaintiffs in the federal case have until Nov. 5 to
decide whether to file a claim or opt out of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri is one of nine states to file an independent legal
action against Publishers Clearing House in what appears to be a
growing legal assault on the lucrative national sweepstakes
industry. Texas added its name to the list Monday, joining Arizona,
Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Washington and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In July, American Family Publishers, another sweepstakes
company, agreed to pay $215,000 to Missouri consumers and $50,000
to the state to resolve allegations of deceptive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Florida attorney general's office also sued
Publishers Clearing House, accusing the company of using deceptive
tactics to sell magazines and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Tritsch, a spokeswoman for the Kansas attorney general,
said Kansas planned to work toward sweepstakes reforms through the
multistate task force of attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   She said the National Association of Attorneys General would
address the issue at its consumer protection conference this week
in Savannah, Ga. Proposed legislation in Congress also would force
the sweepstakes industry to be more forthcoming with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes officials deny that they focus on vulnerable
consumers. ``We have millions of happy, satisfied, long-term
customers,'' Irving said. Still, he said, ``there are consumers
that have had difficulties and have been confused'' by past
mailings.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he said, Publishers Clearing House has
voluntarily adopted new guidelines, which include bolder and more
prevalent disclosures to inform consumers of their chances to win.
</P>
<P>
   Irving said the changes were ``exactly what the response should
be to the concerns that have been voiced. ... We're in the business
to make consumers happy, not cause them confusion or unhappiness.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LINCOLN, Neb. _ Many believe it takes a special quarterback and a
superb I-back for Nebraska's run-oriented offense to thrive. But
the maze of hallways leading from the Cornhuskers' dressing room to
the playing field at Memorial Stadium tells a different story.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The portraits adorning the walls in one such hallway reveal that
21 Nebraska offensive linemen have been chosen as All-Americans
since 1969, compared to just five quarterbacks and three I-backs.
</P>
<P>
   Why 1969? That was the year the Cornhuskers began a
national-record streak of 31 consecutive bowl appearances,
trouncing Georgia in the Sun Bowl to complete a 9-2 season.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Nebraska has been the winningest program in college
football, posting 98 wins in the 1970s, 103 in the '80s and 104
thus far in the '90s. Nebraska is the only team in college football
history to win 100 or more games in consecutive decades.
</P>
<P>
   The men up front will be especially important this week when the
6-0 Cornhuskers visit Texas, which boasts one of the best defensive
lines in the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``The O-linemen look at it as no matter who's taking the snaps
at quarterback, no matter who's getting the ball in the backfield,
no matter what tight end, what receiver's getting the ball for us
it doesn't matter,'' guard Russ Hochstein said. ``We have an
assignment every play, and our goal is to execute that perfectly.
We want to have the ability to put anybody in the backfield and
move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in '95, that may have been one of the best college teams
you ever had. They went through (quarterbacks) Brook Berringer,
Matt Turman, and Tommie Frazier, and it didn't matter. There was a
hole there the size of a house.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time in a long time, Nebraska's front
five had trouble opening those house-sized holes. Two main factors
were at work _ injuries and inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   More chronicled injuries at quarterback and tailback surely
hurt, but much of the Cornhuskers' offensive line spent more time
in the trainer's room than the weight room. There has been a
complete turnaround on the injury front this year.
</P>
<P>
   There has been only one line casualty in 1999; returning starter
Jason Schwab tore a knee ligament during two-a-days. But the unit
that takes to the field this week has been injury-free since the
season began.
</P>
<P>
   After taking flak for a 1998 campaign in which Nebraska managed
only 252 yards per game rushing (still good enough for sixth in the
country), the line banded together for 7 a.m. breakfast workouts
throughout the spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Not one player missed a workout, and with the exception of the
Southern Mississippi game, the Cornhuskers have been having
breakfast _ as in pancake blocks _ at their opponents' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Center Dominic Raiola, who last year became only the second
freshman Husker to start a game on the offensive line, leads the
team with 69 knock-down blocks in six games. Hochstein, a junior,
has 60 pancakes on his stat line.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore David Volk has played well in Schwab's place at right
tackle, and seniors James Sherman and Adam Julch have been solid at
right guard and left tackle, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But though Nebraska is again sixth in the country in rushing
(265.3 yards a game) Raiola says the line has yet to reach its
peak. Of course, they feel they have a lot to live up to. Nebraska
has won the national rushing title five of the last eight years and
11 of the past 18. The Cornhuskers have finished no lower than
sixth in rushing yardage since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tradition is great here, but it's kind of fun having to
live up to it,'' Raiola said. ``It's a challenge. You come in here,
and you look at it like, `I'm going to be a great offensive
lineman.' It's fun to hear that and to try and live up to it every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The line is itching to get a chance to prove itself against a
Texas defensive front that played a major part in the Longhorns'
20-16 upset last year that ended the Cornhuskers' 47-game home
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dark day in Lincoln last year,'' Raiola said. ``It
just brings back bad memories. Walking off the field, hearing The
Eyes of Texas we want to make sure that doesn't happen again this
year.''

TORRE SAYS KNOBLAUCH WILL SIT IN LATE INNINGS TO HELP DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joe Torre invited Chuck Knoblauch into the tiny
manager's office at Fenway Park on Monday, closed the door and
spoke in that soothing fashion that is supposed to make arduous
changes easier for players to digest. Torre has often been lauded
for calmly handling 25 personalities while making players feel as
if he is their favorite uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the time had obviously come for Uncle Joe to stare into
Knoblauch's eyes and explain why he will remove him from second
base for defensive purposes if the Yankees are ahead in the late
innings. Torre reminded Knoblauch that he has helped the Yankees
journey too far to let an unexplainable throwing problem sabotage
their season and told him he could be replaced by Luis Sojo. And he
was, as Torre inserted Sojo in the top of the eighth inning of Game
5 of the American League Championship Series against Boston on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shrewd decision by Torre, one that he probably should
have made before the post-season started. After Knoblauch's
alarming performance in Game 4, Torre finally decided that he could
not let Knoblauch throw away a ball and possibly throw away a game.
``The important thing is that psyche-wise, he's for it,'' Torre
said. ``He understands all the good things he does for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch pounded his fist in his glove beside the batting cage,
ignored the fans who were taunting him about his throwing and
indicated that he would not grouse about what has become
inevitable. By the seventh inning, Knoblauch could be chilling with
the bat boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't care,'' Knoblauch said. ``I don't have a big ego.
I'm not one of those egomaniacs. That wouldn't bother me. If they
think that's the way we would win a World Series, fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Torre was asked about replacing Knoblauch in this manner
before the division series started, he said that he could not
because he had to deal with Knoblauch's ``psyche.'' That sounded
reasonable, but it is now unreasonable after the way Knoblauch has
struggled. Torre has to worry about a team's psyche, too. It is 24
against 1, and Knoblauch must be sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get removed after seven innings, it must mean I'm doing
something right to still be in there,'' Knoblauch said. ``Don't you
think? If they want to put Sojo in there, that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre alluded to the possibility that Knoblauch might be injured
because he throws from the same arm angle and sometimes it is a
bullet and sometimes it is a balloon. But the manager admitted that
was simply his own speculation and that Knoblauch has not reported
any injuries. All Knoblauch said during Torre's meeting was:
``You're the manager. Do what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   If Torre ever needed to be more emphatic, he could have invoked
the name of Bill Buckner. This is the perfect time to bring up
Buckner's awful story, a story of a borderline Hall of Famer who is
universally remembered for letting Mookie Wilson's roller trickle
between his legs in the sixth game of the 1986 World Series. The
rest is history, dismal history throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   While comparing Knoblauch to Buckner might be jarring, it is a
sensible comparison. Knoblauch is a .298 hitter who has won World
Series rings with the Twins and the Yankees but has also come
perilously close to costing the Yankees. In the Yankees' last 15
post-season games, Knoblauch's best friends have been Orlando
Hernandez, Rick Reed and Tim Tschida, because each of them have
indirectly saved the second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   After Knoblauch argued with an umpire instead of retrieving a
loose ball in Game 2 of the league championship series last season,
the go-ahead run scored and the Indians stifled the Yankees, 4-1.
Knoblauch was in danger of being recalled as the villain who
derailed one of the finest teams in history. But Hernandez stopped
the Indians in Game 4 and the Yankees never lost again.
</P>
<P>
   Reed called a runner out at second when Knoblauch dropped a ball
in Game 1 of this series, and the umpire later admitted he was
incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Tschida ruled that Knoblauch had tagged Jose Offerman after
fielding a grounder Sunday, but Tschida conceded that he had
botched the call.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has bruised egos before. He sat down Tino Martinez, a
contributor across 155 games, for three games in favor of Cecil
Fielder in the 1996 World Series. He made Wade Boggs share time
with Charlie Hayes that year. He scheduled David Cone for a Game 4
that never happened in this year's division series; he backed up
Andy Pettitte from the second spot to the fourth spot for this
series. Those decisions worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees need four more triumphs for a championship, and they
need a second baseman who can accurately toss the ball to first to
help them get there. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ At 6-1 and 305 pounds, Casey Hampton may not be willowy,
but the University of Texas junior defensive tackle is confident he
can exhibit a level of gracefulness that would be the antithesis of
his body type.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hampton was hoping to get that chance against Oklahoma two
Saturdays ago. Thanks to Texas' choosing to zone blitz the Sooners'
spread formation on occasion, Hampton dropped into pass coverage at
times.
</P>
<P>
   No passes came his way, but Hampton was sure of what would have
happened had the Sooners been ``brave'' enough to throw at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have taken it to the house, no doubt,'' said Hampton,
who jokes that he is likely to get ejected for raucous celebrating
should he ever manage an interception. ``I don't think people
realize how fast I am. It just doesn't look like it because I'm so
big, but I can roll when it's time to roll.''
</P>
<P>
   This Saturday, however, the Longhorns will face a more
traditional offense against Nebraska. Hampton will spend most of
the game tussling at the line of scrimmage to control the first leg
of the Huskers' triple-option running game.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who is Texas' leading tackler this season with 46 (24
solo), may indeed have the perfect build for the proverbial ``war
in the trenches,'' but don't doubt his ability to cut loose should
he be fortunate enough to get his paws on the football.
</P>
<P>
   He was a tailback before high school and was a
fullback/linebacker when he made the varsity as a freshman at
Galveston Ball. Not only was he a running back, but a speed back
who had run the anchor leg on the 400-meter relay as an
eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   He was moved to the defensive line so he could get more playing
time on an experienced defense as a 10th-grader. That preceded a
50-pound ``growth spurt'' the summer before his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little too big for all those moves and stuff,''
Hampton said. ``That was a l-o-o-n-g time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Many college coaches were not sure Hampton would qualify
academically and backed off of recruiting him. Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C.
Slocum looked at Hampton's grades and told him that while he liked
him as a player, he didn't think he would get his GPA up enough to
qualify for Division I football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't failing, but I was only a C student, and my
grade-point average needed to be higher,'' Hampton said. ``I just
wanted to go to a Division I school to get my shot, so I had to get
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton heeded Slocum's warning and went to work in the
classroom. By the time he graduated from Ball, he had raised his
GPA half a grade point.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at Texas in 1996, Hampton had a solid freshman
year while playing nose guard. He started seven of the Longhorns'
13 games and finished the year with 77 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   A season-ending knee injury against Rice forced a medical
redshirt year in 1997, but he returned to start all 12 games last
season and was a second team All-Big 12 selection with 60 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew he was not playing as well as he could. Hampton
estimates the knee was at about 80 percent of its norm, but he said
fear hurt his play more than pain. He even saw himself on game film
hopping on one leg to avoid putting the injured knee on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely keeping me from doing the things I knew I
could do, and the brace I wore was holding me back as well,''
Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   When team doctors allowed him to go brace-free last spring,
Hampton knew the knee was ready.
</P>
<P>
   Now, phrases like ``best run stopper in the country'' are being
uttered by coaches, players and media members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that it all starts right there for a
defense,'' Texas defensive coordinator Carl Reese said, ``and I
tell you what, I don't know of anybody in the country I would
rather have plugging up the middle on my defense than Casey
Hampton.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Orlando Hernandez chuckled when asked if he had ever
pitched before fans as angry as those in Fenway Park. If you pitch
badly in Cuba, he said of his homeland, then your own fans will
kill you.
</P>
<P>
   Unaffected by the seething Red Sox fans, the cold or the
magnitude of Monday night's game, Hernandez shut out Boston over
the first seven innings on Monday night as the Yankees clinched
their 36th American League pennant early Tuesday morning with a 6-1
victory over Boston in Game 5 of the League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter's first-inning, two-run home run off Kent Mercker
put the Yankees ahead and Boston, which chased the Yankees all
season before finishing second in the Eastern Division, never
caught up. Jorge Posada helped make sure Boston did not with a
two-run homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans will forever lament the role of the umpires in this
series, mistaken decisions that went against Boston in
consequential moments in Games 1 and 4. Still, it will be the
Yankees who will play Game 1 of the World Series either in Atlanta
or at Shea Stadium on Saturday night, in pursuit of their 25th
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lead the Mets three games to two and will play Game 6
in Atlanta on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   By winning the best-four-of-seven-game series against the Red
Sox in five games, the Yankees averted a possible Game 7 meeting
with Boston's Pedro Martinez, who dominated them _ and the rest of
the American League _ so thoroughly this season. The Yankees will
have the rest of the week to prepare for their third World Series
in four years under Joe Torre, time to line up their pitching
rotation and for some players to heal, particularly right fielder
Paul O'Neill, who is playing with a broken rib. They will have a
few moments, too, to marvel at what they have accomplished, through
a difficult season.
</P>
<P>
   They can reflect on Hernandez's post-season dominance. He has
started five games in October over the last two years, and the
Yankees have won all of them; Hernandez has been credited with the
victory in four. He has permitted only four runs in 37 innings, for
an earned run average of 0.97.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez finished warming up before the bottom half of the
first inning on Monday night and, as Boston's Jose Offerman was
introduced by the public address announcer, Hernandez stood behind
the mound, pointed at the center fielder Bernie Williams and
waggled his fingers, beckoning him: move in. Hernandez turned and
did the same thing with the left fielder Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers rarely ask their fielders to re-align this way in
Fenway Park, with its diminutive dimensions often exploited by
hitters. But the conditions were unique, the wind blowing hard from
left field to the first base line, flowing over the Charles River
and over the Green Monster.
</P>
<P>
   And it was very cold, by baseball standards, 48 degrees and
seemingly chillier because of the stiff breeze. David Cone walked
out of the dugout and into the cold early on Monday evening and
brayed, his voice shivering. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner, watched the game in a heavy jacket with a Yankees'
logo, a hooded sweatshirt and baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   Before his teammates took batting practice, however, Hernandez
strolled into the dugout wearing shorts, white stockings and a
sweatshirt, flouting the cold. Somebody reminded Torre that when
Hernandez pitched brilliantly and beat Cleveland in Game 4 of the
A.L. Championship Series last year, Jacobs Field had been freezing
and El Duque was unaffected. Torre hung onto this thought in the
hours before Monday night's game, hoping Hernandez would again
respond in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees traded David Wells for Roger Clemens before this
season, but it is Hernandez who has replaced Wells as the team's
best post-season pitcher. Hernandez struggled to command his
breaking ball in the first inning, and Offerman and John Valentin
hit back-to-back singles. The Yankees led by 2-0 after Jeter
managed to smash the ball through the teeth of the wind and beyond
the center field wall, an incredible feat of power. But the Red Sox
fans roared, sensing Boston was coming back, right away.
</P>
<P>
   But Hernandez blew away Jason Varitek with a fastball of 90 mph,
enticed Nomar Garciaparra to foul out _ the runners holding _ and
Troy O'Leary flied to right. No runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox can legitimately grip about umpires' failures in
this series, about opportunities they should have had. But when
Boston had runners in scoring position in its four losses, the Red
Sox rarely capitalized: 6 hits in 38 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked Mike Stanley and then Trot Nixon in the second
inning, but gradually, he began to gain control of his slider and
curveball. The Red Sox had two out and two on, the go-ahead run at
the plate in Offerman. Hernandez spun a slider over the plate and
Offerman waved futilely, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez kept the Red Sox at bay into the sixth inning, Boston
hardly threatening. Garciaparra opened the sixth with a ground ball
to short, which glanced off the heel of Jeter's glove, an error.
Taking advantage of Hernandez's deliberate delivery, Garciaparra
stole second and took third on O'Leary's ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley then lofted a fly ball down the right field line, where
O'Neill moved over, caught the ball in foul territory some 225 feet
from home plate and flung it homeward, assuming Garciaparra had
tagged up and tried to score.
</P>
<P>
   But Garciaparra had gone a few steps down the line and stopped;
O'Neill's throw, probably impacted by the broken rib in his side,
skipped off line and it was clear Garciaparra would have scored. It
was one of Boston's rare real sniffs of survival in this game.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach grounded out to end the inning, and the Yankees
added two runs in the seventh. Jeter reached on an error when
Stanley dropped a throw to first, Boston's ninth error in the
five-game series, and he eventually scored when Offerman booted
Chili Davis's grounder, the 10th Red Sox error.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez's single to center pushed O'Neill across making it
4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez shut out the Red Sox through seven innings, but Jason
Varitek blasted a home run to open the eighth, and after
Garciaparra pulled a double into the left field corner, Mike
Stanton relieved.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanton walked Troy O'Leary, waving his arms disgustedly
after the final pitch. Jeff Nelson replaced Stanton and fell behind
in the count three balls and no strikes. Suddenly the possibility
of a comeback seemed very real.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley ripped a line drive to center _ right at Bernie
Williams. One out. Allen Watson replaced Nelson and walked the
pinch-hitter Butch Huskey. Bases loaded, potential lead run coming
to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Torre called for Ramiro Mendoza, who had been so integral to the
Game 2 victory, and Mendoza struck out the pinch-hitter Donnie
Sadler and then retired Trot Nixon on a pop out. Steinbrenner
clapped vociferously, while teammates spilled out of the dugout to
congratulate Mendoza.

CLIPPERS ADJUST TO STRICTER RULES

 Long Beach Press-Telegram

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the kinder, gentler NBA ever musters influence
over television scripts, the stars of ``Touched By An Angel'' will
foul out before the first commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the league's mandate for scoreboard stimulation, the
traditional hand-check (not to mention the traditional low-post
full-Nelson) is an official no-no.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take some getting used to,'' said Clippers
forward Maurice Taylor, who learned a lesson while fouling out of
Saturday's exhibition victory at Chicago. Other Clippers students
included rookie Lamar Odom and Tyrone Nesby, who split a dozen
fouls.
</P>
<P>
   While coach Chris Ford continues his lectures on full
compliance, Taylor isn't exactly endorsing stricter rule
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think players shouldn't have to get help from officials to
score,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   But will the quick whistles really disrupt the flow of an NBA
game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, it's going to be horrible,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Sun screen: With Taylor on ice after three quarters, the Clips
were beaten by Golden State in overtime. With Taylor nursing knee
discomfort, they won by 10 in Toronto, then smoked the Bulls by 21.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition Test Drive No. 4 is tonight at Phoenix (7 p.m., KCTD,
AM-1540), where the Suns represent the first playoff team the
Clippers will meet before the real games begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see what we can do if Lamar, Michael
(Olowokandi), Derek (Anderson) and I played a whole game
together,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, still attempting to dig their new up-tempo beat,
will see a genuine running team at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is one of the proven elite teams in the Western
Conference,'' Ford said of the Suns, who have added Penny Hardaway
to a lineup that includes point guard Jason Kidd, Tom Gugliotta and
Cliff Robinson. ``We're going to have to get back as fast as we can
on defense. I'm sure (the Suns) are going to be pushing the ball
down our throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks: Point guard Eric Murdock and his recovering left
ankle participated in Monday's workout at Carson that included a
vigorous round of scrimmaging. Murdock is not expected to play
tonight. . . . Wednesday's Clippers workout will be held at the
Sports Arena and is open to the public. Admission, which is free,
begins at 6:30 p.m., and practice is scheduled to begin at 7.

SPORTS COLUMN: BASIC CIVILITY IS THE LOSER EVERY TIME 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The weather turned chilly here on Monday, nasty, like
the mood of the louts who used the Yankees and the umpires as
targets for bottle-throwing practice Sunday night. It was nature's
way of saying that winter is soon to drop its blanket on New
England while the Red Sox drift off to a hibernating sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had fled south by early Tuesday morning, bags and
bats, after bringing a methodical end to the American League
Championship Series behind Orlando Hernandez, winning Game 5 by
6-1. They left this town to its endless persecution, to the
conviction that its team is cursed, as opposed to being highly
competitive but not good enough. They left on the way to their 36th
World Series, with an eye on _ believe it _ a possible Subway
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves,'' Joe Torre said, ``may be a little on their heels
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the Mets credit for hanging in _ anything can happen
now,'' Darryl Strawberry said, admitting that he'd tuned in between
at-bats as the designated hitter to the amazing proceedings at Shea
Stadium Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The number I heard on Monday was that, at some point on a most
memorable New York baseball night, 52 percent of the active
television sets in the New York metropolitan area were tuned to a
baseball game. What can you say, other than the fact that New
Yorkers are as obsessed with the idea of a Subway Series as the
people up here are with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   It's a volatile mix, these rabid passions let loose in the
night, as the clock winds inevitably toward 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball needs to do something to get these games over
earlier,'' George Steinbrenner declared, hardly a revelation as the
Yankees' celebration commenced almost 30 minutes past midnight
following a 4-hour-9-minute clincher.
</P>
<P>
   To Steinbrenner's credit, he didn't turn the deplorable acts of
a couple of hundred fans fueled by frustration, tanked on beer,
into a condemnation of a city. He agreed that New York, as far as
this particular subject is concerned, is peering out the window of
a Trump-size glass house. But in the nearly three decades that he
has owned the Yankees, Steinbrenner has contributed to a sports
mentality that no longer tolerates losing without casting blame. To
a bottom-line culture that almost revels in disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   Find a scapegoat. Abuse your opponent. Steinbrenner recalled
Mickey Rivers having to wear his batting helmet here for protection
in center field in 1977. As far back as 25 years ago, the Yankee
coach Chris Chambliss found a steel dart in his arm as he stood on
third base here at Fenway Park. The occasional outburst of
alcohol-induced fan violence is nothing new. What is undoubtedly a
trend endemic to the 1990s, though, is the casual attitudes
regarding the decline of simple civility in and around sports.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, I climbed the steps of the transit station, and
stepped into Kenmore Square, just as four fans in Yankee caps were
walking by, attracting a torrent of profanity every few feet.
Scarier than that scene was the public acquiescence to it. On a
beautiful, sunlit afternoon in an intersection filled with parents
and kids, nobody appealed to anyone for restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it depends on what city and what the frustration is,''
Torre said, when asked how much the climate of sports has
deteriorated. ``New York, you hear things you don't hear in St.
Louis. Chicago, you hear things you don't hear in Minnesota. What's
allowed that to happen _ look at TV, go to the movies, listen to
the radio. Everything's down now; there's no barriers anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   We complain about kids, but what do their role models do? Red
Sox Manager Jimy Williams made the umpiring the focal point of his
team's defeat Sunday, when his infielders made four gruesome
errors. On Tuesday night, they handed the Yankees two crucial
insurance runs with two more misplays. They were an unsightly 0 for
10 with runners in scoring position. They don't have to love the
Yankees here. But what's to hate?
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from the ball park on Monday afternoon, a
15-year-old in a Yankee cap named Carlos Santiago pointed toward
Fenway High School and said: ``We get a lot of hatred in that
school just for wearing this. You get pushed in the hallway, cursed
at. Especially now.'' Another kid in a Yankee cap, Radhy Pena, 17,
said he understood why the small segment of Red Sox fans unleashed
their rage Sunday night. ``People get frustrated. Their team got
robbed, and that's hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Their team. Their town. Are we ready, if the Mets can pull off a
miracle, for two teams, one town? &QL;

SAMPSON HAS BIG PLANS FOR U.S. SOCCER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Steve Sampson wears some of his proudest
moments as U.S. national soccer coach on the backs of his cars.
</P>
<P>
   The license plates tell the stories. One car reads ``US-1,
BRA-0,'' reminding him of the night his team beat Brazil in the
1997 Gold Cup at the Coliseum.Coming soon, as a gift from his wife,
is the plate that will read ``US-3, ARG-0'' after the 1995 victory
over Argentina in Copa America '95 in Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are two of the finest moments in U.S. soccer history,''
Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   He prefers to remember these, along with the 0-0 draw in Mexico
during the last World Cup qualifying matches. He's also the only
U.S. coach to finish with a winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   This was his dream job, the one he worked much of his
professional life to obtain. Yet he knows others choose
less-flattering memories: The last-place finish in the 1998 World
Cup that included a loss to Iran, players complaining about him,
the media criticizing his 3-6-1 lineup.
</P>
<P>
   So the first American to lead the U.S. into the World Cup
resigned, and some would suggest he did so one step ahead of being
fired. If he's bitter, he puts it behind him. Now he has returned
home to begin the task of building the national program from the
grassroots up.
</P>
<P>
   While some believe this is Sampson's way to restore his damaged
reputation, Sampson flatly disagrees. He reminds he wasn't fired as
national coach, that in fact, the federation paid him through the
end of his contract, which expired Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's handling of himself during the World Cup was one of
supreme class,'' said Bobby Howe, the U.S. Soccer Federation's
director of coaching. ``Steve had to make tough decisions, and
(players) demonstrated a lack of class. Steve handled himself in an
excellent, classy fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sampson: ``When I made changes, some viewed it as Sampson
bringing more exposure to himself and taking credit. That was the
furthest from the truth. People who know me know I don't work to be
in the limelight. If the players get the credit, I'd be so happy,
and the same is true for this program.''
</P>
<P>
   This program, as Sampson alludes, is his desire to overhaul the
Olympic Development Program, which currently identifies the
country's top youth players. Instead, Sampson would like to see a
scouting program implemented, similar to those of the NFL, NBA and
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we be any different?'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   And he would like that program to reach not only affluent areas
but also inner cities and heavily Latino neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   He travels about half of each month, taking his enthusiastic and
optimistic message that, with his plan, the U.S. can win the World
Cup in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The work is difficult because the various soccer factions _ the
high schools and clubs _ often have disagreed in how best to serve
the soccer youth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sampson believes bringing people together is one of his
greatest strengths, and one of his former players agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Wegerle, who played on the national team from 1992-98, said
Sampson was the main reason he joined the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Wegerle, a South African, married an American woman, making him
eligible to play for the United States. Sampson flew to London at
then-coach Bora Milutinovic's request and convinced Wegerle to go
American.
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, Sampson among them, Wegerle chose to play for
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was genuine and honest, and it was convincing,'' Wegerle
said from his Sarasota, Fla., home. ``He did his job well.''
</P>
<P>
   Former team captain Thomas Dooley also felt Sampson did his job
well, even when it got him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Wegerle and Dooley, a national-team member from 1992-98 now
living in Columbus, Ohio, knew Sampson didn't have a great deal of
international coaching experience when he took over in April, 1995.
True, he was an assistant coach on UCLA's 1985 NCAA championship
team and won 1989 NCAA Coach of the Year honors after leading Santa
Clara to the national title, but internationally, he was more scout
than coach, often traveling to some Latin American country to get
the lowdown on the Americans' next opponent.
</P>
<P>
   His reports helped the U.S. upset Columbia in the 1994 World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no matches when his scouting reports let us down,''
Wegerle said. ``They always were pretty sound. It was all pretty
comprehensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dooley said Sampson, ever the consensus-builder, sought player
input for various things. When he began coaching at the
international level, it worked for him. The input helped to shock
Argentina in Copa America.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached France, it worked against him.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley and Wegerle said there were two players, believed to be
Alexi Lalas and Eric Wynalda, that Sampson didn't want to take to
France, but Dooley convinced Sampson he should.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, he tried to please too many people,'' Wegerle
said, ``and that was his downfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Lalas and Wynalda openly criticized Sampson for his strategies,
which included not playing them enough. Sampson didn't respond
through the media, but those close to him knew it affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled it pretty good,'' Dooley said. ``The thing with
France, players had less respect. That was, I think, the biggest
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson would like to coach a national team again, but for now
the need to rebuild the program remains appealing. So far, in his
desire to build a consensus with the youth soccer factions, Sampson
has won over the state high school federation commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to be moving in the right direction in terms of
solving conflicts,'' said Jack Hayes, the California
Interscholastic Federation commissioner. ``I saw some hope in
solving differences in various soccer institutions. I liked the
approach I heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Horspool, the president of the California Youth Soccer
Association South, also believes Sampson can make good on his
promises. He recalls having lunch at a Mexican restaurant with
Sampson one day, and a Hispanic waiter walked up andasked if this
man was Steve Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``One: He brings a credibility to the program,'' Horspool said.
``Two: he has great contacts in the soccer-coaching community. He
can bring in the top scouts and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows Steve Sampson.''

GIANTS' BARBER DOES DEION IMITATION, DOES IN COWBOYS

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For the second consecutive week, the
Cowboys squandered early scoring opportunities, then let an
inferior opposing offense hang around just long enough to sucker
punch the Dallas defense in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys fell to 4-2 after losing to the New York Giants,
13-10, on ``Monday Night Football'' at The Meadowlands, as Giants
running back Tiki Barber accounted for 233 all-purpose yards,
including a 56-yard pass reception in the final minute that set up
a 21-yard field goal by Brad Daluiso with 1 second remaining in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting him involved was a big part of our \Rgame\S plan,''
Giants coach Jim Fassel said of Barber. ``He gave us a change of
pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barber changed the game.
</P>
<P>
   After returning a punt 85 yards for a touchdown earlier in the
fourth quarter, Barber turned a simple crossing route into a
56-yard pass play down to inside the Dallas 10. It was a dump-off
play that turned into a dagger through the Cowboys' collective
hearts, coming against man-for-man coverage and setting up
Daluiso's chip-shot field goal for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' loss takes some of the edge off their upcoming game
against Washington on Sunday. The Redskins, 4-1, take a one-game
lead over the Cowboys in the NFC East. The Giants evened their
record at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on the Giants' game-winning drive, Cowboys defensive
tackle Brandon Noble appeared to have intercepted a Kent Graham
pass, but the play was nullified because of an offside penalty on
defensive end Greg Ellis. So for the second consecutive week, the
Cowboys' defense was put in a position to lose the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys' offense, Emmitt Smith was held to either zero
or minus yardage on eight of his first 17 carries despite the fact
that Dallas had its entire starting offensive line in place for the
first time since the Sept. 12 season-opener at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who entered the game as the NFC's leading rusher with an
average of 102.3 yards per game, was held to 26 yards on 22 carries
against the NFL's 10th-best defense against the run. Smith scored
on a 2-yard run with 1:57 remaining to force a 10-10 tie ... but it
was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were kept out of the end zone for the first 58
minutes of the game, losing 13-10 for the second consecutive week
to teams with a combined 2-7 record before playing the Cowboys.
Philadelphia went up against Dallas with the NFL's 30th-ranked
offense; the Giants, the NFL's 26th-ranked offense.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, a third-down back with back-breaking quickness, ripped
off an 85-yard punt return for a touchdown with 7:50 remaining in
the game. Punter Toby Gowin and special-teams standout Singor
Mobley each had a shot at Barber. Both missed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first punt return for a touchdown against the
Cowboys' special teams since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys threw away their first scoring opportunity when they
took possession at the New York 29 following a 16-yard punt off the
side of Giants punter Brad Maynard's foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense immediately went ``backward'' two yards,
before Richie Cunningham was called in and missed badly on a
field-goal attempt from 48 yards out. Cunningham, off to his worst
start in three seasons, misfired for the fourth time in six tries
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham finally connected from 38 yards following a 26-yard
Maynard punt. Dallas took a 3-0 lead with five minutes remaining in
the first quarter, but this would be the Cowboys' least-productive
first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This game wasn't pretty, even when somebody scored. On the
solitary scoring drive of the first half for the Cowboys, they
needed a 15-yard personal foul (late hit by Giants strong safety
Sam Garnes) at the end of a 6-yard pass play from Troy Aikman to
tight end David LaFleur to get themselves jump-started.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the Cowboys converted on third-and-eight or
longer three times on completions by Troy Aikman to Rocket Ismail,
Chris Warren and McGarity. That feature of the Cowboys' offense was
not there in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Cowboys let a bad Philadelphia offense hang around
last week, they let a bad Giants offense hang around and gain
confidence in itself last night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys reached the Giants 14, and looked as if they might
be ready to move in for a touchdown, when Garnes pinned Aikman with
his eighth interception of the season seven plays into the second
quarter. The Giants began from their own 10.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 26th-ranked offense in the NFL. But the Giants
drove 80 yards in 18 plays, consuming 9 minutes, 47 seconds, and
tying the game at 3-3 on a 27-yard Daluiso field goal with 2:58
remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kent Graham, who came in with as many interceptions
as touchdown passes (four) this season, converted twice on third
down with completions to Ike Hilliard for 16 yards and tight end
Pete Mitchell for 10 before the Giants' offense did what they do
best. They stalled.
</P>
<P>
   With the smaller/quicker Barber running in place of Gary Brown
in the second quarter, the Giants moved the changes on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But on third-and-three from the Dallas 12, Graham was pressured
and forced to scramble, coming up one yard short of the first down.
Daluiso knocked through the game-tying field goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, the Cowboys were going nowhere on the
ground. Smith would run two yards forward and three yards backward.
</P>
<P>
   On the final play of the third quarter, Cunningham had a chance
to put the Cowboys ahead, and missed for the second time in the
game, hitting the right upright from 41 yards out.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' defense came up with big plays late the game,
forcing punt both times, as defense end Greg Ellis sacked Graham
for a loss of seven on third-and-one, then rookie linebacker Dat
Nguyen threw Barber for a 2-yard loss in the open field.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys needed a big play, they couldn't get one.
</P>
<P>
   And when they could least could afford to give up a big play,
they did.

NO AGREEMENT YET WITH WHITE HOUSE ON FINANCIAL OVERHAUL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating throughout)   (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House and Senate lawmakers completed most of their
work on a bill overhauling the nation's financial system early on
Tuesday morning, but failed to reach an agreement with the White
House over two of the measure's major provisions.
</P>
<P>
   As the joint House-Senate conference committee neared completion
on the measure at 10 p.m. Monday, top administration officials
began a last-ditch round of negotiations with Republican lawmakers
in an effort to resolve differences over the legislation's effect
on a 1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in lending.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and the
Republican lawmakers emerged from the meeting with no agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had discussions and we agreed to have more discussions,''
Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said that Clinton would veto the
legislation both because it failed to protect the privacy of
customers from financial conglomerates and because it would dilute
the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the conference committee defeated a series of
amendments supported by the Clinton administration that would have
provided greater privacy protection for consumers. But Republican
lawmakers said that, despite the failure to reach an accommodation,
they were optimistic that a deal may soon be struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are profound differences of opinion,'' said Rep. James
Leach, R-Iowa, heading the conference committee after leaving the
meeting with Summers. ``On the other hand, it is extraordinary how
close the parties are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, different versions of which have already been
adopted by the House and the Senate, would repeal more than 60
years of laws that have restricted the cross-ownership of banks,
insurance businesses and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton has appeared to make the privacy and
discrimination matters a central policy focus of the debate on the
legislation. He has suggested that he viewed those as more
important than the issues that underlie the legislation and are of
greatest interest to the financial industries _ the repeal of the
Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and other barriers to competition.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the administration's interest in these matters
reflected a belief that Americans are more concerned with privacy
and discrimination than the nuances of bank regulation, even though
three powerful industries _ banks, securities and insurance _ have
heavily lobbied for the changes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the lawmakers defeated a measure, largely on
party lines, sponsored by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. It would have
permitted customers to block their banks from sharing private
information with either affiliated companies like insurers and
brokerage houses or with third parties like telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of finance lobbyists lined basement hallways of the
Capitol on Monday afternoon as the conference committee neared
completion of its work. The industry had uniformly lobbied against
strengthening privacy protection for customers, maintaining that
preventing the affiliates of financial-service conglomerates from
sharing customer information and marketing would defeat the purpose
of such combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This amendment would place unworkable and inappropriate limits
on sharing of information between commonly owned affiliates,'' said
a letter to the lawmakers by trade groups for the securities,
insurance and banking industries. ``Our associations will find it
necessary to oppose any legislation'' that adopted such amendments,
adding that there were consumer benefits derived from affiliates
that shared information and were able to market more services.
</P>
<P>
   Those contentions were sharply criticized by Democrats who
supported the Markey proposal. ``I've seen all the fat-cat
lobbyists in their $1,000 suits outside looking very, very happy,''
said Rep. John Dingell of Michigan. ``They're about to get
everything they want.'' In the end, the Markey measure failed on an
18-to-12 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote suggested that partisan politics might play a strong
and possibly fatal role in deciding the measure's outcome.
Throughout the day, there was no sign of significant compromise by
the White House or the Republican leadership, particularly in the
Senate. The votes on the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which
prohibits discrimination in lending, may ultimately determine the
bill's fate.
</P>
<P>
   While the Community Reinvestment Act is not a significant issue
for many bankers, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has made it an issue in
the legislation. Gramm has criticized the bill as adding burdens
for financial institutions. The measure before the conference
committee was written by Gramm and two other Republicans, Leach and
Rep. Thomas J. Bliley Jr. of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 85 percent of the nation's banks and savings
associations, it would decrease the number of times that their
lending records are reviewed to see if they have complied with the
Community Reinvestment Act _ to once every five years from once a
year.

SURE, IT'S ONLY MID-OCTOBER, BUT COUNT THE COWBOYS OUT

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For those who figured it was a fluke in
Philly, for those who didn't lose faith in the offensive weapons,
well...
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' scoring slump reached Rangers level here last
night, and for what it's worth, the Cowboys' season ended exactly
10 days after the baseball team took it's gloomy exit.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in the aftermath of a bottoming-out, 13-10 loss to the
Giants, coming on the heels of that same-score disgrace in
Philadelphia, go ahead and kiss 1999 goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   It's mid-October in a mixed-up NFL, but the season is already
over. If that changes, notify me immediately, but this is a league
where the strong survive only with offense.
</P>
<P>
   Those who can't score, don't win _ unless it's the lowly Giants
or the even-lower Eagles against the suddenly touchdown-shy
Cowboys. Even with a 3-2 record, what tells the real story for
Dallas is three touchdowns in the past 10 quarters and 20 points in
the past two games against teams that don't figure in future
playoff consideration.
</P>
<P>
   When a chip-shot field goal sailed through with a second
remaining at Giants Stadium, the surprise victory was secured for
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, it was a total collapse by the Cowboys _ the
special teams gave up a Tiki Barber 85-yard punt return for a TD in
the fourth quarter. That one gave New York a 10-3 lead. When the
Cowboys answered with their lone touchdown drive, the Dallas
defense had an immediate breakdown in the final minute of play.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barber again _ he took a short pass in the flat from
quarterback Kent Graham and had some open field due to a coverage
breakdown. But as Barber roared over midfield, he broke two
tackles, and 56 yards later was knocked out of bounds inside the
Dallas 5. From there, it was only a matter of New York running down
the clock to set up the game-winning kick.
</P>
<P>
   The final flaw for the Cowboys was the slump-ridden toe of
Richie Cunningham. He missed a 48-yard first-quarter field-goal
attempt, and much more crucial was a 41-yarder that was off-target
late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that could go wrong did for the Cowboys. But most of
all, this loss was about offensive misery, the same as last week's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey has a problem. He was hired to bring offense to the
Cowboys. That is not happening.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman has a problem. He's paid to make plays that result
in touchdowns. That is not happening.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith has a problem. The go-to running back is going
nowhere. Last night it was an incredible 26 yards rushing on 22
carries.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last week, Gailey can't be blamed for being conservative.
He pulled every rabbit out of every hat, and yet nothing worked
against a good Giants defense.
</P>
<P>
   One killer offensive play came in the second quarter when rookie
receiver Wane McGarity, off to a big start last night, had an
Aikman pass bounce off his hands at the New York 6-yard line.
McGarity's deflection was intercepted, leaving the Cowboys
scoreless on that drive. Maybe even worse, McGarity suffered a
dislocated shoulder trying to make the tackle, and Aikman lost what
had been his favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys' offensive despair started early and happened
often. If nothing else, Aikman's feet told the whole story.
</P>
<P>
   He was dancing. Aikman at his best doesn't dance. The feet stay
planted, which is a sign of comfort and trust in the blocking
scheme and the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the regular offensive line together again for the
first time since the season opener, there was no security level for
Aikman. And it showed.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman was decked by Giants tackle Robert Harris on the Cowboys'
second snap, a result of guard Everett McIver blowing a blocking
assignment. That 8-yard sack helped kill a great scoring
opportunity for the Cowboys, who had been graced with field
position galore _ a first down at the New York 29.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the offense was herky-jerky, never showing
consistency. It couldn't run against the Giants to open up the air
game. It couldn't throw to open up the running game.
</P>
<P>
   And again, this was with the regular offensive line intact.
Those people were beaten badly and repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   No offense means no chance in an NFL that is watered-down and
weak. It's all about points on the board, and the Cowboys will
discover that in six days when Washington comes to Texas Stadium
for a rematch. And then it's the Colts and the Vikings on the road,
Green Bay at home, plus Miami and New England loom out there in the
distant future.
</P>
<P>
   As of last night, however, the season is over. Twenty points in
two weeks says why.

COWBOYS' MISSION TO NY ONE BIG, MISERABLE FAILURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Cowboys arrived at Giants Stadium
last night with a few missions in mind. First and foremost was to
re-establish themselves as an NFC power, in both their own minds
and in the NFL's.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   They came to once again demonstrate their power as a running
team, behind the league's so-called ``best'' offensive line and a
rejuvenated Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   They came to prove that last weekend's upset loss in
Philadelphia was an absolute fluke, an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, they came to win a football game.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   Miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Cowboys lost to the offensively-challenged New York
Giants, 13-10, on Monday Night Football with a deplorable
performance that was even more toxic than the waste allegedly
buried beneath the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Giants' quarterback Kent Graham, not exactly known for his John
Elway-like finishes, flipped a 5-yard pass to Tiki Barber with less
than a minute to play and Barber turned it into a 56-yard
back-breaker to set up Brad Daluiso's game-winning 21-yard field
goal with one second left on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barber's 85-yard punt return midway through the fourth
quarter that had broken open your basic patty-cake, sissy-fight
between two of the NFL's more punchless patsies. But it also
finally stirred up a little life in the listless Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman and the Cowboys answered with a
seven-play, 68-yard drive, capped by Smith's 2-yard touchdown run,
to tie the score at 10-all with slightly less than two minutes
left.
</P>
<P>
   One more defensive stand from the team's defenders, who at least
could hold their heads high, and the Cowboys might have been able
to pull this out in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Cowboys' plan. The Giants had other ideas, catching
the winded Dallas defense off-guard with a no-huddle offense that
finally broke a big play.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's heroics finally injected life into a disgrace of an NFL
game that may have turned half of America back into baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   Barber would have scored the game-winning touchdown himself if
Deion Sanders hadn't slashed across the field to drag him down at
the 3 but the damage was done. Three plays later, Daluiso nailed
the chip-shot field goal to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a simple route,'' Barber said. ``I was the dump-off.
Everybody else was running deep and I was running underneath. I
just split the DBs and broke a tackle and got on down there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys provided a little excitement with a slapstick
kickoff return that included a Sanders lateral to Kevin Mathis,
who, as he was being tackled near the 10, pitched it to Signor
Mobley for the would-be touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Only the tuba player didn't get a chance at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: a yellow flag lay far back downfield at the
Cowboys' 25-yard line, where Sanders' initial lateral was ruled an
illegal forward pass. Replays confirmed that the call was correct.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. If the Cowboys' offense had shown as much innovation
and life, maybe it wouldn't have come to this in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Last night was another test-game for Chan Gailey's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   This was a perfect chance for Aikman to step up and deliver the
Cowboys from their own ineptitude, to take the team on his
shoulders and find a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   He had the one good fourth quarter drive in the end, but that
was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.
</P>
<P>
   This was a golden opportunity for the Cowboys to put distance
between themselves and the rest of the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   Mission aborted.
</P>
<P>
   We haven't seen an offense run this poorly by a Dallas team
since ex-Mavs' coach Jim Cleamons departed and took the haunted
triangle offense with him. Or at least since the Rangers dozed
against the Yankees again last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back losses to the hopeless Eagles and hapless
Giants throws Gailey's entire program into question. Five games
into his second season, his offense remains as foreign and
inconsistent as it did most of last year.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, it must start clicking or the entire team will
lose confidence that it ever will, if that isn't already happening.
</P>
<P>
   How do you explain Smith carrying 22 times for 26 yards? Behind
that line? At halftime Smith had only 10 yards on 7 carries.
``Ten!''
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought it couldn't get worse than that, he
carried 15 times in the second half for 16 yards. Seven times in
the first three quarters alone he was stopped for no gain or minus
yardage. His longest run of the game was for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Pitiful.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like Gailey didn't try virtually every trick in his
playbook. Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Mission failed.

HARPER IS THE FRONT-RUNNER, BUT THEN WHO'S NEXT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All signs point to Ron Harper's replacing the
injured Kobe Bryant in the Lakers' starting lineup. But the battle
for minutes behind Harper is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reporting to the Lakers just last week, and with a
surgically repaired right knee, Harper has been practicing daily
with the first team. Phil Jackson, who coached Harper in Chicago,
appears to prefer him over Rick Fox, a natural small forward who's
still learning the triangle offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Harper's knee acted up Monday, and Fox might start tonight's
exhibition game against the Golden State Warriors in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Then the competition for minutes really begins, as two relative
unknowns _ Sam Jacobson and Devean George _ try to make an
impression off the bench. Even before Bryant broke his hand, the
Lakers were thin at shooting guard. Jacobson and George, both young
and athletic, could compete for time in Jackson's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' George said, ``this is for sure a chance really to
get some more minutes and try to produce out there while Kobe is
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   George, the Lakers' first-round pick in June, saw some time with
the starters Monday at Southwest College. He's had his moments so
far, scoring seven points in 15 minutes in last week's
exhibition-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, a first-round pick in 1998, played 10 minutes last
week, finishing with three points and three turnovers. Jacobson
spent most of his rookie season on the injured list and is eager to
prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to step up and see it as an opportunity,'' he
said. ``For me, last year was tough because I really didn't get a
good chance to get a lot of playing time and to really get myself
asserted on the court and be comfortable. . . . This year, with a
new coach and a new system, it's going to take some time. I'm just
trying to learn as quick as I can and as much as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper hurts: Jackson said Harper's knee was swollen Monday and
he might hold Harper out of tonight's exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have him practice and miss a game than not practice
and play in a game, because I think it's more important for him to
be out here for a practice situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Try, try again: The Lakers' second- and third-teamers _ the ones
who blew a 17-point, fourth-quarter lead in last week's loss to
Washington _ will get a shot at redemption tonight.
</P>
<P>
   That includes George and Jacobson, who each played a majority of
the period as the Lakers committed 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarrassed,'' George admitted. ``The mistakes that we
made, we're not going to make them again. We were rushing (to make
entry passes) when they were playing pressure defense on us. We
weren't making good passes. Instead of backing away from the
pressure, we were trying to fight the pressure and that's what the
coaches don't want us to do. . . . When we get that chance, we're
going to be ready, we're going execute this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jacobson: ``It's a learning process. It just takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut: The Lakers waived free-agent forward Gerald Jordan,
reducing the roster to 17.

COWBOYS OFFENSE FAILS IN THE TRENCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Clarence E. Hill, Jr. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Listening to the Cowboys' coaches talk
before last night's abysmal 13-10 loss to the Giants, it seemed
that a mismatch was about to be played out.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that star receiver Michael Irvin was a spectator _
stylishly standing on the sideline in a brown coat, glasses and a
neck brace to protect his injured spinal cord.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had noticed flaws in the vaunted Giants defense and
planned to exploit them _ just like the Redskins, who put a 50 spot
on the G-men earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Why couldn't the Cowboys do the same? After all, they outscored
the Redskins in a 41-35 shootout.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to confuse the Giants with a lot of movement and
shifting in the passing game early, then pound them with the run
late.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there was a mismatch last night. However, it came in the
trenches, where the Giants' defensive line dominated the Cowboys'
supposed superior offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   And this was not the injured and patched up Cowboys offensive
line of recent weeks. The highly touted fivesome _ center Mark
Stepnoski, guards Everett McIver and Larry Allen and tackles Erik
Williams and Flozell Adams _ played together for the first time
since the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   They certainly met their match in the Giants' front of ends
Cedric Jones and Michael Strahan and tackles Keith Hamilton and
Robert Harris. And you can add linebackers Jessie Armstead and
Corey Widmer in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in golf, you drive for show and putt for dough. In
football the adage is that those formations and tricky sets look
good, but the game is won with the bruisers in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the late touchdown drive by the Cowboys in the final
two minutes and the chest-thumping by Williams and Adams after
escorting running back Emmitt Smith to paydirt on a 2-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   That Smith, who came into the game as the NFC's leading rusher,
had a plethora of 2-yard runs was the problem. His stat line was 22
carries for 26 yards. That's a whopping 1.2 per carry.
</P>
<P>
   The bad part is that the Giants were able to contain the run and
get effective pressure on Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman, who
completed 20 of 33 passes for 266 yards and was sacked three times.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Smith nor Aikman had anywhere to run or hide for much of
the night. It certainly affected Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's
play-calling. Just what was that pitchout call on third-and-two at
the Giants' 21-yard line that netted a 3-yard loss?
</P>
<P>
   And it raises questions about the Cowboys' supposedly vaunted
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the offense scored six touchdowns against the
Redskins and a total of four in the four games since.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about replacing Irvin. The middle needs fixing.

RUGGED DEFENSE IS POINTING GIANTS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It was Monday Night Football against the
hated Cowboys, so the offensive output of the Giants should not
have shocked anyone. In the past three such contests against the
Cowboys, New York had scored 17 points, or just five more points
than Deion Sanders had in a game here last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the rub here last night was that the Giants didn't need
offense to win their first game against the Cowboys on MNF after
six defeats by a combined margin of 188-82.
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber's 233 all-purpose yards, which included an 85-yard
punt return for a touchdown and a 56-yard catch-and-run that set up
the winning field goal, will get the headlines in the Giants' 13-10
upset victory over the Cowboys last night.
</P>
<P>
   But in a game with all the excitement of a potato sack race, the
Giants' defense should get credit for saving, at least for now, the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel needed a game like this from his team,
needed his club to overcome stupid penalties and general ineptness
from his offense to keep the locker room from splitting into
cancerous factions.
</P>
<P>
   So the finger pointing, for now, will wait at least another
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one month ago, the Giants' defense was left for dead
in a 50-21 home loss to the Washington Redskins. Since then, they
have allowed 16 to New England, 15 to Philadelphia, 14 to Arizona,
and 10 last night to the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the club is just 2-2 in this stretch because of an offense
that often gets in its own way.
</P>
<P>
   But last night, the Giants defense carried the club until the
rest of the units caught up. And this was no small task when you
see who was on the other side of the field: Troy Aikman has laser
accuracy. Emmitt Smith is still nimble enough to make linebackers
miss. ``Rocket'' Ismail proved with the game-winning touchdown in
Washington that he is a deep threat. And the offensive line, on
account of having the league's best run offense before last night,
is the best in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet led by a defensive line featuring Michael Strahan, Robert
Harris, Keith Hamilton, and Cedric Jones, the Giants held the No. 1
rushing attack in the league to nothing notable on the ground.
Smith rushed 22 times for 26 yards and is lucky he was able to
leave Giants Stadium in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman passed for more than 250 yards, but many came during the
final few minutes of the game as his team tried to rally in the
fourth quarter. Giants cornerbacks Jason Sehorn and Phillippi
Sparks shut down the outside throwing lanes, and forced Aikman _
who was without Michael Irvin _ to throw inside to Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were in position to put the game away early. But
when Wane McGarity flubbed an Aikman pass near the end zone, strong
safety Sam Garnes was on the spot for the interception.
</P>
<P>
   New York, trailing 3-0, marched down the field for the tying
field goal, and some much-needed confidence. Then the defense took
over the rest of the game. And for that, a season is still alive.

   Injuries or bad play forced six subs into action over the
weekend. And the backups weren't too bad. Damon Huard (in for the
injured Dan Marino), Jay Fiedler (for the injured Mark Brunell),
Gus Frerotte (for the injured Charlie Batch) each earned saves in
relief duty. Jeff George (for the benched Randall Cunningham) and
Ray Lucas (for the benched Rick Mirer) barely lost. Only Dave Brown
(for the injured Jake Plummer) failed to keep his team competitive.
\Nsubheds:Kickers A
</P>
<P>
   Two games, Lions-Vikings and Chargers-Seahawks were decided by
last-second field goals. Two kickers, Detroit's Jason Hanson and
Miami's Olindo Mare, each kicked six field goals in one game, just
one short of the NFL record for most field goals in one game, a
record shared by Chris Boniol, who had seven in a game for the
Cowboys against the Packers in 1996.
\Nsubheds:Mike Ditka F
</P>
<P>
   The Saints coach showed his own fans who's No. 1 when he made an
obscene gesture to taunting fans as he left the field at halftime
of his club's 24-21 loss to Tennessee. Saints general manager Bill
Kuharich fined Ditka $20,000 for his middle-fingered salute. Maybe
Ditka could give the money to rookie running back Ricky Williams,
who signed that dumb contract that will pay him minimum wage next
year unless he makes like Jim Brown 21/2 months.

VITESSE EARNINGS HIGHER DESPITE STOCK DOWNTURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMARILLO, Calif. -- Vitesse Semiconductor Corp., which saw
jittery investors sell off its stock Monday, reported quarterly
earnings that surpassed analysts' expectations after the market
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Profits for its fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 were $21.6
million, or 26 cents a share, a 36.8 percent increase over the same
1998 period and a penny ahead of Wall Street's consensus forecast
as compiled by Thomson Financial's First Call. Sales rose 48
percent over the prior year's fourth quarter to a record $80.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Vitesse cited strong demand for its Fibre Channel and Gigabit
Ethernet products as factors in its improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   The report came after the communications equipment and chip
maker's stock fell $5.375 to $76 a share, a decline of 6.61
percent. During the session, the stock traded as low as $72.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Greg McClenon of Preferred Capital Markets in San
Francisco said the stock's performance reflected an
across-the-board dip in the sector, which was down 6 percent on
average.
</P>
<P>
   McClenon, who has a buy rating, said he has ambitious
expectations for Vitesse, which has weathered six months of flat
orders from its largest customer, Lucent Technologies. Lucent,
which is completing a restructuring of its inventory system, is
expected to begin increasing its orders in the coming quarter, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   McClenon said he predicts the higher orders will lead to a
quarterly revenue growth between 10 percent and 12 percent. He
predicted earnings will be 28 cents a share next quarter and $1.32
a share for fiscal year 2000. &QL;

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
BOSTON _ The journey is complete for Orlando Hernandez. Two years
after risking his life in a voyage by sea from his native Cuba,
Hernandez fulfilled the American dream.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hernandez blanked Boston over the first seven innings Monday
night as the Yankees claimed a record 36th American League pennant
with a 6-1 victory over the Red Sox in Game 5 of the AL
Championship Series at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   New York wrapped up the ALCS 4-1 and will await the winner of
the National League Championship Series between the Atlanta Braves
and the New York Mets. The Yankees will open the Series on the road
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   They needed only two batters Monday to make a statement, then
turned the lead over to Hernandez, who was named ALCS Most Valuable
Player.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed five hits while striking out a postseason-high
nine batters in seven-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought this beautiful moment would happen,''
Hernandez said through an interpreter. ``This trophy belongs to my
teammates, my family and the people of Cuba. The United States has
given me a chance to be El Duque again.''
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and the
Yankees added a pair of runs off two Boston errors in the seventh
and a two-run homer by Jorge Posada in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   New York had to sweat out a tense eighth inning when the Red Sox
loaded the bases on a double by Nomar Garciaparra and a pair of
walks after scoring a run.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramiro Mendoza, who was bumped out of the starting rotation
upon Hernandez's arrival in the summer of 1998, struck out pinch
hitter Scott Hatteberg and got Trot Nixon to pop out to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mendoza saved our you-know-whats a couple of times in the
series,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``Maybe it's some kind of
justice it happened like that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, trying to force the series back to New York for Game 6
on Tuesday, had ace Pedro Martinez warming up in the eighth. He did
not pitch, and Posada delivered the knockout punch with a two-run
shot to right off Tom Gordon in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Until the end, Torre said he remained uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starting pitching just shut down the Red Sox,'' Torre
said. ``Let me tell you something: This (Boston) is as tough a team
as we've had to play in the four years I've been here. They would
not go away.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Yankees moved one step closer to a third
World Series title in four years and became the first repeat
champion in the AL since Toronto in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   For Boston, the Curse of the Bambino continues. The last time
the Red Sox won the World Series was 1918, with Babe Ruth. Ruth's
contract was sold to the Yankees two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in Games 1 and 4, when blown calls by the umpiring crew
affected the outcome, the Red Sox unraveled without aid Monday.
They stranded 11 baserunners, went 0-for-10 with runners in scoring
position and committed two costly errors.
</P>
<P>
   Boston avoided being shut out when Jason Varitek homered to lead
off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   New York jumped on Red Sox starter Kent Mercker with two runs
less than 10 minutes into the game. Chuck Knoblauch singled to lead
off, and Jeter followed with a two-run blast to straightaway center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker threw 32 pitches in the first inning, escaping a
two-out, two-on jam by striking out Posada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to score early and give El Duque a little breathing
room,'' Jeter said. ``Two runs is all he needed tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of the series for the Red Sox was twofold: too many
LOBs (44) because of a lack of clutch hits, and too many errors
(10).
</P>
<P>
   Those trends continued as Hernandez got into a jam in the first
inning when Jose Offerman and John Valentin opened with singles.
Hernandez escaped further damage with a strikeout and two fly
balls.
</P>
<P>
   Boston had two more runners reach base in the second and one
each in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added insurance in the seventh when first baseman
Mike Stanley couldn't handle Garciaparra's high throw, allowing
Jeter to reach second base. Paul O'Neill followed with a single,
and reliever Rheal Cormier walked Bernie Williams to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis drove in a run when Offerman mishandled a grounder
in the hole between first and second base, and the Yankees went
ahead 4-0 on an RBI single by Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees chased Mercker in the fourth when they loaded the
bases on a pair of walks and a single by Knoblauch. Reliever Derek
Lowe got out of the inning when Jeter grounded into a fielder's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   As the game went on, Hernandez seemed to get stronger. He struck
out the side in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a pair of singles in the first, Hernandez allowed
only three other hits _ a single by Valentin in the fifth and
Varitek's homer and Garciaparra's double to open the eighth _
before exiting.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who threw season-high 138 pitches, has allowed only
three earned runs in 22 innings (1.23 ERA) in three playoff starts.
He is 4-0 with an 0.97 ERA and 30 strikeouts in five career
postseason starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like 100 years ago when I saw him in spring
training,'' Torre said. ``Ever since then he's dared people, and
tonight was another example.''

BIG PLAYS SINK COWBOYS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Tiki Barber had two punt returns that tortured the
Dallas Cowboys last night as much as his 56-yard reception in the
final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious one was the 85-yard touchdown return in the fourth
quarter that proved the difference in the New York Giants' 13-10
victory at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Monday night game,'' Barber said. ``We knew it was a
big game. You've got to make big plays in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   The other crucial punt return was a 19-yarder in the third
quarter that was almost a huge play for the Cowboys. The Giants
were fortunate in that regard because Barber fumbled the punt, a
64-yarder by Toby Gowin, and almost put his team in a huge hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were punting from their own 1 but Gowin took
advantage of the whipping wind to get off a boomer, one that sent
Barber racing back from midfield to his own 35. The punt went
through his hands but took a true bounce off the artificial
surface, allowing Barber to regain possession immediately at his
29.
</P>
<P>
   He then weaved his way through the coverage and brought the ball
back to the Giants' 48 before Dat Nguyen brought him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to kick it 40-45 yards,'' Barber said.
``I couldn't catch up to it. I was lucky I got a good bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber came into the game averaging 9.6 yards per punt return
and said, ``We've been close to breaking one all year.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally did so in the fourth quarter, taking a punt at his
15, weaving left through the Cowboys' coverage and then outrunning
Gowin down the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everybody blocked,'' Barber said. ``When I looked up,
the first thing I saw was the punter. I said, `I'm not going to be
tackled by a punter.' I just tried to focus on staying in bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Two crucial punt returns would normally constitute a great night
for Barber. But he wanted more. He wanted to do more offensively
and Giants coach Jim Fassel allowed that to happen by making Barber
an integral part of their no-huddle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting him involved was part of the package,'' Fassel said.
``We wanted to use his speed. We wanted something that would give
us a change of pace. I wish we could have gone to it more.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to last night's game, Barber had rushed just twice for 10
yards and had caught 12 passes for 79 yards. He finished with 231
yards total last night, including 35 rushing, 73 on five receptions
and 123 yards on punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be patient and trying to get a chance,''
Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   He did so last night and the Giants won a football game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiki was outstanding,'' Fassel said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE SCARY ROOM NOBODY TALKS ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ In the tunnel on their way to and from
the Monday night television cameras, the New York Giants and the
Dallas Cowboys were not far from it. And all of them were hoping
that they would stay far from it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the X-ray room, where pro football players never want to
go, but too many must.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the road to the Super Bowl has been described as
winding through Dallas or San Francisco or Pittsburgh, but more and
more the real road to the Super Bowl winds through the X-ray rooms
in the 30 stadiums that serve as sound stages for National Football
League teams.
</P>
<P>
   Every franchise is quick to brag about its stadium, either the
glitz of its new luxury boxes or the history of its ancestral
glory.
</P>
<P>
   No franchise ever mentions what can be its stadium's most
important area, the X-ray room, where a career sometimes goes to
die, where the brutality of pro football is there on ghostly gray
film for doctors to see.
</P>
<P>
   With both the Giants and the Jets playing at Giants Stadium, the
X-ray room there is the only one in the NFL that does double duty.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants edged the Cowboys, 13-10, on Monday night, at
least three players visited the X-ray room _ Giants guard Luke
Petitgout (sprained ankle) and Cowboys wide receiver Wane McGarity
(dislocated shoulder) and safety George Teague (sprained neck).
</P>
<P>
   But it's the room nobody talks about, the windowless room where
the only view occurs when a doctor examines a set of X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   It's stark and scary and small. Brightly lighted, it's only
about 30 feet deep by 10 feet wide, with blue cement-block walls,
an X-ray table below an X-ray tube, other X-ray equipment and, in
the rear, a darkroom where the X-rays are developed. ``We can get a
print in 90 seconds,'' said Marion Federico, the X-ray technologist
who has been on duty here for the last 10 seasons. ``The equipment
is excellent, the best in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   She ought to know. She's the manager of an X-ray facility,
Medical Imaging, in nearby Clifton, N.J., but taking X-rays of pro
football players is different from taking those of most people.
``This is the greatest challenge in my profession _ to get
diagnostic film on such muscular athletes, especially the big
linemen,'' Federico said. ``With so much muscle and tissue
involved, you have to vary your technical factors to get the proper
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The players sometimes arrive howling in pain, or in stoic
silence, each wondering what the X-rays will show, how long he will
be unable to play, or if his career is over.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jets, the road to the Super Bowl hit a dead end in this
X-ray room during their opening game. X-rays showed that
quarterback Vinny Testaverde had a torn Achilles' tendon. Out for
the season. Another Jets quarterback, Ray Lucas, emerged from this
X-ray room Sunday on crutches with a sprained ankle. Out three to
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Graham, who returned as the Giants' quarterback on Monday
night, missed the Arizona game with a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Around the NFL, the results of X-rays have affected the
standings as much as the results of the games. At least a dozen
starting quarterbacks have been battered, notably Testaverde and
Steve Young, the 49ers' quarterback, who suffered his fourth
concussion in three years and is considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's loss to the Washington Redskins, the Arizona
Cardinals lost Jake Plummer for four to six weeks with a broken
finger. Dan Marino of the Dolphins, unable to throw properly
because of a damaged shoulder, and Mark Brunell of the Jaguars,
benched with strained rib muscles, were unable to finish Sunday,
but both teams rallied to win behind virtually unknown backups _
Damon Huard for the Dolphins, Jay Fiedler for the Jaguars. The Rams
lost Trent Green (knee) before the season and the Titans are
waiting for Steve McNair (back) to return. Chris Chandler
(hamstring) has been in and out of the Falcons' lineup. The Lions
hope Charlie Batch (bruised upper arm) will return soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos, who had hoped to win a record third
consecutive Super Bowl, have been decimated; their record is 2-4.
Running back Terrell Davis is out for the season following knee
surgery. Tight end Shannon Sharpe has a broken collarbone.
Quarterback Bubby Brister has a damaged hip.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson, the running back who led the Falcons into the
Super Bowl last season, is out for the season following knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Cowboys appeared at Giants Stadium on Monday night,
Michael Irvin was wearing a medical collar instead of his shoulder
pads; he's out indefinitely. The wide receiver sustained a swollen
spinal cord and a herniated disk a week ago in Philadelphia when
the crown of his helmet slammed into the artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   When Irvin tried to put his hands down to get up, he couldn't.
His condition was so serious, he went by ambulance to a spinal
trauma center. He didn't even stop in the X-ray room. &QL;

HOUSTON CANCER CENTER OPENS TRIALS OF PROMISING DRUG 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON_ After more than a year of excited speculation about
Endostatin, a drug that cured cancer in laboratory mice, physicians
at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center announced
that they will begin enrolling cancer patients next week in the
first human studies of the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Oncologists James Abbruzzese and Roy Herbst, who are leading the
study, detailed the specifics of the highly anticipated experiment
Monday, emphasizing that the drug's use as a cancer treatment is a
long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting that we're starting the trial now, but it's just
the first step,'' Herbst said. ``We're still looking at several
years, if not more, before this becomes standard therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin, discovered three years ago by Dr. Judah Folkman of
Children's Hospital in Boston, is one of a new class of anti-cancer
drugs that works by preventing angiogenesis, or the formation of
blood vessels that nourish tumors. Without a blood supply, tumors
starve and disappear. Tumors vanished in mice treated with the drug
in Folkman's lab, and the mice suffered no side effects.
</P>
<P>
   There are only 30 slots available for the trial, which is
expected to last 12 to 18 months. The drug has received so much
publicity and generated so much hope, M.D. Anderson has received
more than 1,770 calls about it since March.
</P>
<P>
   To be eligible, volunteers must be 18 or older and they must
have exhausted other therapies, Herbst said. Patients will be
selected on the basis of their health, which must be relatively
good despite their cancer; and the location of their tumors, so
that biopsies can be performed easily.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidates will be patients with cancers of the
breast, head or neck, because of the easy access to those tumors,
Herbst said. Some patients with liver tumors that can be biopsied
through the skin may also be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   As with other M.D. Anderson studies, participants must be M.D.
Anderson patients who are referred to the study by their doctors
after all viable treatment options are considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really want people to know we will consider as many
patients as possible through the existing mechanism, but we don't
want people to wait for this drug,'' Herbst said. ``We want people
to go get the best therapy their doctor is recommending for them at
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   M.D. Anderson is taking extra precautions through its
informed-consent process to make sure potential volunteers
understand the difference between a Phase I study and a proven
treatment. A questionnaire will help officials assess patients'
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid people's expectations will have been raised by
the media,'' said Rebecca Pentz, an associate professor of clinical
ethics at M.D. Anderson. ``It's well-established that patients
think these (studies) are therapies when, as a matter of fact, they
aren't. This is a trial just to make sure this drug is safe for
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The first group of patients will begin receiving daily
Endostatin injections the week of Nov. 22. Doctors will start them
out on a low dose, watching for side effects. The dose will then be
gradually increased over a month's time.
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks, ``we will do extensive testing to examine the
toxicity of that dosage before selecting the next few patients,''
Herbst said.
</P>
<P>
   Biopsies will be taken and patients will undergo various scans
to look for evidence that the treatment is working. Tissue samples
will be examined to see if the drug has had any effect on halting
the growth of blood vessels supplying the tumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely that we will see any major, major breakthroughs
(with this study), but we may see hints that will suggest that this
compound, and overall strategy, is of value,'' Abbruzzese said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they plan to provide an update on the status of
the trial in January.
</P>
<P>
   M.D. Anderson is one of three Endostatin trial sites. The
National Cancer Institute is sponsoring the Houston study and one
at the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   A third trial, at Dana-Farber / Partners Cancer Care in Boston,
began last month and is being sponsored by EntreMed Inc., a small,
Maryland-based biotech company that is manufacturing the drug.
</P>
<P>

ACTORS FIGHTING PRODUCTION LOSS TO CANADA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Screen Actors Guild has thrown its weight
behind a campaign to pressure the Clinton administration to slow
down runaway Hollywood production to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guild has turned to our greatest resource _ our nearly
100,000 members across the country _ and asked them to help us
bring the accelerating loss of film and television production to
the attention of every member of Congress,'' SAG National President
Richard Masur said in a printed statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is designed to highlight the impact of runaway
production, lured by locales such as Vancouver through aggressive
tax incentives, on local economies, working families and small
business in the United States. SAG's national office has sent
material to its 26 branches with instructions on letter-writing and
setting up meetings with members of Congress. There is a how-to
section at its sag.org Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Masur also reported that members have begun making phone calls
to Congress in support of a recent letter by eight congressmen to
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky calling for a change
in rules allowing Canada to subsidize productions such as ``The
Dennis Rodman Story'' under the guise of protecting Canadian
culture. The letter, written by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission
Hills, asks Barshefsky to raise the issue at world trade talks
scheduled to start Nov. 30 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   SAG and the Directors Guild of America recently released a study
showing Canada accounted for 81percent of runaway production last
year, costing $10.3billion in lost revenues and more than 20,000
jobs in the United States. Through the first nine months this year,
filming at locations off studio lots declined 6percent from the
same period of 1998 in Los Angeles County, traditionally home to
about 80percent of for-profit film production.
</P>
<P>
   Masur said runaway production also has hurt the economy in other
U.S. regions, such as the state of Washington, with a 37.5percent
decline from 1995 to 1998. Production in North Carolina fell
35.8percent during that period, while it declined 31percent in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is major production centers around the country have
experienced the brunt of the loss of film, television and
commercial production,'' Masur said.

GIANTS TOP COWBOYS, 13-10 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ A star as a rookie two years ago, Tiki
Barber has largely been a forgotten man on the New York Giants this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, with a punt return for a touchdown and a stirring
56-yard catch and run on a routine short pass _ both in the fourth
quarter _ Barber nearly singlehandedly salvaged a Giants season on
the verge of a devastating downward spiral.
</P>
<P>
   It was Barber's reception on a simple crossing route with 27
seconds left in the game that set up Brad Daluiso's 21-yard field
goal with one second remaining that gave the Giants a 13-10 upset
of the Dallas Cowboys early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's production was by no means an accident. In practice
last week, the Giants worked on various ways to get him more
involved in a stagnant offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to do something new, and this was my chance,''
Barber said afterward. ``I know the coaches were disappointed in me
last year. But I've been working for a long time to make up for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   On the play that set up the winning field goal, Barber caught a
Kent Graham pass in his own territory, then turned upfield to
sprint between and around several Dallas defenders before being
pushed out at the 3-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiki played big in a game that we had to win,'' Giants Coach
Jim Fassel said. ``I'm proud of this team because we never lost our
faith. After they scored, we never gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   After the go-ahead field goal, the Cowboys' Deion Sanders took
the ensuing kickoff and two laterals later, Dallas ran the ball
into the Giants' end zone. But Sanders was penalized for throwing
an illegal forward pass and the frenzied play was nullified. It was
costly, however, for the Giants as Daluiso tore a ligament in his
left knee trying to stop the play and will be out for the rest of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the fourth quarter, Barber, who finished the game
with 233 all-purpose yards, dashed 85 yards with a punt return that
put the Giants ahead, 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Barber caught the ball at his own 15-yard line and ran to his
left, splitting two defenders as he sprinted up the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   He faked Dallas punter Toby Gowin near midfield and outran
Singor Mobley to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   With the Giants' defense playing as spectacularly as the Giants'
offense was inept, it appeared Barber's punt return would be enough
to keep the Giants (3-3) from their third division defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys (3-2) tied the score on their next possession as
the Giants' defense appeared to grow more passive protecting a
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' game-tying drive began with a 36-yard pass from
Troy Aikman to Ernie Mills. It moved the Cowboys into Giants
territory, and on the next play, Aikman hit Raghib Ismail for 16
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a third-and-9 at the Giants' 15, running back Chris
Warren caught an Aikman pass over the middle, eluding Giants
linebacker Jessie Armstead to get the first down.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Emmitt Smith tied the score with a 2-yard
touchdown run with 1 minute 57 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Giants won on ``Monday Night
Football'' in five years and the first time the Giants defeated
Dallas on Monday night in eight tries.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left the game briefly in the third quarter with a sprained
left ankle, an injury sustained on a tackle behind the line of
scrimmage by Giants safety Sam Garnes. Smith returned several plays
later, but on a pivotal third-and-3 from the Giants' 21, he lost 3
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The succeeding fourth-down play was a 41-yard field-goal attempt
by Richie Cunningham. The Cowboys were preparing to let the final
seconds of the quarter run out, but the Giants called timeout with
four seconds left, forcing Cunningham to make his attempt into a
strong wind.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who does not have a strong leg, missed the kick, the
attempt skidding off the right upright.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who have had success running their no-huddle offense
during garbage time of previous games, came out in the no-huddle
late in the first quarter. Trailing by 3-0 at the time, the Giants
showed a productive offense and even seemed to move the ball with
enthusiasm and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   It was still a baby step; this is, after all, the Giants'
offense. After an 18-play drive that took 9:47, all the Giants had
to show for it was a 27-yard game-tying field goal by Daluiso.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, some surprises. Barber, who as the
third-down back plays in the no-huddle, excelled as the featured
back. Barber carried the ball seven times during the drive for 22
yards and twice picked up the first down in short-yardage
situations. He had burst and good acceleration into the hole,
something lacking from the Giants' backs for most of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also seemed to show more decisiveness in the pocket in
the no-huddle format. He even threw twice in the drive to Pete
Mitchell, the forgotten tight end who was supposed to be a key to
the offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants were hampered by penalties, even in this
effective drive, just as they were throughout the game. The rookie
left guard Luke Petitgout had consecutive penalties, including a
holding penalty that offset a Cowboys pass-interference penalty on
the same play.
</P>
<P>
   Without the holding call on Petitgout, the Giants would have
picked up 32 yards as Dallas's Kevin Smith interfered with Giants
wide receiver Amani Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   As uncommonly stirring as the Giants' second quarter no-huddle
drive was, it concluded with a fourth down at the Cowboys' 10-yard
line. The Giants needed about a foot for the first down, but Fassel
did not go for it, electing to kick the field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had another no-huddle situation in the final two
minutes of the half, but could not advance the ball. Penalties were
again a problem in this aborted drive.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the game, the Giants' defense, its front four
in particular, dominated the Dallas offensive line. The Giants
harassed Aikman and often hit Smith before he reached the line of
scrimmage in his rushing attempts.

   Smith gained just 10 yards on 7 first-half carries. Aikman had
trouble moving the Cowboys, though he repeatedly tried to take
advantage of the weakest spot in the Giants' nickel defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Shaun Williams is a safety playing the nickel
cornerback role because the reserve cornerback Conrad Hamilton is
out with a knee injury. But Williams is not suited to running
one-on-one all over the field with speedy wide receivers _ not many
safeties are. So Aikman went after Williams often.

   PAKISTAN-ASSESS (New Delhi, India) _ News Analysis: Pakistan's
new military ruler, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, is talking about
reform, but previous military dictatorships have left the country
and its democratic institutions in worse shape than ever. Can
Musharraf deliver on his promises? By Celia W. Dugger.

Psychologists Association is joining the American Federation of

</P>
<P>
   DENVER-SHOOTING (Denver) _ Accused Columbine High School killer
Dylan Klebold's parents have notified the local sheriff and two
local officials that they may sue, according to published reports.
The legal document filed by Tom and Sue Klebold, is more popularly
known as a ``notice of intent to sue.'' Under Colorado law, state
and local government officials and entities cannot be sued unless
they are notified first. The Klebold family says school should have
recognized troubling signs in Eric Harris, the other student
involved in the killings last April in Littleton, Colo. By Michael
Janofsky.

<P>
   &UR; CAMPAIGN _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WEB-CAMPAIGNING (Undated) _ The modern campaign headquarters is
no longer a rented storefront, it isn't a place at all, just an
address starting with www. If in 1996 a candidate could prove
hipness simply by posting an electronic version of a campaign
brochure on the World Wide Web, White House hopefuls for 2000 are
learning to use their Internet sites to raise money and rally
troops. The Web page is the new whistle stop. By Tina Kelley.

   CLINTON-MEDICARE _ In a break from three decades of Medicare
policy, the Clinton administration asked Congress on Monday to
steer Medicare patients to certain doctors and hospitals that offer
discounts on the price of care they provide to people who are
elderly or disabled. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   GULF-WAR-SYNDROME _ A scientific survey underwritten by the
Pentagon has concluded that an experimental drug given to U.S.
troops during the Persian Gulf war to protect against a nerve gas
may have been responsible for the chronic illnesses afflicting tens
of thousands of veterans. The report, to be released at a news
conference on Tuesday, is the first commissioned by the Pentagon to
identify a possible cause for the illnesses. By Steven Lee Myers.

   NISSAN-CUTBACK (Tokyo) _ Nissan Motor Co. has stunned Japan and
the global automotive industry with details of an unprecedented
overhaul plan that makes cuts far deeper than had been expected at
the No. 3 Japanese automaker and will reverberate throughout the
economy. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ Twelve years ago, the stock
market crashed in the largest one-day fall ever. Now, by some
measures, the stock market is even more volatile than it was then.
It is possible that the current surge in volatility is foretelling
a similar turn in this era's dominant sector, technology. Column by
Floyd Norris.

   LUXURY-GOODS (Undated) _ That Calvin Klein may soon be on the
block should come as no surprise. Many other fashion houses have
been tempted by the incredible prices that brand-name companies are
receiving as they are snapped up in a wave of luxury fever. But if
Calvin is counting on the same outrageous multiples that are going
to his European cousins, analysts suggest he may be disappointed.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-CATHEDRAL-ASTRONOMY (Undated) _ While the Roman Catholic
Church condemned Galileo, new research shows that centuries of
oversimplifications have concealed how hard Rome worked to amass
astronomical tools, measurements, tests and lore. In its scientific
zeal, the Church adapted cathedrals across Europe, and a tower at
the Vatican itself, so their darkened vaults could serve as solar
observatories. Beams of sunlight that fell past religious art and
marble columns not only inspired the faithful but provided
astronomers with information about the Sun, the Earth and their
celestial relationships. By William J. Broad.

<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA (Undated) _ For most people with asthma, the proper
use of medication, education and self-management can go a long way
to keeping them out of the emergency room functioning at home,
school or work, experts say. But sadly, many patients with the
diseases fail to adhere to the regimen and many others simply do
not understand it. By Denise Grady. (1950 words)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-ASTHMA-RESEARCH (Undated) _ Despite the seemingly endless
rise in asthma cases, new treatments for the disease have been
noticeably slow in coming. Within the past two years, for example,
three new drugs have been released to treat migraines, with another
due in the spring. But for asthma, which accounts for more
pediatric hospitalizations each year than any other illness, only
two significant drugs were approved in the same time period,
Accolate by Astra-Zeneca and Singulair from Merck. By David J.
Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BLACK-HOLES (Undated) _ A new calculation suggests that
dense star clusters, which are sprinkled throughout galaxies in
Earth's cosmic neighborhood, act as assembly lines for tightly
orbiting pairs of black holes and then spit them out of the
cluster. There, they eventually fall together and merge into one.
Next year, if all goes well, scientists will be able to take the
first steps toward testing that theory with a new $350 million
instrument called a gravity wave observatory. By James Glanz.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MAMMARIES (Undated) _ According to the commonly accepted
``one-half rule,'' the average number of young in a litter is one
half the typical number of mammaries and the maximum litter size is
equal to the total number of mammaries. But studies of naked mole
rats defy that rule, in part, scientists suspect, because of the
docile behavior of the offspring and the protected environment in
which mole rats raise their young. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LEOPOLD-CONSERVATION (New York) _ In the field of
conservation, Aldo Leopold is a titan. His ``Sand County Almanac''
is a bible of the environmental movement every bit as much as
Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring.'' In Washington, where national
conservation policy has been going through major changes of
philosophy in recent years, his name and ideas are everyday
currency. So it is that in this 50th anniversary year of the book,
which has sold more than 1.5 million copies and is still going
strong, Leopold's ideas are being scrutinized afresh. A recent
conference was convened here by the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences,
Arts and Letters to examine his legacy and its relevance for the
future. By William K. Stevens.

   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ News and notes on science: Items on
plastics made from plants, pheromones in frogs and a spider's sun
compass. By Henry Fountain.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Since the mid-1980s, the yearly
total of Americans given diagnoses of brain tumors has doubled, and
it is expected to exceed 100,000 this year. More than half the
increase has occurred in people over 65. Survival rates, too, have
been inching upward, thanks to improved diagnostic techniques and
more precise and inventive methods of treatment, like stereotactic
radiosurgery (a pinpoint form of radiation) and laser surgery with
a gamma knife. Further progress is expected to result from some
still experimental treatments, including immunotherapy, gene
therapy and wafers of chemotherapeutic agents implanted in the
tumor site. By Jane E. Brody.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-MORNING-AFTER (Undated) _ Frustrated by the continued
spread of HIV, a growing number of AIDS doctors are trying out a
kind of morning-after treatment: an experimental application of
drugs meant to abort infection in a person who was recently exposed
to the virus through unsafe sex. By David France.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-IRONMAN (Undated) _ How grownups with real jobs make the
time to train for physical endurance tests like the Ironman World
Championships in Hawaii. By Jill Agostino.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Giants have had two things
going for them this year _ the Mets and the Yankees.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monday they found one more _ the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the baseball playoffs, fans in New York have been
blessedly preoccupied. And thanks to the Cowboys, the Giants pulled
back to .500 with a 13-10 victory while nobody was looking.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who were one of the few undefeated teams in the
league only two weeks ago, have suffered back-to-back losses to
division opponents and find themselves with a 3-2 mark, trailing
the 4-1 Washington Redskins in the race for the NFC East title. The
two will battle it out Sunday at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised in our inefficiency, regardless of what area,''
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``Obviously, to have the
outing we had is disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another pitiful offense that caught the Cowboys
unprepared, needing only a few seconds and a couple of big plays to
hand Dallas another crushing blow. Like the Eagles last week, the
Giants had scored only a handful of offensive touchdowns all
season. But they used a final drive to win the game, haunting the
Cowboys with the exact same final score.
</P>
<P>
   It was all Tiki Barber. The Giants running back went 85 yards
untouched down the left sideline on a punt return for a New York
touchdown with 7:50 remaining in the game. That put the Giants
(3-3) on top 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the Cowboys answered, mounting their first
touchdown drive in six quarters. Beginning at the Dallas 32, Aikman
hit Ernie Mills with a 36-yard pass, then came back with a
16-yarder to Rocket Ismail. Five plays later, Emmitt Smith ran four
yards up the middle into the end zone to tie the game at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas left 1:57 on the clock, however, and the Giants didn't
want to go to overtime. On second-and-10, Barber caught a short
pass, scurried outside and made three defenders miss as he ran 56
yards to the Cowboys' three-yard line. Brad Daluiso kicked a
21-yard field goal with one second remaining to give the Giants the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a play we've been practicing, and we've come close,''
Barker said of his punt return. ``Everybody made their blocks, and
I danced into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber finished the night with 233 all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came through in every facet I was out there for,'' he said.
``Things are clicking well for me. It was a big game, and I had to
make some plays. (The defensive players) were disappointed in us
(offensive players) a little a bit, but we've been pulling
together. It pays off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys left Giants fans aghast for a few seconds at the end
when Deion Sanders fielded the final kickoff, and the Cowboys took
it into the Giants end zone with a pair of laterals. The lateral by
Sanders was correctly ruled an illegal forward pass, however, and
the game ended without the score counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I told this team, we can lose a lot of things, but we can
never lose our faith,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said. ``If we lose
our faith, we're done. This team no matter what was going on, no
matter what was happening in the game, we were out to win this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive week, the Dallas defense played well
for most of the game while the offense floundered.
</P>
<P>
   With Michael Irvin on the sideline because of swelling in his
spinal cord, the Giants made their defensive strategy obvious. They
were out to contain Smith, forcing Aikman to test his second-string
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't just contain Smith _ they stopped him cold. Smith
needed only 25 yards to hit the 13,000 milestone. He made that on
his final carry, the four-yard touchdown run. Smith finished with
26 yards on 22 attempts, by far his worst game in a season that has
already netted him three 100-yard performances.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, Smith had managed only 10 yards on seven carries,
an average of 1.4 yards per attempt. That average dropped to less
than one yard per rush at one point in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were throwing eight and nine up there quite a bit, almost
every down,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``We were checking
out of some runs because of the eight- and nine-man fronts and were
trying to throw the football and didn't have as much success as we
needed to. That's something we have to address.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had a grand total of eight rushing yards at the end
of three quarters. They finished with 24 net rushing yards on 25
rushing plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played extremely well to hold them to 24 yards on the
ground,'' Fassel said. ``I knew they'd try to run on us. That was a
great effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys finished with 274 yards total offense while holding
the Giants to 228. They had another turnover in the red zone, their
third in two games, this one an interception off the hands of
receiver Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas kicker Richie Cunningham added to the inefficiency by
missing two field goals. His 48-yard attempt into the wind in the
first quarter was short, and a 42-yard try hit the right upright at
the end of the third.

USC PRESIDENT TO APPROVE NEW ARENA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC president Steven B. Sample is expected to
announce this week that he is formally approving the construction
of a basketball arena to be located across the street from the
campus, according to university sources.
</P>
<P>
   The approximately 12,000-seat arena will be built on what is
currently a parking lot on the corner of Figueroa Street and
Jefferson Boulevard, adjacent to the Harbor Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   A press conference is scheduled Thursday at USC. The
announcement is significant because it is the first time Sample has
publicly signed off on the project, and naming a location will aid
USC's continuing efforts to raise funds for the structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once there is a public statement, there is no turning back,''
said an administrator close to the project. ``When the president
gets up and says it's going to happen, you're in pretty good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample is out of town and was unavailable for comment Monday,
according to a spokesperson. But Sample told the Daily News last
summer that his dedication toward the arena project is solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I been actively engaged? The answer is yes,'' Sample
said. ``Will I be actively engaged in the next couple of years? The
answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact Sample is allowing himself to be officially tied
to an athletic project is significant. He has said that athletic
director Mike Garrett is responsible for raising the money for an
arena, and usually distanced himself from athletic department
business.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is also far more concrete than last February's
decision that USC's board of trustees would allow the athletic
department to try and independently raise funds for an arena.
</P>
<P>
   The arena is expected to cost between $55-75 million. USC has
raised at least $12 million, and according to sources is courting a
member of the board of trustees for a donation between $25-50
million. The university is also in talks with GTE and other
companies about naming rights for the project.
</P>
<P>
   USC is hopeful that it can begin breaking ground on the project
within one year. An optimistic estimate would have the arena
opening early in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But several university administrators say the arena will
probably require several years of fund-raising, with a more likely
completion in 2004 or 2005.
</P>
<P>
   As of today, the project remains in its infancy. There are no
formal plans or architectural designs for the arena, although
Garrett visited the University of Wisconsin two weeks ago to
inspect its basketball facility.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett could not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   USC envisions the arena as a ``campus events center'' that can
also host concerts and NCAA playoffs such as basketball regionals.
The university also hopes to attract event spillover from the
just-opened Staples Center, which is also located on Figueroa and
visible from the proposed site of the on-campus arena.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ This time they couldn't blame the hangover
effect from a frightening injury to Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   This time they couldn't point their fingers at the rude, crude
and callous fans from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   This time they had better not try to peddle the line about
parity making every game a challenge in today's NFL.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the Cowboys, all by themselves, who were
responsible for the Monday night debacle. Bad offense. Bad defense.
Bad special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's bad, bad news for the bunch that just a couple of weeks
ago was starting to fantasize about the days gone by when they
cruised down the road to Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   With a few more performances like this, the only flashbacks the
Cowboys will be having is to two seasons ago when Barry Switzer's
final year at the helm ended in a 6-10 record and the door being
held open.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the Cowboys are cuddled into second place, looking up
at the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   This one played out to a 13-10 victory by the New York Giants
when Brad Daluiso booted a 21-yard field goal with one second left
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring stuff if you're the Giants, who offensively have a
difficult time getting out of their own way.
</P>
<P>
   Wretched stuff if you're the Cowboys, who in every facet of the
game are having a difficult time looking like they know what
they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it came to putting a hand on Tiki Barber.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that if defensive end Greg Ellis doesn't score a
touchdown, then the Cowboys simply can't score enough points.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith did add to his career-record total of rushing
touchdowns with a two-yard run late in the fourth quarter.
Unfortunately, that piece of real estate was one of the largest
acquired by Smith all night. Emmitt ran with the ball 22 times and
gained only 26 yards. It was that kind of game, even with the
regular starting offensive line healthy and back together for the
first time since the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of game in which Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman
played most of the first 3{ quarters as if he were wearing
handcuffs and the kind of game in which the offensive genius, head
coach Chan Gailey, seemed to be the one hiding the keys.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the night, the Cowboys were just to the right of Pat
Buchanan in terms of being conservative.
</P>
<P>
   Without Irvin, who stood on the sidelines wearing a neck brace,
the Cowboys never really tried to stretch the offense and go down
the field. They dabbled with Rocket Ismail, Ernie Mills, Jason
Tucker and Wane McGarity. But they never really made the Giants
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys turned the ball over once in the second quarter
after reaching the Giants' 14 when Aikman's pass bounced off
McGarity's hands and was intercepted by New York's Sam Garnes.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had a 38-yard field-goal try into the wind come up
way, way short and another from 42 yards out bounce off the right
upright.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys could point to this one play or that one play. But
the two plays that did them in were the pair of times Barber
sprinted right down their throats.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, it was Dallas' Deion Sanders who stuck it to the
Giants with a pair of big punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was the No. 21 in the other uniform _ Barber _ who
gathered in Toby Gowin's 51-yard punt at his own 15 midway through
the fourth quarter and went on the run of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Barber split a couple of would-be tacklers early and headed to
the left sideline. He outran Dexter Coakley, and then he beat Gowin
to the outside and left Singor Mobley grasping at air. He went 85
yards, the second-longest punt return for a TD in Giants history
and the first returned for a score against the Cowboys since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman finally got the offense to roar to life briefly on a
seven-play drive that took just over two minutes and tied the score
at 10 thanks to Smith's run. But it did not stay tied for long.
</P>
<P>
   These were the woefully inoffensive Giants, who used their
so-called ``hurry-up'' offense to move 80 yards in just under a
week for a field goal in the first half. Now, with the game on the
line, they had to go 81 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was so easy for the Giants when Kent Graham hit Barber going
over the middle on a crossing route. Barber got to the outside on
the right _ dodging Kevin Smith, Mobley and Randall Godfrey _ and
ran all the way to the Dallas three.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Daluiso. That set up the Giants. They dealt the
Cowboys a 21-yard kick in the teeth at the end of a miserable night
and a kick in the pants that they'll still be feeling Sunday when
the Redskins come to town.

BOSTON'S TORTURED SOUL LEFT TO GRIEVE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VESCEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After 81 years of suffering, what difference did it
make that the Red Sox died a slow death on their final outing this
October?
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed the news, Game 5 of the American League
Championship Series did indeed come to a end Monday night, even if
each inning had to be measured in dog years.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the heart-stopping bottom of the eighth,
when the Sox finally came back to life and put a deep scare into
the charmed and talented Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek opened eyes by smacking a solo homer to
start the inning. Nomar Garciaparra followed with a double, chasing
starting pitcher Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   And before Trot Nixon popped out in foul territory to crush the
rally and end the inning, the Sox had loaded the bases, forced the
Yankees to run through four relievers for four batters, and best of
all, sent the wonderful Pedro Martinez running across the outfield
to the Boston bullpen, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   You had to see the look on the faces of the Yankees fielders as
they watched Martinez sprint across the grass. There was no doubt
that if the Sox could just tie the game up, another round of
Martinez magic could be in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   This is Martinez's ballpark. This is his town. This is his year,
for goodness sakes, and for a strange moment you almost felt like
any of the Sox fans still left at Fenway that maybe, just maybe,
the season would not end yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him head out there, I thought we could give him an
opportunity to come into the game,'' John Valentin said later about
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would have been something special, because if he went
in, it would have meant we had the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But then it was over, Boston's collective baseball soul left to
sift through the embers of this postseason, after Yankees catcher
Jorge Posada torched a two-run homer in the top of the ninth to
finish it, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a bad omen, bringing out Babe Ruth's daughter to
toss the ceremonial first pitch for Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   With the Red Sox desperate for a win to stay alive in this
series, why risk exposing the raw nerve of the Babe's
angst-provoking place in Red Sox history, even if Julia Ruth
Stevens, 82, said all the right things for the Beantown believers?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's daughter came to Fenway and declared her allegience to
the Sox. Her reasons were simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they deserve a break. They do. They've had a lot of
tough breaks,'' she said. ``And the umpires certainly haven't made
it any easier for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, though, those vilified umpires managed to stay out
of the news, and the Sox went down and out anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sox exposed their greatest flaw. They were the
third-worst fielding team in the American League this season and
their nine errors in this ALCS set a record.
</P>
<P>
   But something else was achieved. Something Red Sox fans have
been waiting too long to feel, which is that this club has moved
past its own fabled history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the `Curse.' I'm from L.A.,'' Garciaparra
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose to a better team. We just didn't play good
enough to win. Am I upset? No, I'm not. Am I disappointed? Yes. We
were a bunch of professionals out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is the new blood of these Sox. He is their only true
talent and superstar, along with Martinez. His attitude helped
drive this team to exceed everyone's expectations, except their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to be proud of,'' said Valentin, the Red Sox
veteran who knows the culture of this town and this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good year. And then we were down 0-2 against
Cleveland and we swept them. That was a really big turning point
for this organization, for the players and for the fans. I think
fans believe a little bit more now. And if this team stays together
or adds a few more pieces, we can take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot about the Yankees in these next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-time world champs are scooting off to the World Series
despite some anemic batting averages and the comedic
unpredictability of Chuck Knoblauch's ``work'' at second base.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is fodder for another day. For now, let's laud the
Sox. For their heart. For their spunk. For their jousting at
windmills like the Yankees, the umpires and the Curse of the
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   And from now on, the citizens of Red Sox Nation should give
themselves a break. They were dinged by some lousy calls by the
umpires during this series _ a legacy that might prompt offseason
discussions about how to better train umps and make them more
accountable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I work in a restaurant in a management
position, and I typically work 10 hours or more a day, 6 days a
week. In addition to my management responsibilities, I cover other
positions, and I am helping the new sales manager. My biggest
problem is that my boss is always on my case when something goes
wrong, and he never seems to see that I do so much for the company.
Should I quit? J.C. &QL; 
A. When you report to a boss in a restaurant who only knows how to
dish out criticism but never serves a compliment, you have other
choices besides quitting. You can always quit, but if you enjoy
many aspects of the job, you should see if there is a way to get
things to work here first.
</P>
<P>
   Since the key source of your job dissatisfaction is the working
relationship with your boss, you should meet with him. Tell him
that you want to bring him up to date on a number of key
developments in the restaurant. Within this framework, give him a
clear idea of the broad range of responsibilities that you are
handling, and let him see the measurable value that results from
your individual effort. You should also tell him that you
understand the need for negative feedback when due, but you would
appreciate more constructive feedback and guidance in such
situations, along with some credit and recognition when merited by
your performance.
</P>
<P>
   If he continues to offer nothing but negative feedback, and if
this is deeply undercutting your job satisfaction, then it may
indeed be time to fold up the menu and move on to a more palatable
offering elsewhere. &QL; 
Q. One of my employees has gotten very lazy lately, to the point
that his work is not completed on time and the quality is slipping.
This is a far cry from how he used to be. Is there a good way to
handle this? D.J. &QL; 
A. When an employee has been a solid performer, but then goes into
a tailspin, you need to take action as quickly as possible.
Although his decreased performance is your immediate concern, it is
not the real problem. Rather, the decline in his performance is a
symptom, and you need to try to figure out the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down with this employee and let him know that you are
concerned about him and would like to help. You can go over his
performance to date, and even compare it to his performance on
similar projects in the past. Ask him if there is anything you can
do to help, and then just listen.
</P>
<P>
   The slippage in his performance can be due to any number of
factors, such as boredom, problems with co-workers, health
problems, family problems or substance abuse. This means that you
will need to tailor your response to whatever you learn from him.
For example, there may be a need to restructure some of his job, or
perhaps the problem is more serious and you will need to consider
referring him to human resources, an employee assistance program or
other outside help.
</P>
<P>
   Your employee's behavior can be viewed as a cry for help, and,
as an effective manager, you are answering it. &QL; 
Q. My manager gave me my performance review in an airport lounge,
in front of everybody, and I felt like a complete fool. When I told
him later that I did not like being evaluated in front of an
audience, his reaction was that they are all strangers, so what
difference does it make. I am still very upset. What do you think?
N.A. &QL; 
A. By definition, a performance evaluation is a private session;
and by definition, a manager who gives one in an airport lounge in
front of everyone should be grounded. The evaluation is a time to
discuss past performance, share expectations and jointly establish
some goals. It does not work in front of a live audience.
</P>
<P>
   Your manager displayed a lack of insight, understanding and
empathy, along with his own insecurities and need for power. He
brushed off the others in the airport, but he was actually playing
for them. This was his opportunity to show all of them that he is
the boss, and he was not going to let that opportunity slip by.
</P>
<P>
   You already expressed your dissatisfaction to him about this
activity, but he ignored you. If he ever tries to pull you into
another one of these sessions, whether at an airport, ballpark or
circus, you should refuse. Tell him that you are interested in what
he has to say, but only if it is in private. Just because he wants
to play emcee does not mean that you have to play contestant.

<P>
   After insisting that no scientific study had ever proved
depleted uranium (DU) shells could cause cancer in Iraq or Kosovo,
NATO has refused to cooperate with a United Nations team
investigating the use of the munitions in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Pekka Haavisto, chairman of the U.N.'s Balkan environment task
force, says NATO refused to cooperate with his team and that
``immediate action is necessary to obtain information from NATO
confirming if, how and where, DU was used during the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no ``if'' about it. NATO admitted in answer
to a question from The Independent in May that U.S. A-10 aircraft
had used DU shells _ designed to penetrate thick armor _ against
Serb targets, a statement the U.S. Department of Defense later
repeated.
</P>
<P>
   A NATO spokesman claimed _ inaccurately _ that a Rand
Corporation study had proved DU munitions caused no harm.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tons of DU were used in the 1991 Gulf War. In the
years that followed, there was an epidemic of cancers among Iraqis
living near the battlefields _ many of whom showed symptoms
identical or similar to those of thousands of Allied veterans now
suffering from Gulf War syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists fear similar contamination has taken place in
ex-Yugoslavia. Yet when last month NATO was asked for the locations
in Kosovo where DU was used, a spokesman said the information was
``not releasable.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N., it now turns out, got the same runaround. ``NATO
always replied to our letters,'' an official in Haavisto's office
told me. ``But they never gave the answers we were expecting. They
were never able to release the information. They said it was
`security.'''
</P>
<P>
   Inquiries by The Independent have established that NATO knows
perfectly well, from munitions and pilots' reports, target areas
against which DU weapons were used. They include districts close to
Djakovica, Mitrovica, Pristina, Urahovac and in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   In private, NATO officers have been telling humanitarian
officials in Kosovo to stay away from any area where DU was used _
while still refusing to state where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Haavisto's report recommends ``a thorough review of the effects
on health of medium and long-term exposure to DU'' by the World
Health Organization. Yet two years ago the Iraqis asked the WHO for
just such a report. It was never produced.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.N. says _ in its DU report _ that ``during and
immediately after any attack where depleted uranium was used, some
people in the immediate vicinity may have been heavily exposed to
depleted uranium by inhalation.''
</P>
<P>
   Special health examinations are necessary, the U.N. says, adding
that the possible contamination of land need not prevent refugees
from returning to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   But ``hot spot'' target areas must be identified as soon as
possible and arrangements made ``for the secure storage of any
contaminated material.''
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, cannot be done _ because NATO is keeping the
information secret. &QL;

BOSTON'S TORTURED SOUL LEFT TO GRIEVE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for previous to restores dropped copy at end; other

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VESCEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After 81 years of suffering, what difference did it
make that the Red Sox died a slow death on their final outing this
October?
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed the news, Game 5 of the American League
Championship Series did indeed come to a end Monday night, even if
each inning had to be measured in dog years.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the heart-stopping bottom of the eighth,
when the Sox finally came back to life and put a deep scare into
the charmed and talented Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek opened eyes by smacking a solo homer to
start the inning. Nomar Garciaparra followed with a double, chasing
starting pitcher Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   And before Trot Nixon popped out in foul territory to crush the
rally and end the inning, the Sox had loaded the bases, forced the
Yankees to run through four relievers, and best of all, sent the
wonderful Pedro Martinez running across the outfield to the Boston
bullpen, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   You had to see the look on the faces of the Yankees fielders as
they watched Martinez sprint across the grass. There was no doubt
that if the Sox could just tie the game up, another round of
Martinez magic could be in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   This is Martinez's ballpark. This is his town. This is his year,
and for a strange moment you almost felt that maybe, just maybe,
the season would not end yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him head out there, I thought we could give him an
opportunity to come into the game,'' John Valentin said later about
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would have been something special, because if he went
in, it would have meant we had the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   But then it was over, Boston's collective baseball soul left to
sift through the embers of this postseason, after Yankees catcher
Jorge Posada torched a two-run homer in the top of the ninth to
finish it, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a bad omen, bringing out Babe Ruth's daughter to
toss the ceremonial first pitch Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Red Sox desperate for a win to stay alive in this
series, why risk exposing the raw nerve of the Babe's
angst-provoking place in Red Sox history, even if Julia Ruth
Stevens, 82, said all the right things for the Beantown believers?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's daughter came to Fenway and declared her allegience to
the Sox. Her reasons were simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they deserve a break. They do. They've had a lot of
tough breaks,'' she said. ``And the umpires certainly haven't made
it any easier for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, though, those vilified umpires managed to stay out of
the news, and the Sox went down and out anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sox exposed their greatest flaw. They were the
third-worst fielding team in the American League this season and
their nine errors in this ALCS set a record.
</P>
<P>
   But something else was achieved. Something Red Sox fans have
been waiting too long to feel, which is that this club has moved
past its own fabled history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about the `Curse.' I'm from L.A.,'' Garciaparra
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lose to a better team. We just didn't play good
enough to win. Am I upset? No, I'm not. Am I disappointed? Yes. We
were a bunch of professionals out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is the new blood of these Sox. He is their only true
talent and superstar, along with Martinez. ``It was a good year,''
Valentin said. ``And then we were down 0-2 against Cleveland and we
swept them. That was a really big turning point for this
organization, for the players and for the fans. I think fans
believe a little bit more now. And if this team stays together or
adds a few more pieces, we can take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot about the Yankees in these next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-time world champs are scooting off to the World Series
despite some anemic batting averages and the comedic
unpredictability of Chuck Knoblauch's ``work'' at second base.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is fodder for another day. For now, let's laud the
Sox. For their heart. For their spunk. For their jousting at
windmills like the Yankees, the umpires and the Curse of the
Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   And from now on, the citizens of Red Sox Nation should give
themselves a break. They were dinged by some lousy calls by the
umpires during this series.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was not the calls but their own shortcomings
that overwhelmed them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe in Boston they'll see this final ALCS of the century as
another year in which the luckless Sox did not go to a World
Series. But that would be wrong. That would be a waste since the
team wants no part of that history anymore.

   Julius Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, died after he had
voluntarily left office, still respected by his people. To this
extent alone, he set himself apart from many of his fellows in that
small club of African men who guided their countries to
independence.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast Kwame Nkrumah, the first to break from Britain's
colonial grip when the Gold Coast became Ghana in 1957, was
transformed during his reign from a charming and popular natural
leader to a diabolic force who built statues to himself, undermined
the judiciary, and left his opponents to rot in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Nkrumah path has been more frequently travelled by
African leaders than Nyerere's.
</P>
<P>
   Mobutu, Bokassa, Banda, Amin, and many others, all used their
office to fatten their foreign bank accounts and further their
megalomaniac ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Their ideology _ usually an ill-defined and sentimental
nationalism _ was the thinnest of disguises for crude kleptocracy.
Much wickedness progressed under the guise of the ``African way''
of running things.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, too, tried to find an African way forward for Tanzania.
He thought the continent was a natural home of socialism, that
sharing and cooperation were the norm for pre-colonial African
society, and that post-colonial leaders would be able to resurrect
this heritage with ease.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to organize Tanzania into a system of collective
villages. But the peasants, as they had done before, worked for
themselves, and only pretended to work on communal plots. The
economy stagnated, and corruption was endemic.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the villages was a hard lesson. But there was one
legacy of Nyerere's ``ujamaa'' socialism that blesses Tanzania to
this day: it defused the country's ethnic rivalries _ divisions
that blight every country on the continent, providing so often a
pretext for ambitious men to grab power.
</P>
<P>
   Other nations _ Nigeria, Angola _ have only themselves to blame
for their poverty. They have the resources, but abuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Tanzania has precious few resources. But at least the only war
it has fought in recent times was to enter Uganda and remove the
appalling Idi Amin from power.
</P>
<P>
   A leader can make a difference. There are very few in Africa who
have made a difference for the better _ Nelson Mandela is the
outstanding example. Perhaps Nyerere should also belong to this
too-small club. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When Willie Brown first contemplated running for
mayor of San Francisco, he wasn't sure the job could hold his
interest. ``Street lights, dog-doo and parking meters are not my
cup of tea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried. Four years into the job, and with a
monumental reelection battle in progress, he can safely say his
life is anything but boring.
</P>
<P>
   He has officiated at mass gay weddings, appointed the Beat
figurehead Lawrence Ferlinghetti as his very own Poet Laureate,
although Ferlinghetti is yet to oblige with a single poem, and has
been on the receiving end of three cream pies thrown by an
agit-prop group called the Bionic Baking Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   On the 50th birthday of his campaign manager, Jack Davis, he and
the cream of San Francisco society were treated to a startling
sadomasochistic sex show in which two performers lacerated each
others' backs, performed Satanic rituals and put a Jack Daniels
bottle to unspeakable uses.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of boredom has not made Brown popular, however. Lambasted
for his harsh treatment of the homeless population and his
painfully slow progress in fixing the bus system, his would-be
successors are now sharpening their knives over everything from his
choice of district attorney _ who has the worst conviction record
in the city's history and likes to throw punches, even in court _
to his uncanny knack of making friends with construction magnates
grown rich on city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   With election day under a month away, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation is crawling all over city offices to investigate
allegations that contracts earmarked for companies run by ethnic
minorities are going to shell organizations acting as fronts for
powerful white friends of the man winkingly known as ``Da Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is throwing every ounce of his considerable energy into a
grand theatrical campaign. Determined not to appear defensive, he
has organized groups of hecklers to drown out his rivals at mayoral
debates.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to pick up every last vote, his reelection committee has
been trawling through every old age home and housing project to
register poor and minority voters who can be talked into supporting
him, if only because he is black.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, they have even been visiting county
jails to register eligible inmates.
</P>
<P>
   If the political battles in San Francisco seem theatrical, then
they are complemented perfectly by the goings-on across the bay in
Oakland, where another famous Brown _ former California governor
Jerry Brown _ is settling into his first term as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The eccentric radical, who briefly gave up politics to study at
Mother Teresa's knee, kicked off his term with a mass meditation
ceremony and has since invited everyone from the Black Panthers to
the U.S. Marine Corps to join his idiosyncratic campaign to revive
the gritty industrial city.
</P>
<P>
   The two Browns are having an electric effect on Bay Area
politics, since both have a sure talent for attracting attention
and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   When Willie, a famously suave dresser, was pied by the Bionic
Baking Brigade he stunned just about everyone by applying the full
pressure of the law against the perpetrators and having them
sentenced to six months behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry the pacifist invited the Marines into Oakland for
three days of noisy war games, he infuriated his city council. One
member said the only benefit to the local economy would be
increased custom for the city's prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   It guaranteed reams of local media coverage. How much either of
them is achieving in office is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry has already modified his pledge to provide 10,000 new
units of affordable housing in downtown Oakland _ dropping the
commitment to affordability.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone back on his pledge to community-based policing,
encouraging an orthodox tough-on-crime approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Hilliard, the former black radical who returned
enthusiastically to Oakland, saying that Jerry Brown sounded ``more
like a Black Panther every day,'' now says the mayor has sold the
African-American community down the river.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, a radical, now says: ``He's not a team
player. He is conscious of what he needs to do to be reelected and
focuses on meeting those political needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar in San Francisco, where Willie Brown failed
to fix Muni, the municipal transport system, in 100 days as he had
promised. He hasn't fixed it more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   And, faced with an unprecedented housing boom, he has torn down
far more low-income housing than he has created.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is a politician's politician, a man who survived more
than 15 years as Speaker of the California state assembly and
earned a national reputation as a deal-maker.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite abysmal approval ratings, he has engineered an
electoral landscape in which the other candidates are even less
popular.
</P>
<P>
   One challenger, the former police chief Frank Jordan, has made
almost no headway in obliterating the lukewarm memories of his
tenure as mayor in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's career blew up in his face on the eve of the 1995
election when, incredibly, two radio shock jocks from Los Angeles
managed to talk their way into his house and persuaded him to climb
into the shower with them for an all-naked interview.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan evidently thought the interview would increase his appeal
with young voters, but when pictures of the occasion made the local
papers he became the laughingstock of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's other challenger, Clint Reilly, is a political
consultant with strong links to the property and insurance worlds _
links that have made it impossible for him to attack Brown for his
own considerable deference to ``special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie will win because he's smarter than everyone else,''
remarked Jo Schuman Silver, a theatrical impresario well connected
to the Brown camp.
</P>
<P>
   And so, San Francisco can look forward to another four yearsof
Willie. It won't be scintillating politics, perhaps, but it is sure
to be great theatre. &QL;

<P>
   MOSCOW _ The clash at the paper mill has only confirmed that
nearly a decade after the collapse of communism, capitalist Russia
remains a wild environment for foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries Western merchants have come to Russia, hoping to
tap its enormous potential, only to go away again bewildered by
this country, which is neither truly European nor fully Asian but a
maddening law unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Alcem, the British company, now risks losing its investment. But
some Western businessmen have come to Russia and lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The most shocking case was probably that of the American
entrepreneur Paul Tatum, who had a joint stake in the
Radisson-Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to turn what had been a dreary Intourist hotel into an
establishment fit to receive U.S. President Bill Clinton when he
visited Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners tried to sideline him. He was in the
process of fighting them in court. They used other methods to end
the argument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was shot dead in an underpass near the Kiev railway
station. He was accompanied by two bodyguards, both of whom
survived, leaving him alone in a pool of his own blood.
</P>
<P>
   Tatum had come to Russia at a time when foreigners were allowed
to have a partial involvement in business here.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Bolshevik Revolution, there were many foreign firms,
for example the Scottish department store Muir and Mirrielees,
which was to Moscow what Selfridges is to London or Jenners to
Edinburgh. But after 1917, everything was nationalized and
collectivized.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his perestroika reforms, Russian President Mikhail
Gorbachev allowed ``joint ventures,'' in which foreigners could
have a maximum of 49 percent but the controlling share remained
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Only under President Boris Yeltsin, who took market reforms
further, were foreigners able to buy the factories, like the pulp
and paper mill, that had failed under communism.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are some success stories, such as that of Inchcape
which, to everyone's satisfaction, has built a profitable bottling
plant for Coca-Cola in the Urals, or Procter and Gamble, which
dominates the market in hygiene products.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's economic crisis frightened many foreigners away but
business analysts say that Russia remains a land of opportunity for
those who are prepared to be patient and take the long-term
approach.
</P>
<P>
   However, many have fallen by the wayside before they could enjoy
the fruits of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The British have always been cautious here, more so than the
Americans or the Germans. There was a time when, out of all
proportion to the size of their country, the Irish were active in
Moscow. But many of them have gone quietly, not waiting, as Paul
Tatum did, for things to turn nasty.
</P>
<P>
   There was a man called Colm Fitzsimmons, who managed a corner
shop called the ``Garden Ring Irish Supermarket.'' His imported
groceries were outrageously expensive but he pulled in crowds of
customers with his personal charm.
</P>
<P>
   He gave to charity, he sponsored the arts. He sponsored the
first ever performance in Moscow of Handel's ``Messiah,'' with an
expatriate choir and a Russian orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Then his Russian partners took over the store. The price of the
groceries went up even further while the service became sullen and
Soviet-like. The customers deserted it in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually it closed and now on the site, somebody else is
trying to make a go of a shop selling sports clothes. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ Walter and I have seen many strange things from our
balcony on the Beirut seafront.
</P>
<P>
   There was the prospect that the famous Avenue de Paris would be
renamed Boulevard du President Hafez el-Assad. They gave the name
instead to a highway near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Israeli naval vessel that often cruised the
waters opposite us. Walter, the family cat, would watch the Hetz
class gunboat with deep concern.
</P>
<P>
   But now we have a Greek goddess just down the road, holding
aloft a symbolic and eternal burning lamp _ to the fury of the
gentlemen who pray in the mosque opposite.
</P>
<P>
   The Goddess is temporary, of course, part of an exhibition by
the Lebanese Association for Plastic Arts whose designs of giant,
floodlit red-painted feet above the rocks and display of white rock
salt have been puzzling, irritating or delighting the thousands of
Lebanese who nightly throng the Corniche.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a collection of black-sided cabins backing onto the
sea in which Beirutis can enjoy ``personal space'' while imagining
that they have their own one-man or one-woman apartment on the
shore. But the Goddess is the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Beirut is being billed as the ``Cultural Capital of the Middle
East,'' a title that became a little frayed when a local judge this
month tried to take Marcel Khalifeh _ one of Beirut's most loved
singers _ to court for defaming Islam in a harmless song based on a
Mahmoud Darwish poem.
</P>
<P>
   And after morning prayers at the Ein el-Mreisse mosque last
Friday, the congregation _ Sufis for the most part, it seems _
showed that they too had different views on the ``cultural''
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Their first target was the twirling pile of rock salt surrounded
by tiles which carried a verse saying: ``We come from Infinity. We
live in Infinity. We will go back to Infinity. We are the
embodiment of Infinity.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, even trite, as the legend may be _ and it was hardly a
pillar of salt _ the lads from the mosque were not amused. Only God
could define the infinite, they complained. Then they saw the
Goddess.
</P>
<P>
   Fully clothed she may be, plain-faced even, her burning lamp a
hollow replica, a cheap, golden-painted ready-made statue put up by
a local architect called Tony Chakar.
</P>
<P>
   Even her title _ ``A Retroactive Monument for a Chimerical
City'' was pretty tame; seductive, brash and often wounded Beirut
may be, but hardly visionary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the goddess stood on a red carpet, beside red-swathed
benches, almost opposite the old mosque. She was golden, a graven
image. She was ``a voluptuary,'' they decided. Worse still _ and I
suspect this was the heart of the matter _ she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The worshippers were scandalized because _ in the imperishable
words of one of the faithful _ ``even if these things are not
directly opposite our mosque, they can be seen by believers going
to pray.''
</P>
<P>
   So they descended on our local ``mukhtar,'' Sami Siblini _ the
shop-keeper-cum-regional mayor who signs my residency papers _ and
threatened to destroy the exhibition; some of his customers even
thought they might destroy Sami's shop.
</P>
<P>
   How could he have allowed such sacrilege? There was talk of
putting a police guard _ night and day _ on the hollow goddess and
the pile of salt.
</P>
<P>
   There were suggestions that perhaps the whole shooting-match
should be dismantled and erected up in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But as usual, there was a Lebanese compromise. The tiles around
the salt were wiped clean of their quotations _ so much for
infinity _ and the Goddess, along with her red carpet, was tugged a
hundred meters down the seafront where she now stands opposite the
Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   It only brought more Lebanese down to the Corniche to see the
blood-red feet and the black-sided cubicles, the salt and the
Goddess.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how Beirut seems all things to all men. On the
Corniche, the city now feels like a test-bed, boasting a display
that is intended to mock the memory of the rich old Beirut of the
1960s but put ``in extremis'' by those who would prefer only the
art of Islamic architecture and illuminated Korans.
</P>
<P>
   Down in Kuwait, Ahmed al-Baghdadi, the head of the emirate
university's politics department who has been imprisoned for
``denigrating Islam'' in a 1996 article, began a hunger strike in
protest at his treatment, promising to go into exile to Beirut
because of its freedoms and because it was, yes, the Cultural
Capital of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   When, I asked myself, did al-Baghdadi last visit Beirut? But the
Lebanese and their guests never let you down.
</P>
<P>
   When I wandered the seafront this week, I was stopped by a
middle-aged man next to the golden goddess. ``What does it mean?''
he asked. It means, I replied hopefully, what you want it to mean.
He stared at me. ``Yes, but what does it mean?'' &QL;

CO-CHAIR OF BUSH'S CALIFORNIA CAMPAIGN TO TAKE STATE GOP POST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  State Sen. Jim Brulte, co-chair of George W. Bush's California
campaign, is expected to announce Tuesday that he is leaving the
post to take over as the financial chair of the troubled California
Republican Party.
<P>
   The Rancho Cucamonga Republican, who heads the state GOP caucus,
will assume the post with the support of Bush, who wants to make
sure California's weakened party does not hurt his efforts in the
state, GOP insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   Brulte, 43, will be in charge of raising an estimated $18
million for voter turnout and crucial legislative elections in
California in the coming year. But his success likely will affect
the political outcome for Bush, the GOP front-runner who has made
strong efforts to appeal to Latinos and the high-tech community in
California.
</P>
<P>
   California's GOP has faced financial and political troubles
lately. The party, still reeling from the landslide victory of Gov.
Gray Davis and the Democrats in November 1998, is $300,000 in the
red.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has been torn by infighting between the
ultraconservative right wing _ which wants to underscore
anti-abortion, pro-gun policies _ and the more moderate wing, which
has lobbied for a change in the platform to at least recognize a
pro-choice faction. The battles erupted in full at the state GOP
convention in Anaheim last month, where moderates in the California
Congress of Republicans held their own meetings in a separate
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared to distance himself from California's state party
by his absence at the convention. He later became a target for
criticism when he was filmed on television, attending the Ryder Cup
golf tournament instead.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP insiders said Brulte's move was discussed when Bush came
to California late last month. They said Bush supporters believed
that the state GOP needed a strong leader and fund-raiser who can
help prepare for the March primary and 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Brulte, who had no official comment on the matter Monday, is
considered a consensus-builder who has tried to broaden the party's
support in California.

 LIVERMORE WORKERS FIGHT PLAN FOR POLYGRAPH TESTS  &HT;     By JASON B. JOHNSON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have started a
letter-writing campaign urging Congress to halt an Energy
Department proposal requiring them to take polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to deluge elected officials with more than 4,000
letters from lab employees living in districts ranging from San
Jose to the Central Valley, and are urging scientists at other
national laboratories to do the same, workers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary controller of whether or not there will be
polygraph examinations will be Congress,'' said William O'Connell,
president of the Society of Professional Scientists and Engineers,
a labor group at the lab. ``We're hoping to influence Congress to
influence the Department of Energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The society's letter-writing campaign, which was begun earlier
this month, is singling out California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and
Barbara Boxer and members of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also urging people to write their state
representatives,'' O'Connell said.
</P>
<P>
   Several scientists and engineers at the Lawrence Livermore lab
have expressed outrage over a proposal by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson to administer lie-detector tests to thousands more lab
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the letter-writing drive, there is a campaign to
circulate petitions among Lawrence Livermore employees.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials have not given detailed information
about what questions they would ask, but they have said they would
center on whether an employee has passed on sensitive information
or been in contact with foreign citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash has spread to Capitol Hill, where late last month
Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Walnut Creek, called for a moratorium on the
polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations would authorize the use of polygraph
examinations for certain Energy Department employees, contract
workers and applicants for employment.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was made in response to charges that an employee at
the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico gave sensitive nuclear missile
technology to the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Garcia, a physicist who wrote the flyer urging employees
to write their elected officials, said he is not sure how many
employees will take part in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a big lobby; we're not a big union,'' Garcia said.
``We need a champion, and our champions are our politicians, our
elected representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The expanded polygraph testing could cover as many as 12,000 lab
workers nationwide. The flyer reminds employees that there is
strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cuts at a very deep core. I'm hoping the flyer gets
people involved,'' Garcia said. ``I sent a snowball rolling down a
hill. I hope it turns into an avalanche.''

 WHEN S.F. SAID `NO' TO FREEWAYS  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fight the chains? Some of us rise up to protest
the creeping invasion of the Starbucks and Home Depots, while
others embrace the collective beast you might call
Franchisenstein's monster.
</P>
<P>
   But once upon a time, this brave little city fought off the
biggest chain of 'em all _ the freeway system.
</P>
<P>
   It was 40 years ago that the San Francisco Supes voted to cancel
seven of 10 freeway routes planned by the state, including a
freeway that would have run across the Panhandle and through Golden
Gate Park.
</P>
<P>
   You could look it up in the Great San Francisco Fact and Trivia
Book. (Great book, but what could be trivial about San Francisco?)
</P>
<P>
   What courage! Remember, that was an era when to challenge a
freeway was to challenge God.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only God challenges a freeway, using earthquakes to shake
down the Embarcadero and the Central freeways because they created
bad feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, where are the supes of yore?'' wails my historical
consultant, Cecil Cesspoole. ``As opposed to the supes of bore.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Cesspooles are deep, but cynical.
</P>
<P>
   USED TO BE ``DYNASTY'': But now the 49ers, says John O'Brien,
are ``The Youngless and the Rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice turn of a phrase, sad turn of events. But smart thinking by
QB Steve, resting his Young head while the 49ers search for their
missing offensive line, and other clues.
</P>
<P>
   I won't say Young was getting sacked frequently, but defensive
linemen were calling out to him before the snap, ``Yo, Steve: Paper
or plastic?''
</P>
<P>
   KING ABDICATES, AGAIN: Once upon a time, Enrico Banducci was the
King of Comedy in North Beach. He owned the hungry i (and Enrico's)
and helped talented youngsters become Woody Allen, Bill Cosby,
Lenny Bruce, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Then Banducci split for the East Coast for a decade. But
recently he came back with plans to open a new nightspot and revive
the old Enrico aura and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, reports Ed Moose, after months of searching his soul and
his old 'hood, Bandooch decided the North Beach he knew was long
gone. So he grabbed his beret and walked away again, this time
probably off to St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   AT LEAST TONY hasn't deserted us. Tony Bennett first publicly
sang ``I Left My Heart in San Francisco'' in '62, in the Venetian
Room of the Fairmont Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, for those of us born before '62, that there was
once a time when that song wasn't on the rack inside our mental
jukeboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tony returns to the scene of the song today. He'll place a tape
of ``Heart'' and other relevant goodies in a time capsule to be
buried under the stage during the Venetian Room's renovation.
</P>
<P>
   If you say ``I Left My Heart'' is corny and schmaltzy, I say you
haven't been in San Francisco long enough. Or you've been here too
long.
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF great S.F. songs, let's not forget ``San Francisco
Bay Blues,'' written by Jesse ``Lone Cat'' Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller performed that wonderful song while playing a 12-string
guitar, a harmonica and a homemade bass instrument that he plucked
with the big toe of his right foot while he tap-danced with his
left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see Tony Bennett do  &UR; that. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DOGGIE NEWS: Yes, this is the second dog item in two days, so
it's clear where this column is going.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, police found a Forest Hill man living with 61
purebred Labrador retrievers. The house was an ecological disaster,
knee-deep in doo-doo, and many of the dogs had their vocal cords
severed.
</P>
<P>
   The cops took 59 of the dogs to shelters, leaving two Labs
behind, looking at each another and saying, ``How did  &UR; we  &LR; draw the
short straws?''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: All 59 of the impounded dogs have been adopted.
</P>
<P>
   If only we could do as well finding homes for homeless humans.
</P>
<P>
   AHHH, LOVE: Jimmy is romantically preoccupied these days and
pleads temporary insanity to explain the following:
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy has two cars, one a gorgeous red vintage Jag he drives
only occasionally. He took it for a spin, stopped at the market on
his way home, forgot about the Jag, and walked (on a cloud) the two
blocks back to his place, a song in his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, he went to drive the Jag but it wasn't in the
garage. Stunned, Jimmy called the cops, and the policewoman who
took the stolen-car report couldn't have been nicer or more
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Jimmy drove his other car to the market,
parked next to a red Jag, said to himself, ``Gee, that's a dirty
car.'' Then a double-take and: ``Hey, that's  &UR; my  &LR; car! The thieves
must be in the market!''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the mental fog lifted and Jimmy ran to a phone, called
the cops and apologized profusely.
</P>
<P>
   Then he bought a box of candy with a pretty bow, went to the
police station and approached the desk clerk. She looked at Jimmy,
looked at the candy, smiled and said, ``Red Jaguar!''

   As a century that brought Texas abundant riches from oil
development draws to a close, a disturbing legacy is emerging:
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of abandoned, unplugged and leaking wells litter the
state. If not properly lined with steel casing and plugged when
they are abandoned, each of these wells can leak salt water, crude
oil, natural gas or other toxic fluids into ground water or onto
the surface, state reports show. Even old wells plugged decades ago
are beginning to leak.
</P>
<P>
   The slow depletion of Texas oil fields has resulted in the
transfer of wells to small operators with suspect environmental
records and little money to seal the wells properly, state
officials say. Plus, the decline in oil prices last winter prompted
alarming numbers of operators to get out of the business, often
leaving behind open wells.
</P>
<P>
   The following stories by Russell Gold of the San Antonio
Express-News examine the challenges facing the Texas Railroad
Commission, the state regulator of the oil and gas industry,
landowners and the oil industry itself.

<P>
   OIL-CONTAMINATION (Sterling City, Texas) _ The Texas Railroad
Commission, the powerful state regulator of the oil and gas
industry, is struggling with the growing number of abandoned wells
that ranchers and water authority officials say are leaking,
turning fresh water supplies into brackish ponds. The agency, which
runs a program to plug the wells and stop the contamination, is
regularly running out of money for the work at a time when more and
more wells are being abandoned. By RUSSELL GOLD.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-LAX-REGULATIONS (San Antonio) _ With the oil industry in
Texas long past its glory days, producers from the Panhandle to the
Gulf of Mexico are folding and abandoning wells in growing numbers.
The Texas Legislature gave the oil regulators authority in 1983 to
plug the wells, but forcing companies to pay has proved extremely
difficult. The state's oil cleanup program spent $12.7 million in
1997 and was reimbursed $82,691 by operators, about 65 cents for
every $100 spent. By RUSSELL GOLD.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-POLITICS (Undated) _ The Texas Railroad Commission is the
agency that oversees the oil and gas industry. And it is the oil
and gas industry that often pumps huge sums of money into the
political campaigns of the elected members of the panel. Critics of
the system say that this is too cozy a relationship for
commissioners who are supposed to be regulators. By RUSSELL GOLD.
</P>
<P>
   OIL-SANTA-RITA (Texon, Texas) _ Santa Rita No. 1, the first well
to strike oil in West Texas, is such an esteemed piece of state
history that the original rig was moved to the University of Texas
at Austin for public display. But few ever see what was left behind
_ 7,000 acres of barren land turned chalk white by years of dumping
salt water, a byproduct of oil exploration. By RUSSELL GOLD.

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STERLING CITY, Texas _ Frank Price, an otherwise unflappable
West Texas rancher, is frightened.
</P>
<P>
   In this high and dry plain, Price uses fresh water from his
underground aquifer to raise cows, sheep and goats. One day in
1989, the cattle wouldn't drink water from one of the wells. They
licked at it and ambled away.
</P>
<P>
   Price took a sip and understood. Like a biblical curse, his
fresh water had suddenly turned salty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wake-up call,'' Price said as he drove a pickup truck
through the sparse land between San Angelo and Midland, where grass
disappears into parched, salt-covered ground. ``I was scared to
death then and I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is almost certainly the nearby oil field, according
to engineering studies. Price believes the wells, drilled beginning
in 1951, allowed briny water from the oil formation to ruin the
aquifer. He has struggled in vain to get state oil regulators to
take action.
</P>
<P>
   A second water well on his ranch turned salty last year, raising
concerns among those who depend on the aquifer that the area's
fresh water supply may be threatened.
</P>
<P>
   As a century that brought Texas abundant riches from oil
development draws to a close, a disturbing legacy is emerging:
Thousands of abandoned, unplugged and leaking wells litter the
state. If not properly lined with steel casing and plugged when
they are abandoned, each of these wells can leak salt water, crude
oil, natural gas or other toxic fluids into ground water or onto
the surface, state reports show. Even old wells plugged decades ago
_ with mud and sometimes tree trunks _ are beginning to leak.
</P>
<P>
   The slow depletion of Texas oil fields has resulted in the
massive transfer of wells to small operators with suspect
environmental records and little money to seal the wells properly,
state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in oil prices last winter prompted alarming numbers
of operators to get out of the business, often leaving behind open
wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC), the powerful state
regulator of the oil and gas industry, is struggling with the
growing number of abandoned wells. The agency runs a program to
plug the wells, but it is regularly running out of money for the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of how many hundreds of thousands of wells have
been drilled in this state and how much oil and gas and salt water
has been produced, you start to get an appreciation of the
magnitude of their problem,'' said Jeff Paine, an oil recovery
specialist at the Bureau of Economic Geology, part of the
University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   A TRC report to the Legislature in the late 1980s concluded:
``By today's standards the majority of wells that have been plugged
do not provide as much protection as is required now. We are
finding instances where wells that were properly plugged for their
time are becoming pollution sources.''
</P>
<P>
   The report foreshadowed today's problems, noting that any well
that has been abandoned ``could eventually become a pollution
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The TRC received 976 complaints from landowners of oil-field
pollution in 1998, according to a computer analysis of state
records.
</P>
<P>
   The agency verified ground water contamination in 77 cases last
year from oil wells and processing plants in 49 of the state's 254
counties. The largest contaminant was salt water, followed by crude
oil and hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
   That is only the tip of the problem. Since large-scale petroleum
exploration began soon after the 1886 discovery of oil near San
Antonio, between 700,000 and 1 million oil and gas wells have been
drilled in Texas. An unknown number are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 have been plugged, including 15,000 abandoned
wells, but older methods are proving inadequate and many need to be
resealed.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 25,000 wells are in immediate need of plugging, TRC
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As production drops, so does the money in the state's Oil Field
Cleanup Fund used to seal wells and clean abandoned sites. The
money comes from a 5/16-cent fee on each barrel of oil and a
1/30-cent fee on each 1,000 cubic feet of gas produced and drilling
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Plummeting production reduced revenues from the fees by $4
million in the fiscal year that ended in August. The fund raised
$10.4 million, the lowest level since it was created in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinking budget for cleanups means each of the state's 80
inspectors is responsible for checking an estimated 4,400 active
wells. The number of inspectors is down from 120 in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the TRC suspended operations for two months at some
offices because the program ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, when times are bad there is less money coming,
and more wells that actually enter into the program and more
environmental concerns that crop up,'' said Stephen Halasz, deputy
director of the TRC Oil and Gas Division. ``People don't have the
money to carefully manage their property.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oil Field Cleanup Fund is used only when an operator can't
be found or is insolvent. Leaking wells are plugged first,
according to a priority system.
</P>
<P>
   But when crude oil or salt water begins to leak from a well,
getting the TRC to help can be difficult, as Price has learned in
the 10 years since his well water turned salty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having to stay on them,'' said Rick Harston, chairman
of the Texas Alliance of Groundwater Districts committee that
monitors the TRC. ``They could be doing more than what they are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the problem is the underground mix of salt water
and oil.
</P>
<P>
   Salt water is undrinkable. It renders cropland unusable.
</P>
<P>
   Oil, on the other hand, helped build the state's economy and
public universities.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   But the wells that suck oil from deep in the ground also bring
up huge amounts of water so saline that a small amount can
contaminate a large volume of fresh water. Oil field brine is many
times saltier than seawater and can contain radioactivity, heavy
metals and other toxins.
</P>
<P>
   A TRC investigation in 1993 on Price's ranch concluded that salt
water in the aquifer came from evaporation pits. Before the
practice was outlawed 30 years ago, operators often poured salt
water into pits and let it evaporate. If it didn't drain quickly
enough, they would throw a stick of dynamite into the pit to crack
the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence suggested that salt water from decades of this practice
had trickled down fissures into Price's freshwater aquifer, the TRC
report stated.
</P>
<P>
   But Price drew a different conclusion. A test showed
contaminated water drawn from his well 180 feet underground had the
same salt content as water found in deep oil wells drilled nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pointed to me that we had found a direct source of
contamination,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Water was migrating up the oil well bore into the aquifer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As odd as it sounds, in many oil fields water trickles up, a
phenomenon caused by an oil-production technique called
water-flooding. Salt water is pumped into the reservoir to create
artesian pressure. Under this pressure, salt water and oil are
forced up wells.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bolen, chief executive officer of Pharaoh Oil &AMP; Gas in
Midland, which owns the wells, said he believed the problem on
Price's land arises from the old evaporation pits. But he was
unable to explain why salt water found in the aquifer was so
chemically similar to that in the oil wells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Price is a typical rancher who doesn't have any minerals
on the land and he doesn't have anything else to do but to heckle
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrogeologist Bob Jennings, who recently left the Sterling
County Underground Water Conservation District, recently found salt
contamination in another water well on Price's ranch. The water was
potable in 1983. It now is too salty to drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious this is continuing pollution,'' Jennings said,
voicing concern that the once-pristine aquifer tapped for
irrigation and drinking water throughout the region is threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The Upper Colorado River Authority also has gotten involved,
asking the TRC to stop the contamination of the water supply, said
Ralph Hoelscher, an authority board member and rancher.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said if we act at this time, when the price is so low, it
will bankrupt the oil companies,'' Hoelscher said. ``We just about
fell out of our chair. What is going on here? We are looking at our
ground water supplies and fresh water supplies for human
consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Henkhaus, the TRC district director in Midland, said the
commission had been trying to compel Pharaoh Oil &AMP; Gas to clean up
some surface contamination by ``hammering them as hard as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is on shaky financial footing, he said, and he is
worried that fines would put it out of business, potentially
creating a few dozen new abandoned wells.
</P>
<P>
   At Price's insistence, the TRC is continuing to test the water
wells, but Henkhaus said the agency hasn't found evidence to change
its conclusion in 1993 that pollution was from the evaporation
pits.

LAX REGULATIONS LEAVE STATE `HOLDING BAG' FOR ABANDONED WELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 24)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUSSELL GOLD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ With his pink sunglasses and gold Rolex watch,
Larry Stiles looked different than the typical oilman when he
walked into the Texas Railroad Commission's San Antonio office in
1991 and filed paperwork to open an oil exploration company.
</P>
<P>
   It soon became clear just how different he was.
</P>
<P>
   Most oil producers seek the fortune at the bottom of the well.
Stiles made his money off the well itself.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say he stripped the wells of everything of value and
left behind more than 500 abandoned wells, most of which are in
Bexar and nearby counties in South Texas. Many of them have leaked
oil or salt water.
</P>
<P>
   Until the state plugs and caps them, the wells are immediate or
potential threats to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles took advantage of permissive state rules as Texas oil and
gas regulators watched helplessly. The state has spent more than
$500,000 cleaning up abandoned wells since Stiles' company filed
for bankruptcy three years ago, and the figure will climb as more
wells are plugged.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles, 50, said he ran a legitimate business that grew too
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought too many wells too fast,'' he said. ``To hear the
Railroad Commission, we bought 2,300 wells that had tubing, rods
and pump jacks, sold them off and walked away with millions and
trillions of dollars. That is a total lie and they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1996, the San Antonio-based Ginco Operating Co.,
owned by Stiles and his wife, Arnon O'Brien, bought thousands of
depleted wells. Ginco then resold the pump jacks and miles of steel
well tubing employees stripped from the wells.
</P>
<P>
   Stiles told landowners and Texas regulators he planned to draw
oil from the open wells with a method called swabbing, in which a
rubber-faced cylinder is dropped down a well on a line and pulled
back up. The process generates modest pressure and draws up the
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Ginco workers swabbed many of the wells, regulators and
landowners said. But hundreds of wells lay dormant for more than a
year by early 1996. All were considered abandoned under state
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC), the state's energy
regulator, began spending money from the Oil Field Cleanup Fund to
plug Ginco wells and referred the case to the attorney general's
office to seek recovery of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   Ginco filed for bankruptcy in 1996. The state didn't recover a
cent.
</P>
<P>
   Many state officials familiar with the Ginco case said the real
culprit lies in the Texas oil and gas regulations, which look
imposing but can be as flimsy as a cardboard house.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a bond or letter of credit is required, but a company
with a good track record can pay $100 per well per year. Oil and
gas operators are supposed to plug a well after its productive life
ends. Operators also are required to provide a financial guarantee
to cover the plugging costs.
</P>
<P>
   The state auditor recommended strengthening the requirements in
1993, but nothing was changed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Ginco owned 636 wells, of which 33 were inactive,
according to TRC records. The company paid a $3,400 security
deposit at the start of the year, $100 for each inactive well and a
$100 renewal fee.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, Ginco had expanded its holdings to 2,381
wells. Staff members in the San Antonio TRC district office
determined the company's liability _ the cost if all of the wells
were plugged _ was $3.7 million. But the state can't request that
kind of financial assurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Legislature has allowed the commission to ask for is a
maximum bond or letter of credit of $250,000,'' TRC engineering
specialist Phil McCool said. ``Obviously there are some changes
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see Ginco as a cautionary tale. As the Texas oil industry
winds down, major companies are selling leases to smaller
independent and mom-and-pop operations. Like Ginco, these companies
can open and close quickly as oil and gas prices rise and fall.
When they fail, the last thing the company can afford is the $4,500
average cost of plugging a well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Stiles got way ahead of the Railroad Commission,'' said
San Antonio lawyer Robert Wilson, who is representing a Panhandle
oil company, Cap Operating, in a lawsuit against Ginco. ``It didn't
take him long to become operator of record of a bunch of wells. He
quickly got out of hand. ... They surely got left holding the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have thousands of empty well holes all over the
landscape,'' he said. ``That's a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The TRC asked Ginco to post a $250,000 bond, but the company
never did. In March 1996, Texas withdrew Ginco's right to operate
oil wells.
</P>
<P>
   With the oil industry in Texas long past its glory days,
producers from the Panhandle to the Gulf of Mexico are folding and
abandoning wells in growing numbers. The Texas Legislature gave the
TRC authority in 1983 to plug the wells, but forcing companies to
pay has proved extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The TRC Oil Field Cleanup Program spent $12.7 million in fiscal
1997 and was reimbursed $82,691 by operators, about 65 cents for
every $100 spent, according to state records. The TRC got only
slightly more, 88 cents for every $100 spent, in fiscal 1993
through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The gaping shortfall quickly empties the cleanup fund, forcing
the agency to mothball plugging operations for months until the
next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The TRC has seen more success in recovering costs by selling the
pump jacks and tubing. In fiscal 1997, salvage operations brought
in $980,176, according to the cleanup fund's annual report.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, a decision by the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals in
New Orleans raised the prospects that the state can recover more
money.
</P>
<P>
   In a case the Texas attorney general brought, the based court
ruled that if a well had to be plugged after a company declared
bankruptcy, the cost of sealing the well should be treated as a
priority claim, not an unsecured one. Instead of having to scramble
for pennies with dozens of other creditors, the TRC's demands will
get preference.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the high-flying Ginco had crashed, selling off many
wells and filing for bankruptcy, the company left hundreds of open
wells in the Somerset Field in Bexar County, the Pearsall Field in
Frio County, the Darst Creek Field in Guadalupe County and
elsewhere in South Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, the bankruptcy trustee closed the Ginco case
after resolving he could not get enough money from the company to
satisfy the dozens of unsatisfied creditors.
</P>
<P>
   McCool, the TRC engineering specialist, said the relationship
between the small companies at the bottom of the Texas oil business
and the regulators can be strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a perfect system.''

TEXAS OIL REGULATORS BENEFIT FROM THE REGULATED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 24)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   When Tony Garza announced he would seek election last year to
the Texas Railroad Commission, it was seen as a smart move to
advance a budding political career.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate raised $1.29 million between March and December
1998. More than $513,000 _ or 40 percent _ came from oil and gas
executives, industry lobbyists and lawyers, as well as top
employees of railroads, quarries, mines and other industries
overseen by the Texas Railroad Commission (TRC), according to a
computer analysis of Texas Ethics Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the large donations of $1,000 or more are linked
to industries that the commission regulates.
</P>
<P>
   While Garza is not the only commission member who has received
contributions from industries that he oversees, the donations raise
questions about the independence of the TRC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask the question, `Is this guy there as a public
servant for the public good or is he there simply as a tool of the
oil and gas industry?''' said Ed Bender, research director of the
nonprofit National Institute on Money and State Politics in Helena,
Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a Republican, said the contributions did not come with
strings attached. He said he had no trouble saying no to industry
interests, even as he accepts contributions from oil and gas
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we've got to run statewide in a large
state,'' he said recently. ``No doubt it presents challenges and
situations where you might create perceptions that people are
uncomfortable with. It's the worst form of government except for
all the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Most regulators around the nation are appointed, not elected.
But in Texas, the fortunes of the oil and gas industry are in the
hands of three elected officials. Every six years, hat in hand,
they must seek contributions to keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Oil money and the TRC have a long history together. But oil no
longer is the lubricant of the Texas economy. And after a century
of exploration, thousands of abandoned, unplugged and leaking wells
are left behind, and often the cleanup falls to the TRC.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is testing the friendly political relationship
between the industry and the commissioners as never before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only people who go over there (to the TRC) and lobby them
is the industry, and, because they are elected officials, the
people who give them the money is the industry,'' said Rick
Lowerre, an environmental lawyer in Austin and longtime critic of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The TRC serves as both promoter and regulator of oil and gas
development, Lowerre said. ``The Railroad Commission can't possibly
serve both roles.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' he said, ``what you take an oath to
is the laws and the Constitution of this state and this country.
And my sense of duty, if you will, isn't just to this generation of
Texans, it is to successive ones as well.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first six months as a commissioner, Garza approved 10
penalties against oil and gas companies in contested cases, while
dismissing, reducing or ordering further hearings on three others.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Carole Keeton Rylander, now the state
comptroller, proposed new ethics rules for the TRC. The rules would
have prohibited commissioners from accepting contributions from
people with pending cases.
</P>
<P>
   But she accepted $6,000 in contributions from George Mitchell of
Mitchell Energy while the TRC was investigating allegations that
the company had known its wells were leaking gas in Wise County in
northern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The commission at first assessed a $2.24 million penalty
Mitchell Energy, but later halved it.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander's spokesman, Mark Sanders, said she ``set a policy of
not accepting money from individuals with contested cases pending
before the commission, and she didn't.'' The Mitchell Energy
matter, he said, did not have two parties and therefore was not
contested.
</P>
<P>
   Others with interests in oil and gas supported Garza's run for
office.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Cross Timbers Oil Co. political action
committee gave Garza a $2,500 contribution in June 1998. The same
day, in a bundled effort, Garza got checks totaling $2,900 from
Cross Timber's chief executive officer, president, seven senior
vice presidents and five vice presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth-based company is the 27th largest producer of oil
in the state and the 28th largest producer of natural gas, with
fields in the Permian Basin and in East Texas, according to state
records.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the company been aggressively acquiring properties and
needs the TRC's approval to develop those fields.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Dingmore, vice president of the 1,600-member Texas
Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, said members
of the association are active in the TRC election races because
they want qualified people as regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe political contributions from independent oil and
gas producers help produce sympathetic commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must make the partisans of democracy uneasy to behold a
political environment in which the naked power of money has been so
plainly decisive in the electoral arena,'' David Prindle wrote in
his 1984 book ``Petroleum Politics and the Texas Railroad
Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Prindle, a government professor at the University of Texas at
Austin, concluded that contributions from oil and gas producers
have made industry-friendly candidates invulnerable. No reformer
has been elected or appointed to the three-person commission in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The two other TRC commissioners are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Matthews, a Republican who does not face re-election
until next year. He got 68 percent of the $95,000 he raised from
March to December 1998 from the people he regulates, according to
state records.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Williams, who was appointed by Gov. George W. Bush to
fill Rylander's unexpired term when she was elected comptroller.
Williams, therefore, did not file campaign contribution statements
for the period analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mack Wallace, a Democrat who was a commissioner from 1973 until
1987, said the source of campaign contributions made no difference
in his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally did no more for contributors than I did
noncontributors. I did not even keep a list of my contributors in
the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza, a close adviser to Bush, won a close primary race before
dominating in the November 1998 general election. He is the first
Hispanic to win a statewide election as a Republican and is viewed
as likely candidate for higher office some day.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he said he is committed to being the best commissioner
as possible. ``Beyond that, life is too uncertain'' to make any
predictions.

SCAR REMAINS FROM TEXAS OIL TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 24)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUSSELL GOLD  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEXON, Texas _ Santa Rita No. 1, the first well to strike oil in
West Texas, is such an esteemed piece of state history that the
original rig was moved from Texon to the University of Texas at
Austin for the public display.
</P>
<P>
   But few ever see what was left behind _ 7,000 acres of barren
land turned chalk white by years of dumping salt water, a byproduct
of oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something that anyone is proud of,'' said Doc
Weathers, a UT petroleum geologist. ``This is about as severe
contamination as you will find.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the University Lands Office began an experimental
project to reverse the damage by removing the salt from the soil
and underground water pools. They chose Texon, the birthplace of
Texas oil some 60 miles southeast of Midland, as the test site.
</P>
<P>
   Weathers, in charge of the project, said the conclusion was
clear: The soil could be desalinated, but the process was too
expensive to be practical for widespread use. Dumped salt water,
abandoned wells and runoff from eroded flow lines have produced
hundreds of sites where salt has left its mark. Only time will heal
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Earth is a strong old gal. I suspect sometime in the
future, if we don't come up with new economical ways to reclaim
contamination like that, it will heal itself up,'' Weathers said.
``But it may be 300 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The famed well struck oil in 1923 on university lands, 2.1
million state-owned acres in West Texas given to higher education
to exploit and develop. The Permanent University Fund has earned
more than $3 billion from oil and gas royalties and other
development on the land.
</P>
<P>
   The money built the state's two flagship universities, Texas A&AMP;M
and the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Rita produced 200 million barrels of salt water until
it was plugged in 1990, Weathers said. Until the 1960s, the salt
water was simply poured onto the surface, where it ran into
evaporation ponds several miles to the north. The water deposited
high levels of salt and turned the ground barren.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contamination was so bad,'' Weathers said, that the soil
``lost its integrity and it was almost like talcum powder.''|
</P>
<P>
   The University Lands project installed more than 23 miles of
underground drainage piping, as well as sump pumps. This sped up
the natural process of leaching the salt through fresh water. Then
salt-tolerant plants, such as barley, were planted.
</P>
<P>
   Weathers said no effective alternatives to removing the salt
exist. Adding gypsum to the soil has helped in some cases, but he
said this has little effect in high-contamination areas. Planting
other salt-tolerant vegetation, such as the four-winged salt bush,
also is being considered, but it holds little promise.
</P>
<P>
   The entire Santa Rita cleanup covered 300 acres of the 7,000
acres and cost more than $100,000, said Steve Hartmann, executive
director of the University Lands Office in Midland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not economical,'' Weathers said.

 &HT;    LETTER FROM HONDURAS: AFTER DISASTER, REBUILDING HOMES IS NOT
ENOUGH
 &HT;    With Photo mug of Williams.
 &HT;    EDs: For locator map purposes, Marcovia is a village a few miles
from the Gulf of Fonseca on the Honduras Pacific coast.

<P>
   MARCOVIA, Honduras _ It seems relatively simple: a nation torn
apart by Hurricane Mitch's raging floods needs to be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Donor countries and international charities step in, providing
millions in aid to repair infrastructure and hundreds of volunteers
to help with housing. Slowly, roads are cleared, wash-outs filled
in, temporary bridges installed and hundreds of new cement block
houses are constructed.
</P>
<P>
   But a year after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a
poor country devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy _ at
least not if you want to address the underlying problems that made
the disaster so much worse than it might have been.
</P>
<P>
   For example, central Honduras' heavily populated highlands are a
rugged, mountainous region. People build wherever they can, often
on steep hillsides prone to collapse in heavy rains, or next to
streams that can grow in hours from placid to deadly.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, aid workers helped Mitch's victims rebuild right
where their homes used to be. While their intentions were good, the
workers really didn't help the families in the long run because
this year's rainy season has flooded the homes again.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups have built houses in better locations, but haven't
provided sanitation or clean water systems. Now rural people
accustomed to bathing in streams and defecating without thought to
the sanitary consequences are still doing that, turning their new
homes into places vulnerable to disease.
</P>
<P>
   Good intentions alone, it seems, aren't enough, even when the
victims being helped are desperately poor.
</P>
<P>
   Workers for CARE, an Atlanta-based relief group that has worked
here for more than four decades, recite the refrain constantly:
``It's easy to build houses. It's more important to help build
self-sustaining communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of natural and man-made disasters around the globe,
they know it's easy to be blinded by cultural biases, to ignore how
the people you are trying to help think and live. Simply rushing
in, building a house and then moving on may do more harm than good,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proposing a program to address the social situation in
the new communities built since Mitch,'' said CARE's director in
Honduras, Marc de Lamotte. ``If we don't address it, we run the
risk of creating ghettos with all the problems of crime, insecurity
and unemployment that come with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the simple act of providing food for disaster victims must
be carefully thought out.
</P>
<P>
   CARE made a point to limit free handouts of food in Mitch's
aftermath to only a few weeks. Once the situation was stabilized,
the handouts were transformed into food-for-work programs. This
encouraged the people to move from being passive victims to active
participation in the rebuilding of their lives. It also avoided
undermining the local economy, since farmers would be reluctant to
plant new crops if free food was available.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is helping build an entire new town near this flooded one,
but has been careful not to simply construct new houses and turn
them over to the flood victims. They have required people to build
their own houses, and the result has been a sense of ownership and
pride in the new community.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, rebuilding Honduras will take years. But what many
hope is that the effort will address the underlying problems of
poverty, sanitation and poor education that have hampered this
country for decades _ and made Mitch's impact much worse than it
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the bricks and mortar,'' said Phil Gelman, who
has directed CARE's emergency operations in Honduras since Mitch.
``There's the whole social side of getting these new communities
off the ground. It's going to be a long process.''

<P>
   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The month begins creepily enough. Nightfall finds Scorpius the
Scorpion slithering downward into the southwestern horizon. Draco
the Dragon hangs high in the northwest, and low in the west stands
Bovtes (pronounced boo!-o-teez). The sky's eeriest props are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the celestial object most intimately connected with devils
and witches waits until mid-month to rise at nightfall, so that by
Halloween it's well up when darkness comes. It's the Pleiades.
</P>
<P>
   What? That close-knit cluster of young suns better known as the
Seven Sisters? What have they to do with sinister things?
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, everything. Halloween revolves around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Halloween, other cultures attached significance to
the Pleiades. The Brahmans of ancient India visualized those stars
as the sparks of Agni, the god of fire. In Greek legend they were
the daughters of Atlas. The Pleiades are even mentioned in the Book
of Job:
</P>
<P>
   Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
bands of Orion?
</P>
<P>
   A ``sweet influence'' is hardly scary. But some cultures
associated the Pleiades with more ominous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs, for example, linked the date when the constellation
reached its highest point, or culminated, at midnight with the end
of the world. The Aztecs believed that every 52 years, when their
365-day sun calendar and 260-day ritual calendar came into
coincidence, the possibility existed that the heavens would cease
to move and demons would fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that this catastrophe wouldn't befall the cosmos? When
the Pleiades reached their zenith at midnight (almost straight
overhead in Mexico City) and then continued harmlessly across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztec ceremony associated with this event involved a human
sacrifice. That's certainly creepy but has nothing to do with
Halloween. For that, we must look to the Celts.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe Halloween is the modern-day remnant of a
Celtic celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the
Celtic year and the transition from summer to winter.

   The Celts believed that during Samhain, the border between this
world and the supernatural world cracked open, granting free

   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The month begins creepily enough. Nightfall finds Scorpius the
Scorpion slithering downward into the southwestern horizon. Draco
the Dragon hangs high in the northwest, and low in the west stands
Bovtes (pronounced boo!-o-teez). The sky's eeriest props are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the celestial object most intimately connected with devils
and witches waits until mid-month to rise at nightfall, so that by
Halloween it's well up when darkness comes. It's the Pleiades.
</P>
<P>
   What? That close-knit cluster of young suns better known as the
Seven Sisters? What have they to do with sinister things?
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, everything. Halloween revolves around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Halloween, other cultures attached significance to
the Pleiades. The Brahmans of ancient India visualized those stars
as the sparks of Agni, the god of fire. In Greek legend they were
the daughters of Atlas. The Pleiades are even mentioned in the Book
of Job:
</P>
<P>
   Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
bands of Orion?
</P>
<P>
   A ``sweet influence'' is hardly scary. But some cultures
associated the Pleiades with more ominous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs, for example, linked the date when the constellation
reached its highest point, or culminated, at midnight with the end
of the world. The Aztecs believed that every 52 years, when their
365-day sun calendar and 260-day ritual calendar came into
coincidence, the possibility existed that the heavens would cease
to move and demons would fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that this catastrophe wouldn't befall the cosmos? When
the Pleiades reached their zenith at midnight (almost straight
overhead in Mexico City) and then continued harmlessly across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztec ceremony associated with this event involved a human
sacrifice. That's certainly creepy but has nothing to do with
Halloween. For that, we must look to the Celts.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe Halloween is the modern-day remnant of a
Celtic celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the
Celtic year and the transition from summer to winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Celts believed that during Samhain, the border between this
world and the supernatural world cracked open, granting free
passage to sinister fairies from the land of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Samhain fell at the midpoint between the autumnal equinox and
the winter solstice, and the Celts originally knew when that was
because it took place at the same time that _ you guessed it _ the
Pleiades culminated at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition, developed in the Middle Ages, of the Witches'
Sabbath on Oct. 31 is probably rooted in the old Celtic observance.
That date was upheld into modern times as All Hallows' Eve, which
became, of course, Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Now is your chance to get closer to the power behind the goblins
and mischief of October's final night. The Pleiades are striking to
the unaided eye, but they become stunning through binoculars.
Instantly the six to 11 naked-eye stars grow to hundreds of
sapphire jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy clubs periodically hold observing nights for the
public. Perhaps some will set up instruments on Halloween, so
families _ already outdoors on their diabolic rounds _ can bravely
meet October's ghostly apparitions face-to-face.

NATURE'S REMEDY: DOSES OF WORMS MAY RELIEVE INTESTINAL DISEASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   American children 70 years ago had a closer relationship with
dirt than they do now.
</P>
<P>
   There were fewer sidewalks, paved roads and indoor toilets, and
kids spent more time playing outside in their bare feet. As a
result of this daily contact with soil, almost all youngsters were
infected with intestinal parasites such as hookworms, pinworms or
whipworms.
</P>
<P>
   And that was a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the thinking of Joel Weinstock, a University of
Iowa researcher who believes regular doses of worms may be the key
to treating people with inflammatory bowel disease, a serious and
baffling disorder that affects at least 1 million people
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move into our sterile boxes, (breathe) sterile air,
we're no longer being exposed to some of the natural agents that
may be required for optimal development of our immune systems,''
said Weinstock, director of the Digestive Disease Center at the
University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. ``As we've de-wormed,
people have developed immune systems which are not dampened.''
</P>
<P>
   The cause of inflammatory bowel disease, a term that encompasses
both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, is a mystery, but it
is presumed to result from poor regulation of the intestinal immune
system _ an overreaction to normal intestinal bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases usually begin in people during their late teens and
20s and last a lifetime. They cause abdominal pain, diarrhea and
gastrointestinal bleeding. Sections of the intestine may become
blocked by scar tissue and require surgical removal. Those
afflicted are at greater risk for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there isn't a cure, but antibiotics, steroids, pain
and immune-modulating drugs such as cyclosporine help reduce
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other industrialized countries, the
disorder is rampant. However, Weinstock notes, the condition is
rare in poor countries where parasitic worm infection is common.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have learned that the intestine houses a complex
ecosystem, including 200 to 300 different species of bacteria as
well as various viruses and parasites. All of the inhabitants
modulate the intestinal immune system, which is largely governed by
two types of T-cells, called TH1 and TH2, found in the intestinal
lining.
</P>
<P>
   TH1 induces inflammation, TH2 neutralizes the inflammatory
response. For unknown reasons, many parasitic infections induce a
pure TH2, anti-inflammatory, response.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock theorizes that man and the lowly worm co-evolved to
become interdependent. He believes intestinal worms, or helminths,
dampen the immune response so they can thrive in humans. In the
absence of these parasites, the human intestinal inflammatory
response is unchecked and goes into overdrive, causing disease.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in mice conducted by University of Iowa researchers
supported this worm-as-good-guy idea. Mice exposed to helminthic
worms were protected from the development of inflammatory bowel
disease.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, working with colleagues David Elliot and Robert
Summers, Weinstock gave six patient volunteers a drink laced with
the microscopic eggs of a worm that doesn't normally infect people.
Standard treatments hadn't helped these patients, four of whom had
Crohn's disease and two of whom suffered from ulcerative colitis.
</P>
<P>
   Although these worms can survive in the human intestine,
reaching nearly a half-inch in length, they can't reproduce and are
expelled after a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   After ingesting the eggs, all six patients improved
substantially. Five went into complete remission. The treatment had
no noticeable side effects and the patients' improvements lasted
one to five months following the single dose.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were doing way, way better than he (Weinstock)
hoped in his wildest dreams. He's not saying this is the be-all,
end-all. This is something to be studied,'' said Dr. Peter Ernst,
an immunologist at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston
who is familiar with Weinstock's research. ``It's a logical thing
to do and so far it seems to work ... And we all hope it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock declined to specify which type of worm he used out of
concern that patients might be tempted to try it on their own and
inadvertently contract a dangerous parasite.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Buchman, a professor of gastroenterology at the
University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, called
Weinstock's idea ``an interesting hypothesis'' but said a study of
six patients is too small to be definitive. Treatments for Crohn's
and colitis typically have a 30 to 35 percent placebo response
rate, he said. &UR;  &LR; The placebo effect is a phenomenon in which people
experience an improvement in their condition in response to a phony
therapy, such as a sugar pill.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock's team i now organizing a clinical trial with
additional patients to compare the treatment with a placebo and see
if additional doses help. The double-blind study, in which neither
researchers nor patients know who is getting worm eggs and who is
getting a placebo &UR;  &LR; until the study's completion, will begin in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year from now, you might look back and it means nothing,''
Weinstock said. ``The bottom line is, it has potential. We will
have to see before we can say for sure it's helping people. But
we're encouraged.''

 &HT;    Assertion is needed to fight for proper health care
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A health insurance company actually gathered
people in four cities this month to hear the keynote speaker say
they should be more tenacious and assertive in fighting for
whatever it takes to improve their health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't take no for an answer. Pursue your options, and pursue
them with an attitude,'' Dr. Freda Lewis-Hall, director of the
Lilly Centre for Women's Health in Indianapolis, said over a
satellite link to the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield conference
on women's health in Dayton and Columbus, Louisville, Ky., and
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't just mean people should be aggressive when they think
their HMO is wrongly denying them coverage. She said they should be
tenacious about learning their health histories, finding reliable
sources of health information, obtaining the right medical
treatment, identifying which illnesses are most likely to kill or
disable them and establishing habits of good nutrition and exercise
to prevent illnesses. ``Keep trying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewis-Hall's speech was aimed at women, it is excellent
advice for people of both genders. Medical science in the 20th
century has been so effective at correcting bad health that it has
begun to focus on maintaining good health. But all too often,
people find that greed, laziness and ignorance in the health-care
industry is blocking their path to the knowledge and technology
that could save or improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   When three-fifths of American women say their biggest health
fear is breast cancer, misconceptions are clearly a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease kills nearly 10 times as many women each year as
breast cancer. Stroke kills more than twice as many. Lung cancer
has been deadlier than breast cancer since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women don't die of breast cancer, even though at the end
of October and Breast Cancer Awareness Month you feel like they
do,'' Dr. Margaret Dunn, a surgeon and Wright State University
medical school administrator, told the Dayton segment of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   It's a serious health concern. It's just not the biggest or only
one.
</P>
<P>
   The four doctors in Dayton offered information that surprised
people about many disorders. Anthem officials found it so
enlightening, they're considering future seminars for nonmembers,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Urinary incontinence, for example, is a problem for 13 million
Americans, and as many as 11 million are women. But half of them
can get relief from the same pelvic floor exercises that are taught
in childbirth classes.
</P>
<P>
   One in every four women will experience depression in their
lifetimes, most of them more than once. They're most susceptible
before menopause. People who turn to excessive alcohol and other
recreational drugs often are medicating their depression without
knowing it. Yet only one-third even seek treatment for depression,
which is effective as often as four times out of five.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all women will break a bone because of osteoporosis.
They lose about 20 percent of their bone mass in the first five to
seven years after menopause. But there are several helpful
medications besides estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Women are often reluctant to take supplementary estrogen after
menopause because it has been associated with breast cancer. But
Dunn, speaking as the session's breast cancer expert, said the
types of breast cancer associated with estrogen are not usually
fatal. Meanwhile, estrogen clearly helps avoid the much greater
danger of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent of women who have heart attacks die within a
year, compared with 27 percent of men. And nearly two-thirds of the
women who die suddenly from bad hearts have no previous symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   And even after years of breast cancer awareness campaigns, Dunn
said only 60 percent of insured women older than 40 have their
recommended annual mammograms and clinical exams.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to live longer than men, but new U.S. data suggests
even that's a mixed blessing. Nearly one in every four women older
than 85 needs help with a basic activity such as dressing or using
the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary baseball manager Casey Stengel, a chain smoker born in
the 1800s, said if he had known he was going to live so long, he
would have taken better care of himself. As the 1900s end with life
expectancy up nearly 50 percent, his wisecrack is timely advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't live longer than men,'' Lewis-Hall said. ``They
take longer to die.''

 &HT;    Peekaboo nudes, trippy dudes redux
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Last weekend Nellie and I and my
brother, Steve, went to my parents' house and helped them throw
away 30 years of accumulated junk.
</P>
<P>
   By helping them, I mean we lovingly chloroformed them and
duct-taped them to their twin Barcaloungers so we didn't have to
listen to their pathetic cries of ``Don't throw that out!'' and
``I'm saving that!'' We were ruthless, totally without ruth, until
Nellie came across a magazine that must have accompanied them
through at least five changes of domiciles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want this?'' Nellie asked, pointing to the cover, where
it said ``Entertainment for Men - $1.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a September issue of Playboy, the year: 1969.
</P>
<P>
   After cleverly concealing the magazine in my tunic, I stashed it
in the car, probably the first time a Playboy has ever been
smuggled out of a house.
</P>
<P>
   What I had here was a time capsule. Later, I promised myself, I
would leaf through the magazine, and let it transport me back
almost exactly 30 years, when I would have been 27. Back then I was
supporting a child and a wife on a reporter's salary and would not
have even seen that issue unless I read it in a barber shop. Back
then the $1 newsstand price would have bought a gallon of milk or
three gallons of gas.
</P>
<P>
   Skin magazines were not in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Skin? How much skin were they showing back in 1969? I turned to
centerfold Shay Knuth, a Mexico City coed, languorously stretched
out on the floor over her studies, CLOTHED! Granted, the silken
kimono she is wearing is negligently fastened, and that some body
parts spill forth, but even her mother would admit that the robe is
otherwise modestly employed.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was time for me to slip into something more comfortable _
1969. I turned to page 1 and let the years fall away.
</P>
<P>
   It is 1969 and Panasonic, a new company, offers a solid state
radio that plays and records tapes, not exposed tape on a bulky
reel, but tape compressed into a plastic cartridge that fits in the
palm.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to Playboy from Jack Williams of Indianapolis, Ind.,
commends the magazine for August's expose on The Minutemen, a
survivalist group representing, Williams declares, ``a dangerous
brand of patriotic paranoia that needs to be exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reis, an underwear company, advertises ``Torso T-Shirts and
Shorti-Shorts, tapered to hug the hips.''
</P>
<P>
   The clothing ads are full of browns and rusts and russets and
greens and beiges, and tans. The male models have poofy hair and
skinny bodies. The suits and sports coats are reflective and stiff,
seemingly woven of spun steel. The models would not, it occurs to
me, look good in Torso T-Shirts and Shorti-Shorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naked Ape'' author Desmond Morris warns in his essay, ``The
Human Zoo,'' that crowding mammals leads to severe strain. ``The
weakest members of the group are frequently hounded to death as the
restrained rituals of display and counter display degenerate into
bloody violence,'' he writes. Cities have become our cages, Morris
warned. Explosions loomed.
</P>
<P>
   I had to recall the anthropologist's popular book that insisted
that aggressive male behavior by primates is largely for show and
finds its human counterpart in men who drive Corvettes. Clearly,
Morris feared that as cities become too crowded, men will kill one
another with sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the issue, animal behaviorist Dr. Robert S. de
Ropp, declares that man, while ``almost insanely sexual,'' is a
pathetic eunuch compared with the snail ``whose copulatory orgies
with sadomasochistic overtones make any human excesses seem
comparatively dull.'' I believe that finding was closely followed
by Sam and Dave's Top 10 hit, I'm a Snail Man.
</P>
<P>
   Movies _ Easy Rider gets high marks as a ``small but pungent
film'' and ``one hell of a trip.''
</P>
<P>
   And this from the 1969 slouching-to-Gomorrah front:
``Hollywood's self-imposed curb on violence, big news a year or so
ago, can be declared officially dead with the arrival of The Wild
Bunch , a bloodbath that makes Bonnie and Clyde seem a model of
restraint.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, a full page ad for the MG Midget sports car
features a trendy couple standing outside the car, which is where
they belong, because to wedge one's self behind the wheel in these
under-powered little death traps was to require the Jaws of Life to
get out.
</P>
<P>
   On the theater front, the reviewer smirks, ``Oh! Calcutta! is
good nudes.''
</P>
<P>
   In its continuing ``Sex on Campus'' survey, the University of
Florida reports bad news-good news for Gator men. The bad: Males
outnumber women 2 to 1. The good: ``Only freshmen girls have curfew
and it's not strictly enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   If I imagined even for a moment that I was back in a time before
the Egg McMuffin, that spell was quickly broken as I read this item
from the Playboy Advisor:
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will the 21st Century begin? I say Jan. 1, 2000. My
buddy says Jan. 1, 2001. Who's right? A. A. St. Bernard, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your buddy is correct, since there never was a year 1.
However, we're told that Jan. 1, 1900 was celebrated with gusto to
welcome in a new century, and a second celebration took place a
year later, on Jan. 1, 1901. It's probable that such double
festivities will be repeated.

 &HT;    Make careful choices about job benefits
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of American workers can tell the boss what to do this
month.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you can't offer him a new itinerary. But you can
select for yourself just what employee benefits you want the
company to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   For young workers in particular, this is a chance to make some
important decisions about insurance and other benefits, to start
their savings plans and perhaps to cut their income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the annual ``open enrollment'' season. During
this period _ usually October _ thousands of midsize and large
companies give employees the chance to sign up for various benefits
or to change existing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the options you have, and why they are
important:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retirement plans. If your employer offers a 401(k) retirement
savings plan, this may be the only time in the year to enroll or to
make changes to your existing choices.
</P>
<P>
   There are three strong reasons to get in on this benefit. First,
you escape income taxes on the portion of your salary that you
deposit in your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Second, most employers match at least a portion of your deposit.
Often the company will put in 50 cents for each $1 you contribute,
up to a maximum of 6 percent of your salary. At a minimum,
everybody ought to put in enough to collect the boss's money.
</P>
<P>
   Third, you don't pay income tax on the money your savings earn
until you withdraw money from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health insurance. If you have married, had a baby or had other
big life changes, you may want to adjust your coverage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are generally healthy, you may want to select an option
that lowers the deduction from your paycheck in exchange for lower
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If you can choose among several insurance plans, you should
compare the benefits and the costs of each one. If you are thinking
about switching, you also should check whether your doctors
participate in the new plan, how the new plan deals with chronic
diseases like diabetes, and whether friends already in the plan are
satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flexible spending accounts. Many employers offer these options
for covering health and dependent-care expenses. Even if you have
already signed up for this year, you will need to sign up again for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of either account, you direct your employer to
deduct a given amount from your paychecks and deposit it in the
appropriate account. You withdraw money from the account as you
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of employees get confused about this benefit,'' said
Jennifer Pelsue, a consultant in the Atlanta office of Hewitt
Associates. ``They don't understand the tax advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a big advantage: The money you put into flexible spending
accounts escapes both income tax and Social Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   One caution: If you don't spend all the money in a flex account,
you forfeit the remaining amount. You could end up searching for
more expenses _ perhaps new eyeglasses and extra dental treatments
_ at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Life insurance. This is particularly important if you have a
non-working spouse or children to provide for after you die. Term
insurance is the cheapest way to go, and that is usually what
companies offer. You may also be able to buy life insurance for a
spouse or your children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disability insurance. This may be even more important than
life insurance. People are much more likely to be disabled than
they are to die at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies suggest that you select a policy that replaces at
least 60 percent of your gross income.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, your first resource should be the
information your employer sends you. Companies spend a lot of money
on these plans, and they want to make sure workers get the most out
of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know more, take your questions to the personnel
department. You may get direct answers, or you may get directions
to Web sites or books for more information.
</P>
<P>
   One last tip: Don't dawdle. ``If you don't meet the deadline,
typically you will default to very basic coverage,'' Pelsue warned.
You might not get as much insurance as you want, and you certainly
will be dropped from any flexible spending accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most employers send the information packets to home
addresses,'' Pelsue added. ``We all get a lot of junk mail. But you
should open this envelope. People go in for annual physicals, and
you should think about your benefits program in the same way.''

 &HT;    Nothing funny about best shows
 &HT;    By Kevin Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Whenever I tell people I get paid to
watch TV, I get two very different responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that's really cool! When are you going to die so I can
get your job?'' The other: ``I never watch TV. There's never
anything on.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree with the first remark _ my job is pretty cool. But I
strongly disagree with the second. TV is having one of its best
years _ ever.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many good shows on network TV, my four VCRs are
working overtime. I can't remember a season when there were so many
choices on so many nights. Remember the song ``It's Raining Men''
by the Weather Girls? Well, it's raining TV shows. And I don't mind
getting drenched.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Mandy Patinkin's return, ``Chicago Hope'' is the
brilliantly moving medical drama it used to be. If you didn't catch
Rene Auberjonois' searing portrayal of a Tourette's
syndrome-suffering surgeon, you missed a possible Emmy performance.
</P>
<P>
   Take ``ER'' off life support. The first two episodes boasted
enough drama, romance and tension than all of last season. ``Law &AMP;
Order'' remains TV's best cop show. I don't have to tell you how
great ``The Practice'' is, and I can say the same about ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer,'' ``Any Day Now'' and ``Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Felicity'' doesn't get on my nerves anymore. The college
sophomore, however, needs to do two things: grow back her curly
brown locks and dump Ben the Cad _ for good!
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, I haven't even mentioned ``The X-Files,'' which
returns Nov. 7, or ``NYPD Blue.'' And I haven't said a word about
the new shows. The tender ``Once and Again'' is living up to its
hype. ``The West Wing'' is intelligent and entertaining. ``Judging
Amy'' and ``Family Law'' are becoming sleeper hits. ``Third Watch''
has finally become watchable. ``Get Real'' is a real treat. ``Now
and Again'' continues to baffle and amuse. ``Angel'' looks like a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't something seem a bit odd? Look at my list again.
What's missing?
</P>
<P>
   Sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the great new sitcoms? While dramas _ new and old
_ continue to flourish, sitcoms are sinking fast. Where is the next
``Friends?'' The new ``Everybody Loves Raymond?'' The potential
``Seinfeld?'' They're certainly not on the fall schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the new comedies, ``Action'' is clearly the best of the
lot. But the scathing satire about a ruthless movie producer (Jay
Mohr) is getting killed in the ratings. That explains why Fox is
pulling ``Action'' for the all-important November sweeps. Another
good sitcom is the odd couple pairing of Neil Patrick Harris and
Tony Shalhoub on ``Stark Raving Mad.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's it. The rest are just downright awful, or
frustratingly mediocre. ``Shasta McNasty,'' ``Love &AMP; Money,'' ``The
Parkers'' and the recently canned ``The Mike O'Malley Show'' fall
into the former category. ``Ladies Man,'' ``Oh Grow Up,'' ``Odd Man
Out'' and ``Work with Me'' go into the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Why are sitcoms dying? The main reason is a talent pool
stretched as thin as Phyllis Diller's face. Writing good sitcoms is
about as tough as writing ``War &AMP; Peace''. . . long-hand. Only a
handful of writers excel at it, yet there are more comedies on the
air than the writing can support. I applaud Phil Rosenthal, one of
``Everybody Loves Raymond'''s executive producers. Last season CBS
wanted him to produce additional Raymond episodes. Rosenthal,
however, refused, saying he didn't want to ``water down'' his fine
show.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies are also too predictable. Surprisingly, the formula
hasn't changed much in 50 years. You have the lead characters,
wacky friends and a laugh track. Doesn't that sound like ``I Love
Lucy?'' And we all know that was much funnier than ABC's ``Two Guys
and a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitcoms also look too much alike. Gun-shy producers are afraid
to try something daring. ``Sports Night'' is not your traditional
sitcom. There's no studio audience, it's shot on film and the
characters are actually smart and interesting. The result? The ABC
comedy continues to struggle.
</P>
<P>
   If you look closely, sitcoms are slowly giving way to the
``dramedy'' _ hard-to-define shows that are part comedy, part
dramas. The sharply-written Sports Night is the perfect example. So
is ``Get Real,'' another Fox show getting bumped during sweeps. But
if these ratings-challenged shows don't attract more viewers,
expect the dramedy to go the way of the Betamax.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike dramas, TV sitcoms underestimate the audience's
intelligence. I know there are a lot of smart TV watchers out
there. Heck, they write, e-mail and call me everyday. But
brain-dead network suits seem to think that if comedies don't
pander to the lowest common denominator, they won't get big
ratings. Such funny, yet intelligent shows as ``Frasier,''
``Friends,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and ``Raymond'' have already proven
that you don't have to talk down to viewers to get them to watch.
</P>
<P>
   So, will great sitcoms ever emerge from the rubble?
</P>
<P>
   Sure. TV is cyclical. Right now, dramas are hot. A few years
ago, it was talk shows. The other year it was newsmagazines.
</P>
<P>
   In a business that emphasizes ratings and instant gratification,
networks need to show more patience with shows that aren't
immediate hits. ABC is doing that with ``Sports Night.'' CBS did it
with ``Raymond,'' and the patience paid off with a top 10 hit. But
the key to making it all work is the writing. Hollywood needs to
scour the country to find the best talent. The industry also needs
to do a better job nurturing young writers with fresh visions.
There's a radical concept _ fresh visions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fact: The networks aren't going away. Despite bleeding
heavily, none of the seven broadcast networks has ``Going Out of
Business'' signs on its doors. If the writing talent doesn't catch
up to the ever-expanding TV universe, we'll just keep getting dopey
comedies like ``Shasta McNasty.''
</P>
<P>
   But forget comedies, for now. This is ``The Year of the Drama.''
Pick a night, any night. Something good is on.

 &HT;    Make careful choices about job benefits
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of American workers can tell the boss what to do this
month.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, you can't offer him a new itinerary. But you can
select for yourself just what employee benefits you want the
company to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   For young workers in particular, this is a chance to make some
important decisions about insurance and other benefits, to start
their savings plans and perhaps to cut their income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion is the annual ``open enrollment'' season. During
this period _ usually October _ thousands of midsize and large
companies give employees the chance to sign up for various benefits
or to change existing plans.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the options you have, and why they are
important:
</P>
<P>
   _ Retirement plans. If your employer offers a 401(k) retirement
savings plan, this may be the only time in the year to enroll or to
make changes to your existing choices.
</P>
<P>
   There are three strong reasons to get in on this benefit. First,
you escape income taxes on the portion of your salary that you
deposit in your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   Second, most employers match at least a portion of your deposit.
Often the company will put in 50 cents for each $1 you contribute,
up to a maximum of 6 percent of your salary. At a minimum,
everybody ought to put in enough to collect the boss's money.
</P>
<P>
   Third, you don't pay income tax on the money your savings earn
until you withdraw money from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health insurance. If you have married, had a baby or had other
big life changes, you may want to adjust your coverage.
</P>
<P>
   If you are generally healthy, you may want to select an option
that lowers the deduction from your paycheck in exchange for lower
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If you can choose among several insurance plans, you should
compare the benefits and the costs of each one. If you are thinking
about switching, you also should check whether your doctors
participate in the new plan, how the new plan deals with chronic
diseases like diabetes, and whether friends already in the plan are
satisfied with it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Flexible spending accounts. Many employers offer these options
for covering health and dependent-care expenses. Even if you have
already signed up for this year, you will need to sign up again for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of either account, you direct your employer to
deduct a given amount from your paychecks and deposit it in the
appropriate account. You withdraw money from the account as you
need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of employees get confused about this benefit,'' said
Jennifer Pelsue, a consultant in the Atlanta office of Hewitt
Associates. ``They don't understand the tax advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a big advantage: The money you put into flexible spending
accounts escapes both income tax and Social Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   One caution: If you don't spend all the money in a flex account,
you forfeit the remaining amount. You could end up searching for
more expenses _ perhaps new eyeglasses and extra dental treatments
_ at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Life insurance. This is particularly important if you have a
non-working spouse or children to provide for after you die. Term
insurance is the cheapest way to go, and that is usually what
companies offer. You may also be able to buy life insurance for a
spouse or your children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disability insurance. This may be even more important than
life insurance. People are much more likely to be disabled than
they are to die at an early age.

</P>
<P>
   For more information, your first resource should be the

on these plans, and they want to make sure workers get the most out
of them.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to know more, take your questions to the personnel
department. You may get direct answers, or you may get directions
to Web sites or books for more information.
</P>
<P>
   One last tip: Don't dawdle. ``If you don't meet the deadline,
typically you will default to very basic coverage,'' Pelsue warned.

 &HT;    Kennedy Center picks Winters for Twain prize
 &HT;    By Carol Simmons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Jonathan Winters says he's proud to be a Buckeye.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton-born comedian, actor, painter and writer has even
been known to carry around a handful of the hard brown nuts to pass
out to people he meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this? A chestnut?'' he says, adopting the voice of a
Hollywood society dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he answers himself, ``it's a poison nut we use in Ohio
to feed to dummies and Michiganites.''
</P>
<P>
   The revery is vintage Winters. Funny, off-the cuff and slightly
off-kilter, with some subtle social commentary thrown in for good
measure.
</P>
<P>
   It was just this ability to make us laugh, while at the same
time revealing the vagaries of human nature, that led the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., to name
Winters the 1999 recipient of its prestigious Mark Twain Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the American satirist who used humor as a vehicle for
his social criticism, the annual award, instituted last year,
recognizes those who have ``made a significant contribution to
American humor.'' The 1998 prize went to the controversial Richard
Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Kennedy Center's executive committee chose
Winters this year for the pioneering nature of his comedy,
according to Kennedy Center President Lawrence J. Wilker.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the award, the center noted that Winters'
stream-of-consciousness approach, combined with his uncanny ability
to capture a variety of characterizations and vignettes, opened the
way for such performers as Robin Williams, Gilda Radner, Steve
Martin, Lily Tomlin, Martin Short and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a seminal figure,'' Wilker said from his Kennedy Center
office last week. ``He was able to look at average, real American
people and highlight their foibles in a gentle and very real way.''
</P>
<P>
   But those weren't just any American people he started out with,
Winters said when reached at his Los Angeles home last week. Those
were Dayton people, and Springfield, Ohio people. Folks he had
known growing up in the Miami Valley in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Winters, who turns 74 in November, spent his first seven years
in Dayton before moving with his family to Springfield. After a
stint in the U.S. Marines at the end of World War II, he returned
to his hometown, attending art school at the Dayton Art Institute
and meeting his wife, Eileen Schauder, a Roosevelt High School
graduate who remains his life's partner.
</P>
<P>
   Always something of a cut-up, Winters listened when his art
school friends encouraged him to enter a local talent show in which
first prize was a watch. He needed a watch, so he gave it try, and
won. The entertainment bug took hold hard, and he got a job at a
local radio station, which led to a two-year broadcasting stint in
Columbus, which led him to take off in 1953 to try his comedic luck
in the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   His first routines were impressions of well-known celebrities,
and he did all right with them. But he found his true voice when he
took to heart some late-night advise from an anonymous comedy club
employee, who told him he was a funny guy, but that he was wasting
his talents ``shining the shoes'' of people who were already
famous.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't he know any interesting characters back home in Dayton?
</P>
<P>
   That he did. And soon the world knew them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Getting along in show business hasn't been an easy life, Winters
said. A pioneer isn't necessarily the person people in charge want
to hire. But it's had its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd get any further than New York,'' he said.
``I've had a good run of it. I can't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters will be on hand Wednesday evening to receive his award
during a tribute program at the Kennedy Center featuring such
entertainers as Steve Allen, Richard Belzer, Sid Caesar, Andy Dick,
Lyle Lovett and Robin Williams. The program, to be taped by Comedy
Central for broadcast on cable television Jan. 12, will cap a
three-day ``Celebration of American Humor'' at the center that
includes lectures, symposia, master classes, performances by
up-and-coming comedians as well as a film festival featuring some
of Winters' best-known movies.

 &HT;    Today's man: BIG!! (because he's hollow)
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``There is not a man here who does not
feel 400 percent bigger in 1900 than he did in 1896, bigger
intellectually, bigger hopefully, bigger patriotically, bigger in
the breast from the fact that he is a citizen of a country that has
become a world power for peace, for civilization and for the
expansion of its industries and the products of its labor,''
proclaimed Sen. Chauncey Depew of New York as the century turned on
its hinge, nearly 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on it all, we see 616,136 American war dead, the
worst depression in U.S. history, a culture besotted with sex,
drugs and random shootings, mega-mergers leading to layoffs and
downsizings, the decline of literacy (are you reading this, you
few, you happy few!?) and a perceived malaise widespread enough for
feminist author Susan Faludi to have written a 600-page book about
the plight of the American man, titled simply, Stiffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Faludi's earlier book, ``Backlash,'' charged that women were
victims of a scam perpetrated by the media and the consumer society
_ that they were forced to define themselves by looks and
possessions; that they were commodities dressed up in other
commodities. ``Stiffed'' contends that the same thing is now
happening to men, that more and more men are what they own, no
less, no more.
</P>
<P>
   New magazines, such as Maxim and Gear, openly celebrate sexual
and economic prowess with large, lingering looks at flesh and
flashy clothes, interspersed with ads for sports gear, electronics,
sweet liqueurs and cigarettes. The October issue of Gear shows
women's soccer champ Brandi Chastain nude, using soccer balls in
lieu of a fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man who is moving into the 21st century is a virile man,
but not a stupid virile man,'' said Jason Harper, associate editor
of Gear. ``Most likely he was raised by his mother, a single mom,
so he has respect for women and appreciates women as a marvelous
creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time he has never been tested by a war, he
didn't grow up hunting or fishing or farming. He's not Ernest
Hemingway. He's an urban guy. So the way he tests himself is with
strenuous sports, the kind of activity you see in the movie Fight
Club, where a bunch of urban guys get together and bare-knuckle it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the ``400 percent bigger'' man, ``bigger
intellectually, bigger hopefully, bigger patriotically?'' What kind
of man is best adapted for the next century? Taken decade by
decade, what sort of men best summed up and symbolized the 20th
century's 10-year intervals?
</P>
<P>
   Right away one can see three striking trends in play. First: The
names multiply as time passes, and the visual media _ movies and
television _ impinge more and more on the American mind. It is hard
to come up with towering, mass-culture figures in the aught-years
and the teens, simply because there is no mass culture. But from
1920 onward, there are any number of male icons to choose from,
because more men are blowing their own horns or are being trumpeted
by the media.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are a dime a jillion. Since the '60s, fame has
become more fleeting. Names blaze up and are consumed almost
instantly, flying skyward like cinders.
</P>
<P>
   Second: The model men get younger and younger, decade by decade.
From the 1950s to the present, youth culture steadily displaces
adult culture. Bing Crosby's baritone, Paul Robeson's bass are
displaced by the infantile falsettos of Tiny Tim and Michael
Jackson. Strong male actors such as John Wayne, William Holden and
Gary Cooper are supplanted by youngsters such as Tom Cruise,
Matthew Broderick and Matt Damon. Elder statesmen such as Dwight D.
Eisenhower and Harry Truman are replaced by John F. Kennedy and Dan
Quayle. Even Ronald Reagan had to insist he never dyed his
jet-black hair.
</P>
<P>
   Third: Money. The current economic boom is empowering certain
young white men faster than at any time this century. ``Dot.com''
millionaires dot the landscape, and technogeeks with Midas touches
are worth a hundred times what their fathers ever earned. Even
though this dream of ready success is a mirage for most of us, the
illusion is still out there: You can be rich before you are 21, win
an Oscar before you are 25 and stay famous for a lot longer than 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Let us fanfold the century into neat, 10-year panes and recall
which men symbolized the best and the worst of each decade:
</P>
<P>
   THE AUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) is catapulted into the presidency
in 1901, when anarchist Leon Czolgosz shoots President William
McKinley to death at the Buffalo Exposition. To the dismay of the
Republican Party bosses who'd made Roosevelt vice president to
neutralize him, the young T.R. does more to revolutionize his party
and his country than anyone since Lincoln. He breaks up monopolies,
builds the Panama Canal, settles the Russo-Japanese war and makes
America a world naval power when he sends the Great White Fleet
around the globe in 1908. When he spares a bear cub on a hunting
trip in Mississippi, the Teddy Bear stuffed animal is born. It is
still with us.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford (1863-1947) founds the Ford Motor Company in 1903 and
puts America on wheels, selling 15 million black Model Ts by 1928.
A pacifist and an anti-Semite, Ford revolutionizes American
industry with techniques of mass production and gives us the
freedom and mobility to go anywhere we like _ and get stuck in
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Jack London (1876-1916), a ruggedly handsome and prolific
author, writes some of his best work in the aught-years, including
The Call of the Wild, The People of the Abyss, The Sea Wolf, White
Fang and The Iron Heel. The Iron Heel predicts the rise and fall of
global fascism and is a book that heavily influences George
Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford White (1853-1906), brilliant architect and lecher,
perhaps sums up the excesses of the last American decade before
income taxes. After seducing Evelyn Nesbit, ``The Girl in the Red
Velvet Swing,'' White is shot to death in Madison Square Garden _ a
building White himself had designed _ by Nesbit's enraged husband,
Harry Thaw. Onstage, a sextet sings, I Could Love a Million Girls.
</P>
<P>
   THE TEENS
</P>
<P>
   The decade is dominated by the luminous, quicksilver art form of
the movies. Charlie Chaplin (1889-1977), a British-born comedian,
becomes the most popular and recognized actor on the planet after
debuting in 1914. Even today, the Tramp with his twirling cane,
floppy shoes, mustache and bowler hat remains instantly
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   World War I is best summed up by two heroes, an officer and an
enlisted man: General John J. ``Black Jack'' Pershing (1860-1948)
who led the American Expeditionary Force to France, and Sgt. Alvin
York (1887-1964), a Tennessean who became the war's most decorated
hero after capturing 132 Germans in the battle of the Argonne on
Oct. 8, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   New York gangster Arnold Rothstein (1882-1928) is a convenient
villain: Rothstein fixes the 1919 World Series in what becomes
known as the ``Black Sox Scandal.'' Rothstein makes a handsome
profit, but four ballplayers, including ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson
(1888-1951), are banned from the game forever.
</P>
<P>
   THE TWENTIES
</P>
<P>
   Now the names multiply. Thanks to the cinema and the new
popularity of radio, hundreds of personalities, good and bad, flash
across the national consciousness. One of the most popular men
never existed: The Man in the Arrow Shirt, an ad creation.
</P>
<P>
   Author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) bears an uncanny
resemblance to the Arrow Shirt Man, and in his 1920s novels, This
Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby, he
celebrates the glitter of the Jazz Age.
</P>
<P>
   Hated by men, beloved by women, Rudolf Valentino (1895-1926), an
Italian-born actor from Castellaneta, dies of two perforated ulcers
and peritonitis. His wake is mobbed by 30,000 grief-stricken
people, mostly women.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, Babe Ruth (1895-1948) hits 60 home runs in 1927. Ruth
was a bit chubby to be a model and his off-field life won't bear
close scrutiny, but the Sultan of Swat still casts a long shadow
today.
</P>
<P>
   No one, before or since, ever reaches the pitch of idolatry
bestowed on Charles Lindbergh (1902-1974), whose 33-hour solo
trans-Atlantic flight in 1927, in a plane with no forward window,
makes him a virtual demigod. Lindbergh's later life was shadowed by
tragedy, the price of fame: His infant son is kidnapped and killed
in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   There are villains aplenty, too, many with Italian names.
Charles Ponzi (1883-1949) lends his name to a type of pyramid-fraud
still called a ``Ponzi Scheme,'' and Al Capone (1899-1947) becomes
the archetypal gangster of the decade, whose most famous
mass-murder was the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   THE THIRTIES
</P>
<P>
   The decade is dominated by Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945),
America's longest-serving president and the man who changes the
nation profoundly. Roosevelt battles the Depression with an
alphabet-soup of federal programs: the WPA, the CCC, the NRA and
TVA.
</P>
<P>
   In movies, Clark Gable (1901-1960) dominates, from Red Dust
(1933) to Gone With The Wind (1939). In literature, Ernest
Hemingway (1899-1961) writes The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To
Arms, Dashiell Hammett creates the hard-boiled private eye with The
Maltese Falcon, The Dain Curse, The Glass Key and The Thin Man.
</P>
<P>
   Banditti swarm across the American Midwest, robbing, kidnapping,
killing. None is more charismatic than John Dillinger (1903-1934),
who is finally shot to death after watching a Clark Gable movie,
Manhattan Melodrama, in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   THE FORTIES
</P>
<P>
   FDR still rules the first, fiery half of the decade, presiding
over World War II from Pearl Harbor to the invasion of Germany. In
this period, however, the real heroes are anonymous, generalized
types _ Bill Mauldin's Willy and Joe, Ernie Pyle's quiet
battlefield heroes, the six unidentified Marines atop Iwo Jima's
Mount Suribachi, raising the flag _ men who fight and die in an
immense, soundless, black-and-white distance, who never boast and
who do not even want to talk about what they've seen after they
make it back home.
</P>
<P>
   The stay-at-home men have all the fun and, curiously, suffer no
consequences for sitting this one out. Ronald Reagan spends the war
in the chow line in Hollywood and goes on to become president. John
Wayne (1907-1979) wriggles out of the U.S. Army after a few weeks
and proceeds to win the war on the movie set. Frank Sinatra
(1915-1998) has a wispy form and a honeysuckle voice that make him
a heart-throb for millions of lonely women. Furious G.I.'s note
that ``rats make women scream too.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks begin to come onstream with the triumphs of boxer Joe
Louis (1914-1981) and ballplayer Jackie Robinson (1919-1972),
though they are curiosities, more than mass culture heroes.
Baseball is still ruled by white stars such as Joe DiMaggio
(1914-1999) and Ted Williams (1918- ).
</P>
<P>
   One male icon isn't a man: Rosie the Riveter. Rosie becomes the
precursor for all the millions of women who will enter the
workplace in the second half of the century. She may be an ersatz
man, but she gets the job done just as well _ and for a lot less
pay.
</P>
<P>
   THE FIFTIES
</P>
<P>
   Here, precisely at mid-century, a sea-change sets in. Youth
culture, then counter-culture begin to challenge and ultimately
replace the status quo. The enormous postwar wealth of the United
States finds its way into youthful pockets in the form of
allowances and wages from part-time jobs, making them an economic
force to be reckoned with. Swing music is swept away by rock 'n'
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Presley (1935-1977), James Dean (1931-1955) and Marlon
Brando (1924- ) are the new men: young, surly, cocksure. ``What are
you rebelling against,'' Brando is asked in his first big film, The
Wild One. ``Whattaya got?'' he shoots back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatniks'' surface in the arts: Allen Ginsberg (1926-1999)
writes Howl in 1956, and Jack Kerouac (1922-1969) produces On the
Road in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Consummate wickedness appears in the person of Wisconsin Sen.
Joe McCarthy (1908-1957), whose communist witch-hunts ruin hundreds
of careers without ever unearthing the name of a single communist
spy. California congressman Richard Nixon (1913-1996) pursues
communists zealously, too, giving early promise of what Henry
Kissinger will later call his ``instinct for the jugular.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SIXTIES
</P>
<P>
   A season of tumult, war and assassinations, the Sixties begin
with crystalline promise on a wintry cold January day in Washington
with President-elect John F. Kennedy (1917-1963) announcing that
``the torch has been passed to a new generation.'' Within three
years, Kennedy would be in his grave, murdered, lying beneath his
own torch, an eternal flame in Arlington Cemetery. While alive, he
is perhaps the single most telegenic and charismatic president of
the century. He launches the Peace Corps, touches off the race to
the moon and single-handedly kills off the American haberdashery
business, by refusing to wear hats.
</P>
<P>
   After Kennedy's assassination, the Sixties reach a fork in the
road. They split in two and run down widely disparate paths.
Veterans of World War II and Korea cannot understand why young men
refuse to serve in Vietnam. Those who refuse display a different
kind of courage, going to jail, leaving the United States for
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts such as John Glenn (1921- ) and Neil Armstrong (1930-
) complete glorious odysseys in space, while on earth Dr. Timothy
Leary (1920-1996) urges young people to voyage within their skulls
with the aid of lysergic acid and Abbie Hoffman (1936-1989) leads
demonstrations in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles rule the pop music world, but the Rolling Stones,
Cream, the Who, Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape and Big Brother and
the Holding Company are only a few of the hundreds of rock bands
who periodically challenge the Fab Four's supremacy. Much of the
music openly celebrates drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Black heroes and anti-heroes can no longer be ignored by the
white culture: Dr. Martin Luther King (1929-1968), Muhammad Ali
(1942- ), Stokely Carmichael (1941-1998), Huey Newton (1942-1989)
and, at Woodstock, Jimi Hendrix (1942-1970) offer challenging new
icons to worship or curse.
</P>
<P>
   Villains: For many young men, their nightmare made flesh is Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey, head of the Selective Service Bureau, the man who
sees to it you get your draft notice. Others revile the serpentine
secretary of state, Henry Kissinger (1923- ). But the man who
really wrecked the whole decade is already dead: Lee Harvey Oswald
(1939-1963).
</P>
<P>
   THE SEVENTIES
</P>
<P>
   After the bacchanal of the Sixties, the Seventies are a massive
hangover, limp and headachy. The Vietnam War ends in an American
pullout and a total communist victory, with Cambodia and Laos
destroyed as an afterthought. This defeat hollows out the country.
Its wounds still smart today.
</P>
<P>
   Corrosive comedians such as Saturday Night Live's John Belushi
(1949-1982) and Bill Murray (1950- ) are worlds removed from the
folksy Will Rogers (1879-1935) of the 1930s. In baseball, Pete Rose
(1941- ) performs brilliantly _ then is exposed as a gambler.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping for purity and moral probity, the nation elects Jimmy
Carter president in 1976. Carter presides over the humiliation of
the Iran hostage situation, and a daring attempted rescue ends in
catastrophe. He is too good to be emulated, and the voters toss him
out after one term.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, '70s Man is almost invisible, legs hidden in bell-bottom
velour pants, heart hidden by enormous swollen neckties. The man
who sends Charlie's Angels out on their missions is never seen.
John Ritter (1948- ) of Three's Company is a male eunuch who lives
with two women but never touches either of them. Tom Selleck (1945-
) of Magnum P.I. is an ex-Vietnam veteran who is kept like a poodle
on the Hawaiian estate of an absent multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester Stallone (1946- ) makes the first, and best, of many
Rocky films in 1976. Rocky trains by punching cow cadavers in a
frosty meat-locker. Rocky is tough, but at the same time, dead cows
don't hit back. Stallone, who sat out the Vietnam War as a ski
instructor, beats the Viet Cong in Rambo II.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing says more about the decade than that its villain was the
president of the United States himself. Nixon resigns in August
1974, a presumed criminal who needed a pardon to escape prison.
</P>
<P>
   THE EIGHTIES
</P>
<P>
   After Vietnam, Grenada. Ronald Reagan (1911- ) sweeps to victory
over the hapless Carter in 1980, declares it is ``morning in
America again,'' and the Decade of Greed roars to life. The process
of hollowing-out begun in the Seventies continues apace. Villains
far outnumber heroes, and idols sprout clay feet.
</P>
<P>
   Financial con artists such as Michael Milken (1946- ) and Ivan
Boesky (1937- ) discover how to buy up prosperous, hard-working
companies with junk bonds and melt them down for cash. Both
eventually go to jail. Donald Trump (1946-) cuts a swathe through
Manhattan real estate. The savings and loan industry is
deregulated, and small banks fall like ninepins, leaving the
taxpayer to sweep up the debris. The deficit expands like an
exploding supernova with an incipient Black Hole in its middle.
Brokerage houses E.F. Hutton and Drexel Burnham Lambert eventually
plead guilty to massive fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Oliver North (1943- ) blubbers his way through the
Iran-Contra hearings and goes from Marine hero to the
document-shredder of history in just a few weeks _ proof of how
fast things move nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jackson (1958- ) makes Thriller, the most successful pop
album in history, in 1984, and goes from idol to accused pedophile
in just a few years _ more proof of the speed of events.
</P>
<P>
   Televangelists Jimmy Swaggart (1935- ) and Jim Bakker (1939- )
forget the commandment about adultery and are caught in flagrante.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Norris (1940- ) mops up the last, stubborn Viet Cong
resistance onscreen. But Norris learned his martial arts skills
from the graceful Bruce Lee (1940-1973), a Hong Kong-born fighter.
So the Asians win again, really.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, George Bush (1924- ) is elected president, claiming he
was ``out of the loop'' during the Iran-Contra imbroglio, that he
will never raise taxes and that he wants to be ``the education
president.'' All three pledges ring hollow. More Allied troops are
killed by friendly fire than by Iraqis in the Gulf War, but a
jubilant Bush declares ``We've licked the Vietnam syndrome.'' Two
years later he's turned out of office.
</P>
<P>
   THE NINETIES
</P>
<P>
   We are running out of space. In a few weeks we'll be out of
time. So we'll end with two names, two men, two wonks, two Bills.
They are the touchstones of the decade. They are so much with us,
neither needs explication.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton (1946- ).
</P>
<P>
   Gates (1955- ).

 &HT;    `Stiffed' is `not a pity festival' for men, author says
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a light workday for Susan Faludi,
whose new book, ``Stiffed; The Betrayal of the American Man,'' is
getting the kind of buzz authors can only dream of. She's sitting
in her room at Boston's Colonnade Hotel, a prisoner of the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been out of the room since I checked in. I have
seven phone interviews today,'' said Faludi, 41, a former Miami
Herald reporter whose previous book, ``Backlash,'' was on the New
York Times bestseller list for four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different media outlets these days. . . . So
doing a book tour these days is like being in the same room with
the carnivorous plant in ``The Little Shop of Horrors.'' It's just
this little horror-plant that keeps screaming, 'Feed me! Feed me!'
'' she laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Susan Faludi fed me:
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``Stiffed'' is a book that sets out to examine the pain and
sense of betrayal that American men supposedly feel nowadays. How
would you answer the criticism that with this book you are working
both sides of the street? Before, in ``Backlash,'' you were
attempting to explain and validate women's dissatisfaction with
inequities in American society, and you criticized men, or at least
some men _ date rapists for example. Now you seem to be trying to
make up to men, in an 'I feel your pain,' kind of way. Aren't you
trying to have it both ways?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. First of all, ``Backlash'' did not, in fact, attack men.
It was a book that was entirely about cultural institutions that
were telling women to back off their independence. What it attacked
was the media, Hollywood, the fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   And this book is not about feeling men's pain. It's not a pity
festival. Basically it's an attempt to do for men what feminism
does for women which is to say: 'It's not all in your head. It's
real. There are these cultural, social and economic sources that
have as much to do with shaping your experience as your hormones,
as your genetic makeup.'
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you are not an ideologue?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm too practical and interested in concrete and specific
things to be ideological or dogmatic. Being an ideologue goes
against nature with journalists. We see too many different things
in the real world to get ideological.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Just how hellish is this book tour?
</P>
<P>
   A. Today wasn't as bad as most days. I had to fly from New York
to Boston so that gave me an hour off. I checked into this hotel
here and I've been sitting in my room on the phone all afternoon,
one telephone interview after another. Seven interviews! I haven't
been out at all! But at least I've been talking to print
journalists. I haven't had to do television. Print journalists, at
least, actually read, and have ideas in their heads.
</P>
<P>
   But many days you have to get up at the crack of dawn and then
you run off to some morning show where you spend an hour in makeup.
It's not fun.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would you characterize the initial reaction to the book?
How are men reacting? How are women reacting?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's really too soon to say. I have a small, totally
anecdotal sense that both men and women are interested in it. When
I'm giving speeches I get some comments, but it's really too soon
to judge. Some men come up and slip me notes and whisper and say,
'This really describes how I feel. You're on to something.' They do
it with an enormous amount of embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Then you get comments from women about how brutally men rule the
world, so who cares? They deserve everything they get! Serves them
right!
</P>
<P>
   But most men don't rule the world. Quite a few feel as powerless
as women do. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. How long did it take you to write the book?
</P>
<P>
   A. Seven years. I spent a deliberately long time on it. It's
hard to excavate a kind of history of men's experience because
they're looked at as unchanging. 'Everyman' has always been the
same way. I was trying to find the lines of historical change for a
certain historical generation of men. I really wanted to follow
individual men and groups of men over long periods of time. You
can't do that in a few months. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Q. In one section you discuss the disillusionment a group of
football fans felt when the Cleveland Browns abandoned Cleveland
for Baltimore. In another you mention the nationwide angst over the
loss of the Vietnam War and the massacre at My Lai. Can you really
equate losing the Vietnam War with losing a football franchise?
</P>
<P>
   A. Of course not. I wouldn't equate those two at all. I was
attempting to explore how the idea of being a useful man in
society, how having a sense of public worth, rendering public
service, got eroded in all these different contexts. Some of them
are serious, some of them are trivial.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But isn't it true that misfortunes befall all people in all
times, that people lose their jobs, get divorced, lose wars, lose
football games, lose their faith? Why is this particular generation
of men any more ``stiffed'' than any previous generation?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because this generation had such a promise to it. We were
born into what was declared to be the beginning of the American
century. We were the most prosperous nation in the world. We had
the greatest economic prosperity in history.
</P>
<P>
   And there was this enormous drumroll. You've got John F. Kennedy
calling, calling on men, specifically young men, in his addresses.
It was this whole glorious period when fathers were going to pass
on to the sons all their knowledge, all the fruits of victory in
World War II, all their moral authority and their virtue, and force
of America being a beacon to world.
</P>
<P>
   And it all fell apart so dramatically. Take the space program.
The new frontier of space turned out to be an empty void where the
new pioneer was a guy strapped into a capsule. Instead of Normandy
we got Vietnam. Instead of a brotherhood , we got a situation where
young men offered a lifetime of service to a corporation and then
got downsized, thrown away like Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   And the thing that's really new, what I'm trying to detail in
this book, is the thing that came into this void: A social
breakdown. This commercial culture which has been building for a
hundred years since mass merchandising has come to define us all,
men and women both.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So buying into commercialism, letting the media define us, is
the common danger both men and women face?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. What this culture tells men is, forget about having a
useful role in society. Just as women were supposed to validate
their political progress by smoking Virginia Slims, men are now
supposed to live up to some wild consumer ideal of being a winner.
You've got to be biggest, fastest, hardest _ hardest almost in a
sexual sense. And this is completely unattainable. It's a goal
completely driven by commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it realistic to hope, as you say in your final chapter,
that men shouldtake their cue from the feminist movement, or that
male readers are going to seek counsel from a feminist?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't expect men to seek counsel from me. I'm not a
counsellor. I'm just trying to open up a discussion here, a
discussion that a lot of people are trying to open up in other
ways. It isn't about listening to me, as much as, 'Now here's this
thing that I've seen. I encountered a lot of men in my research who
all seemed to be on the same page.' Now it's up to the men to take
the ball and run with it.''

 &HT;    ``Iron Chef,'' presents the cooking contests of gastronomic
gladiators
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Picture this: You turn on the TV and
some sort of electron vortex out of a science fiction movie causes
a half-dozen programs past and present to zoom in on one channel.
Suddenly, you're watching ``Emeril Lagasse,'' ``Monty Python,''
``The Price is Right,'' a heavyweight championship fight, the
Democratic National Convention and The Mikado.
</P>
<P>
   All at once _ in Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Impossible to imagine? Tune in the Iron Chef on the Food Network
at 10 p.m. Friday or Saturday. It's beyond Must See TV; it's Must
See To Believe TV. Even after you've seen the Iron Chef, it's
almost impossible to describe, or categorize.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a cooking program from Japan is like calling Elvis a
singer from Tennessee _ true, but woefully inadequate to explain a
pop-culture phenomenon that blurs myth and reality.
</P>
<P>
   The setting is the fictitious but highly functional Kitchen
Stadium, presided over by a mysterious, eccentric gourmet named
Kaga. The show's premise is that Kaga has assembled the greatest
chefs in each of the world's great cuisines and invites a worthy
challenger, usually another accomplished chef, to battle one of
them each week.
</P>
<P>
   Kaga, who appears at the beginning and end of each show in an
Elvis-like sequined suit, is an actor. But his Iron Chefs are
legit, all from first-rate restaurants. The drama builds as they
rise out of a mist, one by one _ Iron Chef French, Chinese,
Japanese and Italian _ the same faces each week. Their bright robes
lend a Gilbert and Sullivan air to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Kaga sets the match in motion by introducing the challenger,
then calling out the Iron Chef who must do battle. Then he yanks
the veil from a bin containing the day's theme ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredient may be as mundane as potatoes or as exotic as
deeply marbled Mishima beef, described as the tenderest and
possibly dearest beef in the world. Sometimes, the choice is
puzzling to the Western palate: konyaku, for example, a stiff
gelatin made from tuber roots.
</P>
<P>
   Each chef must use the theme ingredient in each dish _ most
contestants make at least five in the allotted hour _ from
appetizer to dessert. (Just how big a hint the chefs get about the
theme ingredient before show time is one of those blurs on the
show's fact-fiction fault line.)
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out what the chefs are making and whether they're going
to steam, boil or stir-fry that tantalizing lump of squid brain is
an essential part of the fun. The viewer gets help from three
commentators, including roving floor reporter Ota Shinichiro, who
wades fearlessly among the scurrying chefs and their numerous
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   His discoveries are relayed to anchor Fukui Senji with a
high-pitched urgency that suggests Godzilla is breathing fire over
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fukui san!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go head, Ota.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry to interrupt! But the Iron Chef has just added butter to
his rice!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Butter in the rice? What is he thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Such occasional Western touches may shock the audience in Japan,
but routine preparations can be even more jarring on this side of
the Pacific. One chef began a mackerel challenge by cutting the
head off a fresh, whole fish _ and throwing everything else in the
garbage. Almost any dish containing fish innards draws oohs and ahs
from the moment the chef plucks the carcass clean.
</P>
<P>
   One Iron Chef sealed a recent victory with a dessert of fish
liver in bittersweet chocolate sauce!
</P>
<P>
   When the hour is up, it's left to a panel of four tasters to
determine whether the Iron Chef has upheld the honor of Kaga and
his fellow chefs. Several of the judges are regulars, including a
dour Japanese food critic fans have lovingly nicknamed the East
German Judge. Actors, rock singers and even politicians alternate
in the other seats.
</P>
<P>
   Their voices, like all the others on the show except Kaga's, are
dubbed into English with the original Japanese audible in the
background. The result is sometimes comedic, conjuring images of
low-budget Japanese movies. The incongruity is also unnerving;
female judges may sound like giggly Valley girls, while the Chinese
Iron Chef sounds like Ralph Kramden.
</P>
<P>
   Judging can be tough, and the Iron Chefs are not immune from
pointed criticism. (Woe to any chef who so masks the strong and
bitter flavor of fish innards that they cannot be truly
appreciated!) The chefs, already perspiring like boxers after their
hour-long workout, look genuinely agonized while awaiting the
results of the voting.
</P>
<P>
   There's no prize for winning, and the Lord High Executioner does
not await the loser, but the show is so popular in Japan that a
victory is said to boost a chef's career. Results, especially
upsets, are reported as news.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of ``Dallas'' or ``Dynasty'' at their pinnacles,
it's much bigger,'' says Matthew Stillman, manager of program
development for the Food Network.
</P>
<P>
   Original, non-dubbed episodes began winning American fans when
they first showed up on stations in a handful of cities a few years
ago. The show got a shot at winning a national U.S. audience in
July because Stillman was one of those fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was transfixed when I first saw the show four years ago,''
says Stillman, who was still in college way back then. ``One of the
first things I did when I got into program development was say,
'Hey, we should get this show.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many other fans the show has is unclear; Stillman
says only that the Food Network is available in 42 million homes,
about half of all homes with cable television. The network hasn't
yet promoted ``Iron Chef'' except to its own viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But a search of the World Wide Web turned up several fan sites
and numerous queries. One site, ironchef.com, includes details
about the show's personalities and clashes, including box scores on
the judging for each battle so far.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show's regular run on Japanese television recently
ended, with plans for less-frequent but even-bigger battles to
come, the Food Network has access to several hundred
never-seen-in-America episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Stillman says viewer reaction so far has been ``largely
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely people who are freaked out by it, like it's
a bad kung fu movie,'' he concedes. ``But there are more people who
get really excited about it. It's really so different from our
normal programming.''

 &HT;    Pardon me, but I'm no 'Survivor'
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mike Naidus says I'm The Prototype, the
precise kind of aging woman growing more and more conservative in
her closet who hates this new show he's working on. The show is
called ``Survivor,'' and it's called that for a reason. CBS is
going to take 16 strangers, put them on an empty island, and the
last one to leave gets $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Television of the '90s. Gotta love it.
</P>
<P>
   Except I hate it.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Mark Burnett, who also produces the show
``Eco-Challenge'' _ ``a TV adventure race into inhospitable
environments'' _ says he spent two years looking for the perfect
place for his show. It's off Borneo in the South China Sea. I'm
told Palau Tiga has just the right mix of danger. No poisonous
insects. No poisonous snakes. But there are flying foxes and weird
monkeys and huge lizards.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists will be chosen from the thousands of applications
CBS is expecting _ a video of yourself is part of the deal _ and
once they get to the island in March, practically everything these
Gilligans do will be caught on camera. They'll have remotes and
live crews rolling as they ``build shelter, catch food and
establish a new island society.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how CBS explains the show on its Web site and, by the
way, are you weirded out yet? Because I am.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will form a Tribal Council. Here you will openly debate
the group dynamics of the previous days. The council ends with a
secret ballot where each of you votes one of your fellow castaways
off the island. Over the weeks, one by one, more are eliminated
until only two remain.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the last seven people kicked off the island, who
have been watching the last two on camera, will vote on who wins.
CBS will air its show in the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The show's a little like MTV's ``Real World'' except when that's
over, those kids just go home to their same neurotic obsessions.
With Survivor there's the little matter of the $1 million. Burnett
says no one will be able to hide their real self for 49 days. And
all of us will watch as people argue and laugh and finagle for the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, who fashioned this show off a similar show in Sweden,
says his survivor will be someone successful and nice. Someone
creative and ingenious. ``You know whoever gets that money will be
a good person,'' says Burnett. His dream cast is a Catholic priest,
a 30-something New York cop, an aspiring model, an activist
housewife and ``someone who's totally into running in the woods.''
I didn't have the heart to remind him that Ted Kaczynski's busy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Burnett made no mention of wanting me, a 43-year-old
mother, wife and cynic with absolutely no interest in trying to
survive on some island for 49 days. But I'm not insulted. Really. I
wouldn't look that great on TV running from a flying fox. And
besides, how are those people going to keep their whites white
without Clorox for 49 days? I just don't get the whole thing.

 &HT;    Clearwater bed-and-breakfast has ample breakfasts, homey touches
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEARWATER, Fla. _ China plates clink against each other. Bacon
pops and sizzles. The refrigerator door opens with a soft static
tear, then shuts with a tight slap.
</P>
<P>
   The percussion could not be more perfect for the new morning.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Lanning makes a lyric call to the dining room from her
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how would you like your eggs?''
</P>
<P>
   Eggs?
</P>
<P>
   The guests at the Green Gables' table had not considered such a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Already there had been warm banana muffins, bagels and cream
cheese, fruit cups with fresh peaches and blueberries, whole grain
toast, honey and marmalade, yogurt and cereal, a coffee pot with
contents that would delight Colombian aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Eggs? Yes. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over easy, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanning runs her three-bedroom inn, Clearwater's only
bed-and-breakfast, with maternal devotion. Those who come to the
Green Gables are obliged to surrender to it.
</P>
<P>
   Well, most do, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some regulars have been able to resist. Among Lanning's favorite
tales is that of her first encounter with a group of six women, all
in their 80s and from Florida's west coast, who booked the inn for
a weekend reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw them come in, and they were white-haired, sweet ladies
who looked as though they had come from church,'' Lanning recalls.
``I thought I'd serve them some tea and cookies to make them feel
at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The snacks were received with meager enthusiasm. When Lanning
returned to the house later, she found out why.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women were playing poker, and all of them were drinking
Southern Comfort,'' she said. ``When they checked out, they left
liquor bottles all over the house. They had a great time and were
wonderful guests. They just didn't come for the tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanning and husband Tom bought the Green Gables nine years ago.
It overlooks a tidal pool a few hundred yards from the Intracoastal
and St. Joseph Sound, not far from the Dunedin city line. Built in
1910 as a grove house, the Green Gables has the feel of Old Florida
with its high-pitched roof, large screened front porch and many
windows to catch the sea breezes.
</P>
<P>
   The bedrooms are awash in colorful flowered fabrics and filled
with the homey clutter of past generations: old books, old photos,
old furniture sharing space with a new TV and VCR that's plugged
into 54-channel cable, so grandma can surf with the remote.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Gables is ideal for family reunions. Rent the whole
house, and within 48 hours you feel as if you own it. But be sure
the cat doesn't sneak in, OK?
</P>
<P>
   Lanning, herself a grandmother, lives next door and will see to
it that the breakfasts are hearty and the inconveniences minor.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit, a guest hurriedly departed, forgetting her
earrings on the bathroom sink.
</P>
<P>
   Lanning found them, folded them carefully in protective wrap,
and mailed them that day to the guest's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you didn't miss these too much,'' she wrote. ``I wanted
to make sure you got them back to wear for the weekend.''

 &HT;    Battle scene is uniquely unchanged in 135 years
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PICKETT'S MILL, Ga. _ In this leafy corner of north Georgia, on
the fringes of the city men died to capture and defend in 1864,
lies what is probably the single most unspoiled, most authentic,
most evocatively pristine battlefield in the whole long, fiery
struggle during the ``War Of the Rebellion,'' as the victorious
North called it.
</P>
<P>
   Among Civil War enthusiasts, Pickett's Mill is unique. It is, in
its way, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   All across the eastern United States, Civil War battlefields are
being nibbled, gobbled, diminished by urban sprawl. There are fewer
and fewer places you can go to feel the atmosphere of those days.
Even in the great battle-parks under federal control, such as
Gettysburg, Antietam, Shiloh, Vicksburg, Chickamauga and Manassas,
memorials and interpretive exhibits tend to turn the land into a
kind of cemetery, or museum, or showcase of the past, with water
fountains and souvenir shops, slide shows and lookout towers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Manassas, where ``Stonewall'' Jackson earned his name,
narrowly escaped hosting an adjacent Disney theme park some years
ago, and the Civil War Trust is putting out an urgent appeal for
money to rescue the Wilderness battlefield in northern Virginia
from the threat of an impending subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing is happening in Paulding County, northwest of
Atlanta, where a huge car-crazy city is expanding like a cosmic,
primordial ``Big Bang'' explosion of fleeing gas and dust.
Fortunately, the Pickett's Mill site was bought up 20 years ago by
the state of Georgia, which operates it as a quiet park today. It
is still hard to find, and on many mornings, you may have the place
to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   When you get there, there is a little selfish thrill of
discovery. Pickett's Mill was a minor engagement, compared to the
great battles of the Civil War. It did not shape the outcome of the
conflict. It was a sharp, short, hard-fought affair, a Southern
victory, but it only delayed the inevitable: the encirclement and
fall of Atlanta, the defeat of the South, the end of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Here, on May 27, 1864, well-entrenched Confederates beat back a
bold Union thrust toward the heart of Atlanta. The Northern assault
broke up into ill-organized, piecemeal attacks through difficult,
steep terrain, where gunpowder smoke obscured lines, and battle
flags became snagged in tree branches. It failed spectacularly, and
the bloody setback was so embarrassing that the commanding general,
William Tecumseh Sherman, omitted all mention of Pickett's Mill
from his official reports and later from his memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, there are only a tiny pepper-sprinkle of references
to it in Volume 38 of the huge, 128-volume Official Records of the
War of the Rebellion, published by the Union after the Civil War
was won and lost. Here is one, from Gen. Howard to Gen. Sherman,
complaining about the task he'd been assigned:
</P>
<P>
   ``GENERAL: I am on the ridge beyond the field that we were
looking at this morning. No person can appreciate the difficulty in
moving over this ground unless he can see it. I am on the east side
of the creek on which Pettitt's (Pickett's?) Mill is, facing south,
and am now turning the enemy's right flank, I think. A prisoner
reports two divisions in front of us, Cleburne's and Hindman's.''
</P>
<P>
   Very respectfully,
</P>
<P>
   O.O. HOWARD, Major-General
</P>
<P>
   Howard was ordered to attack anyway. It was a very lopsided
affair. The Union lost 1,600 men, the Confederates 400. Union
assaults were launched piecemeal. Troops became separated among
tangled woodlands, steep hillocks and twisting ravines.
Well-entrenched Confederates poured a lethal fire down on their
opponents and followed up the day's success with a punishing night
attack that wreaked further havoc on the long-suffering Federals.
One eyewitness later wrote that the attacking Union troops were
``moved by a common despair.'' They knew they'd been given an
impossible task to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Dead pine trees set afire during the battle burned in the dark,
illuminating the hills and hollows around Pumpkinvine Creek with
the weird glow of a ``hell hole,'' as some survivors described it.
The killing ground presented a ghastly sight the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beheld that which I cannot describe; and which I hope never
to see again, dead men meet the eye in every direction, and in one
place I stoped (sic) and counted 50 dead men in a circle of 30 ft.
of me,'' wrote Confederate Capt. Samuel T. Foster. ``It seems like
they have nearly all been shot in the head, and a great number of
them have their skulls bursted open and their brains running out
... I would have fainted if I had not passed on and got out of that
place as soon as I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer Ambrose Bierce, who as a young Union lieutenant
served at Pickett's Mill, wrote of it later in a short essay called
The Crime at Pickett's Mill, in which he attacked the foolishness
of high commanders and praised the good sense and bravery of
rank-and-file soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bierce predicted bitterly that despite ``acts of heroism and
devotion performed in scenes of awful carnage to accomplish the
impossible,'' the battle was ``foredoomed to oblivion,'' because
the Union attack had been beaten back. Indeed, after the war, the
place lapsed into obscurity, reverting to farmland and forest.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how it looks today. That is why Pickett's Mill is so
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   To see a battlefield, as it looked the day of the battle, as it
looked 135 years ago, unchanged, unbloodied, innocent of war and
weaponry, with only a few leaf-cloaked hillocks where entrenchments
once rose, where open ground still looks sunny and deadly, where
deep forests once rang with screams and explosions _ you have to
come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wary of using the word most or best, but Pickett's Mill is
probably the best-preserved small battlefield for 1864-65, when the
soldiers marched with one hand on the rifle and the other hand on
the shovel,'' said Edwin Bearss, historian emeritus for the
National Park Service and one of the gods of Civil War studies
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other relatively well-preserved battlefields _
Griswoldville, near Macon, where the Georgia militia, old men and
boys, marched out to confront Sherman's army and were slaughtered.
Then you've got the battle of the North Anna, 23-26 May, 1864, in
northern Virginia, but it's a very narrow battlefield, and the
lines of sight are getting intruded on by modern development, and
less than one-fifth of the entrenchments are left.''
</P>
<P>
   The ghostliest thing about Pickett's Mill, where three trails of
differing lengths and difficulty take the visitor through the
battlefield, is the vague hummocking-up of the old entrenchments.
There are no signs or show-and-tell markers. Visitors are given
little plastic-sheathed, folding walking guides to point them out.
It's like finding buried treasure, to come across one in a shady
glen, or near a boulder-strewn rise, beside Pumpkinvine Creek,
which still runs bubbling today as it did that day. You are asked
not to walk on them. They are original.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness Ambrose Bierce wrote later of an indescribable ``dead
line,'' a line beyond which no man in his right mind would advance,
a zone of murder that took shape in certain folds and hollows of
the place, in the minds of the combatants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the 'dead-line,' with its well-defined edge of
corpses _ those of the bravest. Where both sides are fighting
without cover _ as in a charge met by a counter-charge _ each has
its 'dead-line,' and between the two is a clear space _ neutral
ground, devoid of dead, for the living cannot reach it to fall
there.''
</P>
<P>
   You can still see this dead-line, in your mind's eye, at the
foot of Hazen's Hill, where more than 200 bodies were found the
morning after the battle that lasted well into the night.
Night-fighting was a rarity in the Civil War. Here, it is a
testament to the furious stubbornness of both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the landscape is one of the most picturesque in north
Georgia, deep-green in the heat of summer, with the clear waters of
Pumpkinvine Creek purling over stones flaked with glittering sparks
of mica. You can see the terrain better in wintertime, when the
trees have shed their leaves, but the battle was fought in late
spring, and this impenetrable forest was what the soldiers had to
contend with.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling landscape, strewn with dead men the morning after
the fight, struck a Confederate survivor, Lt. R.M. Collins, oddly:
``To look upon this and then the beautiful wild woods, the pretty
flowers as they drank in the morning dew, and listen to the sweet
notes of the songsters in God's first temples, we were constrained
to say, 'What is man and his destiny, to do such a strange thing?'

 &HT;    Just how vital are the first three years?
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At young Kenedy Franklin's level, everything is
a wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a woman walk by the window at the Ebenezer Child
Development Center sends the 9-month-old racing on all fours to
press his hands against the pane. The pink ball that teacher
Dorothy Casey shows him prompts Kenedy to thrust out his short arms
to grab. As foster grandmother Lois Manor sings the pattycake
rhyme, Kenedy's eyes widen and he flashes an open-mouth,
two-toothed grin.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in Kenedy's tiny brain as he soaks in all the
activity is the focus of a new debate among scientists and advocacy
groups over what happens in a child's brain in the first three
years of life and what, if anything, parents can do to make their
children smarter.
</P>
<P>
   A tidal wave of information and news reports on how young
children's minds develop has spurred a plethora of child-rearing
magazines and organizations and a burgeoning industry of
educational toys, games, CDs, books and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Along with car seats and diaper pails, parents now find videos
that boast they can make children smarter or learn faster.
Classical music CDs are hawked with claims that playing them will
improve a baby's IQ. Graphically patterned crib mobiles are touted
as providing the right visual stimuli for newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that what a child experiences in the first few
years of life largely determines how his brain will develop and how
he will interact with the world throughout his life,'' says a
brochure by Zero to Three Foundation, a national advocacy
organization in the early childhood development movement. The
movement's key tenets include that what a child learns in the
earliest years lasts forever, and that unrepeatable opportunities
for sculpting a child's brain occur only during the first three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clamor has come criticism that such claims and
statements are largely myth.
</P>
<P>
   John Bruer, author of the recently published ``The Myth of the
First Three Years,'' says that purveyors of the ``myth'' _ whom he
identifies as the media, advocacy groups such as Zero to Three and
I Am Your Child, and some politicians _ have misinterpreted
selected pieces of rather old brain science to support their views
about early child development, parenting practices and child-care
standards.
</P>

   ``Neuroscience provides no evidence that the first three years
are a critical or the critical period'' of a child's life, said
Bruer, also president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation of St.
Louis, which specializes in education and child development.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics are not quite as harsh, but they agree there has
been overstatement about growing better brains in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful for babies to listen to Mozart. It's
tremendous for parents to be spending more time talking to their
children,'' said Jack Shonkoff, dean of the Heller Graduate School
at Brandeis University in Massachusetts and a pediatrician. ``What
I'm against are beliefs that if we spend money on this kind of toy
or game, that we will create smarter babies. ... Hogwash.''
</P>
<P>
   Passion for the new early child learning practices runs high. In
Texas, First Lady Laura Bush has made early childhood education her
personal cause and helped organize a conference around it. Other
states give classical music recordings to newborns or require
state-funded day-care centers to play it. Vice President Al Gore
has made universal preschool a plank in his presidential campaign
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Such devotees fear Bruer's criticism may undo what they believe
their message has accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just when we are getting parents to pay attention, he writes
in and says, `Don't bother,''' said Jill McRae, who coordinates
community outreach for the Connections Resource Center in Austin.
The center provides free information on child care and child
rearing and holds parenting classes on various topics, including
brain development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me,'' McRae said, ``that he would halt what I see
as progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfft.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenedy makes a ras-- berry at caregiver Dorothy Casey at the
Ebenezer center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pfft,'' she raspberries back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello? It's for Kenedy,'' she says, as she hands him the
receiver of a pink plastic toy phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us to make gestures and move our mouths because they
like that,'' said Casey, 57, relating some of the lessons of her
child development studies.
</P>
<P>
   She did such things while raising her two sons, but not because
scientific research said to. ``You know what babies are supposed to
do, and so you do what comes normally,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that what she's learned about how children's
brains get wired, or don't, in response to their environment and
stimulation has made her more diligent about her interaction with
young children.
</P>
<P>
   The teachings of the early childhood movement are evident at the
Ebenezer center, on East 10th Street, which cares for infants to
5-year-olds. Each classroom has a radio/cassette recorder, and
teachers play Mozart, usually at nap time. Gospel and Latin music
also are played.
</P>
<P>
   Ebenezer has always played music, ``but since all the research
has come out, I have been acquiring tapes, especially Mozart,''
said center director Karlene Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   She also may suggest exercises from books such as ``Brain Games
for Babies.'' The book includes games such as Follow the Action, in
which parents make different expressions and faces to their
children to develop vision and hearing, and Where Is the Sound? in
which parents hide a musical toy and try to get their baby to look
in its direction. The book says this game will heighten a baby's
awareness and help wire his or her brain.
</P>
<P>
   The games, the interaction and the contact have always been
stressed at Ebenezer, Bennett said, but reports on brain science
have strengthened her belief that the practices profoundly affect
her wards' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what brain development (research) does; it really
focuses on the child,'' Bennett said. ``If this was not important,
we could just sit here and just watch them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the root of the controversy is what scientists know or don't
know about how the human brain develops.
</P>
<P>
   There is wide consensus that from about birth through at least
the first year, an infant develops trillions of synapses _ the
connections between brain cells, or neurons. At birth, infants have
the same synaptic density _ the number of synapses in theircortical
tissue _ as adults. Rapid synapse formation following birth hits a
plateau at puberty, and then synapse densities decline to adult
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also know that there are important periods during
which, given the right stimulation, brain circuitry develops.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is much disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, some groups and marketers have tried to link the
number of synapses with intelligence and maintain that the amount
of parental interaction with a child controls synapse formation.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruer and other researchers say rapid synaptic formation is
largely the result of genetics, not environment. He and others say
it's a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of scientific findings
to say that synapse growth can be encouraged with stimulation, or
that when rapid synapse formation ends, so does the opportunity for
learning certain skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not know how the micro-organization of the brain is
affected by experiences a child has in early years,'' Bruer said.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Gopnik, a psychology professor and author of ``The
Scientist in the Crib,'' agrees. Scientists do not believe that
babies are ``stimulus response machines, where you have to put a
penny in at the right moment to get a gum ball,'' she said. But she
says that behavioral science shows children learn a lot and learn
very complex ideas in their early years, such as that some of the
figures moving around them are other people.
</P>
<P>
   Bruer and others say that while there are key periods for the
early development of vision, hearing and language, these systems
develop fine in any normal environment. The periods have different
time spans, some extending into adolescence, others tapering
gradually.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, there are no critical periods for using
computers, learning a musical instrument or even for social and
emotional development. Claims that children learn more and more
quickly at this time than at other times in their life have not
been substantiated either by brain or behavioral science,'' Bruer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of early childhood theories agree that there has been
some overstatement of what neuroscience shows, but they say Bruer
himself goes too far in what he paints as myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he has as one of his basic premises that the
neuroscientist evidence has been overstated. I do not quarrel with
that,'' said Matthew Melmed, executive director of Zero to Three.
But Melmed also says Bruer oversimplifies the messages of his group
and I Am Your Child, which was founded by filmmaker Rob Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My response to Bruer is there is very strong empirical and
clinical evidence that the first three years of life are
valuable,'' Melmed said. ``Cognitive pathways are laid, and those
are central to who we become as adults. This brain science issue is
not where we at Zero to Three or other researchers are focusing or
staking our positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Melmed said his group does not tell parents that the first three
years of a child's life are the critical period for learning. But
he says it does consider those years akin to laying the foundation
of a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we say is during the first three years, they create the
foundation for everything that follows,'' Melmed said. ``That
doesn't mean that it's over after 3, but we think it's critically
important for the public to know you learn a tremendous amount by
the time you are 3 and your expectations of the world are being
formed and who you become as an adult are being formed by how
people interact with you or don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has not prompted any changes in I Am Your Child
literature or messages, said Ellen Gilbert, director and cofounder
of the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based national education campaign on
early childhood development. Last year, the group was successful in
getting voters to approve a tax on cigarettes in California to
raise revenue for early child development projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very confident that what we are promoting _ even if you
were to throw every bit of science out the door _ we are promoting
what we should be promoting to parents,'' Gilbert said. ``It's
advice for parents to be involved in their children's lives ...
Anyone who's raised a child gets it and doesn't need scientific
charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Nelson, a University of Minnesota professor of child
psychology, neuroscience and pediatrics, said the emphasis on the
early years is pressuring parents and filling them with anxiety
about making a mistake that could affect their children for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's setting parents up to feel nothing but guilt,'' said
Nelson, whose praise for Bruer's work is on the book's jacket.
``All new parents feel typically overwhelmed, and they lack the
confidence to be a good parent, and this is exactly the type of
thing to make that worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Shonkoff, the Brandeis dean, said the debate, in the end, is
probably confusing parents more. The points they should remember,
he said, are that the first three years are important.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are the next three years,'' he said, ``and the next three
years and the next three years after that.''

 &HT;    Just how vital are the first three years?
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At young Kenedy Franklin's level, everything is
a wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a woman walk by the window at the Ebenezer Child
Development Center sends the 9-month-old racing on all fours to
press his hands against the pane. The pink ball that teacher
Dorothy Casey shows him prompts Kenedy to thrust out his short arms
to grab. As foster grandmother Lois Manor sings the pattycake
rhyme, Kenedy's eyes widen and he flashes an open-mouth,
two-toothed grin.
</P>
<P>
   What's going on in Kenedy's tiny brain as he soaks in all the
activity is the focus of a new debate among scientists and advocacy
groups over what happens in a child's brain in the first three
years of life and what, if anything, parents can do to make their
children smarter.
</P>
<P>
   A tidal wave of information and news reports on how young
children's minds develop has spurred a plethora of child-rearing
magazines and organizations and a burgeoning industry of
educational toys, games, CDs, books and other materials.
</P>
<P>
   Along with car seats and diaper pails, parents now find videos
that boast they can make children smarter or learn faster.
Classical music CDs are hawked with claims that playing them will
improve a baby's IQ. Graphically patterned crib mobiles are touted
as providing the right visual stimuli for newborns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now clear that what a child experiences in the first few
years of life largely determines how his brain will develop and how
he will interact with the world throughout his life,'' says a
brochure by Zero to Three Foundation, a national advocacy
organization in the early childhood development movement. The
movement's key tenets include that what a child learns in the
earliest years lasts forever, and that unrepeatable opportunities
for sculpting a child's brain occur only during the first three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clamor has come criticism that such claims and
statements are largely myth.
</P>
<P>
   John Bruer, author of the recently published ``The Myth of the
First Three Years,'' says that purveyors of the ``myth'' _ whom he
identifies as the media, advocacy groups such as Zero to Three and
I Am Your Child, and some politicians _ have misinterpreted
selected pieces of rather old brain science to support their views
about early child development, parenting practices and child-care
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neuroscience provides no evidence that the first three years
are a critical or the critical period'' of a child's life, said
Bruer, also president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation of St.
Louis, which specializes in education and child development.
</P>

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ If Colt's Manufacturing goes through with its
reported plan to quit the retail handgun business after 144 years,
it may be doing the right thing, but it will be doing it for the
wrong reason. Litigation is a poor substitute for politics as an
instrument of public policy, even when the fallout is in the public
good, as is the case here. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ THUN, Switzerland _ I am sitting in a
delicious little restaurant in this equally delicious lakeside town
scarfing down a pizza that is the best I have tasted in years.
Nevertheless, I am choking. There is so much cigarette smoke
floating around the establishment that I find it difficult to
breathe. I didn't realize until this visit how far ahead of the
rest of the world we Americans are when it comes to grappling with
smoking and its effects. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ It seems a couple of elementary
schools in the Atlanta area have yanked 2,300 textbooks from the
classroom because some folks (two of them, I think) are objecting
to a full-page reproduction of a portrait of George Washington
crossing the Delaware. What's the problem? (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ If doctors could do with the body
politic what they did with Rees Paap's brain, things would run
smoother for a time. The Waco man is as optimistic as a sufferer of
a degenerative neural disease _ Parkinson's disease _ could be.
Surgeons at Dallas' Presbyterian Hospital made two strategic
lesions on the brain of the 49-year-old Netherlands native in May.
It was like the surgery that made it possible for Michael J. Fox to
return to ``Spin City'' _ miraculous. But no cure. That's what Paap
wants. And a monster breakthrough that could lead to a cure for
Parkinson's, diabetes and a host of other diseases has patients and
the medical community buzzing. Now politics needs to stay out of
the way. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN _ Medical science in the 20th century has been so
effective at correcting bad health that it has begun to focus on
maintaining good health. But all too often, people find that greed,
laziness and ignorance in the health-care industry is blocking
their path to the knowledge and technology that could save or
improve their lives. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mike Naidus says I'm The
Prototype, the precise kind of aging woman growing more and more
conservative in her closet who hates this new show he's working on.
The show is called ``Survivor,'' and it's called that for a reason.
CBS is going to take 16 strangers, put them on an empty island, and
the last one to leave gets $1 million. Television of the '90s.
Gotta love it. Except I hate it. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Last weekend Nellie and
I and my brother, Steve, went to my parents' house and helped them
throw away 30 years of accumulated junk. By helping them, I mean we
lovingly chloroformed them and duct-taped them to their twin
Barcaloungers so we didn't have to listen to their pathetic cries
of ``Don't throw that out!'' and ``I'm saving that!'' We were
ruthless, totally without ruth, until Nellie came across a magazine
that must have accompanied them through at least five changes of
domiciles. What was uncovered (literally!) was a Playboy
magazine/time capsule. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   JOURNAL-HONDURAS _ MARCOVIA, Honduras - It seems relatively
simple: a nation torn apart by Hurricane Mitch's raging floods
needs to be rebuilt. Donor countries and international charities
step in, providing millions in aid to rebuild infrastructure and
hundreds of volunteers to help provide housing. Slowly, roads are
cleared, washouts filled in, temporary bridges installed and
hundreds of new cement block houses are constructed. But a year
after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a poor country
devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy - at least not if
you want to address the underlying problems that made the disaster
so much worse than it might have been. (Williams, Cox News

<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ If Colt's Manufacturing goes through with its
reported plan to quit the retail handgun business after 144 years,
it may be doing the right thing, but it will be doing it for the
wrong reason. Litigation is a poor substitute for politics as an
instrument of public policy, even when the fallout is in the public
good, as is the case here. (Teepen, Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ THUN, Switzerland _ I am sitting in a
delicious little restaurant in this equally delicious lakeside town
scarfing down a pizza that is the best I have tasted in years.
Nevertheless, I am choking. There is so much cigarette smoke
floating around the establishment that I find it difficult to
breathe. I didn't realize until this visit how far ahead of the
rest of the world we Americans are when it comes to grappling with
smoking and its effects. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED
MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ It seems a couple of elementary
schools in the Atlanta area have yanked 2,300 textbooks from the
classroom because some folks (two of them, I think) are objecting
to a full-page reproduction of a portrait of George Washington
crossing the Delaware. What's the problem? (Schuett, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ If doctors could do with the body
politic what they did with Rees Paap's brain, things would run
smoother for a time. The Waco man is as optimistic as a sufferer of
a degenerative neural disease _ Parkinson's disease _ could be.
Surgeons at Dallas' Presbyterian Hospital made two strategic
lesions on the brain of the 49-year-old Netherlands native in May.
It was like the surgery that made it possible for Michael J. Fox to
return to ``Spin City'' _ miraculous. But no cure. That's what Paap
wants. And a monster breakthrough that could lead to a cure for
Parkinson's, diabetes and a host of other diseases has patients and
the medical community buzzing. Now politics needs to stay out of
the way. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   LAMB-COLUMN _ Medical science in the 20th century has been so
effective at correcting bad health that it has begun to focus on
maintaining good health. But all too often, people find that greed,
laziness and ignorance in the health-care industry is blocking
their path to the knowledge and technology that could save or
improve their lives. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mike Naidus says I'm The
Prototype, the precise kind of aging woman growing more and more
conservative in her closet who hates this new show he's working on.
The show is called ``Survivor,'' and it's called that for a reason.
CBS is going to take 16 strangers, put them on an empty island, and
the last one to leave gets $1 million. Television of the '90s.
Gotta love it. Except I hate it. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Last weekend Nellie and
I and my brother, Steve, went to my parents' house and helped them
throw away 30 years of accumulated junk. By helping them, I mean we
lovingly chloroformed them and duct-taped them to their twin
Barcaloungers so we didn't have to listen to their pathetic cries
of ``Don't throw that out!'' and ``I'm saving that!'' We were
ruthless, totally without ruth, until Nellie came across a magazine
that must have accompanied them through at least five changes of
domiciles. What was uncovered (literally!) was a Playboy
magazine/time capsule. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   JOURNAL-HONDURAS _ MARCOVIA, Honduras - It seems relatively
simple: a nation torn apart by Hurricane Mitch's raging floods
needs to be rebuilt. Donor countries and international charities
step in, providing millions in aid to rebuild infrastructure and
hundreds of volunteers to help provide housing. Slowly, roads are
cleared, washouts filled in, temporary bridges installed and
hundreds of new cement block houses are constructed. But a year
after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a poor country
devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy - at least not if
you want to address the underlying problems that made the disaster
so much worse than it might have been. (Williams, Cox News
Service). 20. WITH MUG OF WILLIAMS.

But you can select for yourself just what employee benefits you
want the company to pay for. For young workers in particular, this
is a chance to make some important decisions about insurance and
other benefits, to start their savings plans and perhaps to cut
their income taxes. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

and the rest of the auto industry look at the bottom line: The
Cavalier is Chevy's best-selling sedan. The 2000 Cavalier gets some
exterior tweaking _ body-color trim and repackaged taillamps _ and
some mechanical and interior refinements. (DeVault, Atlanta

   WINTERS-HONOR _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Jonathan Winters says he's proud
to be a Buckeye. The Dayton-born comedian, actor, painter and
writer has even been known to carry around a handful of the hard
brown nuts to pass out to people he meets. ``What's this? A
chestnut?'' he says, adopting the voice of a Hollywood society
dame. ``No,'' he answers himself, ``it's a poison nut we use in
Ohio to feed to dummies and Michiganites.'' The revery is vintage
Winters. Funny, off-the cuff and slightly off-kilter, with some
subtle social commentary thrown in for good measure. It was just
this ability to make us laugh, while at the same time revealing the
vagaries of human nature, that led the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., to name Winters the 1999
recipient of its prestigious Mark Twain Prize, which will be
awarded to him Wednesday. (Simmons, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   GOOD-TVSHOWS _ TV is having one of its best years _ ever. There
are so many good shows on network TV, my four VCRs are working

Weather Girls? Well, it's raining TV shows. And I don't mind
getting drenched. But where are all the great new sitcoms? While
dramas _ new and old _ continue to flourish, sitcoms are sinking
fast. (Thompson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   IRON-CHEF _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Picture this: You turn on

movie causes a half-dozen programs past and present to zoom in on
one channel. Suddenly, you're watching ``Emeril Lagasse,'' ``Monty
Python,'' ``The Price is Right,'' a heavyweight championship fight,
the Democratic National Convention and The Mikado. All at once _ in
Japanese. Impossible to imagine? Tune in the Iron Chef on the Food
Network at 10 p.m. Friday or Saturday. It's beyond Must See TV;
it's Must See To Believe TV. Even after you've seen the Iron Chef,
it's almost impossible to describe, or categorize. (Kalajian, Palm

   BIG-MEN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``There is not a man here who
does not feel 400 percent bigger in 1900 than he did in 1896,
bigger intellectually, bigger hopefully, bigger patriotically,
bigger in the breast from the fact that he is a citizen of a
country that has become a world power for peace, for civilization
and for the expansion of its industries and the products of its
labor,'' proclaimed Sen. Chauncey Depew of New York as the century
turned on its hinge, nearly 100 years ago. ``The man who is moving
into the 21st century is a virile man, but not a stupid virile
man,'' said Jason Harper, associate editor of Gear magazine. ``Most
likely he was raised by his mother, a single mom, so he has respect
for women and appreciates women as a marvelous creation. ``But at
the same time he has never been tested by a war, he didn't grow up
hunting or fishing or farming. He's not Ernest Hemingway. He's an
urban guy. So the way he tests himself is with strenuous sports,
the kind of activity you see in the movie ``Fight Club,'' where a
bunch of urban guys get together and bare-knuckle it out.'' What

intellectually, bigger hopefully, bigger patriotically?''

Timothy McVeigh's missing license plate as he sped out of Oklahoma
City in 1995, the notorious bomber might have vanished. McVeigh's
arrest is probably the most dramatic example police officers call
up as they defend the use of traffic stops as a tool for
investigating more serious crimes. But civil libertarians counter
that minorities, rather than McVeighs, are the most likely targets
for traffic stops. By KIM COBB.
</P>
<P>
   GUT-WORMS (Undated) _ It turns out parasites may not be so bad
for our health. A University of Iowa researcher believes regular
doses of worms may be the key to treating people with inflammatory
bowel disease, a serious and baffling disorder that affects at
least 1 million people nationwide. He's got the initial study to
prove it and a broader study is in the works. By LEIGH HOPPER.
</P>
<P>
   ANTARCTIC-PHYSICIAN (Glenville, N.Y.) _ The dramatic and
historic military rescue of an ill physician trapped on Earth's
southern tip may be made into a book or film. But the sale of Dr.
Jerri Nielsen's story could bring her riches that may never
compensate for a priceless commodity: good health. By LINDA
TRISCHITTA.
</P>
<P>
   LASER-SURGERY (San Francisco) _ The explosive growth in laser
eye surgery _ fast becoming the most common corrective surgery in
the nation _ is producing cut-rate prices and prompting thousands
of patients to seek even deeper discounts in Canada. By ULYSSES
TORASSA.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   JUMP-ROPE (Albany, N.Y.) _ Just 15 minutes of jumping rope can
burn nearly 200 calories, with the added benefits of developing
agility, coordination and a healthy heart. Long used as a training
tool for boxers, jumping rope is increasingly popular among tennis
and basketball players and at health clubs, where fitness
instructors are adding it to aerobics and kick-boxing classes. By
SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   SLEEP-GLOVES (Delmar, N.Y.) _ Larry Leavitt, an inveterate
tinkerer with the air of an absent-minded professor, recently
received approval for his first patent _ gloves that can detect
when a driver is falling asleep at the wheel. By PAUL GRONDAHL.
</P>
<P>
   BIRDS-TRACING (San Francisco) _ For a century, ornithologists
using the time-honored tools of leg bands and binoculars have tried
and failed to track the migration routes of songbirds. Now along
comes evolutionary biologist Thomas B. Smith, one of the first to
use genetic markers to link populations of songbirds as they breed
in the north and winter in the south. By JANE KAY.
</P>
<P>
   MIGRATING-BUTTERFLIES (Undated) _ On a mild October morning, a
single monarch butterfly wafted from a patch of scrub trees, dying
goldenrod and aster in a littered grove, hovered erratically, then
darted away.But where to? This monarch may have joined its dead
mates, riddling the roadside or stuck to a windshield wiper. As
likely, the monarch may have found the Hudson River, using it as a
guide to continue an amazing, arduous migration, as long as 2,000
miles from Canada to Mexico. By MICHAEL LOPEZ.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-CHILDREN (Undated) _ Parents can control what television
programs they watch, but they have absolutely no control, or
warning, over advertisements. Some of the ads, notably beer spots
during sporting events and other commercials hawking alcohol and/or
containing violent or sexually suggestive content, have become the
norm. This is not a prude's standpoint. It just is. By MARK
McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   FINANCIAL/BUSINESS NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-TIME (San Francisco) _ Too many companies and
industries are still in an old-fashioned time zone, not realizing
that the Internet not only has increased competition, but has made
people more impatient with the old ways of doing business. By DAVE
MURPHY.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BBA-KNAPP-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The best play of the baseball
season violated its most fundamental rule. In fact, ``touch 'em
all'' has risen above the game, becoming a universal prescription
for excellence through thoroughness. But let's salute Robin Ventura
for his sloppiness, for disregarding the fundamentals. He touched
only one base in the 15th inning Sunday night, skipping the last
three, turning a grand slam into a single. By GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ The 49ers' special teams are
suffering the effects of the league's salary cap that forces out
journeymen. Left are the stars and rookies. By BRUCE ADAMS.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ At times like this, I'm glad I
don't do endorsements. If I did endorsements, I might have to do
what The Examiner's editorial board did, and endorse Mayor Willie
Brown for re-election on Nov. 2. I know that sounds like an
endorsement, but it isn't. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Niskayuna, N.Y.) _ The real problem with the
burgeoning population on Spaceship Earth is that fully a third of
the world, the most fertile members of the population, lives in
utter and abject destitution. We need to finance population control
and health care for them and help them reduce the number of
children they produce in conditions of extreme misery. By DAN
LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ David Knight, an Air Force
Academy graduate, fighter pilot and Gulf War veteran, is mightily
estranged from his father, a former test pilot, Air Force colonel
and now-conservative Republican legislator from Palmdale, Calif.
Despite (or, as some suspect, because of) a gay brother who died of
AIDS and his gay son, the elder Knight has sponsored next election
season's anti-homosexual proposition: the ``Definition of
Marriage'' initiative. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICALLY-CORRECT (Santa Maria, Calif.) _ Many of us look with
great reservation at the age of political correctness that now
engulfs us. It is Victorianism all over again, with a heavy net
descending upon anything resembling freedom of speech. The P.C.
thought patrol works overtime to dictate what is, and what is not,
acceptable speech. Casual conversation in the workplace can be a
springboard to accusations of sexual harassment. By DONALD G.
SMITH.

   WRESTLING: AL SNOW: According to the old saying, two heads are
better than one. But don't try telling that to one of the security
ladies working at the Dayton International Airport in Ohio. Let Al
Snow explain _ it's his head and tale: ``I was flying out somewhere
and put my garment bag down at the security checkpoint,'' says the
popular World Wrestling Federation performer who lives in Lima,
Ohio, and uses the Dayton airport to get to many of the 200 to 250
shows he wrestles in each year. ``They saw something when the bag
went through the X-ray machine, so they asked if they could look
inside.'' As the checkpoint lady rooted through the bag, she pushed
aside the title belt and found herself staring at a severed head.

   &UR; FOCUS (Available by 5 p.m., Fri., Oct. 22) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY CRASHES: The U.S. military routinely sends into the air
planes and helicopters that it knows are plagued with deadly safety
problems. An 18-month Dayton Daily News examination finds that
planes keep falling from the sky for the same reasons, that
hundreds of crashes can be linked to maintenance errors and that
the military keeps hundreds of crashes off its yearly accident
totals.
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-CASE: After an F-16 crashed into a South Carolina
neighborhood and killed a man, the Air Force assured the
congressman representing the district that the plane had been
``trouble free.'' But a Dayton Daily News investigation found that
in the months preceding the Sept. 13, 1988, crash, the engine had
been on two other F-16s and removed after pilots reported smoke and
fumes in their cockpits.

Snow explain _ it's his head and tale: ``I was flying out somewhere
and put my garment bag down at the security checkpoint,'' says the
popular World Wrestling Federation performer who lives in Lima,
Ohio, and uses the Dayton airport to get to many of the 200 to 250
shows he wrestles in each year. ``They saw something when the bag
went through the X-ray machine, so they asked if they could look
inside.'' As the checkpoint lady rooted through the bag, she pushed
aside the title belt and found herself staring at a severed head.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Striding into his office at Aero Vironment Inc. in Monrovia,
Calif., on a June afternoon, a slightly rumpled-looking Paul
MacCready juggles an armful of folders with a bag of take-out Thai
and apologizes for his tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up until 3 a.m. the past few nights working on some
projects,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of projects? The gray-haired 74-year-old company
founder hesitates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are patent and proprietary concerns ...'' he says. But
then his enthusiasm gets the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have found a way to make exercise addicting,'' he says,
launching into an energetic description of his ``Micro Gym,'' a
pocket-size exercise machine with a pulse meter that vibrates when
the user reaches an optimal heart rate. ``Just enough exercise to
get that rush of endorphins that will make you want to do it
again,'' MacCready says. ``Wouldn't that be a great service to
humanity?''
</P>
<P>
   From anyone else, the idea might seem pure fantasy. But
MacCready has a knack for making the fantastic real.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the mild-mannered aeronautical engineer designed the
first plane powered solely by human effort _ a furiously pedaling
pilot _ capable of sustained flight.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Gossamer Condor, the flying machine now sits
alongside the Wright Brothers' Flyer and Charles Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Gossamer Albatross, a design offspring of
the Condor, was pedaled 22.25 miles across the English Channel,
cementing MacCready's place in aviation history. Soon after,
MacCready was named Engineer of the Century by the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, MacCready was just getting started. In 1980, he
designed the Solar Challenger, the world's first piloted
sun-powered airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he set jaws dropping by creating a
computer-controlled, wing-flapping replica of a pterodactyl for the
Smithsonian's film ``On the Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1987, back on Earth, a team of six drivers won a
1,867-mile Australian road race with his Sunraycer, an electric
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's not afraid of making mistakes or dealing with
resistance,'' says Ray Morgan, director of Aero Vironment's Design
Development Center, who has worked with MacCready since the 1970s.
``He's known for saying, 'I bet if we try it this way ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the man called the ``father of human-powered flight''
aims to soar ever higher. Working with NASA support, his team at
Aero Vironment is building a new generation of lightweight
solar-powered planes designed to ascend high into the stratosphere
and then remain there for several months.
</P>
<P>
   A craft called Helios could monitor atmospheric conditions and
perhaps serve as a communications station for relaying high
bandwidth video and teleconferencing signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero Vironment team is also busy designing micro air
vehicles, palm-size battery-powered crafts that look like toys but
are equipped with tiny video cameras that could provide real-time
reconnaissance for soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas are always germinating,'' MacCready says. His office is
lined with file cabinets labeled ``Active'' and ``Less Active,''
the latter for projects _ like a hamster-powered miniplane _ that
he hasn't yet perfected but won't give up on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dogged,'' he admits. ``Irrationally persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for his most noted achievements, the Gossamer
projects, came in the early 1970s, when a relative had to default
on a business loan, and MacCready, who had co-signed the note,
suddenly found himself owing $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for a way to pay it back, he recalled an
18-year-old challenge that had been offered by British
industrialist Henry Kremer to the first person who could complete a
1.15-mile-long figure-eight course using human-powered flight. The
prize? $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conventional ways to achieve human flight had been
tried,'' MacCready says. ``People were stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   A solution came to MacCready as he was driving cross-country on
vacation with his wife, Judy, and their three sons, Parker, Tyler
and Marshall, and started watching the hawks and turkey vultures
soaring in circles overhead, taking advantage of updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for fun I figured a way to calculate a bird's flight
speed and its turning radius,'' he says. ``All you needed to do was
to estimate its banking angle, then use your wristwatch to time how
long it takes it to make a 360-degree turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the great `Aha!' moment hit,'' he says. ``I realized that
as long as you kept the weight the same, you could take an airplane
and let the wings get bigger and bigger. The flight speed would
decrease, but so would the power needed to make the plane fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, MacCready and his colleagues at Aero
Vironment set out to prove that theory with the Gossamer Condor.
They designed 96-foot wings of aluminum tubing, corrugated
cardboard and balsa wood, made them rigid by bracing them with
piano wire, and then covered them with a thin layer of Mylar.
MacCready drafted his sons, then teen-agers, as test pilots.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Condor's weight down, MacCready insisted on ``no
frills, no safety margins.'' Indeed, when a couple of pieces fell
off the Condor during a test run and the plane didn't crash,
MacCready decided to scratch the parts from the design. Ultimately,
the Condor met Kremer's challenge _ and made aviation history _ at
a mere 55 pounds, not counting the 137-pound pilot, Bryan Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we understood the large-and-light concept,'' MacCready
says, ``it was just a matter of doing the grunt work.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, MacCready also devotes much of his time to public
speaking. Addressing schoolchildren, he encourages them to ``search
for the answers yourself, and trust no one's conclusions but your
own.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are always more projects. He has been studying bird
flight with soaring enthusiasts in an organization called TWITT
(The Wing Is The Thing) and working on a plan to get a real
bird's-eye view of Earth by placing a two-gram video camera on the
head of a pigeon or a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Owl, MacCready's design for an affordable
two-seater plane. One day he hopes commuters will abandon their
cars and emulate bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We humans are grubbing around the surface, but at some point
in their lives, something like three-quarters of all the insects in
the world fly,'' he says. ``It's a much more efficient way of
covering territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Aero Vironment's Martyn Cowley won't be surprised if it
eventually takes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Paul,'' he says with a laugh. ``We're busy working on
the old cutting-edge stuff here. Paul's way out there, working on
the things that will be cutting edge 10 years from now.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Manuel Vitorino Pinheiro dos Santos had just shot four
white-lipped peccaries when he heard it. The horrible
soul-wrenching humanlike cry came from a tangle of vines about 50
meters away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment you hear it, all your hairs stand on end,'' Dos
Santos says.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the peccary he was carving up, grabbed the lianas he
had cut to lash the carcass to his back and sprinted in the
opposite direction, toward the nearby river.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos waited in the water for an hour or so until he felt
safe going back for his peccaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a knife and no shells and didn't want to face the
creature,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not Dos Santos or any of the other villagers of Barra
do Sao Manuel, a tiny settlement on the banks of the Tapajos River
deep in the Brazilian Amazon, or anyone else in the vast rain
forest _ relishes facing it.
</P>
<P>
   Covered in long red hair, standing more than six feet on its
hind legs, emanating a stench so foul it disorients everyone in
sniffing distance, the mapinguari is reputed to be the most
terrifying denizen of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   It is said to avoid water, to wander with roving herds of
white-lipped peccaries and to protect them, to forage at night, to
twist huge palm trees apart with its massive claws so it can feast
on the soft insides, to have backward-turned feet, and to be
generally immune to bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The mapinguari is also said to be another Bigfoot, a figment of
the imagination of people like Dos Santos _ and of a prominent
scientist named David C. Oren, whose relentless quest to find one
is growing as legendary as the beast itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is to Oren and his mapinguari-seeking swat team that Dos
Santos relates his encounter some two months later, standing in the
same spot in the forest near Barra.
</P>
<P>
   Oren, an ornithologist and expert on Amazonian biodiversity at
the Emilio Goeldi Museum in Belem, listens intently.
</P>
<P>
   Oren did not always believe in mapinguaris. When he first came
to study birds in Brazil more than 20 years ago, to do research for
his doctorate at Harvard, Oren heard about the creature.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly classified it along with other Amazonian myths: the
activities of the boto dolphin, blamed for all unwanted pregnancies
because it assumes the form of a handsome man, penetrates village
parties and lures young women into the floral night; or the
transformation of the curupira, a protean creature that appears as
an animal or a hairy, ugly man and plagues hunters.
</P>
<P>
   But about 15 years ago, after repeatedly hearing mapinguari
tales, Oren changed his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with a friend and he said, `David, you are the
biologist, I am the historian. What could this creature be?'' Oren
recalls. ``And it was when I first listened carefully to one of the
stories that the light went on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Oren hypothesized that mapinguaris were indeed real and
that they were none other than the last extant giant ground sloths,
Pleistocene survivors lying low in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   These enormous creatures _ relatives of today's two- and
three-toed arboreal sloths but with higher metabolisms and thus
greater speed _ emerged about 30 million years ago and roamed the
Americas, the Caribbean and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   They were red-haired vegetarians with large claws that curled
under and faced backward when they walked on all fours, they could
stand on their hind feet like people, and some species had dermal
ossicles, bony plates that made their skin tough.
</P>
<P>
   In paleontological time frames, the giant ground sloths had just
disappeared yesterday. Overhunting or climate change or some
combination thereof had wiped them out sometime between 5,000 and
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed eminently possible to Oren that the greatest expanse
of rain forest in the world could still harbor such beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Stalking the wild-eyed mapinguari in that green hell is not the
easiest way to spend one's time. The terrain is infested with,
among other things, ticks, spiders, malarial mosquitoes whiteflies
(which carry leishmaniasis) and the dreaded botfly. Oren has had
his share of all of the above, but particularly the last one.
</P>
<P>
   His left heel has a dime-size scar surrounded by a web of what
look like varicose veins. A botfly larva _ which probably entered
the skin through a mosquito bite hole _ foraged around his foot for
weeks, growing into an inch-long fly, eating out a new circulatory
system and never staying still or putting up a breathing siphon as
botfly larvae typically do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Jacques Cousteau of botflies,'' Oren says. ``It had
an Aqua-Lung.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond braving the bugs and many other hardships, Oren and the
team must cover as much ground as possible _ sometimes walking as
many as nine hours a day _ trying to find tracks or traces of
recent peccary passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like looking for a needle in a haystack without a
magnet,'' says Oren as he sits in the dark of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   This trip to Barra is Oren's sixth mapinguari foray since 1994,
when he began looking in the field for hard evidence of the
creature. He has received grants for this work from the Brazilian
Boticario Foundation and a small film company. The rest of the time
he relies primarily on his Goeldi salary, which includes the many
research grants he gets from such places as the MacArthur
Foundation and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence Oren has gathered on these hunts _ a clump
of hair, several fecal samples from different areas and some casts
of footprints _ has led to naught. The hair proved to be that of an
agouti, the fecal samples did not reveal any DNA aside from, in one
case, that of a giant anteater, and the casts don't hold any
scientific weight, as Oren readily points out, ``because they can
be easily faked.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of tangibles is hard to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a kook,'' mutters one ornithologist, who doesn't want to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are willing to accept more on faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a bankrupt world it would be if you refused to believe
things existed until you actually had seen a specimen in a museum.
I mean, there are lots of things we are prepared to believe exist
without having seen them,'' says Wildlife Conservation Society
biologist Kent Redford, citing subatomic particles and Madeleine
Albright's accounts of NATO air strikes in Kosovo. ``Why not a
mapinguari?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he is being hoaxed. I think he is being
courageous,'' says Nigel J.H. Smith, a geographer at the University
of Florida in Gainesville who has traveled widely in the Amazon
collecting folktales and legends _ including those of the
mapinguari _ which he describes in his book ``The Enchanted Amazon
Rain Forest: Stories From a Vanishing World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to put local knowledge in a shrine,'' he says.
``But there's a lot of natural history knowledge that scientists
are too dismissive of.''

<P>
   Manuel Vitorino Pinheiro dos Santos had just shot four
white-lipped peccaries when he heard it. The horrible
soul-wrenching humanlike cry came from a tangle of vines about 50
meters away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment you hear it, all your hairs stand on end,'' Dos
Santos says.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the peccary he was carving up, grabbed the lianas he
had cut to lash the carcass to his back and sprinted in the
opposite direction, toward the nearby river.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos waited in the water for an hour or so until he felt
safe going back for his peccaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a knife and no shells and didn't want to face the
creature,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not Dos Santos or any of the other villagers of Barra
do Sao Manuel, a tiny settlement on the banks of the Tapajos River
deep in the Brazilian Amazon, or anyone else in the vast rain
forest _ relishes facing it.
</P>
<P>
   Covered in long red hair, standing more than six feet on its
hind legs, emanating a stench so foul it disorients everyone in
sniffing distance, the mapinguari is reputed to be the most
terrifying denizen of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   It is said to avoid water, to wander with roving herds of
white-lipped peccaries and to protect them, to forage at night, to
twist huge palm trees apart with its massive claws so it can feast
on the soft insides, to have backward-turned feet, and to be
generally immune to bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The mapinguari is also said to be another Bigfoot, a figment of
the imagination of people like Dos Santos _ and of a prominent
scientist named David C. Oren, whose relentless quest to find one
is growing as legendary as the beast itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is to Oren and his mapinguari-seeking swat team that Dos
Santos relates his encounter some two months later, standing in the
same spot in the forest near Barra.
</P>
<P>
   Oren, an ornithologist and expert on Amazonian biodiversity at
the Emilio Goeldi Museum in Belem, listens intently.
</P>
<P>
   Oren did not always believe in mapinguaris. When he first came
to study birds in Brazil more than 20 years ago, to do research for
his doctorate at Harvard, Oren heard about the creature.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly classified it along with other Amazonian myths: the
activities of the boto dolphin, blamed for all unwanted pregnancies
because it assumes the form of a handsome man, penetrates village
parties and lures young women into the floral night; or the
transformation of the curupira, a protean creature that appears as
an animal or a hairy, ugly man and plagues hunters.
</P>
<P>
   But about 15 years ago, after repeatedly hearing mapinguari
tales, Oren changed his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with a friend and he said, `David, you are the
biologist, I am the historian. What could this creature be?'' Oren
recalls. ``And it was when I first listened carefully to one of the
stories that the light went on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Oren hypothesized that mapinguaris were indeed real and
that they were none other than the last extant giant ground sloths,
Pleistocene survivors lying low in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   These enormous creatures _ relatives of today's two- and
three-toed arboreal sloths but with higher metabolisms and thus
greater speed _ emerged about 30 million years ago and roamed the
Americas, the Caribbean and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   They were red-haired vegetarians with large claws that curled
under and faced backward when they walked on all fours, they could
stand on their hind feet like people, and some species had dermal
ossicles, bony plates that made their skin tough.
</P>
<P>
   In paleontological time frames, the giant ground sloths had just
disappeared yesterday. Overhunting or climate change or some
combination thereof had wiped them out sometime between 5,000 and
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>

botfly larvae typically do.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Striding into his office at Aero Vironment Inc. in Monrovia,
Calif., on a June afternoon, a slightly rumpled-looking Paul
MacCready juggles an armful of folders with a bag of take-out Thai
and apologizes for his tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up until 3 a.m. the past few nights working on some
projects,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of projects? The gray-haired 74-year-old company
founder hesitates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are patent and proprietary concerns ...'' he says. But
then his enthusiasm gets the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have found a way to make exercise addicting,'' he says,
launching into an energetic description of his ``Micro Gym,'' a
pocket-size exercise machine with a pulse meter that vibrates when
the user reaches an optimal heart rate. ``Just enough exercise to
get that rush of endorphins that will make you want to do it
again,'' MacCready says. ``Wouldn't that be a great service to
humanity?''
</P>
<P>
   From anyone else, the idea might seem pure fantasy. But
MacCready has a knack for making the fantastic real.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the mild-mannered aeronautical engineer designed the
first plane powered solely by human effort _ a furiously pedaling
pilot _ capable of sustained flight.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Gossamer Condor, the flying machine now sits
alongside the Wright Brothers' Flyer and Charles Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Gossamer Albatross, a design offspring of
the Condor, was pedaled 22.25 miles across the English Channel,
cementing MacCready's place in aviation history. Soon after,
MacCready was named Engineer of the Century by the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, MacCready was just getting started. In 1980, he
designed the Solar Challenger, the world's first piloted
sun-powered airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he set jaws dropping by creating a
computer-controlled, wing-flapping replica of a pterodactyl for the
Smithsonian's film ``On the Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1987, back on Earth, a team of six drivers won a
1,867-mile Australian road race with his Sunraycer, an electric
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's not afraid of making mistakes or dealing with
resistance,'' says Ray Morgan, director of Aero Vironment's Design
Development Center, who has worked with MacCready since the 1970s.
``He's known for saying, 'I bet if we try it this way ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the man called the ``father of human-powered flight''
aims to soar ever higher. Working with NASA support, his team at
Aero Vironment is building a new generation of lightweight
solar-powered planes designed to ascend high into the stratosphere
and then remain there for several months.
</P>
<P>
   A craft called Helios could monitor atmospheric conditions and
perhaps serve as a communications station for relaying high
bandwidth video and teleconferencing signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero Vironment team is also busy designing micro air
vehicles, palm-size battery-powered crafts that look like toys but
are equipped with tiny video cameras that could provide real-time
reconnaissance for soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas are always germinating,'' MacCready says. His office is
lined with file cabinets labeled ``Active'' and ``Less Active,''
the latter for projects _ like a hamster-powered miniplane _ that
he hasn't yet perfected but won't give up on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dogged,'' he admits. ``Irrationally persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for his most noted achievements, the Gossamer
projects, came in the early 1970s, when a relative had to default
on a business loan, and MacCready, who had co-signed the note,
suddenly found himself owing $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for a way to pay it back, he recalled an
18-year-old challenge that had been offered by British
industrialist Henry Kremer to the first person who could complete a
1.15-mile-long figure-eight course using human-powered flight. The
prize? $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conventional ways to achieve human flight had been
tried,'' MacCready says. ``People were stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   A solution came to MacCready as he was driving cross-country on
vacation with his wife, Judy, and their three sons, Parker, Tyler
and Marshall, and started watching the hawks and turkey vultures
soaring in circles overhead, taking advantage of updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for fun I figured a way to calculate a bird's flight
speed and its turning radius,'' he says. ``All you needed to do was
to estimate its banking angle, then use your wristwatch to time how
long it takes it to make a 360-degree turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the great `Aha!' moment hit,'' he says. ``I realized that
as long as you kept the weight the same, you could take an airplane
and let the wings get bigger and bigger. The flight speed would
decrease, but so would the power needed to make the plane fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, MacCready and his colleagues at Aero
Vironment set out to prove that theory with the Gossamer Condor.
They designed 96-foot wings of aluminum tubing, corrugated
cardboard and balsa wood, made them rigid by bracing them with
piano wire, and then covered them with a thin layer of Mylar.
MacCready drafted his sons, then teen-agers, as test pilots.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Condor's weight down, MacCready insisted on ``no
frills, no safety margins.'' Indeed, when a couple of pieces fell
off the Condor during a test run and the plane didn't crash,
MacCready decided to scratch the parts from the design. Ultimately,
the Condor met Kremer's challenge _ and made aviation history _ at
a mere 55 pounds, not counting the 137-pound pilot, Bryan Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we understood the large-and-light concept,'' MacCready
says, ``it was just a matter of doing the grunt work.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, MacCready also devotes much of his time to public
speaking. Addressing schoolchildren, he encourages them to ``search
for the answers yourself, and trust no one's conclusions but your
own.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are always more projects. He has been studying bird
flight with soaring enthusiasts in an organization called TWITT
(The Wing Is The Thing) and working on a plan to get a real
bird's-eye view of Earth by placing a two-gram video camera on the
head of a pigeon or a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Owl, MacCready's design for an affordable
two-seater plane. One day he hopes commuters will abandon their
cars and emulate bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We humans are grubbing around the surface, but at some point
in their lives, something like three-quarters of all the insects in
the world fly,'' he says. ``It's a much more efficient way of
covering territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Aero Vironment's Martyn Cowley won't be surprised if it
eventually takes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Paul,'' he says with a laugh. ``We're busy working on
the old cutting-edge stuff here. Paul's way out there, working on
the things that will be cutting edge 10 years from now.''

   The inspiration for his most noted achievements, the Gossamer
projects, came in the early 1970s, when a relative had to default
on a business loan, and MacCready, who had co-signed the note,
suddenly found himself owing $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for a way to pay it back, he recalled an
18-year-old challenge that had been offered by British
industrialist Henry Kremer to the first person who could complete a
1.15-mile-long figure-eight course using human-powered flight. The
prize? $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conventional ways to achieve human flight had been
tried,'' MacCready says. ``People were stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   A solution came to MacCready as he was driving cross-country on
vacation with his wife, Judy, and their three sons, Parker, Tyler
and Marshall, and started watching the hawks and turkey vultures
soaring in circles overhead, taking advantage of updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for fun I figured a way to calculate a bird's flight
speed and its turning radius,'' he says. ``All you needed to do was
to estimate its banking angle, then use your wristwatch to time how
long it takes it to make a 360-degree turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the great `Aha!' moment hit,'' he says. ``I realized that
as long as you kept the weight the same, you could take an airplane
and let the wings get bigger and bigger. The flight speed would
decrease, but so would the power needed to make the plane fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, MacCready and his colleagues at Aero
Vironment set out to prove that theory with the Gossamer Condor.
They designed 96-foot wings of aluminum tubing, corrugated
cardboard and balsa wood, made them rigid by bracing them with
piano wire, and then covered them with a thin layer of Mylar.
MacCready drafted his sons, then teen-agers, as test pilots.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Condor's weight down, MacCready insisted on ``no
frills, no safety margins.'' Indeed, when a couple of pieces fell
off the Condor during a test run and the plane didn't crash,
MacCready decided to scratch the parts from the design. Ultimately,
the Condor met Kremer's challenge _ and made aviation history _ at
a mere 55 pounds, not counting the 137-pound pilot, Bryan Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we understood the large-and-light concept,'' MacCready
says, ``it was just a matter of doing the grunt work.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, MacCready also devotes much of his time to public
speaking. Addressing schoolchildren, he encourages them to ``search
for the answers yourself, and trust no one's conclusions but your
own.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are always more projects. He has been studying bird
flight with soaring enthusiasts in an organization called TWITT
(The Wing Is The Thing) and working on a plan to get a real
bird's-eye view of Earth by placing a two-gram video camera on the
head of a pigeon or a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Owl, MacCready's design for an affordable
two-seater plane. One day he hopes commuters will abandon their
cars and emulate bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We humans are grubbing around the surface, but at some point
in their lives, something like three-quarters of all the insects in
the world fly,'' he says. ``It's a much more efficient way of
covering territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Aero Vironment's Martyn Cowley won't be surprised if it
eventually takes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Paul,'' he says with a laugh. ``We're busy working on
the old cutting-edge stuff here. Paul's way out there, working on
the things that will be cutting edge 10 years from now.''

<P>
   Manuel Vitorino Pinheiro dos Santos had just shot four
white-lipped peccaries when he heard it. The horrible
soul-wrenching humanlike cry came from a tangle of vines about 50
meters away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment you hear it, all your hairs stand on end,'' Dos
Santos says.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the peccary he was carving up, grabbed the lianas he
had cut to lash the carcass to his back and sprinted in the
opposite direction, toward the nearby river.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos waited in the water for an hour or so until he felt
safe going back for his peccaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a knife and no shells and didn't want to face the
creature,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not Dos Santos or any of the other villagers of Barra
do Sao Manuel, a tiny settlement on the banks of the Tapajos River
deep in the Brazilian Amazon, or anyone else in the vast rain
forest _ relishes facing it.
</P>
<P>
   Covered in long red hair, standing more than six feet on its
hind legs, emanating a stench so foul it disorients everyone in
sniffing distance, the mapinguari is reputed to be the most
terrifying denizen of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   It is said to avoid water, to wander with roving herds of
white-lipped peccaries and to protect them, to forage at night, to
twist huge palm trees apart with its massive claws so it can feast
on the soft insides, to have backward-turned feet, and to be
generally immune to bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The mapinguari is also said to be another Bigfoot, a figment of
the imagination of people like Dos Santos _ and of a prominent
scientist named David C. Oren, whose relentless quest to find one
is growing as legendary as the beast itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is to Oren and his mapinguari-seeking swat team that Dos
Santos relates his encounter some two months later, standing in the
same spot in the forest near Barra.
</P>
<P>
   Oren, an ornithologist and expert on Amazonian biodiversity at
the Emilio Goeldi Museum in Belem, listens intently.
</P>
<P>
   Oren did not always believe in mapinguaris. When he first came
to study birds in Brazil more than 20 years ago, to do research for
his doctorate at Harvard, Oren heard about the creature.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly classified it along with other Amazonian myths: the
activities of the boto dolphin, blamed for all unwanted pregnancies
because it assumes the form of a handsome man, penetrates village
parties and lures young women into the floral night; or the
transformation of the curupira, a protean creature that appears as
an animal or a hairy, ugly man and plagues hunters.
</P>
<P>
   But about 15 years ago, after repeatedly hearing mapinguari
tales, Oren changed his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with a friend and he said, `David, you are the
biologist, I am the historian. What could this creature be?'' Oren
recalls. ``And it was when I first listened carefully to one of the
stories that the light went on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Oren hypothesized that mapinguaris were indeed real and
that they were none other than the last extant giant ground sloths,
Pleistocene survivors lying low in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   These enormous creatures _ relatives of today's two- and
three-toed arboreal sloths but with higher metabolisms and thus
greater speed _ emerged about 30 million years ago and roamed the
Americas, the Caribbean and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   They were red-haired vegetarians with large claws that curled
under and faced backward when they walked on all fours, they could
stand on their hind feet like people, and some species had dermal
ossicles, bony plates that made their skin tough.
</P>
<P>
   In paleontological time frames, the giant ground sloths had just
disappeared yesterday. Overhunting or climate change or some
combination thereof had wiped them out sometime between 5,000 and
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed eminently possible to Oren that the greatest expanse
of rain forest in the world could still harbor such beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Stalking the wild-eyed mapinguari in that green hell is not the
easiest way to spend one's time. The terrain is infested with,
among other things, ticks, spiders, malarial mosquitoes whiteflies
(which carry leishmaniasis) and the dreaded botfly. Oren has had
his share of all of the above, but particularly the last one.
</P>
<P>
   His left heel has a dime-size scar surrounded by a web of what
look like varicose veins. A botfly larva _ which probably entered
the skin through a mosquito bite hole _ foraged around his foot for
weeks, growing into an inch-long fly, eating out a new circulatory
system and never staying still or putting up a breathing siphon as
botfly larvae typically do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Jacques Cousteau of botflies,'' Oren says. ``It had
an Aqua-Lung.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond braving the bugs and many other hardships, Oren and the
team must cover as much ground as possible _ sometimes walking as
many as nine hours a day _ trying to find tracks or traces of
recent peccary passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like looking for a needle in a haystack without a
magnet,'' says Oren as he sits in the dark of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   This trip to Barra is Oren's sixth mapinguari foray since 1994,
when he began looking in the field for hard evidence of the
creature. He has received grants for this work from the Brazilian
Boticario Foundation and a small film company. The rest of the time
he relies primarily on his Goeldi salary, which includes the many
research grants he gets from such places as the MacArthur
Foundation and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence Oren has gathered on these hunts _ a clump
of hair, several fecal samples from different areas and some casts
of footprints _ has led to naught. The hair proved to be that of an
agouti, the fecal samples did not reveal any DNA aside from, in one
case, that of a giant anteater, and the casts don't hold any
scientific weight, as Oren readily points out, ``because they can
be easily faked.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of tangibles is hard to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a kook,'' mutters one ornithologist, who doesn't want to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are willing to accept more on faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a bankrupt world it would be if you refused to believe
things existed until you actually had seen a specimen in a museum.
I mean, there are lots of things we are prepared to believe exist
without having seen them,'' says Wildlife Conservation Society
biologist Kent Redford, citing subatomic particles and Madeleine
Albright's accounts of NATO air strikes in Kosovo. ``Why not a
mapinguari?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he is being hoaxed. I think he is being
courageous,'' says Nigel J.H. Smith, a geographer at the University
of Florida in Gainesville who has traveled widely in the Amazon
collecting folktales and legends _ including those of the
mapinguari _ which he describes in his book ``The Enchanted Amazon
Rain Forest: Stories From a Vanishing World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to put local knowledge in a shrine,'' he says.
``But there's a lot of natural history knowledge that scientists
are too dismissive of.''

TV ADVERTISING NEEDS TO CLEAN UP ITS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My take regarding appropriate television content for young
people has been pretty uniform: It is up to parents or guardians to
police the viewing habits of their children. The remote is there
for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an admitted hole in that argument, a glaring fault
line growing daily in my mind. A parent can scan the television
listings. He or she can check the ratings. Mom and Dad can sit down
with junior and watch the shows with them, exhibiting any and all
due diligence.
</P>
<P>
   But the parent has absolutely no control, or warning, over what
advertisements will bombard them during commercial breaks. Some of
the ads, notably beer spots during sporting events and other
commercials hawking alcohol and/or containing violent or sexually
suggestive content, have become the norm. This is not a prude's
standpoint. It just is.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of (adult) shows, I don't have much concern. Let
the buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   But with advertisements, it's let potential buyers beware. And
that is all of us, all of the time, whether we like it or not.Then
there is targeting advertising directly to youths, from cereal to
toys to ``entertainment'' shows that are merely half-hour
infommercials. Die, ``Pokemon,'' die.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 13 organizations recently sent a letter to House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., calling on Congress to authorize the Federal Trade
Commission to ``protect children against advertising that may harm
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress should be on the side of children, not those who
would exploit them for monetary gain,'' the letter read. ``As you
know, advertisers barrage children each day with an onslaught of
psychologically sophisticated messages to generate desire for
products.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter cites examples ranging from ads for violent
entertainment, alcohol, tobacco (now only in print ads) and junk
food (``These ads may contribute to skyrocketing levels of
childhood obesity,'' the letter states).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a cause for shame that advertisers in this country would
devote their talents and energies to prod unsuspecting children in
these directions,'' the coalition asserts. ``It is beyond
comprehension that the U.S. Congress would protect such behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   On a tangentially related front, there is Mark Crispin Miller, a
professor of media studies at New York University, and Robert W.
McChesney, who wrote a book on the media and democracy. Writing
together in the Oct. 4 issue of the New Republic magazine, the two
called for greater control of the airwaves, in part to combat the
growing corporate consolidation of media outlets: ``We also need to
find ways to let Americans take part locally in media reform. (We
should consider having state and/or municipal versions of the
Federal Communications Commission, comparable to state
environmental agencies.)''
</P>
<P>
   These concerns are great, and valid. A 9-year-old watching
football should not be conditioned that to be a football fan, no, a
man, you must be downing a Bud (let's not even get into the
professional wrestling angle, that misogynistic pseudo-violent
cartoon-fest that should be considered out of bounds for kids).
Yes, something should be done.
</P>
<P>
   But not by the feds or other political entities. I have grave
reservations about the government stepping in and being a content
police in terms of outright bans. (Mandating set hours for
educational programming is another matter.) Part of this is a First
Amendment bias, but more importantly it takes away the
responsibility from where it belongs, the programmers and
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where the pressure belongs. You want to hawk beer
and sex and violence? Direct it toward adults, during adult viewing
hours (after 10 p.m.) But keep doing it during prime time, the day,
the morning _ any hours when a large number of children may be
watching _ and face the eventual wrath. This anger should be
directed at the advertisers, the networks, the local affiliates,
everyone who is making a buck off of kids in an unsavory manner.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that the airwaves belong to the public is quaint, yet
codified. These purveyors deserve all the heat that can be
generated.
</P>
<P>
   Just not from the government. And not because they don't deserve
it.

PLENTY OF SEATS ON SPACESHIP EARTH FOR NEW BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NISKAYUNA, N.Y. _ Last week, a baby boy born in Sarajevo was
proclaimed by the United Nations as the 6 billionth passenger on
Spaceship Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at Bellevue Women's Hospital in this comfortable
Albany suburb, six girls and two boys were born. They were among
370,000 new human arrivals that day around the globe. They became
part of a world population that totaled 1 billion in 1804, two
billion 127 years later, 3 billion 33 years after that, 4 billion
in another 14 years and fully 5 billion 13 years later in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, a few of the newborns lay swaddled in white in
Bellevue's first-floor nursery. They were the only latest of the
nearly 96,000 humans to begin life at Bellevue since the hospital
opened in 1931. As you stood there and watched these tiny, new
people yawn and grimace through the nursery window, it was
difficult to feel alarm at their presence among us.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, considerable alarm over the world's burgeoning
human population has been expressed for more than two centuries
now, beginning with Thomas Malthus' ``Essay on the Principle of
Population'' in 1789. He predicted worldwide starvation as humans
increased in number. Author and thinker Paul Erlich has predicted
the same thing every decade for the last 30 years _ and turned out
to have been dead wrong every decade, too.
</P>
<P>
   Early population alarmists were most worried about the
population boom among supposedly inferior peoples _ that is, people
with the temerity to be non-white. In recent years, most alarm has
focused on world famine _ on threats proven empty because of
improved food-production techniques _ and on the ecological damage
that more humans might do.
</P>
<P>
   What will happen to the planet when we get to 10 billion, the
alarmists say? What happens when we reach 20 billion?
</P>
<P>
   Well, relax. That won't happen. As the world has industrialized,
the birth rate has begun stabilizing. Scandinavia, for example, is
actually experiencing a negative birth rate. And the northeastern
United States, where those babies were born a week ago, is at zero
population growth, like fully a 10th of the world.
</P>
<P>
   High birth rates tend to be a byproduct of poverty and
agricultural economies. As agriculture gives way to industry and
its accompanying prosperity, birth rates drop. What keeps
population now growing is mainly longer life. Every day in America,
10,000 babies are born and only 6,000 people die. In Europe when
Malthus was writing, life expectancy at birth was 30 years, the
same as during the Stone Age. Industrialized prosperity, lower
infant mortality and better medical care puts that figure at
roughly 75 today throughout the developed world. Human population
growth actually peaked 31 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations projects that population will top out at
somewhere between eight and 11.5 billion at the middle of the new
century _ and probably closer to the lower number _ then decline to
slightly over 4 billion a century later.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, there is no ideal number of humans on the planet.
In and of itself, human population growth is neither good nor bad.
The only issue is the ability of the planet to support population.
And every indication is that our species never will come close to
exceeding that.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is that fully a third of the world, the most
fertile members of the population, lives in utter and abject
destitution. We need to finance population control and health care
for them and help them reduce the number of children they produce
in conditions of extreme misery.
</P>
<P>
   But if your new child or grandchild made his or her appearance
in America last week, congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   And don't put up with anybody trying to make you feel guilty
about it.

A PRAYER FOR TOLERANCE, FAMILY UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As I read a brave, eloquent opinion column by
the gay son of state Sen. William ``Pete'' Knight, I found myself
thinking about a line from the official Catholic ``Prayer for the
New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated weekly in parishes all over the country and addressed
to ``Gracious God,'' the prayer asks for help with a variety of
contemporary problems. One of the requests: ``Reunite our
families.''
</P>
<P>
   David Knight, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, fighter pilot
and Gulf War veteran, is mightily estranged from his father, a
former test pilot, Air Force colonel and now-conservative
Republican legislator from Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Despite (or, as some suspect, because of) a gay brother who died
of AIDS and his gay son, the elder Knight has sponsored an
anti-homosexual ballot proposition in California: the ``Definition
of Marriage'' initiative. It is his second attempt to ensure that
California is a same-sex marriage-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   (The state already defines marriage as between a male and
female; Knight is trying to guard against lesbian and gay couples
who might manage to marry in another state then demand that
California recognize their union.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is he doing this?'' David Knight wrote in the Los Angeles
Times. ``I believe, based on my experience, that his is a blind,
uncaring, uninformed, knee-jerk reaction to a subject about which
he knows nothing and wants to know nothing, but which serves his
political career.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview with the Los Angeles Daily News, Pete Knight
lent some credence to that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how those things happen,'' he said of
homosexuality. ``I don't know how it happened to my brother, and I
don't know how it happened to David. I don't know how you explain
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion column, David Knight said he was ``a cabinetmaker
by trade, and I lead a quiet, full life.'' He said he had ``a life
partner, Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, I told my father I was gay. ... From that
moment on, my relationship with my father was over,'' he wrote. ``I
can't begin to explain the hurt that has come from this
rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his son's column, Pete Knight said merely that his son
``disagrees with my legislation. We've agreed to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says: ``I regret that my son felt he needed to force a
private, family matter into the public forum through an editorial.
Although I don't believe he was fair in describing the true nature
of our relationship, that is a subject which should remain between
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the senator's press statement last week, he said, ``I care
deeply about my son.''
</P>
<P>
   In his column, David Knight said, ``I'm deeply sorry that my
father feels that he can no longer be a part of my life. I miss
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some of my fellow Catholics _ not to mention at least
eight of the 12 dioceses in California, which have so far
contributed more than $300,000 to the Knight Initiative _ I do not
support the same-sex marriage ban.
</P>
<P>
   Like David Knight, I believe _ because I have seen _ that, in
his words, ``Gay people are forming strong, loving families.
Understanding and accepting this will make our communities stronger
and safer places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   So, from now on, each week when I pray the Prayer for the New
Millennium, I plan to think hopefully of Pete and David Knight when
I say, ``Reunite our families.''
</P>
<P>
   And when I get to the last few lines, I plan to think hopefully
of my church and the men who've been entrusted to speak for it and
to spend its money when I say: ``Fill us with joy to celebrate the
fullness of life. Empower us to be a community of love growing in
your likeness.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in awhile after Mass, I plan to write a check to No On
Knight. It's the underfunded group opposing the initiative.

trappings. Every 30 minutes, preschoolers are moved to a different
activity, from French to math to creative movement. Tuition runs
almost twice as high as the area average _ it's $12,000 a year for
preschoolers _ but satisfied parents say their children's happiness
is worth it. Yet child development experts warn that high cost does
not equal high quality. Kate Beem. Photo. 45.

FROM VICTORIAN PRUDERY TO THE P.C. POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DONALD G. SMITH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MARIA, Calif. _ The Victorian Era lasted at least 40 years
after the death of the venerable lady for whom it was named,
Britain's Queen Victoria. It was a period of socially enforced
morality, a time when proper ladies and gentlemen were bound by a
code of conduct that generally went undisputed.
</P>
<P>
   This was an era in which legs were called limbs by people of
refinement. Undergarments were not hung on an outdoor clothesline.
The term ``in mixed company'' had a well-understood meaning, and
certain topics were avoided: abortion, for example, and
prostitution, rape, sexual deviance, condoms and just about any
physical malady that hit between the waist and the knees.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this died during World War II. We came out of that
conflict with far different social attitudes. The somewhat stifling
atmosphere created by the Victorian Era is not missed. For all of
its quaintness, we are undoubtedly well rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, many of us look with great reservation at the
age of political correctness that now engulfs us. It is
Victorianism all over again, with a heavy net descending upon
anything resembling freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   The P.C. thought patrol works overtime to dictate what is, and
what is not, acceptable speech. Casual conversation in the
workplace can be a springboard to accusations of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The simple recognition that another person might be of another
ethnic background could be branded as racism. The American Indian
must be called Native American, even though the term ought to apply
to people of all races and cultures who were born here.
</P>
<P>
   Some sports teams with Indian nicknames, such as Warriors and
Chiefs, are changing to politically correct names. As soon as it is
decided that Lions, Tigers and Eagles are offensive to someone,
more changes will be made.
</P>
<P>
   I recall a fight announcer who was covering a boxing match
between a white man and a black man. He identified the black
fighter as ``the one in the blue trunks.''
</P>
<P>
   The P.C. power people have gained control of the electronic
media, the public schools and the entertainment business and
therefore have a significant influence over what can and cannot be
said.
</P>
<P>
   We are careful not to link the acquired immune deficiency
syndrome with homosexuality. We should not suggest the crime rate
is inordinately high for certain minority groups. It is not
permissible to point out that militant feminists do not in any way
represent American women. We cannot say that affirmative action is
quota-based, which it most assuredly is.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't acceptable to suggest that there are some unemployed
people who aren't actively looking for work. They are all victims
of the capitalist system.
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness takes precedence over truth. Some things
are not to be said publicly because the P.C. thought police don't
want them said, as if silence will make it all go away.
</P>
<P>
   It is Victorianism all over again, just as severe, as
dictatorial, as unforgiving. Those of us who have been through it
once are not all that thrilled about a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   As I recall, it wasn't as bad the first time around. It is far
better, I think, to avoid a discussion of syphilis at the dinner
table than to blame all social ills on the depletion of the rain
forest.
</P>
<P>
   If given the choice between prudery and stupidity, the decision
isn't all that difficult.

step in, providing millions in aid to rebuild infrastructure and
hundreds of volunteers to help provide housing. Slowly, roads are
cleared, washouts filled in, temporary bridges installed and
hundreds of new cement block houses are constructed. But a year
after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a poor country
devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy - at least not if

so much worse than it might have been. (Williams, Cox News

   RANCH-ECONOMICS _ MEEKER, Colo. _ In 1951, a steer brought $100
a head at a sale here, and a rancher could buy a new pickup for
$1,700. Nowadays, though, that steer brings in $500, but the
pickup, integral to ranch operations, costs $38,000. ``Prices
haven't quite kept up,'' said Ginny Love, who ranches here with her
husband. High land prices, low livestock prices and a flood of
imports make it difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to
break into the ranching business. Seeing the writing on the wall,
some second-generation ranchers are getting out altogether. ``We
just barely made expenses this year,'' said Tom Theos, 80, who's
ranched in the White River Valley of northwest Colorado since 1926
and whose family owns one of the largest tracts of land in Rio
Blanco County. (Vader, Daily Sentinel) MOVED.

Franklin's level, everything is a wonder. Seeing a woman walk by

pane. The pink ball that teacher Dorothy Casey shows him prompts
Kenedy to thrust out his short arms to grab. As foster grandmother
Lois Manor sings the pattycake rhyme, Kenedy's eyes widen and he
flashes an open-mouth, two-toothed grin. What's going on in
Kenedy's tiny brain as he soaks in all the activity is the focus of
a new debate among scientists and advocacy groups over what happens
in a child's brain in the first three years of life and what, if
anything, parents can do to make their children smarter. Amid the
clamor has come criticisms that the importance of the first three
years of life are largely myth. (Gamboa, Austin American-Statesman)

ENDORSING THE NON-ENDORSABLE MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At times like this, I'm glad I don't do
endorsements. If I did endorsements, I might have to endorse Mayor
Willie Brown for re-election on Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   I know that sounds like an endorsement, but it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly out of self-interest, all journalists in this town
would endorse Brown if they could. He offers more to write about,
and in a smaller geographical space, than New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason I'd endorse Brown, if I did endorsements, is that
he puts San Francisco on the national map the way only an
earthquake can. My father called from Cape Cod last week and said,
``I see your mayor is flip-flopping on rounding up the homeless'
shopping carts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Boston Globe runs San Francisco shopping cart stories,
perhaps as a comic counterpoint to the Globe's stories about
hundreds of millions of dollars worth of corruption in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is so big he created the squeaky shopping cart wheel heard
round the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the issue of Brown's famous style. San Franciscans
care about style, and Brown definitely has it, and I'm not just
talking about his expensive clothes and all his hats.
</P>
<P>
   The man has style just walking through a reception, sitting in a
restaurant or standing at a party. He does those things every day
of the week, and approximately 21 hours a day, because he sleeps
only three.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is everywhere. Ubiquity is a great thing in a mayor,
especially if he's witty and stylish. I'm not so sure I'd like to
see and hear former Mayor Frank Jordan or Clint Reilly, two of the
candidates challenging Brown, everywhere all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is a good man and Reilly is a very smart man. It's hard
to imagine a man with Reilly's explosive temperament and
grudge-bearing ability being mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown bears grudges, but they tend to be rational, politically
calculated ones. Reilly's grudges veer into the weird.
</P>
<P>
   It's all too easy to imagine Jordan being mayor. He already has
been. Remember? He's honest and has an even disposition, but often
has been ineffectual and easily manipulated. To his credit, as
mayor he inherited a $300 million deficit and left Brown with a
surplus. He also helped save the Giants from going to St.
Petersburg and helped settle a newspaper strike.
</P>
<P>
   Again, I'm glad I don't do endorsements, because I like him.
</P>
<P>
   But I agree with most voters, whose attitude is, ``been there,
done that.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is what happens to San Francisco for the next
four years. We particularly have to consider the two worst-case
scenarios a mayor would have to face: Further booming prosperity or
a deep recession.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, San Francisco is in real trouble. Perhaps the very
worst of worst-case scenarios, judging by the last four years, is
if Brown presides over a continuing boom.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who did very well by San Francisco in hard times.
As Assembly speaker, he funneled money our way even as state
funding disappeared under Proposition 13.
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, Brown has presided as mayor in a time
of unequaled wealth. The rich have gotten richer. High-rises have
gotten denser. Big chain stores are trying to get into every
neighborhood. Parking has gotten worse. Schools don't have pencils
or paper to give kids. Housing has gotten astronomically expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The poor, the working classes, the middle classes, small
merchants and the neighborhoods have gotten the shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they've gotten the drive shaft of a Lincoln Town
Car, since they've been run over by Brown's limousine liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, I quoted a woman who asked the then-speaker of the
Assembly what he'd done for poor people lately. Brown answered, ``I
stay out of their way at Kmart.''
</P>
<P>
   That outrageous, revealing humor is why we love Brown. Now that
he's mayor he hasn't done much for poor people, but he's staying
out of the way of Rite Aid, Starbucks and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Four more years of our home despot is likely. Four more years of
prosperity is very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But if we get both, we face a San Francisco with more
high-rises, less parking, higher rents and an even wider gap
between the rich and poor, with fewer people in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``World-class city, world-class mayor'' is Brown's slogan on
taxicab roofs.
</P>
<P>
   The words ``San Francisco'' alone used to say class. Part of San
Francisco's calss was that all social classes flourished. Now we're
a city that leads the nation in the division between rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   The next mayor has to close the class divide and not succumb to
moneyed interests, while making the city work. There's only one
mayoral candidate of the political stature to do that, but he
failed to do it for four years already.
</P>
<P>
   At times like this, I'm glad I don't do endorsements.

JUMPING ROPE GREAT FOR HEART AND COORDINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Jump ropes are not just for prizefighters and
little girls anymore. They are an economical and time-efficient way
to stay in shape this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent form of aerobic training,'' said Dr. David
Putnam, a physician with Capital Cardiology Associates in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Just 15 minutes of the exercise can burn nearly 200 calories,
with the added benefits of developing a healthy heart. Long used as
a training tool for boxers, jumping rope is increasingly popular
among tennis and basketball players and at health clubs, where
fitness instructors are adding it to aerobics and kick-boxing
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you coordination, agility and timing,'' said Marty
Winkler, a jumping instructor and co-owner of Freestyle Roping in
Burbank, Calif. ``It has speed and power development. Jumping rope
gives you so many benefits you just can't beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexpensive and portable, jump ropes are also convenient, which
is part of the reason Winkler believes they are becoming more
popular, especially among those who travel or don't belong to a
gym.
</P>
<P>
   Minute for minute, jumping rope burns more calories than almost
any other activity, besides fast running. In an hour, a 150-pound
man can burn 750 calories, more than bicycling 12 mph or swimming
50 yards per minute. Despite the pay off, Winkler still hears from
many adults who are afraid to try it. ``The problem is they're not
sure they can do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He counsels people to start jumping without a rope to get the
rhythm. Once you have that down, swing a looped rope at your side,
timing your jump to each slap of the rope on the floor. When you're
ready, start jumping with both feet hitting the ground at once,
working up to 20 minutes at a time.
</P>
<P>
   A good pace is 120 to 130 rope turns per minute. To minimize the
chance of tripping or twisting the rope, size your rope by standing
on the center. When you pull the handles straight up, they should
just touch your lower chest. Another concern among beginners is the
potential for injury and knee strain. But because your feet only
need to leave the ground an inch or so, jumping rope is actually
less stressful on the body than running.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do it well, you're barely off the ground at all,''
Putnam said.
</P>
<P>
   As with any new exercise, the key is starting slow and making
sure you're properly warmed up, he said. The American Heart
Association has long promoted jumping rope among adults and
children with its annual fund-raising and education series called
Jump Rope For Heart, usually held in February.
</P>
<P>
   Because jumping rope is such an intense activity, Putnam
recommends using it as a cross-training activity to add variety and
challenge to any workout.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he suggested five minutes of jumping rope after
20 minutes on the treadmill or the bicycle. The key for cardiac
health is to total 20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise at least
five days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population is getting fatter and fatter,'' said Putnam, a
volunteer for the American Heart Association Northeastern Region.
``We're not exercising enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of the most underrated physical activities,''
said Frank Cusato, a retired construction worker in Albany. ``It's
really intense.'' Cusato, 68, has been jumping rope for 40 years.
The former Marine used to jump to stay fast in the boxing ring.
Today, like a growing number of Americans, he jumps for fitness and
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Cusato believes his regular regimen of jumping rope has helped
keep him healthy.
</P>
<P>
   He walks an average of six to eight miles a day, using the jump
rope for five to 10 minutes as a warm-up. In the winter, when the
weather is bad, he increases the amount of time with the rope,
jumping on a small sheet of plywood in his basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``My health is great,'' Cusato said. ``I can still bench press
300 pounds. How does that sound?''

UPSETS CLAIM CUP HOPEFULS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nationally prominent horses continue to taste defeat as the Nov.
6 Breeders' Cup at Gulfstream Park approaches, and Cup XVI could be
the most wide open ever contested.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, More Than Ready, a top 2-year-old colt;
Silverbulletday, the leading 3-year-old filly; Lemon Drop Kid, one
of the best of the 3-year-old colts; and Behrens, who sits atop the
handicap division, all lost on Breeders' Cup Preview Weekend at
Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend claimed four prominent victims as well, the
difference being the damage was spread over three racetracks, with
Banshee Breeze, considered the best of the older fillies, running
second in the Spinster at Keenland at 3-10; General Challenge, an
outstanding 3-year-old colt trained by Bob Baffert, finishing
second in the Goodwood at Santa Anita at 4-5; Old Trieste, the
fastest of the older colts, running third in the Goodwood at 9-5,
and Vision and Verse, another outstanding 3-year-old colt,
finishing third in the Meadowlands Cup at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze, who lost the Breeders' Cup Distaff by a nose
last year, won her first four starts this season, all graded
stakes, before running second to Beautiful Pleasure in the slop at
Saratoga. This time, Banshee Breeze, a daughter of Unbridled, went
wide under Pat Day and was outfinished by Keeper Hill, who won for
the first time this year. Keeper Hill, who is trained by Bobby
Frankel, was off at 9-2 ($11.40 to win) and came up the rail to
tally by 2 1/2 lengths under Kent Desormeaux in the time of 1:47
for a mile and one-eighth. ``I was kind of looking for Banshee
Breeze,'' said Desormeaux. ``But when the doors opened up my fily
was so full of run, I didn't think anybody could catch her. She was
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge and Old Trieste were beaten by 9-1 shot ($20
to win) Budroyale, a 6-year-old trained by Ted West. Ridden by
Garrett Gomez, Budroyale overtook Old Trieste, then outgamed
General Challenge to win by a neck in the time of 1:48 1/5 for the
nine furlongs. ``I've never ridden a guttier horse than this one,''
said Gomez. ``He beat two of the best horses in the world,'' said
West. ``The fact that he can look those horses in the eye and gun
them down, means we'll have to consider the Breedes' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Vision and Verse, who finished second to Lemon Drop Kid in both
the Belmont Stakes and Travers, hates a wet track and was scrached
from the far tougher Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont by trainer
Bill Mott when the surface came up sloppy. However, he was outrun
by Pleasant Breeze, a 7-1 chance, and Jazz Club, at 7-2, in the
Meadowlands Cup. Vision and Verse did stage a wide rally to show,
but he did not menace the top pair, who were a head apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasant Breeze is a nice, maturing horse who ran a game
race,'' said his trainer, Jim Bond, who also trains Behrens. ``They
tell you in racing to take chances, and that's what we did. We took
a shot at a half-million dollar purse.''
</P>
<P>
   So eight outstanding horses have been beaten within the space of
two weekends, and there should be great value available at the
Breeders' Cup windows. Bring money.

A GREAT RUN FOR A GOOD TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was never, ever, ever, ever going to be The Year, OK?
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief moment when the 1999 Red Sox had a whiff of
the 1988 Dodgers about them, but if you're going to be the 1988
Dodgers you've got to do more than provide your own Orel Hershiser.
Pedro or no Pedro, you can't win if you don't at least occasionally
catch the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about curses, and jinxes, and conspiracies, and
inexcusable umpiring, and any other irrelevant excuses. The Yankees
are advancing to yet another World Series because they had the good
fortune to be playing a team with far too many guys auditioning for
the lead in ``The Dick Stuart Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and have we mentioned situational hitting?
</P>
<P>
   But just because it wasn't The Year doesn't mean it wasn't a
good year. The Red Sox deserved to be a participant in postseason
play. They won 94 regular-season games, and they can take pride in
the way they assumed control of what we shall dub the ``Secondary
Pennant Race'' (sometimes known as the ``Wild-Card Race'') when
every interested party from Joe Torre to Kevin Costner figured they
were getting ready to be swept away by an Oakland or Toronto
steamroller.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams kept talking about the way these ``kids,'' as he
quaintly calls them (Mike Stanley? John Valentin? Darren Lewis?
Jose Offerman? Rheal Cormier? Kids?), ``competed,'' and while his
rap occasionally got a bit tired, it pretty much spoke the truth.
If there is one thing we have learned about the Jimy Williams Red
Sox, it is that they are feisty, spunky, ornery, resilient and,
yes, competitive.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't have enough of is talent: pure, raw, basic
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams may not be just the American League Manager of the
Year. For winning 94 games and a playoff round with this team, he
may be the Manager of the Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   He did this with a second baseman who can hit but not field, a
third baseman who, when he was in the lineup, was an erratic hitter
and a rangeless fielder, a center fielder who hit .240, a rookie
right fielder who didn't really figure out what he was doing in the
bigs until after the All-Star Game, a succession of first basemen
whose collective defensive prowess added up to about one-third of a
Keith Hernandez, and either no closer or a stomach-churning
knuckleball closer.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also did it with a pitching rotation that usually
consisted of Pedro Martinez and a dartboard. The Red Sox came
within 11 days of becoming the first team to make it to the
postseason with just one pitcher with double-figure wins.
</P>
<P>
   This team was absolutely, positively on the coroner's slab on
Aug. 22. On that day they were shut out in The Ballpark by Aaron
Sele, making it four straight losses and dropping them to 67-57.
They had fallen behind Oakland in the wild card and there was no
reason to think that things would ever get any better, other than
their aforementioned spirit, and the fact that they were heading to
play the Twins three times, and nowadays the Twins often play the
reluctant role of Dr. Feelgood for needy teams.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp _ Pat Rapp! _ beat LaTroy Hawkins the next evening, and
that triggered a dazzling run of 21-5, which included an improbable
6-1 homerless homestand and an even more improbable 9-3 road trip
(Seattle, Oakland, New York, and Cleveland). On Sept. 10, Pedro
Martinez pitched the Game of the Year, one-hitting the Yankees
while striking out 17, the most whiffs ever for the Bronx Bombers.
The team was so energized it took the next two games as well, and
the high continued long enough for them to take two of three in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   If only there were two Pedros, or even 1 1/2 Pedros. When he
pitched, the Red Sox were the best bet in baseball, a reality that
continued right through Saturday, when an impaired Pedro two-hit
the Yankees and struck out 12 in seven innings with, as Tiger Woods
might say, his ``B Game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Pedro out there, neither offense nor defense seemed to
matter. Only Pedro mattered. But while other teams may not have a
Pedro, teams like Atlanta and New York have a number of people who
are worth at least half a Pedro. With the Red Sox, the difference
between No. 1 and No. 2 isn't merely big. It's like falling off the
top of the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox got as far as they did with one great everyday
player _ guess who _ a solid hitter having a career year (Troy
O'Leary), a budding catching star (Jason Varitek), and with a
professional leadoff man (Offerman) doing a professional leadoff
man's job. They also got as far as they did with no real No. 2
hitter, the man who should be batting third batting fourth, and
everyone else of note in slots five, six, and seven batting ahead
of his actual skill level.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland comeback showcased their determination, and when
they put themselves in a position for Pedro to nail it down for
them, he came riding in on his white horse. It was a monumental
achievement, one well worth toasting into the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox were a shaky-fielding team without a pitching
staff, and common sense said these deficiencies would eventually
catch up with them. After Pedro, all Jimy had to offer were rehabs
and throwaways. He had no viable closer. The Yankees had Mariano
Rivera. Is any elaboration necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Be assured that the 1999 Red Sox did everything in their power
to win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special club for me,'' Williams said. ``I think the
city of Boston and the people of New England really like this team.
They never dropped their heads and quit, even tonight. We had a
shot in the eighth inning. They gave their all as baseball players.
They became a unit. They were blue-collar kids who left all between
the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't bother searching for hidden meanings or reasons. It's
not enough to be lovable. It's not even enough to be good. If
you're going to win it all, you've got to be great.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are far from great.

LAST STOP ON A GREAT RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's over.
</P>
<P>
   The wondrous seven-month ride of the 1999 Boston Red Sox ended
with a 6-1 loss to the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the American
League Championship Series. As the end of 20th century draws near,
the Yankees will be going for their 25th World Series title since
Boston sold Babe Ruth to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the curtain on a year of Big Events in Boston
sports. In 1999, Greater Boston played host to the NCAA basketball
tournament, Women's World Cup soccer, the Davis Cup, the Ryder Cup,
and baseball's All-Star Game with its Home Run Derby for the ages.
The sensational season of sport was capped with the Red Sox'
comeback from 0-2 against Cleveland, and last Saturday's Pedro
Martinez masterpiece against Roger Clemens and the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as it was, the magical Red Sox season ended the way
all the others have since the doughboys came home from France. The
championship drought is at 81, and counting, as Y2K steps into the
on-deck circle. ``Wait till next year'' has become ``Wait till next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a festive atmosphere in the finale, inspired by an
eighth-inning rally when it looked like the Sox might get back in
the game. Jason Varitek led with a homer, cutting the score to 4-1,
and the Sox loaded the bases with one out while Martinez _ clad in
down parka, stocking cap, and red oven mitts _ started bouncing
around the Boston bullpen. Then he warmed up. Pedro wanted his
mates to know he'd pitch till November if they needed him.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't. Ramiro Mendoza stuck out Scott Hatteberg and got
Trot Nixon on a popup. Jorge Posada hit a two-run homer in the
ninth to bury Boston for keeps and the Yankees celebrated their
36th American League pennant on the Fenway lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Red Sox go down as Boston's most lovable baseball team
since the Impossible Dreamers of 1967. Not coincidentally, they
gave birth to a new generation of Boston baseball fans, young
people not trained to expect anything bad to happen in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special club for me,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
``I think the city of Boston, the people of New England really like
this team. This whole summer, they never dropped their heads, they
never quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good shot in the eighth tonight. I basically
just thanked them all for what they gave me as a baseball unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the image of their folksy manager, these Sox
displayed a cohesiveness and hunger unlike any Sox edition in three
decades. Their overachievement seemed boundless when they stunned
the cocky Indians, and again when they pounded the proud Yankees
into submission, 13-1, in Game 3. Otherwise sensible people somehow
concluded that the bad stuff was behind them. This was going to be
the year.
</P>
<P>
   The magic carried them to the final innings of the final game.
But they did not win because they were not good enough. They were
simply not quite as talented as the mighty Yankees, and those
Saturday serenades of ``Just like Cleveland,'' and ``Hey, hey, hey
. . . goodbye!'' only underlined the innocence of new members of
Sox citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Boston baseball's October yielded to a winter of
what-ifs? And this time the long-sufferers can curse the names of
umpires Rick Reed and Tim Tschida. But they should admit that the
Red Sox really lost because they had no answer for New York's
pitching. Witness the powerful performance of Orlando ``El Duque''
Hernandez, and relievers Ramiro Mendoza and Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But it's never just about the baseball when the Red Sox play in
October. The Sox uniform gets heavier when the leaves turn brown.
How else to explain a LCS-record 10 errors in only 5 games? How
else to explain two outrageous gaffes by the men in blue that
killed crucial rallies and inspired rare apologies from the umps.
</P>
<P>
   There was considerable karma in the old yard. The daughter of
the Babe threw out the first pitch and said, ``I feel like Daddy
was watching over me.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek made the final out, a fly ball to left. Nomar was on
deck. Symbolic, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a never-say-die kind of team,'' John Valentin said in
the locker room after 1 a.m. ``That's kind of good. The mistakes we
made were very important. You can't make mistakes in the playoffs
against this type of team. They're the world champions. It would
have been special if we beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   They did not beat them. The Yankees were too good. The magic
ride is over. Fenway is closed for the winter.
</P>

WHICH TIME ZONE ARE YOU IN: INTERNET OR ROADKILL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When our home phone line went dead recently, it
reminded me of something that workers had better know. There are
two time zones in America these days: Internet time and roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the phone company that Wednesday afternoon, the
recorded voice told me that a technician would arrive on Saturday
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. When I called back the next day to ask a
real person if she could narrow that 10-hour window, she said the
technician would show up between 2 and 6.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday came, and so did the technician _ at 11:30 a.m. He
fixed the line outside, but didn't bother to call afterward just to
make sure everything was OK. The next day, an automated voice from
the phone company called to say the line was fixed; it didn't
mention anything about crediting my account for the three days my
line didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a phone company horror story. The line did get fixed,
and I'm sure I could get a credit on my bill if I called to
complain. But you could also say that waiting three days and having
that original 10-hour window is ridiculous in this day and age,
that it's pretty bad when a technician misses a four-hour window by
2 1/2 hours, and that I shouldn't have to complain to get my
account credited.
</P>
<P>
   The phone company is operating in the roadkill time zone, acting
like a monopoly at a time when few monopolies are safe. Too many
companies and industries are still in that zone, not realizing that
the Internet not only has increased competition, but has made
people more impatient with the old ways of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a booming economy like this one, lots of companies fail.
</P>
<P>
   And even with unemployment at 30-year lows, many workers get
left behind. In both cases, the problem is usually the same:
They're operating on roadkill time.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have more skills today than you did five years ago,
the world is passing you by. The status quo just won't cut it
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses get comfortable. They have happy customers, and
all seems to be well. Then the landlord raises the rent or a
competitor moves in, and their business suddenly isn't so
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Workers get comfortable, too. Then their company pushes for more
profits or increased productivity, and their jobs suddenly aren't
so comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to blame greedy landlords or office politics or evil
bosses, but the main cause is that people are reacting _ slowly _
to things as they happen. You need to be thinking a couple of years
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Look at your career. Do you see your company doing business as
usual five years from now? If you do, somebody is a fool; now all
you have to do is decide whether it's you or your chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still operating on roadkill time, five years isn't
much.
</P>
<P>
   But on Internet time, it's a couple of generations. Think back
to how relatively meaningless the Web was in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Roadkill thinking is dangerous even for people who believe they
have it made, like government workers. Local governments have been
known to outsource entire departments to get the work done less
expensively. If people see more efficiency in business and less
efficiency in government, expect the political pressure to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   How do you see your company changing in five years? Are
competitors likely to surface? Will your industry have more or
fewer jobs? What will you need to know then that you don't know
now? When you're applying for a job, are you just responding to the
employer's questions, or are you offering ideas of your own?
</P>
<P>
   Take the ``Where do you see yourself in 10 years?'' job
interview question and turn it around. Where do you see that
company in 10 years? Where does your prospective boss see it?
Before you even write a cover letter, show some initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the company's store or Web sites. Find out what
competitors are doing. Go into the interview prepared to talk for
10 minutes about why you want to work for that company and what you
could offer. (Don't actually give the 10-minute talk; just think
about the elements that would go into it.) And, of course, don't
show up for an appointment 2 1/2 hours early. Only phone companies
can get away with that.

MOSCOW LAUNCHES A VIDEO OFFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ One by one, the five Russian servicemen, their hands
bound, their faces showing signs of severe beatings, knelt at the
command of their Chechen captors.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the Russians died. Their executions were captured in
violent detail on video. As one victim struggled for his last
breaths, captors were shown laughing and kicking at his dying body,
before dumping it into a pit with others.
</P>
<P>
   Then a new scene began, showing something no less horrific _
mutilated corpses of Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't show this on national television,'' said the
Russian federal prosecutor who showed this gruesome videotape to
journalists last week in Moscow. The camera technicians for three
major Russian television networks kept filming.
</P>
<P>
   The footage, compiled from Moscow's 1994-1996 campaign to crush
rebels in Chechnya, is now part of a tactic to whip up support for
Russia's latest military effort to tame the North Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   As Russian troops, tanks, and warplanes have driven into
Chechnya's heartland, officials in Moscow have been pushing ahead
with a propaganda offensive aimed at showing off Russia's successes
_ and, it seems, at demonizing the Chechen enemy.
</P>
<P>
   The purveyors of this information war make no bones about their
inspiration: How NATO backed its air raids this spring in
Yugoslavia, with updates detailing allied successes, as well as
Serb atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one lesson of Kosovo that we have learned,'' said
Mikhail Margelov, an organizer of a press center set up to give the
official Russian view of the Chechnya conflict. ``We are trying to
use media technology to let the international community see what is
really going on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the center's daily briefings, Russian generals have provided
upbeat reports of the advance through northern Chechnya. Civilian
officials have told of the effort to return life to normal in the
areas that federal troops control. And prosecutors have listed the
crimes committed by Chechens, their words backed by images such as
Thursday's video.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground in Chechnya, the opening days of the new military
campaign look a lot like the beginning of the 1994-1996 war:
Russian warplanes bomb indiscriminately, refugees flee, and federal
troops surround and bombard villages, while their supposed targets,
Chechen militants, get away to fight again.
</P>
<P>
   The big change is how the war is being reported in Moscow. Last
time, the Russian military had numerous officials giving
conflicting information, making one another look deceptive and
poorly informed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's television screens were filled with disquieting images
from the front _ dead federal soldiers, devastated Chechen
villages, sobbing survivors of air raids _ which belied the
confident claims of military and civilian leaders in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   This time, those images have been absent. Russian television
reports from the front have shown smiling, well-fed federal troops
and confident officers, assuring the Chechens that they have come
in peace. Footage shows heavy guns firing, not where the shells
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has continued to deny civilian casualties,
even when faced with videos and reports from Western journalists in
Chechnya. The same goes for Russian military losses, which Chechens
and independent reports indicate are much higher than the few dozen
that Moscow acknowledges. On Tuesday, a Russian general said he had
trapped Shamil Basayev, Moscow's most wanted Chechen leader, in
Goragorsky, a village in western Chechnya. Basayev appeared on
Wednesday in the Chechen capital of Grozny. On Friday, the Russians
bombarded Goragorsky, reportedly to ruins, although the Chechens
said all their fighters had left. But unlike the last Caucasus
campaign, no one here seems to mind when the official version of
events appears to clash with the truth. If the last war was
unpopular in Russia, Moscow's operation in Chechnya now seems
justifiable to many Russians.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian authorities, the former Soviet republic has
turned into a lawless, murderous place where gangs have abducted
1,300 people for ransom. Attacks, apparently from Chechnya, are an
almost daily event.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Chechnya-based Islamic militants twice invaded the
neighboring Russian region of Dagestan. The Russian government has
blamed them for four bombings that killed 300 people in Moscow and
two other cities last month. The Chechens deny that they were
involved, and no concrete evidence has been produced linking them
to the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the new press center comes in, with its Orwellian
goal of giving ``completely objective information that shows the
official point of view of the Russian government,'' in the words of
a co-director, General Alexander Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal authorities have successfully connected terrorists
with the Chechens, so that in many peoples' minds, the two concepts
are interchangeable,'' said Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst for
the Moscow-based Carnegie Center.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television networks routinely refer to all Chechen
separatists as ``terrorists'' and ``bandits.'' The implication
seems to be that any rebel could blow up a building in Moscow, or
cut the throat of an innocent Russian soldier, and laugh while he
dies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their practice in the last war, many Russian and foreign
journalists are unwilling to visit Chechen-controlled territory,
despite invitations by President Aslan Maskhadov, to get the other
side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has also made it known it will not
tolerate journalists who give air time and print to ``terrorists.''
Emphasizing that point, Russian officials have hinted that
journalists who visit rebel territory could face sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few Russian reporters have been permitted access to areas
controlled by federal forces. Once there, their reports have been
far more positive about the Russian military effort, according to
General Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, a senior federal commander in the
region, who said: ``This time we are getting more help and less
trouble from journalists.''

HAIL TO THE MOMS: CANDIDATES CREDIT THEM FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Al Gore wants political mentoring, when
Elizabeth Dole seeks inspiration, when George W. Bush craves a good
laugh, when Gary Bauer requires a lesson in mental toughness, they
all turn to their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   And when John McCain needs a little scolding, he gets it from
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, Roberta McCain read in a magazine that her son
had shouted obscenities at the guards in the Hanoi prisoner-of-war
camp where he was held from 1967 to 1973. She was furious, and she
called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny,'' Mrs. McCain said, ``I'm coming over there and wash
your mouth out with soap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mom,'' McCain remembers protesting, ``these were very bad
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's no excuse,'' replied Mrs. McCain, who is 87. ``I never
taught you to use such language under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the season of Famous Fathers in presidential politics.
Bush's father was president, and Gore's was a US senator. McCain's
father and grandfather were Navy war heroes. Steve Forbes's father,
the flamboyant Malcolm, built a magazine empire and a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   But while the fathers were off tending to the nation's business,
or building their own, mothers remarkably similar in their
ambition, intelligence, spunk, discipline, and faith stayed home to
raise the current crop of White House candidates. As much as or
more than the fathers, the candidates say, their mothers built
their characters, shaped their personalities, and imparted the
values and some of the views they brought to politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my daddy's eyes and my mother's mouth,'' Bush likes
to joke. ``Sadly,'' Bush's mother, Barbara Bush, told the Globe,
``that may be true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's wit and wisecracking, often with a
needle-sharp edge, indisputably come from the woman Bush
affectionately, and maybe a little fearfully, calls the Silver Fox,
other family members say. ``He's got more of Barbara in him, and
that's good. It makes him both more sparkly and less sensitive than
his father,'' said William Bush, the former president's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Walker _ the W. in the Texas governor's name _ was the maiden
name of President Bush's mother, Dorothy. Indeed, memorable
maternal surnames are not uncommon in the annals of presidents.
According to Charles O. Jones, a political scientist, the six
presidents he views as the most important in this century _ Thomas
Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy,
Lyndon Baines Johnson, Richard Milhous Nixon, and Ronald Wilson
Reagan _ all bore their mother's family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fascinating thing,'' said Jones, a retired professor
at the University of Wisconsin. ``The mothers appear to be the ones
who were nurturing and stimulating leadership in future
presidents.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems true of some of the mothers of today's candidates.
Susie Bradley, who played on a state champion basketball team in
high school, pushed her son, former New Jersey senator Bill
Bradley, all the way to the NBA Hall of Fame. Mary Hanford
tirelessly promoted her daughter Elizabeth for president _ of the
third-grade bird club, the Boyden High School student body, and the
women's college at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth's inspiration and motivation always came from
wanting to please our parents, particularly Mother,'' said John
Hanford, adding that his sister, a two-time Cabinet secretary and
the wife of the former presidential candidate Bob Dole, talks to
Mrs. Hanford by telephone every day.
</P>
<P>
   The only mother playing an active, public role in this campaign
is Mrs. Bush, who raised $100,000 for her son at a single Iowa
fund-raiser last month. But this group is notable in other ways:
</P>
<P>
   --Five of the 10 candidates for the major-party nominations have
living mothers. (By contrast, Bush is the only candidate whose
father is living.) Mrs. Hanford, 98, is the oldest. Mrs. Bush, 74,
is the youngest. In between are Betty Bauer, 76, and Pauline Gore
and Mrs. McCain, both 87.
</P>
<P>
   --Several of the mothers had professions and ambitions before
raising children. Gore's mother was a divorce lawyer. The mothers
of Bradley and Alan Keyes were schoolteachers. Patrick J.
Buchanan's mother was a visiting nurse. Forbes's mother managed the
family's ranches in the West. Dole's mother chose marriage over a
promising career as a musician, and Mrs. Bush dropped out of Smith
College to get married.
</P>
<P>
   --Bradley, who describes himself as his mother's ``greatest
project,'' was an only child, as was Bauer. Dole was the only
daughter in her family; Gore was the only son. Buchanan _ ``Paddy
Joe,'' as Catherine, his mother, called him _ was one of nine
children. So was Utah Senator Orrin G. Hatch, whose mother, Helen,
was a fiercely committed convert to the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   --None of the candidates grew up in single-parent or broken
homes. Hatch's parents were married for 69 years. The Gores had
been together for 61 years when Albert Sr. died last December.
Forbes, the only candidate with divorced parents, was 38 years old
when his mother, Roberta, left his father.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, the former head of the conservative Family Research
Council, says he learned family values from his mother, Betty, a
feisty woman who held her marriage together, made ends meet, and
protected her only son from the psychological abuse of an alcoholic
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't let me get dragged down by a very dicey homelife,''
Bauer recalled, ``but instead said, `Gary, you can get a better
life.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since 1992, when Bill Clinton successfully honed his
image as ``the man from Hope,'' presidential candidates have taken
care to weave heartwarming childhood tales and tributes to
role-model parents into their stump speeches. Describing their
mothers as saintly and steady has become even more a staple since
Hillary Rodham Clinton attributed her husband's scars to abuse from
his mother and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Gore moved his presidential campaign from
Washington to Nashville. The gesture distanced him from the Clinton
administraton and put him 50 miles from the home of Pauline Gore,
his politically astute mother who prepared him since boyhood for
public life.
</P>
<P>
   Opening his new headquarters on her birthday, Gore praised his
ailing mother for teaching him that ``women and men are certainly
equal, if not more so.'' Mrs. Gore looked on proudly as Gore
described how she tutored her blind sister through college and then
lived in a YWCA for $2 a week while attending Vanderbilt Law School
from 1933 to 1936. Mrs. Gore was the school's 10th woman graduate,
though at the time no law firm in Tennessee would hire her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pauline is the best politician in the family,'' said Ned
McWherter, a former Tennessee governor who has known Mrs. Gore all
his life and who has observed her as a strategist and campaigner
for her husband and son.

CALIF. AGRICULTURAL SUCCESS ISN'T PEANUTS _ IT'S ALMONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Now that Congress is poised (again) to make a
multibillion-dollar mess of agriculture _ and President Clinton is
poised to approve it (again) _ it needn't be against the law to
take a little peek at something that works.
</P>
<P>
   Like almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Against a larger background of supply gluts in major products,
prices miles below the cost of production for most noncorporate
farmers, a three-year-old federal law that has been a complete
failure at both saving money and empowering market-based farm
policies, and genuine fear in the small communities that still
depend on family agriculture, consider a few facts.
</P>
<P>
   The people who grow almonds control almonds here at Blue
Diamond, one of the better co-op success stories around (more than
4,000 members in a state that grows some 540 million pounds
annually); they make products with it and spend money to come up
with still more products and marketing methods; they sell almonds
aggressively in this country and all over the world; and they're
doing more than OK at it.
</P>
<P>
   The success of almonds can't be duplicated in corn or wheat or
soybeans or hogs, but it ought to be an instructive example for
government policy makers and legislators as well as farm interests
as another bust cycle in agriculture unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   In his proudly nonswank office here the other day barely a mile
from the state capitol complex, it was apparent that Blue Diamond
CEO Walt Payne, a straight-ahead guy, can get intense on at least
two topics: keeping almonds from ``commodity'' status and
maintaining healthy, rural communities _ two values that are
closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity status means market sharpies screaming obscure lingo
at one another in Chicago that can ruin the years of the best
farmer. It means you're just a futures contract to be played with,
much as the giant processing companies manipulate low farm prices
so they can make billions off what happens from the middle on down
the distribution chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a commodity,'' says the onetime oil industry
official proudly. ``But to make it work we have to differentiate
from others. We have to add value, we have to come up with new
ideas for the use of products we develop. And it means we have to
work hard to export.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, the almond guys were emerging from the '80s
in more than decent shape. But that meant that new tree plantings
were up sharply in response to the good returns (so good, Payne
says, that ``even the growers admitted it''), and that meant that
surplus loomed with all its attendant price and profit dangers.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more challenging, one of the industry's best
customers, the Soviet Union, was in the process of going belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, here are some recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   --An important new product, milk extracted from almonds that is
intended as a dairy substitute for those who can't handle lactose,
turns out to taste good and is just entering the market as Almond
Breeze, a new choice for some 30 million Americans and hundreds
more around the world.
</P>
<P>
   --The latest round in the fat wars over what's good and what's
not has taken a sharp turn in the almond's favor on the basis of
the latest research. Previously, legal challenges had produced a
moratorium on advertising, but now the environment for its branded
snacks (all co-op produced) has improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   --In the meantime, exports (the destination for 70 percent of
the California crop) expand. The industry _ a classic beneficiary
of the last worldwide negotiating round that produced the World
Trade Organization _ also has a strong presence in Washington and
has won important breakthroughs in Europe, India, and East Asia.
This is not peanuts: California's largest agricultural export is
almonds, and it is the country's sixth largest.
</P>
<P>
   When the century began, almonds weren't that different from
grains today. The growers were atomized, selling to dealers on
their own with no leverage. This co-op dates back to 1910, and what
worked then is likely to keep on working in the next century's
world of billion-pound crops.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it can't be copied in big-league grain and beans. But
instead of $8 billion-or-so bailouts each year (too much of it
going to people who don't need it), there is no reason national
policy can't encourage more farmer-owned ventures _ conservation
reserves, local processing facilities, and, of course, a safety
net. There is also no reason why national policy can't more
vigorously enforce the antitrust laws against the middlemen who
profit at farmers' expense and labor.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal were simply plentiful supplies and rock-bottom
prices at supermarkets, corporate agricultures might make sense.
But as Payne knows and his co-op's success proves, healthy family
agriculture means the preservation of a way of life that is more
than worth the effort for all of us.
</P>

 WASHINGTON: ... husband and son.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a good nose for picking out issues that concern
people, and she passed that on to Albert, as well an almost
compelling commitment to do public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore launched his bouquet to his mother a few days after Dole
toasted hers as ``the best teacher I ever had.'' Speaking at the
dedication of the new Elizabeth Hanford Dole Elementary School in
her hometown of Salisbury, N.C., Dole led her audience in
applauding Mrs. Hanford, who was making a rare public appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is giving me too much credit,'' Mrs. Hanford
scoffed before greeting dozens of old friends with waves and kisses
from her wheelchair. Perfectly coiffed and stylishly dressed in a
violet suit and pearl earrings, Dole's mother said in her deep
Southern drawl: ``All I taught her is that love and compassion for
others goes a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   The themes of self-improvement, achievement, and competition
were strong in the Hanford, Bradley, Bush, and Hatch homes, all
presided over by willful, energetic mothers who weren't averse to
using a little thunder or guilt to get results.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother insisted on protocol and performance in her only
child,'' Bradley wrote in his memoir, ``Time Present, Time Past.''
His mother was a fervent Presbyterian, and Bradley remembers how
guilty he would feel when she would say: ```Go ahead and stay in
bed and miss Sunday school. I don't care if you are irresponsible.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bradley was an avid competitor, a counterpoint to Bradley's
father, the town banker who was too compassionate to foreclose on
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``At basketball games, you would hear Mrs. Bradley's voice above
the others, getting after Bill and the officials, too,'' said Dick
Cook, a boyhood family friend in Crystal City, Mo. ``She wanted to
expose him to all his options _ piano, French horn, trumpet,
swimming, boxing. Mr. Bradley cut it off when she tried to give him
dancing lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Hatch saw the spark of an overachiever in Orrin, the
oldest boy after her first son was killed in World War II. The
Hatches were poor, but Mrs. Hatch scraped together the money for
his piano and violin lessons and for a season ticket to the
Pittsburgh Symphony. Hatch says he was particularly close to his
mother, who taught him to sew, write poetry, and love Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad, a big, overgrown building tradesman, hardly ever
spoke,'' Hatch said. ``My mother was constantly making sure I knew
what she wanted me to become.''
</P>
<P>
   She was also quite protective. During his first Senate run in
Utah in 1976, opponents accused the Pittsburgh-born Hatch of being
a carpetbagger. Mrs. Hatch wrote a letter to the state's largest
newspaper that said, ``Don't blame my son. It was my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   History is alive with presidential mothers who were colorful
(Miss Lillian Carter), controlling (Sarah Delano Roosevelt), and
strong (Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Washington, George's cantankerous, ever-complaining mother,
was so jealous of her son's attention to the Revolutionary War that
``she never really warmed up'' to it, said James Rees, executive
director of Historic Mount Vernon, Washington's estate. Still, Mrs.
Washington's ``tough love'' ultimately benefited her son, Rees
said. ``Some of her demands on Washington made him the ambitious,
hard-working, trying-to-please person he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson said he was closer to his proud, pushy mother,
Rebekah, than to his politician father. Dwight D. Eisenhower
attributed his moral compass and his playful grin to his mother,
Ida. And Nixon, in a teary address to his staff the day he left the
White House, called his father ``a great man,'' but his mother,
Hannah, ``a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, a Nixon speechwriter, might have said the same about
his mother. An industrious, God-fearing woman in a household of
seven sons brought up by a boisterous Scottish-Irish father to be
street-fighting bullies, Catherine Buchanan was the ``diplomat
among warriors,'' Buchanan wrote in his autobiography, ``Right from
the Beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought my dad was the dominant force, but I tell you,
my brother's brains come from my mother,'' said James Buchanan,
Patrick's brother and a dentist in Chevy Chase, Md. ``She didn't
say much, but she didn't need to. She expected that as Catholics we
would be moral, work hard, and not embarrass the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Keyes's education _ Catholic and secular _ was the domain
of his mother, Gerthena, who was home when his father, an Army
sergeant, was away. ``Alan has been an educator his entire adult
career, and I think it's because his mother, a teacher, was such a
positive influence,'' said Marlo Lewis, who became Keyes's friend
at Harvard in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who lived in the shadow of a demanding and daring
father, said he endured the pressures and expectations because of a
loving, supportive mother. In a 1992 obituary in Forbes magazine,
he wrote that Roberta Forbes wasn't glamorous or a celebrity, but
her influence on him was ``profound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom was the softie,'' Forbes said, ``the one we turned to for
sympathy, understanding, comfort, or at least a more merciful
sentence. She was ready with the hugs, quick to forgive a lousy
report card, and never reproached our distinct lack of athletic
ability. She never seemed disappointed in our shortcomings. She
took us for what we were. I was grateful for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Bush ``can't define'' her special relationship with
George W. ``I have a bond with all five of our children,'' she
said. But family members trace the closeness to the time when a
young Mrs. Bush, deeply grieving over the death of her 4-year-old
daughter to leukemia and left alone in West Texas by a traveling
husband, turned to her firstborn for consolation and comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   In her memoir, Mrs. Bush recollects hearing George W. tell a
friend he was not able to come over and play because ``he couldn't
leave his mother,'' who needed him. ``That started my cure,'' Mrs.
Bush wrote. ``I realized I was too much of a burden for my little
7-year-old boy to carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCain was also the enforcer, particularly since her
husband, a submarine commander, was often at sea for months at a
time. The most rambunctious of her three children was John, the
oldest. He's still ``such a scamp,'' Mrs. McCain said in a
television interview last summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most vivid childhood memories, the Arizona senator
recounts in ``Faith of My Fathers,'' his best-selling book, was of
a cross-country drive with his mother. Tired of the back-seat
bickering and exasperated with her son for being ``a real pain in
the neck,'' Mrs. McCain threw a banana at John that hit his sister
instead. Mocked by McCain for the miss, she then flung an aluminum
Thermos at him, denting both the Thermos and his brow, and
``knocking me temporarily mute,'' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The blow didn't damage McCain's deep affection for his mother,
an irrepressible extrovert who rebelled against her parents and
eloped with a young sailor named John McCain to Tijuana, Mexico, in
1933. The senator emulated his father's devotion to duty but felt
estranged by his long absences and taciturn nature. He attributes
his own youthful ``hell-raising'' to exaggerating Mrs. McCain's
spirit and exuberance. ``I became my mother's son,'' McCain wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At 87, Mrs. McCain's spirit is still intact, as is her love for
the open road. She's somewhere in Europe now, motoring around with
her identical twin sister Rowena, and not phoning home as often as
her candidate son might like.

CALIF. AGRICULTURAL SUCCESS ISN'T PEANUTS _ IT'S ALMONDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Now that Congress is poised (again) to make a
multibillion-dollar mess of agriculture _ and President Clinton is
poised to approve it (again) _ it needn't be against the law to
take a little peek at something that works.
</P>
<P>
   Like almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Against a larger background of supply gluts in major products,
prices miles below the cost of production for most noncorporate
farmers, a three-year-old federal law that has been a complete
failure at both saving money and empowering market-based farm
policies, and genuine fear in the small communities that still
depend on family agriculture, consider a few facts.
</P>
<P>
   The people who grow almonds control almonds here at Blue
Diamond, one of the better co-op success stories around (more than
4,000 members in a state that grows some 540 million pounds
annually); they make products with it and spend money to come up
with still more products and marketing methods; they sell almonds
aggressively in this country and all over the world; and they're
doing more than OK at it.
</P>
<P>
   The success of almonds can't be duplicated in corn or wheat or
soybeans or hogs, but it ought to be an instructive example for
government policy makers and legislators as well as farm interests
as another bust cycle in agriculture unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   In his proudly nonswank office here the other day barely a mile
from the state capitol complex, it was apparent that Blue Diamond
CEO Walt Payne, a straight-ahead guy, can get intense on at least
two topics: keeping almonds from ``commodity'' status and
maintaining healthy, rural communities _ two values that are
closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   Commodity status means market sharpies screaming obscure lingo
at one another in Chicago that can ruin the years of the best
farmer. It means you're just a futures contract to be played with,
much as the giant processing companies manipulate low farm prices
so they can make billions off what happens from the middle on down
the distribution chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not a commodity,'' says the onetime oil industry
official proudly. ``But to make it work we have to differentiate
from others. We have to add value, we have to come up with new
ideas for the use of products we develop. And it means we have to
work hard to export.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a decade ago, the almond guys were emerging from the '80s
in more than decent shape. But that meant that new tree plantings
were up sharply in response to the good returns (so good, Payne
says, that ``even the growers admitted it''), and that meant that
surplus loomed with all its attendant price and profit dangers.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more challenging, one of the industry's best
customers, the Soviet Union, was in the process of going belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, here are some recent developments:
</P>
<P>
   --An important new product, milk extracted from almonds that is
intended as a dairy substitute for those who can't handle lactose,
turns out to taste good and is just entering the market as Almond
Breeze, a new choice for some 30 million Americans and hundreds
more around the world.
</P>
<P>
   --The latest round in the fat wars over what's good and what's
not has taken a sharp turn in the almond's favor on the basis of
the latest research. Previously, legal challenges had produced a
moratorium on advertising, but now the environment for its branded
snacks (all co-op produced) has improved dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   --In the meantime, exports (the destination for 70 percent of
the California crop) expand. The industry _ a classic beneficiary
of the last worldwide negotiating round that produced the World
Trade Organization _ also has a strong presence in Washington and
has won important breakthroughs in Europe, India, and East Asia.
This is not peanuts: California's largest agricultural export is
almonds, and it is the country's sixth largest.
</P>
<P>
   When the century began, almonds weren't that different from
grains today. The growers were atomized, selling to dealers on
their own with no leverage. This co-op dates back to 1910, and what
worked then is likely to keep on working in the next century's
world of billion-pound crops.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it can't be copied in big-league grain and beans. But
instead of $8 billion-or-so bailouts each year (too much of it
going to people who don't need it), there is no reason national
policy can't encourage more farmer-owned ventures _ conservation
reserves, local processing facilities, and, of course, a safety
net. There is also no reason why national policy can't more
vigorously enforce the antitrust laws against the middlemen who
profit at farmers' expense and labor.
</P>
<P>
   If the goal were simply plentiful supplies and rock-bottom
prices at supermarkets, corporate agricultures might make sense.
But as Payne knows and his co-op's success proves, healthy family
agriculture means the preservation of a way of life that is more
than worth the effort for all of us.

MAKING A FACE WITH FENG SHUI'S COSMETIC SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not uncommon these days to come across folks arranging
their furniture based on feng shui, a Chinese system that strives
for spiritual harmony in homes and work spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a feminist's nightmare of a twist, some women are using
the concept to arrange the makeup on their faces.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Sloan, owner of the Color Investment Cosmetics kiosk in
Boston's Prudential Center, has introduced a feng shui cosmetics
line that she says can improve users' love lives, careers,
finances, and family ties. All women have to do, she says, is mix
the right color combinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of certain colors is historically associated with the
human environment and human feelings,'' she says. ``According to
feng shui, black means career. Today, it's the number one choice
for career wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red equals fame. You wear it if you want to stand out in a
crowd. . . . I took these color philosophies and put them in
cosmetics sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you crave love and marriage? Sloan recommends you wear her
pink, beige, and yellow eye shadow. Pink (worn on the lid) stands
for beauty, tan (worn in the crease) represents balance, and yellow
(worn on the browbone) is closest to heaven. Cheeks and lips? Pink.
</P>
<P>
   Prefer wealth and power? Try purple, gold, and wood green on the
eyes. Purple (on the lid) means wealth _ think of royalty. Wood
green (on the crease) stands for energy _ like the energy from a
living plant. Gold (on the browbone) represents power. Sloan has
also designed kits for knowledge and family; and career and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of women have succeeded in life without a single tube of
lipstick, of course. But Sloan's product, which she says is the
first of its kind in the United States, is gaining notoriety.
Already the London Independent newspaper has written about it, and
Sloan said she recently sold 100 $44 eye-shadow-blush-and-lipstick
kits in one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of terrific things happened, so I'm a believer,'' says
Theresa Baldassarri, a product salesperson at IDX Systems Corp. in
Boston. She bought a wealth and power kit this summer and was soon
promoted. ``I don't know if I was using the makeup as a suit of
armor but . . . I credit the makeup.''

   The British are coming _ for a free wedding gown exhibit
starting Wednesday and running till Oct. 30 at Shreve Crump &AMP; Low
Co. at 330 Boylston St., in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation, called For Weddings, will include the gown
worn by Sarah Ferguson, the duchess of York, in 1986 and a $10,000
gown covered with 2,500 Swarovski crystals.
</P>
<P>
   Wearable gowns will be on hand, too. Eight British designers _

   Now in a new collaboration, retailer Emporio Armani and music
news Web site Launch.com are featuring up-and-coming DJs from
around the US throughout October on both the site and at every US
Emporio Armani boutique, including the Boston store on Newbury

</P>
<P>
   Every Saturday this month, local DJs like Sammy (who plays
progressive house, techno, and trance music at Rise) are performing
for shoppers from 2 to 7 p.m.

   Photographers in the fashion world often struggle to get their
work published. Now Surface magazine, Levi Strauss, and Louis,
Boston are providing them a new forum.
</P>
<P>
   From Friday to Oct. 28, the trio will host a traveling exhibit,
``Avant Guardians,'' at Louis, Boston, to promote the work of 26
unpublished American fashion photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Surface assigned each photographer to
professional hair and makeup artists, stylists, and designers like
Geoffrey Beene, Tommy Hilfiger, and Tom Ford, who agreed to provide
clothing for fashion shoots.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting fashion editorials will be featured in the
exhibit, which will be on display in four US cities.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 people submitted portfolios. The finalists' photos
are also being featured in the October/November issue of Surface.

`FIGHT CLUB' PUMMELS AND PROVOKES THE SENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is ``Fight Club,'' the new rock 'em, sock 'em film starring Brad
Pitt and Edward Norton, an audaciously inspired thriller which,
beneath its visual bells and whistles, provocatively jabs at the
increasingly soft underbelly of the American male? Or is it, in a
society almost overwhelmed by senseless violence, the most
nihilistic, irresponsible, and inflammatory bucket o'cheese ever
fed through a movie projector?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, to both questions, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' is the kind of film for which congressional
</P>
<P>
   panels on violence in the media are formed. Gleefully twisted
and relentlessly bloody, it's director David Fincher's splashy
adaptation of a Chuck Palahniuk novel which envisions men,
emasculated by dead-end jobs, shrewish women, and the whole
bleepin' world, reclaiming themselves by beating the stuffing out
of each other once a week in underground fight clubs _ the ultimate
cockfight, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the film, I felt a deep shudder. I couldn't help but
think of all those dummies who might take the film as a blueprint
for wreaking havoc, a cue to shun civility and order to lash out at
anything or anyone who rubs them the wrong way. In a country where
foolish, angry young men pack guns with their textbooks, ``Fight
Club'' seems as horribly reckless as a shout of ``fire'' in a
crowded theater.
</P>
<P>
   Several articles in the Hollywood Reporter, especially those by
editor Anita M. Busch, have been so critical of the film that 20th
Century Fox, the studio distributing the film, has pulled all of
its advertising in the magazine indefinitely. Busch has called the
film ``exactly the kind of product that lawmakers should target for
being socially irresponsible in a nation that has deteriorated to
the point of Columbine,'' referring to the fatal multiple shootings
at a Littleton, Colo. high school last April.
</P>
<P>
   Busch is right. Yet even as I was horrified, I also found myself
exhilarated.
</P>
<P>
   If any film has ever left me as conflicted as ``Fight Club''
has, I certainly cannot remember it. Two-plus hours of id
unleashed, it's an anarchist's joyride to the end of the world, and
I flinched and laughed, chuckled and cringed from start to finish.
In one moment, I nodded in recognition as it questioned our endless
pursuit of the perfectly accessorized lives we'll never have; in
the next, recoiled as men pummeled each other into hamburger meat.
It's the kind of film that probably spent a third of its budget on
fake blood.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``Fight Club'' is a flawed film. It's too long, Brad
Pitt is essentially channeling his manic ``Twelve Monkeys''
performance (but, oh, that washboard tummy!), and the ending
presents the most infuriating McTwist since the ``it was all just a
dream'' season on TV's ``Dallas.'' To buy it, one needs not only
suspend belief, but force it into retirement altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Fight Club,'' unlike so many simplistic movies from
``Double Jeopardy'' to ``The Story of Us'' _ both of which trumped
it at the box office _ actually wants to be about something. It has
so much on its fevered little mind _ out stifling consumer culture,
what it means to be a man, the search for true emotion and
humanity, and the selling of our souls in nowhere jobs to acquire
the right sofa, the right cappuccino maker _ at times, it's like an
excited child trying to say everything at once. Yes, it's an often
loud, one-note barrage, but one impossible to ignore. It's less a
movie than a provocation, a warped mirror turned on those who have
surrendered and settled.
</P>
<P>
   With its dark, violent vision of society run amok, it's been too
quickly and lazily compared to the Stanley Kubrick classic ``A
Clockwork Orange.'' I would suggest it's more a descendent of
Howard Beale (as played by the late Peter Finch), ``the mad prophet
of the airwaves'' screaming ``I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going
to take it anymore,'' in Paddy Chayefsky's great ``Network.'' It's
like a pitch-black, deviant version of those Frank Capra heroes
like Mr. Deeds or Mr. Smith shaking up the system with their own
singular slant on the ways of the world.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Fight Club,'' Fincher, never a subtle filmmaker, pushes
us over the edge, then offers a helping hand to ressurect us. As
manipulative as he is masterful, he never takes the easy road;
heck, he barely stops long enough to touch the road. Love it or
hate it, and there's certainly lots of room for both, ``Fight
Club'' is unforgettable. And before all is said and done, it may
well be remembered as one of the best _ and worst _ films of the
year.

   NEW HAVEN _ If memory serves, the last Yalie annointed
generational mouthpiece was Joyce Maynard. It earned her a blind
date with J.D. Salinger and a reputation for shamelessly living off
her celebrity. Before Maynard there was the young conservative
William F. Buckley Jr., who still speaks for the generation of
Americans born during the Norman Conquests.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Jedediah Purdy, a 24-year-old Yale Law School student

   Born and raised in rural West Virginia, educated at Phillips
Exeter Academy and Harvard College, a budding public intellectual
in an era that scarcely recognizes the species, Purdy is garnering
the kind of attention the Backstreet Boys might get if they opened
for Stephen Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   With its ponderous subtitle (``Irony, Trust, and Commitment in
America Today''), Purdy's book has generational manifesto written
all over it. Part polemic and part autobiography, it is wholly in
synch with a Zietgeist perpetually searching for the Next Big
Thing.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, look no farther than last month's Purdy profile in
the New York Times Magazine or at a recent ``Saturday Night Live''
hosted by Jerry Seinfeld. Seinfeld looms large in Purdy's dyspeptic
critique of pop culture. A fan of ``Seinfeld'' the sitcom, Purdy
views Seinfeld the TV character as exemplifying what Purdy calls
``terminal irony,'' a worldview that treats all relationships and
institutions fundamentally unseriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irony is powered by a suspicion that everything is
derivative,'' writes Purdy, with uncommon economy. ``Jerry
Seinfeld's stance resists disappointment or failure by refusing to
identify strongly with any project, relationship, or aspiration.''
Calling for a renewed commitment to public service and other common
causes, Purdy dismisses the hip self-distancing of ironists like
Seinfeld as ``the negative security of perpetual suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld returned the compliment a couple of weeks ago. In an
``SNL'' skit about a fatuous diet-book author, the comedian played
``Dr. Jedediah Purdy.'' Maybe one in a thousand viewers got the
reference, maybe one in ten thousand. Back in West Virginia,
though, the cry went up: Jed? Our Jed?
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it as a broad wink in my direction, nothing more,''
says Purdy with a nonchalant shrug. He is lunching near campus with
a reporter, one of many to have hightailed it to Yale over the past
few weeks to see what Jedimania is all about. Around campus, where
he lives with several roommates (but no current girlfriend) and
tries to keep as low a profile as possible, students often do a
double-take when they pass Purdy. Then again, his picture is in the
Yale Book Store's front window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have reacted as though I blame Watergate on
Seinfeld,'' he continues. ``I have no animus against Jerry Seinfeld
or the ironic manner. The spirit in which I wrote is not of someone
outside the culture but as a participant, a product of the
institutions where the ironic manner is most refined.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy breaks into a boyish smile. Downy of cheek and wearing
campus blend-in garb _ crewneck sweater, suede jacket, jeans, work
boots _ he looks about as threatening to the cultural establishment
as Opie on a class field trip to Washington, D.C. If he weren't
larding the conversation with words like ``meritriciousness'' and
``unsalutary'' you'd swear he was on his way to a glee club
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't write well about a cultural temper that you don't
feel connected to,'' Purdy goes on. One difference between Dan
Quayle's attack on Murphy Brown and Purdy's take on Seinfeld, he
says, ``is that I don't give Seinfeld any causal weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Causal weight-wise, Purdy has taken a few lumps himself since
his book came out last month. ``Pious'' and ``sanctimonious'' are
two of the milder criticisms leveled against his earnest diagnosis
of society today. Though clearly to the left of center politically,
Purdy sounds sufficiently conservative on some issues to inspire
comparison to cultural warriors like William Bennett, whom Purdy
loathes. Both his critics and admirers have also struggled to
separate Purdy the messenger from Purdy the message, which to some
extent is an artificial distinction anyway, since Purdy closely
links his life story to his liberal-progressive views. The capsule
bio goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in tiny Chloe, W.Va., on a small family farm. His
parents _ Wally, 48, and Diedre, 54 _ belonged to the early-70s
back-to-the-land movement. Wally dropped out of Penn State to
pursue farming and carpentry. A former philosophy student and a law
school graduate, Diedre became passionately involved in local
political and environmental causes.
</P>
<P>
   In a house without indoor plumbing or television until the late
1980s, Jed and his sister were home-educated until they reached
high school. Beyond a few TV shows and movies like ``Cosby'' and
``Star Wars,'' they had scant exposure to mainstream cultural fare.
Popular music didn't even penetrate Purdy's consciousness until
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Purdy's intellectual gifts were on display early, however. A
voracious reader, he became a national spelling-bee finalist. After
three not terribly challenging years of local high school, he
entered Exeter, where he was first exposed to what he now calls
``the ignorant worldliness of some of my classmates, the easy
contempt they had for anyone who didn't share their variety of
adolescent sophistication.''
</P>
<P>
   After Exeter, Purdy took a year off to work on public policy
issues in his home state. Crisscrossing West Virginia, he was
deeply moved by the grass-roots activism he saw in a state where
coal-mining interests are often pitted against ecological concerns.
Purdy arrived at Harvard in 1993, and Joel Greifinger became one of
his social studies tutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jed was a legend the day he set foot in the department,''
Greifinger recalls. ``It was astonishing to see someone his age who
could read and assimilate as much as he did, even whole disciplines
at a time. He handed in one paper, and the next time I saw it it
was published in the Harvard Review of Philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdy maintains that he did not wage cultural war on Harvard,
notwithstanding the spin to which his bio has been subjected. One
oft-cited anecdote concerns the screening of the movie ``Love
Story'' during Purdy's freshman year. On cue, older students
shouted out comments like ``You're going to get cancer!'' at key
moments in the film. Purdy was upset enough to fire off a letter to
the Harvard Crimson _ if this was freshman hazing meets ``Wayne's
World,'' he didn't care for it _ but he admits now that his protest
was more than an intellectual exercise. A close family friend had
just died of cancer, says Purdy, ``so a lot got stirred up. But it
was also an introduction to a kind of hip smugness I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, Purdy wrote his senior thesis on Montaigne, a hero
of his (along with Tocqueville, Thoreau, and Orwell) and it is one
of the few pieces of Purdy's earlier work to be incorporated into
his book. After college he returned once more to West Virginia,
this time to work for a community development organization. Purdy
also approached The American Prospect, a Cambridge-based journal,
about a job. Editor Robert Kuttner, who also writes an op-ed column
for the Globe, says Purdy ``blew us all away'' with his raw
intellect and writing talent.
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen Prospect pieces later, Kuttner steered Purdy to a
literary agent who negotiated a $75,000 book contract with Knopf.
The manuscript of ``For Common Things'' was completed a year ago,
during Purdy's first semester at Yale. He is now in the second year
of a three-year program combining law, social values, and forestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the snotty press he's been getting, Jed is the real
thing,'' says Kuttner, who compares Purdy to a young Walter Lippman
or Isiah Berlin. ``He's not a media creation. He didn't read the
Classics Comics versions of the books he writes about. There's so
much cheap cynicism out there in our society, in that sense I think
he is an authentic voice of his generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hang that one around Purdy's neck, though, and he winces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that this is a culture obsessed with youth, that
likes the idea of generational spokespersons,'' he says, sitting on
a bench outside Sterling Library. ``I'm skeptical of the idea,
though, especially where there's no unifying experience like the
Vietnam War. Our experience is much more fragmented. Those are
marketers' terms, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   What is Purdy saying to provoke such intense reaction? The book,
conceived as a series of six interlocking essays, examines several
timely phenomena, including the corruption of political rhetoric in
America over the past 25 years; the ``life is a hustle'' philosophy
embodied by magazines like Fast Company and Wired, and by cultural
gurus like Tom Peters; the absence of any overriding governmental
initiatives or ideals in the 1990s; the ``I'll get mine'' dogma of
the educational and cultural elite; and the embrace of feel-good
pop spirituality at the expense of deeper spiritual yearning. He
questions the practice of strip mining (``mountaintop removal'')
and champions political leaders like Polish dissident Adam Michnik.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is terribly radical or even terribly original
stuff, which helps explain why Purdy has become such an attractive
target for cynics. Certainly, the author himself is not surprised
that by showing his private, vulnerable side in print he has made
himself vulnerable to public, ad hominem attack.
</P>
<P>
   At a reading in Cambridge this month, Purdy was asked what
people his age could do to get involved. He mentioned housing
policy, labor organizing, and social service programs, then
conceded that the answers sounded ``rather banal.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, he commented, ``It's inevitable that my life gets
subjected to increased scrutiny now. If I go to work for a
corporate law firm'' _ which Purdy says he has no intention of
doing _ ``it will cast doubt on what I wrote in the book. But this
book is not an announcement of my candidacy for sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a book about my thinking. About a keen sense of
ambivalence that won't go away and may be widely shared. I only
regret that it's been described as `anti-irony.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He leaned over the podium. ``If you're talking about irony as
practiced by Twain and Thoreau,'' Purdy said, ``I'm all for it.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... places in Portugal.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tiny Monsaraz, all 16th-century cobblestone and whitewash, is
entered through a pointed gateway. The views of Portugal, Spain,
and the dividing Rio Guadiana along the castle walls are
breathtaking. Only a couple of streets wind through the town, and
most vehicles must park outside the walls. Monsaraz also is home to
a bullring, a large church, and several shops and restaurants; this
is a popular Portuguese tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at the local O Alcaide included some of my favorite
dishes: ``balcahau a bras,'' a salted cod dish (as omnipresent as
burgers are in this country) scrambled with eggs, onions, and
garlic; ``caldo verde,'' a kale soup; and ``espinafas,'' creamed
spinach pureed with garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us stayed at Casa Paroquial, a small cavelike dwelling
with rooms that emanated history. Three elderly Portuguese women
seemed to always be sitting in the tiny lobby, curiously watching
our comings and goings. The rest of the group stayed at the larger,
more elegant Casa D. Nuno, where many rooms had views of the
surrounding countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The fast ride down the backside of Monsaraz was a thrill. We
stopped before reaching the bottom to check out the Cromleque Xerez
megalithic stone circle, dating to even earlier times than the town
above it.
</P>
<P>
   The small town of Bencatel we passed through on our way to Vila
Vicosa, where we would stay next, was most memorable. Outside the
town are several marble quarries, and with the stone plentiful, it
is used for sidewalks, entryways, and the like, making for quite
unusual architecture for Portugal. One scene from Bencatel I'll
never forget: About 15 men, mostly dressed in black and sitting in
straightback chairs outside of the town's social center, seemed
silently transfixed by the sight of my friend and me cycling by,
watching us until we were out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The next two nights were spent at the lovely, majestic Casa De
Peixinhos, or house of the little fishes, on a hill just outside
the center of Vila Vicosa. We were treated like royalty at the
17th-century manor house, recently renovated for guests. Our group
ate at a long table in the formal dining room, with all our dishes
served to us in style, as they no doubt had been to the home's
first resident, the country's finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning we toured the opulent Palace of the Dukes
of Bragance in Vila Vicosa, and, this being a free day, some of us
rode through neighboring towns of Alandroal, named for the
plentiful flowering oleander shrubs, and Juromenha, both housing
castles. In tiny Juromenha, residents and visitors in black were
lined up outside, for a funeral we were told. The ride back to Vila
Vicosa, though quite hilly, was one of the loveliest of the trip.
Winding roads with boulders strewn about the fields and a nearby
water supply gave this area a lusher, more varied look.
</P>
<P>
   The next day's ride, our longest, at almost 60 miles, was rainy
and cool. Still it was lovely. We passed stork nests and shepherds
using dogs to herd sheep. A colorful truck with a loudspeaker
announcing a bullfight at a local ring passed by. We stopped in
Estremoz for pastries and coffee, bought fruit at the local
farmer's market, and walked up the winding staircase of the police
station to see its beautiful blue and white tiles. The reward after
our long, wet day of riding was great indeed. We cycled up to the
village of Crato for our stay at the impressive Pousada de Flor Da
Rosa. Pousadas, found across the country, are government-run inns
of varying ratings and are usually established in historic
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Flor Da Rosa is the newest of the country's more than 45
pousadas and with its modern furnishings is quite different from
most, I'm told. Imagine what postmodern architect/designer Philippe
Starck would do to the inside of a castlelike 14th-century
monastery. You enter through the cloisters and wind your way to the
lobby, furnished with a modern couch, sleek desk, and an austere
freestanding stone staircase. The grounds include flower gardens
and a large pool, and rooms feature floor-to-ceiling glass doors,
balconies, oversized tubs, and outlet converters. The dining room
and menu are equally impressive, and we gladly stayed two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Our last day of cycling was one of my favorites. The first
stretch was through relatively flat countryside lined with cork
trees and sheep. Next came a two-lane road as narrow as one lane
and seemingly centuries old. Gratefully, we passed only a couple of
cars but many sheep. As we started to climb, the terrain became
rocky and we could see the Serra de Sao Mamede mountain range. Back
on a newer, wider road, we had to cycle over one small mountain
pass; at the top we were surrounded by an evergreen forest with a
magnificent view. Just before we reached our lunch destination of
Castelo de Vide, we continued up to a small chapel and shrine that
looked over the city of about 4,500.
</P>
<P>
   Castelo de Vide is a hidden gem. It has few foreign tourists,
several Renaissance-era flowering fountains, and a medieval quarter
to rival Lisbon's Alfama section. As you walk up the hill and back
in time, you'll find that the narrow cobblestone streets are
dangerously steep, so watch your step as you stroll past colorful
doorways decorated with potted plants and bougainvillea. At the top
is a well-preserved 13th-century castle, which affords a wide view
of the surrounding countryside and foothills.
</P>
<P>
   We turned in our bikes at Marvao (Mar-VOWN), another hill town
similar to Monsaraz. Most of its 1,000 residents live within the
town's 17th-century walls, which took us about a half-hour of
strenuous cycling to reach. The van and trailer carrying our bikes
barely made it through the narrow archway entrance. Cars and buses
also may park just outside the gate. We stayed at Pousada de Sta.
Maria, smaller and older than Flor da Rosa, but equally enchanting.
Marvao's 13th-century castle is fun to explore, and the wall that
surrounds the town is easy and safe to walk along. The views upon
the mountaintop near Spain are beautiful by day and turn eerie as
the sun sets and the nightly fog rolls in. We had our final group
dinner that evening, and were back in the hustle and bustle of
crowded, noisy Lisbon the following morning.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and I stayed on a couple days, visiting antique shops
in the Alfama and dining in the always-hopping Bairro Alto. This
time we stayed at the Hotel Principe Real, an older hotel on the
edge of Bairro Alto. Smack in the middle of an urban residential
area, it captures the flavor of living in the heart of Lisbon. We
had time for one day trip, and there was no question where we'd go:
Sintra. Lord Byron was right when he called Sintra ``glorious
Eden.'' These days the Eden is somewhat marred by tacky tourist
shops, but the town, perched on a mountainside, is still worth the
45-minute train ride from Lisbon. Highlights include beautiful
views, some worthwhile shops, cafes galore, and three castles. Not
to be missed is Palacio Nacional da Pena, built in the 1840s by
Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria. We took the uphill, 90-minute
pedestrian route, but taxis are available as well. The palace
features Arabic minarets, Russian onion domes, and Gothic turrets,
and the lavish interior includes a furnished kitchen and a
tile-covered toilet. From its walls you can see Serra da Sintra,
the coast, and, on a nearby hillside, the statue Ferdinand had
commissioned of himself, overlooking his domain.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of egocentricity is not common among the Portuguese.
Though sometimes the country folks seem standoffish, most are
welcoming and seem politely amused by Americans' attempts at
speaking Portuguese. The people, food, and sights are plenty reason
to find the time to visit this small, inviting country, and being
on a bicycle makes the trip even more memorable.

REALM OF THE MONARCH STRETCHES FROM CANADA TO MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ On a mild Saturday morning in early October, a
single monarch butterfly wafted from a patch of scrub trees, dying
goldenrod and aster in a littered grove in Troy, hovered
erratically, then darted away.
</P>
<P>
   But where to? This monarch may have joined its dead mates,
riddling the roadside or stuck to a windshield wiper. As likely,
the monarch may have found the Hudson River, using it as a guide to
continue an amazing, arduous migration, as long as 2,000 miles from
Canada to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In the mountains of Michoacan, in central Mexico, the
butterflies gather in winter colonies so great in number that the
fir trees seem instead huge sugar maples, ablaze in orange autumn
glory. Though the burnt-orange monarch is as familiar in northern
climes as a dandelion, it is in fact a tropical butterfly that
makes a unique journey southward, following an intricate,
mysterious calling.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian zoologist Fred A. Urquhart chased the monarch for
four decades to find its winter colony. The quest included
sometimes darkly comic attempts to perfect the gummed tags that
introduced a tagging system enthusiastically embraced by volunteers
and schoolchildren nationwide. A year after his associates, Ken and
Cathy Brugger, discovered the first roost in central Mexico,
Urquhart tried to impart the awe of seeing millions of monarchs
gathered in one roost in an article he wrote for National
Geographic in 1976:
</P>
<P>
   ``While we stared in wonder, a pine branch, 3 inches thick,
broke under its burden of languid butterflies and crashed to earth,
spilling its live cargo. I stooped to examine the mass of dislodged
monarchs. To my amazement, was one bearing a white tag!''
</P>
<P>
   The tag showed that part of this butterfly's journey included a
stop in Chaska, Minn., where one Jim Gilbert tagged it in a field
of goldenrod.
</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of this spectacular migration can be taken somewhat
at face value. The tropical monarch, Danaus plexippus, evolved to
migrate northward to take advantage of a vast resource: the
milkweed on which its caterpillar feeds, and which imparts a
foul-tasting poison to birds, the theory goes.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the monarch became adapted to travel, but not the
extreme winter. ``In that way, it has to leave, it has to avoid
being frozen,'' said Robert Dirig, a lepidopterist and assistant
curator of the Bailey Horatorium at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, monarchs begin their one-time southward migration
in late August, though stragglers, aberrants that one scientist
likened to the deciduous tree that turns color in August, do remain
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of (the latecomers) is uncertain, but certainly the
chance of them making it diminishes daily. It all has to do with
the breaks. Chance. Are they going to encounter a crippling freeze
or not?'' said Robert Michael Pyle, a Washington state biologist
who has studied monarchs most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The monarch inherently makes the southward trip once, to spend
the winter is a semi-dormant state, in a perfect microclimate for a
condition akin to hibernation. In the mountain colonies, the
temperature hovers at freezing. The oyamel firs act both as
protective umbrella and thermal water bottle. After mating, the
same butterflies in late February make a partial northward return,
laying the eggs of successive generations in the Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   No other butterfly migrates in a round-trip pattern of such
magnitude, said Lincoln P. Brower, research professor of biology at
Sweet Briar College in Virginia and a leading monarch authority.
The strategy of the monarch migration is still being deciphered.
</P>
<P>
   Brower said shorter days and lower temperatures halt the
butterfly's sexual maturity and trigger the drive to head to ``cold
storage.'' Yet, scientists are still trying to understand patterns
of migration and exactly how they find their way, be it through a
sun compass or magnetic sensory to find a winter roost they've
never seen.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about the daily life of the monarch, Pyle in 1996
logged 9,462 miles following monarchs in western North America. He
documents his excursion, from British Columbia to Mexico, in the
book ``Chasing Monarchs: Migrating with the Butterflies of
Passage'' (1999 Houghton Mifflin Company).
</P>
<P>
   Pyle's work was part naturalist's journal, part scientific field
work.
</P>
<P>
   By following monarchs, by camping with them as they roosted
overnight, Pyle assembled a composite of a day's journey, estimated
from 80 to 200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle noticed a scarcity of monarchs in the middle of the day, a
disappearing act that could mean they were making time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough assignment, not only to make time and distance,
but it's also incumbent on them to take in nectar to build fat
reserves. They've got to balance their time between distance and
nectaring and ultimately being in a safe place for the night,''
Pyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Their journey strips away the notion that the butterfly, or at
least the monarch, is fragile.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a butterfly, it's a very large and very tough butterfly,''
said Robert K. Robbins, chairman of the department of entomology at
the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. ``Generally,
butterflies which put poisons in their wings and are distasteful
... are very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides compiling a poetic journey, Pyle was testing a long-held
theory about monarch migration: that monarchs east of the Rockies
migrate to Mexico, while monarchs west of the mountain range
migrate to the California coast. Pyle did witness butterflies of
the West head south, into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It is no small point.
</P>
<P>
   The passage may mean there are more unknown colonies, perhaps in
western Mexico, or, as Brower posited in a study he co-authored
with Pyle, a mixing of populations previously thought separated by
the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   That the population may be whole has important implications for
preserving what is considered an endangered phenomenon. ``That
makes it even more imperative and urgent to protect the rapidly
deteriorating sites in Mexico,'' said Brower, deeply involved in a
conservation effort to protect the mountain colonies from swiftly
encroaching logging.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Vanity Fair article on the monarchs detailed how the
butterflies returned to one cleared forest, hovered for a few days
in confusion, then simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Brower, involved in the Wildlife Conservation Society and World
Wildlife Fund, is working on a new plan to conserve the
overwintering sites, already declared protected areas in a broad,
sometimes violated, 1986 presidential decree. Brower predicts that
if a concerted plan does not coalesce in a few years, the eastern
migration will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Pyle as a scientist is hesitant to personify the monarch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``If I were to make metaphoric (comparisons) connecting
them to humans: extraordinary endurance. The endurance is
astonishing. I like to think they're extremely adept animals at
what they do, extremely adaptable to conditions, resistant to
threatening conditions. They are simply a highly honed animal ...
very, very good at what they do.''

A SMALLER LINER STILL PACKS SPEED AND AMENITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In comparison to some whale-like ships being introduced, the new
Olympic Voyager is a shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   It will weigh in at 25,000 tons vs. the 100,000-ton-plus vessels
some lines are building. And, it will carry only 840 passengers vs.
the 2,000 to 3,000 of some lines.
</P>
<P>
   But what the liner will lack in size, it will more than make up
for in speed and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Olympic Voyager, now in the last stages of
construction at the Blohm and Voss Shipyard in Hamburg, Germany, is
the first new vessel of the Royal Olympic fleet. The line is the
result of a 1995 merger of Sun and Epirotiki cruise lines and
currently consists of eight ships that offer three- to 56-day
destination-oriented cruises to some of the most historic places in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   While most cruisers don't look for speed in a ship, its expected
27-knot cruising speed will play a major role in its itinerary,
allowing the vessel to travel to three continents in seven days
with time enough to sample some of the world's most fascinating
places. When it begins service next June, the ship will depart from
Piraeus (Athens) Greece, then sail to Santorini, cross the
Mediterranean to Alexandria (Cairo), Egypt, then on to Ashrod,
Israel, for Jerusalem, then to Rhodes, Istanbul, and, on its last
day, a double-hitter of Turkey's Kusadasi for Ephesus (one of the
ancient world's most beautiful cities, which even in its ruins
towers above other ancient sites), and Greece's Mykonos.
</P>
<P>
   After the summer season, the ship will sail out of Fort
Lauderdale, and feature a 14-day round-trip sailing up the Amazon
River and back to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will achieve its speed through a unique hull design the
Blohm and Voss Shipyard developed. Already the shipyard has begun
work on a second vessel for the line, the Olympic Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The speed of the ship will not only allow the vessel to go
greater distances in a week's cruise, but also to stay in port
longer. When I sailed on the then Sun Line Stella Solaris in 1985,
our cruise was limited to Greek isles and Turkey. Israel and Egypt
were part of another cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Aleco Keusseoglou, cochairman of the line, said the decision to
go for speed was made to further differentiate the ships from other
lines. ``This 21st-century design and technology demonstrates Royal
Olympic's commitment to expanding and modernizing our fleet so that
we may continue to provide guests with unique, culturally enriching
vacation experiences onboard mid-sized, human-scale vessels.''
</P>
<P>
   The line already offers an on-board enrichment program that they
feel is second to none. The program features specialists in various
fields, and has included many Pulitizer Prize winners. A new
feature to be introduced on the Olympic Voyager will be one-on-one
meetings with the on-board speakers who have included astronauts
and the son of Nikita Khrushchev.
</P>
<P>
   The ship also will introduce some innovative food experiences.
Cooking classes with hands-on participation by guests will be one
program. Italian pizza and pasta will be prepared and served daily
by the pool. International-themed breakfasts will be another
offering. Menus will integrate Pacific Rim and Greek specialties,
and all the menus will be prepared with the assistance of a
professional nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the line plans on holding ``Valentine's Day'' once every
cruise. Jacques Bourguignon, vice president of hotel operations,
said ``the idea is to provide some romance on every sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ship will be fast, it will also be very stable.
Andreas Angelidakis, director of new ship construction for the
line, said tests have shown that the vessel will perform better
than most ships in rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Voyager will offer 12 Sky Suites with private
balconies, among the largest at sea; 16 Bay Window suites, spacious
accommodations with large windows overlooking the ocean; and 266
more staterooms, including four for passengers with disabilities. A
fitness and spa center will include a Turkish bath, sauna, mud
baths, and offer massages.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a warm, homey feel. Extensive use of fine woods,
classically designed ceramics, colorful carpets, and fine
contemporary art will be found throughout the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises will begin at $2,150 with discounts of up to 40 percent
on certain departures for early bookings. Travel agents have
details or call Royal Olympic Cruises at 800-872-6400 or check out
www.royalolympiccruises.com.

Virtual Voyager
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest cruise ship, Royal Caribbean's Voyager of
the Seas, will begin sailing next month, but spectators at the Head
of the Charles race (Saturday and Oct. 24) along the Charles River
will get a sneak preview of the 142,000-ton ship. The Virtual
Voyager exhibit will be at the Rowing and Fitness Expo at Magazine
Beach on the Cambridge side of the Charles. The virtual tour is a
high-tech 3-D tour that features some of the ship's amenities
including an ice-skating rink, rock-climbing wall, and in-line
skating track. The free tour runs from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and lasts
about 5 minutes.

Millennium cruises
</P>
<P>
   Space is still available on millennium cruises, according to the
Cruise Lines International Association, which represents most
lines. Among some of the cruise opportunities are a midnight
rendezvous with sister ships of Royal Caribbean International and
Celebrity Cruises in the Caribbean for a special fireworks display
and customized gifts from Tiffany &AMP; Co.; the chance to cross the
international dateline and celebrate the midnight countdown twice
aboard Crystal Cruises sailings in the South Pacific and South
America; and a gala New Year's celebration at Antarctica's Port
Lockroy along with a complimentary gift aboard Orient Lines.

<P>
   Being perceived as a power couple can be a strain. Especially if
you haven't yet decided to become one.
</P>
<P>
   In June of 1995, Dee Dee Myers had been out of her job as White
House press secretary for six months, and after a friendly dinner,
she and New York Times White House correspondent Todd Purdum were
chatting in her car in front of his house when they were
unceremoniously rousted by the cops.
</P>
<P>
   Myers _ behind the wheel but not in motion _ was arrested for
driving under the influence of alcohol. She pleaded not guilty and
entered a diversion program, and the misdemeanor was expunged. But
not before the story made national news, with a picture of Purdum's
front door showing up in the New York Post with the headline
``Street of Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Russian newspaper Izvestia got into the act, reporting
that Myers had been expressing endearments to a new swain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that saved us was that it was the same night as
Hugh Grant's peccadillo,'' says Purdum, now the Times bureau chief
in Los Angeles. ``It was needlessly humiliating.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a hell of a way to jump-start a relationship. In
fact, it almost killed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ultimately became, like the rest of life, good narrative
material,'' Purdum goes on. ``But at the time, we were just in very
tentative stages of deciding whether or not we wanted to have
dates. Really, carnality had not entered the picture. And the
result was that for many months, Dee Dee did not want to have
anything to do with me. It really scared her away.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at the point where Purdum was about to start playing
guitar and throwing pebbles at her window, the pair got back
together.
</P>
<P>
   Then on the first anniversary of the Night of Shame _ as they
refer it _ they commemorated the traumatic occasion. Purdum picked
up blinking lights at a bicycle store and they arranged them in
Myers' driveway so as to cast an aura of gung-ho law enforcement.
Then the couple perched on the tailgate of her car and ate oysters
on the half shell while they listened to music waft from the radio.
</P>
<P>
   A little under a year later they got married.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the wedding, my brother said in his toast, `Couldn't you
have just invited her in, Todd?''' says Purdum, an unabashed
romantic who says he still has to pinch himself to believe that
Myers fell in love with him.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Myers affectionately contrasts her husband _ a
Times stringer in his Princeton days who became a copyboy upon
graduation _ with his more cynical journalist colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good egg,'' she say. ``He's completely unafraid to be
wowed: `Wow! This is the White House.' `Wow! We're in Sam Goldwyn's
house.' 'Wow! That's Drew Barrymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the pair, who settled in California in 1997,
circulates in an ever-widening sphere of celebrity. But they also
find themselves frequenting the aisles of Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``What surprises me is how quick you want to become a
Californian,'' says Perdum, proud owner with Myers of a 1931
English-style cottage in the Wilshire district. ``When we made two
trips to Home Depot in 24 hours, I knew we were sunk, because you
want to have the best-blooming flowers and you want your lemons to
be healthy. It's very seductive.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker staff writer Betsy Kolbert, who was the Times' Albany
bureau chief in the early '90s when Purdum was covering City Hall,
says of the couple, ``Todd's always coming home with these stories
about being at Barbra's. (As in Streisand.) But they're totally
down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds producer Sean Daniel, another friend, ``They're the
smartest people around today. Put them together and they know
everything. But they're grounded in the real world. I don't think
either of them is going to put on airs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Garrick, a Democratic media consultant for Los Angeles,
who's known Myers since she worked on Dianne Feinstein's 1989
California gubernatorial campaign, describes both Myers and Purdum
as ``incredibly American. They're the best of what America has to
offer: the opportunity through savvy and smarts to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdum's father and grandfather were in the savings &AMP; loan
business just outside of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, the jock daughter in a Navy family, grew up in the remote
Los Angles suburb of Valencia, then went to Santa Clara University.
With no grand plan for her life, she climbed her way up in
hard-core Democratic political circles, working for Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Frank Jordan
and Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in acknowledgment of her work on the 1992 Clinton
presidential campaign, she was awarded the high-profile position of
first woman _ and, at 31, youngest-ever _ White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought I was going to roller-skate in a bikini
into my first press briefing. That's sort of how they treated
people from California,'' she says. ``The Washington establishment
thinks it's all freaks and flakes and nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Appointing Myers was an expedient move for Clinton, under
pressure to pick a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was in that position. I'm not an idiot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But three others also dealt with the press, and Myers wasn't
given the clout _ or the inner-circe status _ she needed to project
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after getting into what she describes as ``a pissing
contest'' with new chief of staff Leon Panetta, whose job was to
restructure the West Wing, she resigned in December 1995 after at
last being granted more than figurehead status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to do the job was one anguished moment after another,''
she says. ``I won the battle, but I lost the war.''
</P>
<P>
   After she left, Myers joined Vanity Fair in 1995 as a
contributing editor, put in two years on the TV talk show ``Equal
Time,'' hit the lecture circuit and _ with her Cristophe haircuts,
plucked eyebrows and quick wit _ has become one of television's
most prominent talking heads.
</P>
<P>
   After initial loyalty to President Clinton in the Monica
Lewinsky debacle, she became outspoken in her criticism,
demonstrating her no-nonsense ability to articulate what the public
is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   She says Lewinsky _ who she thinks is still in love with the
president _ thanked her when the two met at this year's Vanity Fair
Oscar party for not trashing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about Tom Cruise, you don't really see the charisma.
With Bill Clinton, you're sucked into it,'' Myers says. ``I saw
adult women _ not that he did anything about it _ but I would see
them turn into giggling, knee-wobbling pots of jelly in his
presence. He knows how to work it. Women are putty in his hands.
You take an insecure 22-year-old girl, what do you expect? Not
every girl would show the president her underwear on a first
meeting _ but he was giving her a signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former colleague George Stephanopoulos, Myers has not
written a tell-all book _ though she says she's had offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to wrestle with what you owe this person even if he
disappoints you,'' she says. ``I think one of the things that's
hard for presidents is they don't trust anybody around them. Some
ass is always sitting in the corner scribbling notes.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who was subpoenaed multiple times in the Whitewater
hearings and called before the grand jury in the Vincent Foster
case, Myers is not sorry to be out of the Washington fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal _ and personally destructive _ culture,
and that is the thing I miss the least,'' she says. ``It's a mean
place. This is not a mean place. It's a forgiving place. People
wake up in the morning and read in the L.A. Times that they got
forced out as head of a studio or something, but three weeks later
they have a product deal or they're working somewhere else. In
Washington, people treat it as if there's a finite amount of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   After some moments of oh-my-God-what-have-we-done panic, Purdum,
too, settled happily into life in Los Angles where he covers
breaking news and turns out graceful stories that recognize the
state's quirky side without settling for the outsider's habitual
palm-tree-and-Cadillacs take on the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find any reality in my life to the Los Angles cliche
that it's all a bunch of empty-headed people,'' he says, admitting
a few minutes later that he is unnerved by the town's emphasis on
perfection. ``Dee Dee laughs at this, but one of my indices of
Southern California values is that all three of the Brown sisters,
Nicole included, had breast implants and none went to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter notes that Purdum
doesn't resemble anyone else in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like a little Princeton professor on his way to
class. He's the only person in Los Angeles who wears lace-up
shoes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Carter, who claims to find politics boring these days, says
Myers is one of the few people who can make them interesting to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Purdum and Myers may have left Washington, but both are eagerly
following Hillary Clinton's bid for the New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been very popular when she's been weak, and very
unpopular when she's been strong,'' points out Myers, who thinks
the public, fed up with the soap opera of the Clintons' marriage,
would rather hear about policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if she's out front, playing by the rules and willing to
take her lumps, the public will be more indulgent than if they see
her as Lady Macbeth, which they hate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myers still wonders if Hillary Clinton's self-assuredness
might not continue to rub voters the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've proven that they like cuddly,'' she says. ``He's
really cuddly and accessible, even though he's a rogue.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Myers is in Los Angeles, she hasn't entirely
left politics behind. She's taken a job as a consultant on NBC's
fall TV series ``West Wing,'' which stars Martin Sheen as the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing that will never happen in this drama is any
kind of personal scandal surrounding the president.'' she says.
``There won't be a big sex scandal on this show. It's too
hackneyed.''

   One requirement to be a travel agent should be patience. Witness
these stories provided by agents and making the e-mail rounds:
</P>
<P>
   --``I had someone ask for an aisle seat so that his or her hair
wouldn't get messed up by being near the window.''
</P>
<P>
   --``A man called, furious about a Florida package we did. I
asked what was wrong with the vacation in Orlando. He said he was
expecting an ocean-view room. I tried to explain that is not
possible, since Orlando is in the middle of the state. He replied,
`Don't lie to me. I looked on the map and Florida is a very thin
state.' ''
</P>
<P>
   --``A woman called to make reservations: `I want to go from
Chicago to Hippopotamus, N.Y.' The agent (asked), `Are you sure
that's the name of the town?' `Yes.' . . . The agent scoured a map
of New York and finally offered, `You don't mean Buffalo, do you?'
`That's it! I knew it was a big animal!' ''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Travel Trivia: Which continent has no mold or mildew? (Answer at
end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   Quotable: ``Beautiful mountains, breathtaking coastline, and
clean and clear waters made New Zealand an enchanted land everybody
dreamed of finding. . . . Most people gave up because they never
got to visit New Zealand'' _ President Clinton, who did get to
visit.
</P>
<P>
   In a name: During the Vietnam War, American prisoners in Hanoi
jokingly called their quarters the Hanoi Hilton. But now there
really is a Hilton in Hanoi. The 269-room Hilton Hanoi Opera hotel
opened earlier this year. And in the future? Hilton is studying the
possibility of a hotel in space or on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween happenings: The ninth annual Halloween Horror Nights
at Universal Studios, Fla., running several nights through Oct. 31,
is called The Last Gasp. Included are haunted mazes with terrifying
3-D effects. . . . Aberdeen, Scotland, is offering ``Ghost and Gore
Pub Trails. . . . During the Day of the Dead celebration in San
Antonio Nov. 1 and 2, many churches set up special altars with
candles, skeletons, and bread for the dead. The goal is to preserve
tradition and foster pride in Hispanic culture.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of the month: When the Exploratorium opened in San
Francisco in 1969, featuring interactive and hands-on exhibits, it
changed the concept of what a science museum could be. That
revolutionary idea of ``audience participation'' in turn had a
major impact on other museums, including many yet to be built.
Today, the Exploratorium is filled with more than 650 hands-on
exhibits, with subjects ranging from memory to turbulent
landscapes. As actor Robin Williams put it, the Exploratorium is
``a wonderful place to be at play in the gravitational fields of
the Lord.'' The museum is inside the Palace of Fine Arts in San
Francisco's Marina District. For more information, call
415-561-0360 or visit www.exploratorium.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Today's loopy law: Douglas Avenue in Wichita, Kan., must be
quite the thoroughfare. Although he's not sure of the status of the
law, Jim Dickeson of Acton writes, ``In Wichita (my hometown), if
you drive an automobile on Douglas Avenue west of the Arkansas
River, you are required to have someone walk in front of the
vehicle yelling, `Automobile!'. . . . I have personally broken this
law uncounted times and I have not once startled a horse,'' the
creature that, presumably, the law was intended to protect. And
www.dumblaws.com says that at Douglas and Broadway, a person in an
auto is required to get out, fire three shotgun rounds into the
air, get back in the vehicle, and proceed through the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Travel bookshelf: If you like ranches and four-legged creatures
who neigh, you might consider ``Jim Balzotti's Best Guest Ranches
and Horseback Riding Vacations'' (Balzotti Publications, $22.95).
The oversized softcover book is a wide-ranging and profusely
illustrated guide to guest ranches and dude ranches, as well as
romantic country inns, fox hunts, cattle drives, pack trips, and
remote fishing adventures. Areas covered range from the West to New
England to Canada to Ireland. In addition, there are cartoons,
campfire recipes, and ``A Cowboy's Guide to Life,'' which offers
such advice as ``Never ask a barber if you need a haircut.'' The
book is available through AAA, in some catalogs and bookstores, and
by calling 800-829-0715. Balzotti, incidentally, is chairman of the
Pembroke selectmen.

California gubernatorial campaign, describes both Myers and Purdum
as ``incredibly American. They're the best of what America has to
offer: the opportunity through savvy and smarts to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdum's father and grandfather were in the savings &AMP; loan
business just outside of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, the jock daughter in a Navy family, grew up in the remote
Los Angles suburb of Valencia, then went to Santa Clara University.
With no grand plan for her life, she climbed her way up in
hard-core Democratic political circles, working for Los Angeles
Mayor Tom Bradley, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Frank Jordan
and Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in acknowledgment of her work on the 1992 Clinton
presidential campaign, she was awarded the high-profile position of
first woman _ and, at 31, youngest-ever _ White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought I was going to roller-skate in a bikini
into my first press briefing. That's sort of how they treated
people from California,'' she says. ``The Washington establishment
thinks it's all freaks and flakes and nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Appointing Myers was an expedient move for Clinton, under
pressure to pick a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was in that position. I'm not an idiot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But three others also dealt with the press, and Myers wasn't
given the clout _ or the inner-circe status _ she needed to project
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after getting into what she describes as ``a pissing
contest'' with new chief of staff Leon Panetta, whose job was to
restructure the West Wing, she resigned in December 1995 after at
last being granted more than figurehead status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to do the job was one anguished moment after another,''
she says. ``I won the battle, but I lost the war.''
</P>
<P>
   After she left, Myers joined Vanity Fair in 1995 as a
contributing editor, put in two years on the TV talk show ``Equal
Time,'' hit the lecture circuit and _ with her Cristophe haircuts,
plucked eyebrows and quick wit _ has become one of television's
most prominent talking heads.
</P>
<P>
   After initial loyalty to President Clinton in the Monica
Lewinsky debacle, she became outspoken in her criticism,
demonstrating her no-nonsense ability to articulate what the public
is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   She says Lewinsky _ who she thinks is still in love with the
president _ thanked her when the two met at this year's Vanity Fair
Oscar party for not trashing her.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about Tom Cruise, you don't really see the charisma.
With Bill Clinton, you're sucked into it,'' Myers says. ``I saw
adult women _ not that he did anything about it _ but I would see
them turn into giggling, knee-wobbling pots of jelly in his
presence. He knows how to work it. Women are putty in his hands.
You take an insecure 22-year-old girl, what do you expect? Not
every girl would show the president her underwear on a first
meeting _ but he was giving her a signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former colleague George Stephanopoulos, Myers has not
written a tell-all book _ though she says she's had offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to wrestle with what you owe this person even if he
disappoints you,'' she says. ``I think one of the things that's
hard for presidents is they don't trust anybody around them. Some
ass is always sitting in the corner scribbling notes.''
</P>
<P>
   As someone who was subpoenaed multiple times in the Whitewater
hearings and called before the grand jury in the Vincent Foster
case, Myers is not sorry to be out of the Washington fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal _ and personally destructive _ culture,
and that is the thing I miss the least,'' she says. ``It's a mean
place. This is not a mean place. It's a forgiving place. People
wake up in the morning and read in the L.A. Times that they got
forced out as head of a studio or something, but three weeks later
they have a product deal or they're working somewhere else. In
Washington, people treat it as if there's a finite amount of
power.''
</P>
<P>
   After some moments of oh-my-God-what-have-we-done panic, Purdum,
too, settled happily into life in Los Angles where he covers
breaking news and turns out graceful stories that recognize the
state's quirky side without settling for the outsider's habitual
palm-tree-and-Cadillacs take on the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't find any reality in my life to the Los Angles cliche
that it's all a bunch of empty-headed people,'' he says, admitting
a few minutes later that he is unnerved by the town's emphasis on
perfection. ``Dee Dee laughs at this, but one of my indices of
Southern California values is that all three of the Brown sisters,
Nicole included, had breast implants and none went to college.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanity Fair editor-in-chief Graydon Carter notes that Purdum
doesn't resemble anyone else in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like a little Princeton professor on his way to
class. He's the only person in Los Angeles who wears lace-up
shoes,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Carter, who claims to find politics boring these days, says
Myers is one of the few people who can make them interesting to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Purdum and Myers may have left Washington, but both are eagerly
following Hillary Clinton's bid for the New York Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been very popular when she's been weak, and very
unpopular when she's been strong,'' points out Myers, who thinks
the public, fed up with the soap opera of the Clintons' marriage,
would rather hear about policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe if she's out front, playing by the rules and willing to
take her lumps, the public will be more indulgent than if they see
her as Lady Macbeth, which they hate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Myers still wonders if Hillary Clinton's self-assuredness
might not continue to rub voters the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've proven that they like cuddly,'' she says. ``He's
really cuddly and accessible, even though he's a rogue.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Myers is in Los Angeles, she hasn't entirely
left politics behind. She's taken a job as a consultant on NBC's
fall TV series ``West Wing,'' which stars Martin Sheen as the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one thing that will never happen in this drama is any
kind of personal scandal surrounding the president.'' she says.
``There won't be a big sex scandal on this show. It's too
hackneyed.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeanswear designers are asking themselves: After
Gucci, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Stores are flooded with interpretations of Gucci's '70s-inspired
jeans after the look was tested and well received for spring and
summer. After several years of oversized, unisex looks, the market
was primed for Gucci's hippie-chic fantasy, jeanswear designers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing out there right now comes close to the Gucci trend,''
said Carla Slocum, vice president, design, for Lizwear, which
offers subtle Gucci interpretations for fall. ``It has an emotional
appeal, and works for everybody, from older customers who remember
the look the first time, to young people who see it as brand new.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Fiene, chief executive officer of XOXO jeans, said the
Gucci trend represented a larger fashion direction that is
revolutionizing denim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeans had become boring and dull in recent years, but Tom Ford
and other upper-tier designers brought back fun and fashion from
the '70s and '80s and made denim sexy again,'' Fiene said.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO's seven-month-old jeans line is 70 percent fashion and only
30 percent basics, with a variety of Gucci-inspired styles.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gucci, designer collections _ often with their own denim
groups _ can be a wellspring of inspiration today. Helmut Lang's
dirty washes and knee pads; Versace's embellished capris; Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana's prints and fringe; Martin Margiela's patchworks; John
Galliano's western pony prints and whip stitching have all made
their mark on denim this year.
</P>
<P>
   Designer power is fueled by widespread media attention. A host
of new fashion magazines and TV programs has raised consumer
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten-year-olds know Prada, Gucci _ all the big names,'' said
Lisa Engelman, national sales manager for the New York-based
jeanswear firm Paris Blues. ``More magazines and in-your-face TV
shows are making teens much more savvy than 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the rising influence of designers, the primary muses
of denim remain streetwear, pop culture and especially music.
Indeed, jeanswear designers say, many kids thrive on setting trends
of their own, rather than slavishly following runway looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any high fashion image becomes dated quickly with kids,
especially when their mothers start picking up on it,'' said Allan
Kemp, design director at Silver Jeans, a firm based in Winnipeg,
Manitoba. ``A big trend now is no-trend, as some kids reject
contrived designer looks in favor of creating their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately ``anti-label,'' with little advertising, Silver
promotes kids' quest for individualism, offering a variety of
inseams and arm seam lengths for different body types. Jeans are
presented without models, so consumers can imagine themselves in
them, rather than conforming to an image.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said he researches European music and pop culture trends
twice a year in emerging music scenes, such as Manchester, England,
rather than traditional fashion hubs like London.
</P>
<P>
   The wide variety of denim trends now reflects a new diversity in
musical styles from techno to ethnic influences, he said. For
spring 2000, Silver will experiment with East Indian tunics,
crocheted and mirrored looks and Japanese prints, along with
recycled used jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Like Silver, New York-based Zana-Di takes an individual
approach, avoiding anything that smacks of mass production that can
alienate kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're careful to have no two patches in the same place, no two
distressed areas in the same place,'' said Lars Klingstedt, head
designer. For spring, the line will add experimental trends taken
directly from the street, such as paint splatters, tie-dye washes
and ombre shading.
</P>
<P>
   Streetwear, once the domain of the urban scene in the U.S., is
becoming distinctly more global, with cities such as Tokyo, London
and Prague rising as trend centers in music and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is searching for new direction for the millennium,
and traveling more,'' said Alain Audet, sales and marketing manager
for Parasuco, a Montreal-based jeans line. ``A strong Asian
influence is coming from small Japanese designers and the
technological advances in Japanese mills. Dragon embroideries,
based on the year 2000, Japan's year of the dragon, will also be
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   With hip-hop becoming more mainstream, new ethnic musical
influences abound, trickling down to fashion. Latin music by hot
performers such as Ricky Martin is taking jeans in a sexier
direction, said Audet, who will add more fitted silhouettes and
sheer layering to the spring line.
</P>
<P>
   Along with distressed denim, Parasuco will experiment with
selvage on stretch denim, rubber logo treatments and asymmetrical
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than silhouettes, the biggest new trend frontier is in
treatments, washes and finishes, along with details such as
embellishment and mixed fabrics. Boot cuts and flares that broke
new ground a few years ago have become standard shapes for
designers to play with.
</P>
<P>
   And while capris and shorter lengths will carry over somewhat
into fall, they will serve to make longer silhouettes look fresh
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flares, cargos and bells are basics now,'' said Michelle
Clark, trends manager at the Lee Co. For 2000, Lee will focus on
``smart'' fabrics, with technical, functional or performance
textiles often influenced by activewear. Utility features, such as
attached bags, should add a new dimension to jeans, said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is aiming for a personalized look, with home-crafted, worn
effects and ``busted denim,'' with stress points influenced by the
wearer. While the interest is in distressed light denim now, dark
denim is still important for fall, said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Variety seems to be the only constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, denim floors were boring, and everything looked the
same,'' said Paris Blues' Lisa Engelman. ``Now everybody's
experimenting with washes and alternative fabrics, and there's
something for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The next trend flash for Paris Blues should be slimmer legs,
with fabrics and ruffles added below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Gucci-inspired jeans end up on the sale rack, they
have had a positive impact on retailers by making once-cautious
buyers more receptive to new trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer have to sell buyers on a trend,'' said Zana-Di's
Klingstedt. ``They used to be afraid of newness. Now they demand
it.'' &QL;

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I had lived in Portugal for 18 months a decade ago, my
short visit in March gave me an even closer view of the people and
the countryside because this time I traveled by bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, ranking with Greece as the least Westernized and most
affordable country in Western Europe, is a place many people say
they've considered visiting while in Europe but ``ran out of
time.'' In some ways, that's a pity, but fewer tourists is also
what helps Portugal, on the western edge of the Iberian peninsula,
retain its authenticity. When I was teaching English in Lisbon in
1988, I traveled enough to get a taste of the surprisingly varied
regions in this small country of about 10 million people. So when
returning this year, I wanted to revisit Lisbon but not spend too
much time there. It's a beautiful, historic city, but it's also
full of traffic, noise, and crowds.
</P>
<P>
   After researching cycling tours that traveled in Portugal (I
found only a few), the most appealing outfitter in both itinerary
and cost turned out to be based in the Boston area _ Easy Rider
Tours, operated by Newburyport residents Jim Goldberg and Nancy
Roeder. Three friends and I decided on ``Spring in the Alentejo,''
a weeklong trip in the Alto Alentejo, the northern part of the
south-central plains region that borders Spain, punctuated by
castles, cork and olive trees, and meadows dotted with wildflowers.
</P>
<P>
   I flew into Lisbon with my friend Erik, whom I'd met while
teaching in Lisbon, for a whirlwind visit of our old haunts. Before
even crossing the Atlantic, we had a taste of the country on our
Air Portugal flight _ hearing Portuguese (akin to Spanish but,
because of the nasalization and slurring consonants, more difficult
to pronounce), nibbling on local cheeses, and breathing in the
omnipresent cigarette smoke from the last few rows. And of course
now we were on Portuguese time, not only the literal five hours
later than East Coast time, but the unstructured sort typical of
southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   After a harrowing but cheap taxi ride into town, we checked into
the Hotel Metropole, a small, comfortable hotel right on the
Rossio, the city's main square. I was happy to have a room on the
back side, as it sounded as if the entire city was sitting on its
horn on the street side. Heading out to see the sights, we walked
down the Baixa (pronounced BI-sha), a gridded shopping district, to
the Ascensor de Santa Justa, an elevator housed in a Gothic
Eiffel-designed tower, and went up to the Bairro Alto section of
town, stopping at the cafe at the top for a ubiquitous ``tosta
mista'' (``mixed toast,'' a ham and cheese sandwich) and a view of
land and sea.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbon, a city of about 1 million, looked much as I had
remembered, only cleaner and more crowded. The sprucing up came
over the past few years, in preparation for the World Expo, which
Lisbon proudly hosted in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Later we headed up, up, up to the Alfama, the city's oldest
section, crowned by the restored Castelo Sao Jorge, used as a
fortress in Caesar's time and later as a Moorish stronghold. The
medieval quarter of Lisbon houses a motley mix of poor families and
wealthier expatriates. Erik and I reminisced in front of our former
home at 22 Largo do Salvador, a 16th-century aristocrat's mansion,
no longer regal, which we had shared with two other English
teachers. If you have only a day in Lisbon, the Alfama should be
your first stop. The winding cobblestone streets, laundry hanging
in courtyards, and beautiful tile-covered walls evoke old-country
flavor in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   We were thrilled to find that one of our favorite restaurants,
Mestre Andre, was still operating, though neither of us could
remember our way through the mazelike streets and had to ask for
directions. Luckily Erik's Portuguese had stayed with him much
better than mine had.
</P>
<P>
   The next day we met our fellow cyclists at the airport, happy to
be leaving the city for quieter destinations. Except for my three
friends in their 30s, the other 10 members of our group were over
50. We had three leaders instead of the usual two, as owner
Goldberg came along to train a guide new to this particular trip.
</P>
<P>
   With hybrid-style bikes (which Easy Rider will supply) and
luggage in tow, we took our omnipresent shuttle van to Evora, about
two hours east of Lisbon, and would start cycling the following
day. Evora, a walled medieval town, is one of the most beautiful
cities in Portugal. A masterpiece of Moorish architecture, it also
houses the Temple of Diana, a well-preserved Roman temple in the
heart of town, built between the second and third centuries. Nearby
is a 12th-century cathedral and the Chapel of Sao Loios, which has
a stunning interior of 18th-century blue ``azulejos'' (tiles). A
more macabre attraction is the Capela dos Ossos in the Gothic
Igreja De S. Francisco, constructed with the bones of thousands of
nuns and monks. A mosaic to mortality, every bit of wall space is
filled with bones, from femurs to eye sockets and skulls. Evora's
main square, Praca do Giraldo, is the perfect people-watching spot.
Tables and chairs fill the center, surrounded by cafes. Be patient
and you will eventually be waited on. Be patient again and you'll
eventually get the check.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at a lovely inn in the heart of the old section, Solar
de Monfalim, where colorful tiles and plants were plentiful. For
dinner our guides took us to Restaurant Luar de Janeiro for a most
decadent shared meal. Having lived in Portugal, I knew how
bountiful a restaurant meal could be, but several of the newcomers
had no idea that our first offerings were merely appetizers and
that a main course _ make that two main courses _ would follow. We
started with local olives, cheese, ham, pork rinds, mussels, and
even roe. Of course ``vinho tinto'' and ``branco'' (red and white
wine) accompanied the food. Next came a perfect paella and a pork
dish. Desserts included a gooey sweet yellow cake, fruit, and
creamy rice pudding. We couldn't wait to get on our bikes the next
day and burn off some of the thousands of calories we'd consumed.
Easy Rider includes most meals (they were all scrumptious) in the
price of the trip, but we did spend enough escudos to know that
Portugal is still a culinary bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Our first riding day began on flat, somewhat trafficked roads
initially, then we went deeper into the countryside. For the most
part, cars kept a safe distance, although they seemed to follow no
speed limit. The roads were lined with half-stripped cork trees,
all having the years they were harvested painted on their trunks so
farmers could keep track. Our route was 35 miles, with an option to
do more. Every ride had a range of mileage, and the van would pick
cyclists up if they were tired. Or, if you just wanted a rest day
(some were built into the tour), you could stay in the van, which
carried our gear as well. We rode at our own pace, following maps
and cue sheets. The first few days, the weather was warm and sunny,
then it turned cooler and rainy. As in New England, spring and fall
climates in Portugal can change radically.
</P>
<P>
   Along the route we saw the first of many storks and their huge,
high nests; pottery shops (we could keep purchases in the van); and
a small Celtic dolmen, a funerary temple. (Many dolmens, dating
from the third to fifth centuries, can be found in the Alentejo.)
Our destination was Monsaraz (mon-seh-RAHZ), a castle town and one
of my favorite places in Portugal.

   THE LOST CHILDREN OF ROCKDALE COUNTY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Produced by: Rachel Dretzin Goodman and Barak Goodman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The producers of the PBS documentary ``The Lost Children of
Rockdale County'' were already in Conyers, Ga., when a high school
shooting rampage there made national news last year. They had been
living in the upscale Atlanta suburb for months, exploring a teen
culture notable for its promiscuous sex, spasms of violence, and
copious use of alcohol and drugs. But what set Conyers apart from
other affluent, largely white suburban communities was a 1996
epidemic of syphilis among teens as young as 14. A public health
nurse suggests that some of the girls had 50 or more sexual
partners and that casual group sex among Conyers' youths was not
uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   The program, made for the ``Frontline'' series, shows us the
outsized homes of Conyers, the dismal commercial strip that passes
for the town center, and a cross-section of teens and their
parents. The grownups were largely ignorant of their kids' chronic
antisocial and sexually risky behavior. Most of the teens
chainsmoke while being interviewed, and many of their parents come
across as disturbingly passive and affectless. A visiting public
health physician speaks of a community of parents in ``total
denial.''
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute program, which begins on some PBS outlets Tuesday
night, is a curious affair, at once deeply provocative and
maddeningly tentative and superficial. ``What's wrong with our
children?,'' the program's narrator asks, before promoting a
probing account of ``lonely kids desperate to belong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the kids on camera, some of whom were in high school during
the publicized syphilis outbreak and another, younger cohort,
aren't especially revealing. They talk blandly about their risky
behavior but rarely in forthcoming detail or with any depth of
insight. One popular girl says that sex isn't pleasurable, just an
expected aspect of socializing. Better documentarians might have
managed to prompt her to elaborate on this rueful admission.
Another girl says the Conyers boys are ``mean'' and sexually
predatory, but the filmmakers fail to pursue this important social
theme. A bright boy who was once openly fond of mayhem, then
temporarily pacified by a local ministry, says that God ``failed''
him. He seems to be reaching for something more than a
rationalization of his return to delinquency, but isn't urged to
stretch for greater understanding.
</P>
<P>
   By more subtly, patiently drawing out their interview subjects,
the filmmakers would have been able to shed more light on Conyers'
disturbing problems and their tangled social roots and national
implications. ``The Lost Children of Rockdale County,'' which falls
short of the usually high standards of ``Frontline,'' frames a
subject of enormous social importance, but doesn't mine its depths.

IN ORSON WELLES' STEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESSAOUIRA, Morocco _ When the great actor and director Orson
Welles needed an atmospheric and visually dramatic place to film
his acclaimed version of ``Othello,'' he knew just where to point
his camera.
</P>
<P>
   Here.
</P>
<P>
   In Essaouira, with its cannon-lined ramparts, brooding
watchtowers, narrow cobblestoned streets, boat-filled harbor, and
sweeping ocean and shoreline views, Welles found a setting worthy
of Shakespeare and his own artistic vision. The old walled town has
changed little since Welles worked here four decades ago, and not
all that much in the last two centuries, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor today walks the same massive walls and climbs up to
the identical towers and bastions where the distraught Othello
(played by Welles in over-the-top form), suspecting his wife
Desdemona to be unfaithful, roamed and ranted in jealous rage.
These days most Essaouira roamers are low-key tourist couples,
often hand-holding honeymooners attracted by Essaouira's
magnificent 6-mile-long crescent beach and romantic reputation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to have a drink in sidewalk cafes and enjoy
seafood meals at harborside restaurants that, over the several
years it took to make the film, were enthusiastically patronized by
Welles: a man whose appetite and girth were as awesome as his
talents. Essaouira fondly remembers Welles _ along with the
international attention and celebrity influx his ``Othello''
brought the town _ and has even named a square after him.
</P>
<P>
   Different in appearance and ambience from any other town in
Morocco, Essaouira is very much its own place. Strategically
located halfway down Morocco's Atlantic coast, it was founded by
the Portuguese at the end of the 14th century as a trading port
called Mogador.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese were eventually driven out and in 1765 the then
sultan of Morocco, Sidi Mohammed bin Abdallah, hired a French
architect to design a fortified port on the site. The Western-style
town, renamed Essaouira, was meant to both protect and contain the
foreign traders who were Morocco's commercial link with the outside
world but also as a potential bridgehead for European invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why although Essaouira is only a few hours' drive
from Marrakech, probably the most Moroccan of cities, it has a
relaxed, cosmopolitan, and almost southern European feel. Instead
of the labyrinthine street plan common to most Moroccan towns, here
the streets run straight as arrows and meet at precise right
angles. And along with the expected large mosque there is also an
active Christian church where, since Essaouira is an international
resort, services are held alternately in French, English, Dutch,
and German.
</P>
<P>
   Until about 20 years ago a majority of the town's population
were Jews, but most of Morocco's Jewish community has emigrated to
Israel or France in recent years. Essaouira still has a small
so-called ``mellah,'' or Jewish quarter, but many of the houses and
shops in it have been abandoned, the synagogues closed, and it now
has a rather forlorn air.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the intimidating fortifications surrounding it,
Essaouira itself is a light-filled and welcoming place. Virtually
all the buildings within the old town are painted white and blue,
the cheerful local signature color scheme, and there are sun-filled
and cafe-lined small squares that invite lingering.
</P>
<P>
   As everywhere in Morocco, shopping streets and markets in
Essaouira are lively places, but they are nowhere near as frenetic
or confusing as, say, the large and maze-like souks of Marrakech or
Fez. Also happily absent are the aggressively friendly would-be
guides and the persistent souvenir salesmen who so often bedevil
tourists in Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   Essaouira is one of the crafts centers of Morocco and noted for
its jewelry and woodworking, particularly exquisite inlaid work, or
marquetry, from the fragrant local thuya wood. Many woodworking
shops _ aromatic places perfumed with thuya dust _ are located in
the old gunpowder magazines beneath the Skala de la Ville, the main
bastion that faces the sea and is lined with a baker's dozen of
18th- and 19th-century cannons.
</P>
<P>
   The artisans work from early morning to well into the evening
and usually welcome visitors. Customers are advised not to waste
time trying to haggle: The thuya craftsmen know the value of their
work, and prices, already low by American standards, are usually
non-negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   To many people, Moroccan cuisine is lamb couscous and not much
else except possibly chicken couscous. In Essaouira, however,
eating out mostly means seafood _ the best and freshest in Morocco,
it is claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The seafood places are all clustered around the harbor, very
much a working fishing port, and share space on the quays with
small shipyards where wooden boats are still made by hand to a
design Sinbad the Sailor would have recognized. Dining options
range from simple stalls, where fresh caught fish is cooked in
front of you on charcoal grills and eaten al fresco at wharfside
picnic tables, to full-service sit-down restaurants such as Le
Coquillage and Chez Sam.
</P>
<P>
   A local institution (Essaouira's equivalent of Boston's Jimmy's
Harborside), Chez Sam is famous all over Morocco. For about $15 a
head Sam, an imposing white-haired man in skullcap and flowing
djelaba, serves an enormous set meal that could satiate an Orson
Welles. A tableful of plates of delicious Moroccan hors d'oeuvres
is followed by grilled lobster tail, fish soup, octopus salad,
baked sea bass, and on and on to an almond-covered pastry and
high-octane espresso for dessert. And while consuming the fruits of
the sea, diners can watch the fish being unloaded from boats
anchored just outside the restaurant's windows.
</P>
<P>
   Essaouira has a wide range of places to stay, from campgrounds
and hostels to beachside resort hotels. In a class by themselves,
however, are the Hotel Villa Maroc and the Hotel Riad al Medina.
Within the walls of the old town, both are beautifully restored
mansions and charmingly and unfussily elegant. Double rooms at the
Villa Maroc, which occupies two adjoining 18th-century houses,
start at $60. Rates at the Riad al Medina, a former pasha's villa,
begin at $50.

<P>
   It's that time of year when people seem to go out of their way
to be scared out of their wits. Fortunately for New Englanders, you
don't have to go very far _ just to Salem, Mass., north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Salem, best known as the Witch City because of the infamous
witch trials of 1692, will again have lots of ``Haunted
Happenings'' between now and Oct. 31. There will be haunted houses,

will be open as will the House of Seven Gables, made famous in the
novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and more. For a complete schedule,
call the Salem Tourism Office at 800-777-6848.
</P>

   While there, take in the Eerie Events planned by the Peabody
Essex Museum Oct. 22-23 and 29-31. Inside a mansion with a walkway
lined with glowing jack-o-lanterns, visitors will hear frightening
tales inspired by masters of Gothic fiction. In addition to the
tales, there will be horror films shown in the Phillips Library, a
Haunted Ballroom, where you can step to a bizarre beat, and a free
exhibition of the original witch trial papers. Hot and cold cider
and other goodies will be available. Tickets for the event, held 6

   It's called the Super Bowl of barbecue competitions, and this
year it will be on Oct. 23 in Lynchburg, Tenn., a town known for
its whiskey. Lynchburg is home to the Jack Daniel Distillery,
America's oldest registered distillery. The distillery is in a
``dry'' area, so you can tour, but you can't buy a bottle of the
whiskey, except for a specially designed commemorative decanter,
allowed by a special act of the Tennessee Legislature in 1994.
While the competition is in the South, the barbecue is
international in flavor. Teams from around the country, as well as
Europe, Japan, and Canada will be competing. There also will be
games, music, and homemade Southern delectables, including fried
pies and roasted corn on the cob, for sale. For information on the
11th annual Jack Daniel's World Championship Invitational Barbecue,
call 615-340-1035.

NOUVEAU BOORS PUT ON AIRS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the economic good times roll on and on, never before have so
many been able to employ so many others as servants. But a boom
market in domestic help is coinciding with a boom in boorish and
disrespectful behavior toward domestics.
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Times &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dahling, you simply must keep up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed from the days of those old fogy families of
wealth. The Rockefellers, the Carnegies, the Gettys _ what in the
world do they know about servants? It is we _ the Internet gold
miners, the bull market broncos, the newly rich _ who understand
the true meaning of privilege. Handmaids, manservants, footmen,
butlers _ how terribly quaint! How terribly passe!
</P>
<P>
   Who in her right mind in today's world would stoop so low as to
treat a servant with courtesy? I mean, really! What a load of
old-fashioned rubbish. These ... people ... are our dogs. We must
train them, keep strict watch over them, teach them to heel, and to
heed our commands. If it means shouting at them in front of the
guests, so be it. We all know they don't listen _ they can hardly
remember to serve left, clear right. They're just lucky to have a
job at all!
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it's just not possible to get along with the familiar
barnyard of hired help. Housekeepers, laundresses, cooks, nannies,
drivers _ sure, they're all here grunting away over their assigned
tasks. But I need more. More, I tell you. And more. Why in the
world should a woman in my position lift a finger, except of course
for my manicurist?
</P>
<P>
   I see no reason why a woman in my position should have to put
herself out during her day in order to push buttons. My God, you
can't turn around without some silly button needing to be pushed.
It starts first thing in the morning with the snooze alarm. Then
there's the light switch, the coffee maker, the hair dryer _ it
goes on and on. And let's not forget doorbells and elevators. A
woman can get worn to the bone by all the push-buttons in her life.
And the damage to my nails _ my God! I now have a hired hand I call
Stinky Pinky to smooth my way through the push-button jungle.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why some people say I'm blind. It's just I don't
know why a woman in my position should have to use her own eyes.
I've got myself a seeing-eye domestic who, it turns out, has no
peripheral vision. You wouldn't want to hear me when I lay into
her.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one member of the house staff I should go easy on, I
guess it's my hired lungs. A while ago I decided there was no
reason in the world why a woman in my position should do her own
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   I do give my hired lungs a hard time but why shouldn't I?
Sometimes I find myself inexplicably short of breath. I get the
feeling the rotten simp is holding back on purpose. I mean, who
does she think she is?! I'm paying the miserable huffer's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Hey! What the ... ?! You ... little ... (gasp). Breathe! I order
. . . you! (Gasp.) What?! You quit?! You can't (gasp) quit. I . . .
(choke). I . . . (choke). I order _ (dry rattle). Help . . . Arghhh
. . .

FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready for a bumpy ride.
</P>
<P>
   The fragile stock market, still fazed from the beating it took
last week, could be pushed into jagged moves higher or lower still
by a series of economic and corporate reports scheduled for the
days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Together they will have a strong impact on the stock market's
two leading preoccupations, interest rates and profits. The results
could be a muddy combination of good and bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Front and center: the government consumer price index report due
out this morning. New monthly data showing inflation in excess of
the consensus figure of 0.3 percent would all but cement the
market's expection of an interest rate boost by the Federal Reserve
next month and increase worries about the magnitude of the hike.
</P>
<P>
   But a string of corporate earnings reports due out in the next
week or two are expected to be very strong. Two to watch: Microsoft
Corp. because of its sheer size and importance to both the economy
and the market, and United Technologies Corp., seen by some as a
good indicator for industrial America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think when the dust settles, this (quarter) is going to
look like a period of very good earnings power,'' said Kevin Parke,
chief equity officer at MFS Investment Management in Boston. ``That
ultimately matters a lot more than whether the CPI is 0.2 or 0.3
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnings from companies that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
are expected to be 22 percent higher in the third quarter,
according to First Call Corp. in Boston. Analysts attribute the big
increase to strong consumer spending, improving overseas economies
and weak comparable figures from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call, believes
investors could view strong profits two ways. They could see big
improvements and a historically above-average forecast for next
year and be pleased. Or they can see earnings increases at their
most powerful point and conclude that this is the time to take
money off the table.
</P>
<P>
   But more often than not, big profit gains propel stocks higher.
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than Monday's stock market for an indication of
how the lure of strong profits and the fear of higher interest
rates can pull prices in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were under pressure early in the day, based mostly on
worries over Tuesday's consumer inflation report. High-priced tech
stocks and small-company issues were particularly hard hit, driving
the Nasdaq Composite index down by more than 3 percent in
midsession.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dow Jones industrial average was performing much better,
in positive territory for much of the day. Big banks J.P. Morgan
and Citigroup Inc. came through with strong third-quarter earnings,
as did Ford Motor Co. Others mostly followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, the Nasdaq index had cut its losses by
half, shedding 42.68 to 2689.15. Still, the Nasdaq has been trimmed
by a whopping 7.8 percent off its closing record set a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished up 96.57 to 10116.28, enjoying its best gain in
seven sessions. But the bellwether index is still more than 500
points below its level of a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rate fears were particularly strong in the wake of last
Friday's wholesale inflation report, which showed the largest
increase since the Persian Gulf War period of September 1990. The
producer price index was boosted partly by special circumstances
but still reflected more modest increases in a broad range of
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation fears don't just drive down the prices of stocks, they
do damage in the bond market as well. Bond yields increase in the
face of inflation, driving prices in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Rates on the 30-year US Treasury bond, just under 5 percent a
year ago, have been moving higher all year. They rose to 6.321
percent Monday, but not quite as high as a peak set last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bond market will call the tune in the short run,''
said Walter S. Frank, chief investment officer at IBC Financial
Data. ``I think we're very close to the highs on yields at 6.3
percent. It's built in a great deal of what could happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What could happen is that the Federal Reserve could raise rates
for a third time since June when regulators meet Nov. 16. But some
worry about another period of market limbo if Tuesday's consumer
inflation report doesn't validate the assumptions investors have
already made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market has already priced in a November move and this
will all but confirm that,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at
Fleet Boston Corp. ``But if it's a ho-hum number, we're back in
that world of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Events like the government's monthly inflation reports have more
short-term impact than ever on stock and bond markets, driven
partly by the quicker reactions of professional money managers
investing huge sums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portfolio manager's time frame is shortening and
shortening,'' said John Snyder, manager of the John Hancock
Soverign Investors fund. ``Now we're down to monthly or weekly
numbers. The volatility is just staggering.''

BOSTON VS. NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What with recent events, will the conventional wisdom of Boston
vs. New York have to be rethought? It's not just the rough behavior
of a few Red Sox fans. BankBoston and other fundamental local
institutions recently have seen their top-most management shift to
far-off cities.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much of its vaunted civic leadership and virtue does
the Hub retain?
</P>
<P>
   The standard version of Boston vs. New York goes something like
this. At the very beginning of the industrial revolution, Boston
and New York were neck-and-neck in population, political power, and
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Associates, a loose partnership of old-line merchant
families, were determined to avoid the fate of England, where the
factory system led to bitter divisions in the social order. So
starting around 1800 they instituted a very different system in the
textile mills they built, hiring young women from New England
farms, thereby keeping wages low and delaying the rise of a
permanent class of working men.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, New York City eagerly participated in the building
of the Erie Canal, opening a vast interior market to the sea. A
pell-mell rush of commercial development followed, complete with
races to build the most ostentatious department store, the most
striking skyscraper. Competition, not civic commitment, was the
rule. Boston's textile companies moved their headquarters to New
York City starting in the 1850s.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent New Yorkers such as John D. Rockefeller modeled their
philanthropic activities on the Boston Associates but were
powerless to deflect the trend. The most prosperous families moved
their residences farther and farther up the island of Manhattan to
escape the bustle.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost out in the competition for economic influence,
Boston sought to reinvent itself as a cultural capital. Bankers and
industrialists adopted the creed that commerce should go hand in
hand with public good works. The most prominent families remained
in the city in Beacon Hill and the Back Bay and protected the
Common and the Public Garden from commercial encroachment. They
kept their factories out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the jewel box of a city as Boston exists today,
with its deliberate mix of residential neighborhoods, commercial
districts, and public space; its short lines of communication; its
pleasing sightlines; its nearby suburbs and outlying high-tech
districts, as opposed to the unplanned 3-D concrete sprawl that is
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is set out concisely in ``Invented Cities: The
Creation of Landscape in Nineteenth Century New York and Boston,''
by Mona Domosh, a fascinating little book published in 1996 by Yale
University Press. Boston's upper classes successfully preserved
their civilized city thanks to the degree of control over the
enterprises they maintained, Domosh writes, while New York's
explosive growth never allowed one powerful class to achieve
control. Conspicuous consumption trumped good taste and good sense.
</P>
<P>
   Civic commitment remains strong in Boston, even though
leadership long ago passed from families named Lawrence, Lowell,
Cabot, and Appleton. It was Ned Johnson, for example, who began the
downtown renaissance when he bought Fidelity's building on
Devonshire Street. Norman Leventhal personifies the real estate
industry, instead of Donald Trump. Senator Edward M. Kennedy keeps
watch over the city's great hospitals. Neil Rudenstine, Charles
Vest, John Silber, and J. Donald Monan preside with competitive
zest over top universities.
</P>
<P>
   And it is Mayor Thomas M. Menino who is negotiating with New
York developers on the height of a skyscraper over the
Massachusetts Turnpike; with the Red Sox over the future of Fenway
Park; with Harvard University over its expansion plans. On such
decisions does the city's future livability depend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani is still trying to move
a baseball park back into Manhattan from the Bronx. Columbia
University, repeatedly uprooted over the years to make way for
commercial businesses, is expanding into the suburbs. And Harlem,
though it is experiencing a considerable renaissance, still has a
long way to go to reclaim its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to keep a city intact than to put it back together.
There is no more telling symbol of Boston's competitive advantage
vis-a-vis New York than the scale and coherence of its landscape.

LAWSUITS CHALLENGE `ROUTINE' TRAFFIC STOPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By KIM COBB 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosano Gerald vividly recalled that summer afternoon in Oklahoma
_ the drive across the state line, two highway stops by state
troopers, and an aggressive search of his car that left his
frightened son in tears. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Gerald was convinced that he had been pulled over and targeted
for the humiliating search in August 1998 solely because, as a
black man, he fit a departmental racial profile for potential drug
couriers.
</P>
<P>
   When the decorated Army sergeant recently sued the Oklahoma
Department of Public Safety for the fruitless search, he joined a
growing number of litigants across the country challenging the use
of ``routine'' traffic stops as a pretext to look for evidence of a
larger crime.
</P>
<P>
   Police frequently point to an arrest on another stretch of
Oklahoma highway as a dramatic example of how well the practice can
work. If a state trooper had not noticed Timothy McVeigh's missing
license plate as he sped north out of Oklahoma City on that chilly,
spring day in 1995, the bomber might have vanished after the worst
act of terrorism on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   But civil libertarians counter that minorities such as Gerald,
rather than whites such as McVeigh, are the most likely targets for
traffic stops. What police defend as a valuable crime fighting tool
cannot be maintained at the expense of an important civil liberty,
they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits similar to Gerald's are pending in California, Indiana,
Maryland and New Jersey. Bills requiring police departments to keep
detailed records of traffic stops, including the ethnicity of those
pulled over, have been filed in both houses of Congress, and the
issue is tentatively scheduled for hearings before a Senate
subcommittee this month. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; California Gov. Gray Davis set off a firestorm last month when
he vetoed a bill that would have issued a similar mandate for every
police agency in his state, requiring police to compile statistics
on the race and ethnicity of people selected for traffic stops. He
said he finds racial profiling ``abhorrent'', but does not believe
the state government should mandate more work for local
jurisdictions to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   Gray did order the California Highway Patrol to begin keeping
such data and asked for voluntary compliance from local police
departments. Cities such as San Diego and San Francisco are already
preparing systems to keep racial data on traffic stops. But critics
say the departments that most need to be monitored _ Los Angeles,
for example _ are unlikely to meet a request for voluntary
compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an issue that's gone away (and) it's not just
identified with Rodney King,'' argues Elaine Elinson of the
Northern California American Civil Liberties Union. ``It's an issue
that happens to people daily, on the freeways, and around town.''
</P>
<P>
   Since there is no national system in place to measure the
frequency that minorities are subjected to traffic stops, the
charges of racial bias are based on individual, though widespread,
complaints. The ACLU has helped set up hot lines to allow people
who believe they have been targeted because of their race to report
their traffic stops, and some of the calls have led to lawsuits. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; There are smaller snapshots available, however. The Orlando
Sentinel studied a drug interdiction program along a busy stretch
of I-95 in Florida, where some of the deputies' cars involved in
related traffic stops were equipped with video cameras. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The newspaper obtained videotapes from almost 1,100 stops,
showing that about 70 percent of the drivers who were pulled over
were black on a stretch of highway on which 5 percent of the
drivers were African-American. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think there is an emerging public consensus that that kind
of use of race is wrong,'' said UCLA law professor David Sklansky,
an expert in criminal procedure. When allegations of racial
profiling surface, Sklansky said, few police officials argue that
race should be used as a measure of suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman fired state
police superintendent Carl Williams last spring after he said he
did not condone racial profiling, but believed minorities were
responsible for most of the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   However, the question of race is firmly imbedded in the larger
question of all traffic stops arranged as a &UR;  &LR; ruse to investigate
possible criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say a disproportionate number of minorities will
continue to be subject to traffic stops, the so-called offense of
``driving while black or brown,'' as long as police agencies are
allowed carte blanche in pulling over and searching vehicles on the
pretext of some minor traffic or vehicular infraction.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Chiefs of Police, representing
a large consortium of police administrators, decries the practice
of racial profiling, but supports the continued use of so-called
``pretextual'' traffic stops. They oppose an unfunded national
mandate forcing local police departments to collect ethnic data,
but do recommend federal funding to support state and local
databases that could feed a national system.
</P>
<P>
   More guns are taken off the streets through traffic stops than
any other tactic, argues the chiefs' association. The Drug
Enforcement Agency estimates 40 percent of all drug arrests are the
outgrowth of traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the ACLU issued in June charged that the ``war on
drugs'' of the past two decades has unfairly legitimized the notion
that minorities are more likely to violate drug laws. A 1986 Drug
Enforcement Agency program called ``Operation Pipeline'' has helped
institutionalize racial profiling, the report charges, by training
about 27,000 police officers across the nation to use
``pretextual'' traffic stops as a means to thwart drug trafficking
on the nation's highways.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, the Supreme Court ruled in Whren vs. U.S. that
any traffic offense committed by a driver was a legitimate basis
for a stop, even if the officer's real motivation was to fish for
evidence of criminal activity. &UR;  &LR; The court unanimously said that it
would not presume to interpret an officer's motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court in the Whren case said you can do whatever
you damn well please,'' complained Seattle attorney Jeff Steinborn,
who frequently represents the National Association of Criminal
Defense Lawyers on constitutional search and seizure issues. Since
1996 there's been an astronomical increase in ``pretextual''
traffic stops, he said, adding, ``You know how it's used. It's used
racially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course if you run a dragnet through society, you're going
to catch criminals,'' Steinborn said. ``But this is America, folks.
That's why you had a revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinborn's home state of Washington this summer became the
first in the nation to outlaw ``pretextual'' stops. The Washington
Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the state constitution contained
``substantially greater'' protections than the Fourth Amendment
prohibitions against illegal search and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   But in a dissenting opinion, Washington Justice Barbara Madsen
reiterated the same point underpinning the U.S. Supreme Court's
decision in Whren _ that the court has no business peering into the
mind of an officer to judge his motivations for pulling someone
over. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Seattle Police Chief Norm Stamper railed against the decision
on the opinion page of the Post-Intelligencer newspaper saying that
an officer's ``sixth sense'' has been responsible for some of the
best arrests in the history of policing.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Washington case turned on a state constitutional
issue, it has no applications for any other state and cannot be
appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Legal experts say that since
the U.S. Supreme Court rejected in Whren the argument that
pretextual traffic stops violate the Fourth Amendment, it will
probably take a lawsuit seeking protection for minority drivers
under the Fourteen Amendment's equal protection clause to get the
issue back before the high court. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Anecdotes about criminals such as McVeigh and Ted Bundy caught
at traffic stops are common police lore. ``So lots of police
departments, for years, have been telling their officers when you
stop a car, don't just view this as a traffic stop _ view it as an
opportunity,'' explained Sklansky, the UCLA law professor.
</P>
<P>
   The primary author of the ACLU report on traffic stops told the
Congressional Black Caucus last fall that the ``bland rhetoric'' of
the Whren decision hides a disturbing reality for every American,
but particularly for members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all drivers violate some provision of the vehicle
code at some time during a short drive,'' said author David Harris,
a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law. ``No driver
is perfect; a violation, even a technical one, cannot be avoided.
This means that all drivers are subject to being pulled over almost
any time, as long as police are willing to follow them for a short
distance.''

STEAK SAUCE WITH BITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best-known steak and cheese combination in this country may
be the Philadelphia cheese steak, but the French know there is a
more elegant way to combine these two foods: top a steak with a
simple blue cheese sauce. It is the kind of dish I crave from time
to time _ a good steak served with something powerfully salty and
rich; anchovy butter or a combination of butter, soy sauce and
ginger also do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   A classic blue cheese sauce is essentially cheese melted in milk
or cream, or stirred into a milk-based white sauce. To use such a
sauce on pasta you need the added fat of milk or cream, but when I
tried these combinations with steak, they were near disasters _
richness on top of richness, with no contrasting sharpness. It was
clear that the cheese alone provided enough fat, and that the other
ingredients in the sauce should provide lots of bite. This led me
to combine shallots and vinegar, and to augment the sauce with a
little cayenne. The result is a wonderfully mouth-watering
combination.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite blue cheese for this sauce is Roquefort, but
Stilton, Gorgonzola, Maytag blue or any high-quality, fairly soft
blue cheese will work equally well. Don't try to make this sauce
with commercially produced domestic blue cheeses like those sold
precrumbled for salads. Its taste will be inferior and it will not
provide enough creaminess.
</P>
<P>
   As for the steak, the usually too-lean and mildly flavored
tenderloin (filet mignon) will do fine. Its tenderness will be
welcome, and the sauce will more than compensate for its blandness.
A good strip steak or rib-eye would be chewier and more flavorful,
but also fattier. The choice is yours.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED STEAK WITH ROQUEFORT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon butter or neutral oil, like canola
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white wine or cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces crumbled Roquefort or other blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of cayenne
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1{ to 2 pounds strip or rib-eye steaks, or filet mignon
</P>
<P>
   Minced fresh parsley or chives for garnish, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Start a charcoal or wood fire or preheat a gas grill or
broiler; the fire should be quite hot, and grill rack no more than
4 inches from heat source.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place butter in a small saucepan over medium heat; when
butter melts and its foam begins to subside, add shallots and cook
until soft, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Add vinegar,
stir, and cook until it is just about evaporated, 1 or 2 minutes.
Turn heat to low and stir in cheese, cayenne and a few grindings of
pepper. Stir occasionally until cheese melts, then taste and adjust
seasoning. Keep warm while you grill steaks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Season steaks well with salt and pepper, then grill or broil
about 3 to 4 minutes a side for medium-rare, longer or shorter
according to your taste. Serve steaks with 1 or 2 spoonfuls of
sauce over each, garnished with parsley or chives if you like.

<P>
   Quisp cereal. Necco wafers. Fizzies. Just the names of the
edibles of childhood exert a powerful pull on adults, as consumers
move on to new towns and manufacturers to new products.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently many of these lost foods have been available
only in memory or where they originated. Now, Americans are going
to ever-greater lengths to obtain them, and a whole industry has
sprung up to help.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites, mail-order suppliers and even big food producers are
the new private detectives on the trail of nostalgia with flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Chapin created Hometown Favorites
(www.hometownfavorites.com; 888-694-2656) after she moved from
Wisconsin to West Palm Beach, Fla., and searched in vain for Candy
Raisins, which she describes as ``a harder Gummi Bear kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is a state of transient people,'' she said. ``Everyone
is from somewhere else, and in talking with people I found that
everybody missed something.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chapin began Hometown Favorites in 1996 with 100 or so
items; the list has grown to about 400. Some, like Moxie soda, are
cult fare. Some, like Jiffy Pop Stovetop Popcorn, are familiar to
New Yorkers but unavailable to, say, Floridians, who must make do
with the microwave variety.
</P>
<P>
   And some, like the pickled vegetables of Minnesota's Lehmann
Farms, or the raspberry-based products of Robert Rothschild of
Ohio, are local specialties with fans from all over.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in 1997 Paul Hooper, of Tampa, Fla., started
www.homesickgourmet.com (813-985-3301), a Web site with dozens of
links to other sites on regional foods, after noticing that people
who had left their home state and had become more affluent were
seeking the foods they grew up with.
</P>
<P>
   On Ms. Chapin's Web site, the ``Boy They Were Good, but ...''
section lists more than 100 discontinued foods that even Ms. Chapin
can't get anymore, from Freakies cereal to Bonomo Turkish Taffy to
Silver Cup Bread.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for any number of these once-mass-market foods is growing
because many supermarkets no longer stock them, in an age of 40
spaghetti sauces on one short shelf, or because independent outfits
have given way to mega-chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole trend of the stores is changing,'' said Marcia
Bennett, a sales and marketing assistant for Redco Foods in
Windsor, Conn., which makes Junket, the archetypal ``Whatever
happened to?'' dessert, a molded cross between custard and gelatin.
``You don't have the little guy down the street watching out for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Sheli Tucker, of Baldwin, N.Y., sought out Hometown
Favorites to satisfy a craving for the Halloween candy she used to
get as a girl _ Black Taffy and B-B Batts.
</P>
<P>
   In her pursuit of elusive provender like Stegner's Mock Turtle
Soup and Roman Meal Cream of Rye, Ms. Chapin is tireless. ``It
might take 10 or 15 phone calls for me to track down a particular
item,'' she said, adding that her markup is about 40 percent. ``A
lot of time I have to get past these 20-year-old phone operators
who only know what's in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hometown Favorites handles products from around the country, but
other outfits cater to regional expatriates. A Taste of
Philadelphia (www.tasteofphiladelphia.com; 800-846-2443) provides
care packages of not only hoagies and cheese steaks, but also local
brands like Bookbinder's Soup and Habbersett Scrapple. ``Customers
are desperate,'' said the company's president, Richard Della Barba.
``Business has tripled since we hit the Internet,'' in 1997, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Tastykake, the Philadelphia-area line of
Hostess-style baked goods. ``Someone took it upon themselves to
call Philadelphia International Airport and do a report on the
X-ray machines,'' said Kathy Grim, the director of corporate and
community relations for the manufacturer. ``They asked, `What do
people take with them most?' And the answer was Tastykake.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Foods of New York (www.nyhotdog.com; 800-468-3646), founded by
All County Provisions 18 months ago and based in Medford, N.Y.,
carries authentic pushcart fare, like pretzels and Gabila's potato
knishes.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer to do your own food hunting, be warned that food
companies generally will not sell except in bulk. And many of the
companies frequently have neither the inclination nor the ability
to identify nearby stores that might carry a particular item.
</P>
<P>
   Redco Foods handles other products that have limited market
penetration, notably Salada Tea, but two-thirds of its inquiries
are about Junket. It has set up a Junket mail-order service (the
minimum order is six packets), but it would really prefer to direct
consumers to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, brand-name junkies are rewarded when companies
extend their retail reach. Last year, Drake's, whose baked goods
had been largely unknown outside the New York area, was acquired by
Interstate Brands of Kansas City, Mo.; now its Yodels and Devil
Dogs are distributed nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, a ground swell of popular demand can revive a
cult food. Fizzies, those Cold War-era tablets that produce a
fruit-flavored carbonated beverage when dropped in water, were
withdrawn during the cyclamates scare of a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Wojciechowski, a devoted Fizzies fan from Pacific
Palisades, Calif., bought the trademark from Warner-Lambert in
1995, using Nutrasweet as a substitute, and is selling the new
Fizzies on line through www.fizzies.com or from (310) 230-2300.
</P>
<P>
   Better known was the case of Nabisco's Crown Pilot Cracker, a
staple for 200 years along the northern New England coast. Nabisco
eliminated them in 1996. ``Three hundred products were
discontinued,'' said John Barrows, the senior manager for marketing
communications, ``and 299 of them passed quietly into the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so Crown Pilots. Thanks largely to the voluble efforts of
Donna Miller Damon of Chebeague Island, Maine., Nabisco's decision
was recast as a Goliath-stomping-on-David morality play. After
considerable protest, Nabisco announced that Crown Pilots would be
taken off the endangered-species list and that orders of at least
six boxes would be available from (800) 622-4726.
</P>
<P>
   Other foods are the culinary equivalents of Amelia Earhart or
Jimmy Hoffa, missing and presumed dead. Welch's once lent its name
to a candy called Rum Frappe. ``It's no longer made, I'm sure,''
Ms. Chapin said, ``but no one can put it to bed for sure. It
remains on my things-to-find list.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, there is always the do-it-yourself approach.
Todd Wilbur, who felt deprived when he came to the East Coast from
California in 1990, compiled ``Top Secret Recipes: Creating Kitchen
Clones of America's Favorite Brand-Name Foods'' (Plume, 1993).
Besides recipes for fast-food staples like the Dairy Queen
Blizzard, the book offers facsimiles of Aunt Jemima Maple Syrup,
Cracker Jack and Yoo-Hoo.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web site (www.topsecretrecipes.com), home cooks trade
their versions of brand-name recipes. ``If you can't get it
yourself,'' he said, ``make it yourself.''

ALMOND BRIOCHE TOAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the sixth of eight columns by Amy Scherber of Amy's Bread
in Manhattan. These columns are being written with Dorie
Greenspan.)  
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almond toast is a traditional French teatime snack with an
American-style rags-to-riches history. Created by French bakers to
use up day-old brioche, this easy sweet is simply sliced stale
bread spread with a rich almond-butter ``cream'' and baked until
the topping is golden and the bread toasted.
</P>
<P>
   But what started as a make-do sweet became a beloved staple at
many bakeries in France, as well as at mine in New York. In fact,
to keep a steady supply of almond toast on the shelves, we bake
surplus loaves of brioche and set them aside for a day to dry out.
At home, you can use any kind of egg bread, like hallah, or a
top-quality white bread or even split croissants.
</P>
<P>
   For the light, characteristically fluffy almond topping, you
need only butter, eggs, ground almonds and sugar. The topping will
be fluffiest if you start with room-temperature butter and eggs;
they beat to their fullest volume when they are not chilled. And
you will get the tastiest topping using almonds with the skins on;
the skins add deep flavor and a toasty color. You can buy almonds
already ground or grind them easily in a food processor or blender.
(A little confectioners' sugar keeps them from turning to an oily
paste instead of a powder.)
</P>
<P>
   Since fluffiness is most important, the topping has to be made
with an electric mixer fitted with a whip or beaters. This is
really the only way to get it sufficiently aerated, and it's the
air that helps the baked topping form its fine crust.
</P>
<P>
   Some bakers soak the bread in a sugar syrup flavored with kirsch
before they cover it with the almond mixture, but I don't. I think
the syrup is too sweet and masks some of the toast's flavor and
much of its fragrance. I just spread the topping over the dry
bread, lay the slices on a cookie sheet, sprinkle them with sliced
almonds and bake them until the bread is lightly toasted and the
topping is puffed and golden. To support the topping, the bread
should be cut three-quarters of an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   The minute the slices are baked, they have to be transferred to
a rack to cool, to keep their toasted crunch. It's also important
to let them cool completely. It is an exercise in willpower, but
the toast, whether you eat it out of hand or with fork and knife,
tastes much better when it is cool.
</P>
<P>
   ALMOND BRIOCHE TOAST
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   { cup whole unsalted almonds, skins on and toasted
</P>
<P>
   \ cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   { cup (1 stick) butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   { cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, slightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   8 slices day-old pan-loaf brioche, sliced } inch thick, or
hallah slices or day-old croissants, sliced as if for sandwiches
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons sliced almonds.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a blender or the bowl of a food processor fitted with a
metal blade, combine whole almonds and confectioners' sugar.
Process just until nuts are powdery; do not make a paste. Set
aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In bowl of a mixer fitted with a whip or beaters, combine
butter and granulated sugar. Beat until light and fluffy. Add
powdered almonds and mix just to blend. Add eggs, and beat just
until mixture is fluffy. (Overmixing will break down the almond
cream.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Position oven racks to divide oven into thirds, and preheat
oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment.
</P>
<P>
   4. Place about 3 tablespoons of almond cream in center of each
slice of bread. Spread it almost to, but not touching, the edges.
Sprinkle each with 1 tablespoon sliced almonds.
</P>
<P>
   5. Divide slices between baking sheets, and bake 5 minutes.
Rotate pans top to bottom and front to back, and continue baking
until topping begins to brown and crust is golden, about 6 minutes
more. (If using croissants, remove top halves, spread filling and
almonds on bottoms, bake partly without tops, and replace tops for
last 4 minutes of baking.) Transfer toast to a cooling rack
immediately. Cool before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 slices.

A GLORIOUS RESTAURANT-STYLE BRUNCH WITH JENNIFER NAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
 3 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Make a special occasion weekend brunch at home
with restaurant-inspired recipes, shared by executive chef Jennifer
Naylor of Granita in Malibu. With these creations, you don't have
to spend a bundle to go out _ you can prepare a fabulous meal at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Naylor demonstrated three different brunch entrees _ all from
the restaurant's weekend brunch menu _ at a cooking class at the
restaurant. Also included is a beautiful coffeecake ideal for the
festivities, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although the recipes may seem a bit complex, Naylor has broken
them down into component parts for the ease and convenience of home
cooks. ``Read through the recipe before making it,'' advised
Naylor. ``And get all the ingredients ready before you start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lemon Cream Cheese Blintzes With Mixed Berry Compote
involves making crepes, a cream cheese filling and a mixed berry
compote. None of the steps is particularly difficult. If you want
to speed preparation time, pick up a package of prepared crepes in
the supermarket produce section. They're made by Frieda's and come
10 crepes per package with a suggested retail of $3.99 (look for
them at supermarkets).
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to make their own crepes: Strain the batter
after mixing to remove any extraneous pieces of flour or egg. Also
use clarified butter when cooking the crepe batter _ it won't burn
and the finished crepes will look and taste better.
</P>
<P>
   The filling goes together in a jiffy with a package of cream
cheese, grated lemon peel, sugar, vanilla and ricotta cheese. (The
restaurant uses a combination of farmer's cheese blended with the
cream cheese, but to streamline the recipe we opted for all cream
cheese.) To avoid having the filling break down, don't overmix once
you've added the ricotta.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a pastry bag to fill the crepes, you'll have more
control than if you spoon on the filling, but suit yourself. Fold
in the two sides of the crepes and then roll up.
</P>
<P>
   You can make the crepe batter or cook the crepes the day before
serving (keep covered and refrigerated), but don't fill them or
brown them in butter until an hour before serving brunch. Once
you've cooked the filled crepes until golden, you can keep them in
a hot oven a few minutes until serving. Another time you might want
to fill the crepes with cheese, lobster or mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Select the freshest and sweetest berries for the fruit compote _
and mix and match according to availability. Have the compote ready
and warm at serving time. The hostess can plate the crepes for each
person _ two to a plate, or three as the restaurant does _ and top
with compote, then sprinkle with powdered sugar. Or you can serve
the crepes buffet style _ on a large platter _ with the warm
compote in a separate dish, noted Naylor.
</P>
<P>
   Another outstanding brunch choice is an Omelette With Crab,
Asparagus, Carmelized Shallots and Mascarpone. Serve with Granita's
fabulous Breakfast Potatoes, which rated raves from tasters. They'd
be great another time with scrambled or poached eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Naylor uses peeky toe crab (so named because the crabs have
pointed claws) flown in fresh from Maine. ``It is very sweet, and
if you can get it, it's great to use in crab cakes, crab salad and
squash soup,'' added Naylor. ``Other crab such as Dungeness or blue
can be substituted, but be sure it is fresh.''
</P>
<P>
   Mix it with mascarpone cheese and season with salt (taste and go
easy as the crab may be salty) and pepper to use as the filling.
``If you don't eat shellfish, you can substitute porcini or morel
mushrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   To make each omelette, add cut-up blanched asparagus and
carmelized shallots to butter in a skillet, then add the seasoned
egg mixture (use a non-melt scraper to pull in the sides of the egg
mixture as it starts to harden) and cook until it begins to set.
Naylor keeps the eggs loose in the center _ not hard. Top with the
crab mixture and pop under the broiler to heat through. Then fold
the omelette over, serve with the potatoes and garnish with a sprig
of fresh rosemary. For those wanting to serve buffet style, half
the omelettes, center on the platter and surround with the
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The Breakfast Potatoes can be prepared in advance, then popped
into a hot oven to heat through. ``You want to make sure they are
crispy when served,'' said Naylor. Roast the red marble potatoes
(small potatoes available at selected farmers' markets) initially
in a hot oven _ either uncovered and with a bit of water in a pan,
or covered _ until tender. Then combine with sauteed red and yellow
peppers, red onion, asparagus pieces and rosemary for a dynamite
dish.
</P>
<P>
   The most complicated and sweetest offering is the Banana French
Toast with Date Cream and Coconut Syrup. Many tasters found it
overly sweet but thought it had possibilities if the flavors were
simplified some _ either by removing the dates from the cream
mixture or skipping the coconut syrup entirely. A raspberry or
other fruit syrup might be a nice complementary touch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the topping was a beautiful golden crown of carmelized
bananas that was difficult to cut through. You might skip this step
and add cut-up bananas to the cream instead of dates.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant makes banana brioche from scratch to use as the
French toast base, but for ease the recipe version that follows
calls for egg or raisin bread slices. The recipe has possibilities
_ adapt it to suit personal tastes.
</P>
<P>
   While the class was in progress, a plate of Lemon Scones hot
from the oven was passed around. They were tender and fabulous _
and difficult to resist. Although the recipe was not included in
the class, after a little arm twisting, the restaurant shared it.
With a few tweaks, it came out terrific in the home kitchen. But be
forewarned _ use whipping cream in the recipe _ no substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   A wonderful and fragrant Warm Pecan Coffeecake with Fondant
Icing was also demonstrated to the class. It contains a Pecan Sugar
Filling and a Streusel topping; after baking, a powdered sugar
icing is drizzled over the cool cake. Granita offers a warm slice
to diners for $4.50 that's gilded with yummy caramel sauce and
creme fraiche. What a splurge!
</P>
<P>
   For those who want a special grand finale to brunch serve a
wonderful Chocolate Tart. The restaurant makes its version with
Valrhona bittersweet chocolate, but it comes out great with other
brands as well. In a bind, you can even use semisweet chocolate. We
adapted the restaurant's recipe for the pate sucre because when we
reduced the recipe to home-size, it came out rather bland. We
preferred using a favorite cookie-style crust for the tart shell.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that a recipe is a guideline, not something to bog you
down, pointed out Naylor. ``Cook from your heart, not your head. If
you like something spicier, add more spice. Or add more olive oil
or vinegar.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook with all your senses and start with the freshest
ingredients. How something looks, tastes and smells is important.
When you present the food, it should look clean and fresh _ not
manipulated _ and still have life to it.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's no excuse for not serving a glamorous brunch to your
guests. These inspired recipes from Granita will help make the meal
_ and the cook _ shine. &UR;  &QL;

   CHEF PROFILE ... &UR;  &QL;

Age: &LR;  35. &UR;  &QL; 
Profession: &LR;  Executive chef, Granita restaurant, Malibu. &UR;  &QL; 
Hometown: &LR;  Santa Monica. &UR;  &QL; 
Food background: &LR;  She's from a third-generation restaurant family.
Her grandfather, Tiny Naylor, owned the Tiny Naylor's restaurant
chain in Southern California, which was sold years ago. Jennifer
baked and cooked a lot with her mother and grandmother when she was
young and won awards for her baking in grade school.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Southern Methodist University in Dallas
with an art history/studio art major and a minor in Spanish, she
worked as a waitress at a restaurant in Manhattan Beach. At her
request, chef Roland Gibert (now at 72 Market Street in Venice)
gave her a chance to work in the kitchen doing cold salads and
appetizers. She fell in love with it.
</P>
<P>
   After a year and a half, she left to work with Mary Sue Milliken
and Susan Feniger at the City of Angels for two years. Then it was
on to DC3 in Santa Monica and Eureka (Wolfgang Puck's restaurant,
which has since closed). ``Wolfgang called me the sausage queen,''
she noted, as she made all the specialty sausages.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Granita eight years ago as the kitchen manager.
However, in 1996 she worked a year for Gianfranco Vissani at his
restaurant in Baschi in Italy's Umbria region _ and for Nadia
Santini in her restaurant outside of Mantova in the Lombardy area.
On her return, she went straight to Chicago (for five months) to
help open Spago there _ and upon returning to California two years
ago she became the executive chef at Granita. &QL; 
Cooking style: Before she went to Italy, her style was very
California cuisine, but now it's California cuisine with Italian
and Mediterranean influences using the freshest ingredients.  &QL; 
Kitchen secrets: Shopping at the heart of the source _ going
directly to the farmers. ``Shop first and plan your menu later _
and you won't go wrong.'' &UR;  &QL; 
Most popular dish &LR; es &UR; she makes: &LR;  Seafood risotto with Maine
lobster, scallops and prawns; bouillabaisse. &QL; 
Three f &UR; avorite foods: &LR;  Any kind of pork (such as prosciutto and
culatello, which is a cured pork product found in Italy); pasta;
anything with extra virgin olive oil drizzled all over it.  &UR;  &QL; 
Favorite junk food &LR; : Haagen-Dazs Dulce de Leche (caramel ice
cream). &QL; 
Food she hates: Calf's liver (but she loves foie gras). &UR;  &QL; 
Secret food passion &LR; s &UR; : &LR;  Black truffles; she also collects antique
culinary treasures.  &UR;  &QL; 
Favorite kitchen gadget: &LR;  Her grandmother's old hand-crank meat
grinder. &UR;  &QL; 
Pet peeve: &LR;  Incorrect orders _ whether from a purveyor, a takeout
order from a restaurant, etc. &UR;  &QL; 
Favorite cookbook &LR; s &UR; : &LR;  ``Le Ricette Regionali Italiane'' (regional
Italian recipes that cover every region of Italy); ``The Splendid
Table,'' by Lynne Rosetto Kasper. &UR;  &QL; 
Ideal vacation: &LR;  To go anywhere in France and Italy where she can
enjoy the wine, food and men. &UR;  &QL; 
Favorite restaurant &LR; s &UR; : &LR;  Vincenti in Brentwood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most memorable meals: Trois Gros in Rouen, France; French
Laundry in Yountville, Calif. &UR;  &QL; 
What does she do when not cooking?: &LR;  She spends a lot of time with
her family, which is very large. &UR;  &QL; 
Dream job: &LR;  To be a professional traveler. &UR;  &QL; 
If she could dine with anyone (current or historical) &LR; , &UR; who would
it be?: &LR;  Julia Child. &QL; 
The worst part of being a chef is: You never meet any men. There is
no time to date. &QL;

MAKE FIVE GREAT MEALS WITH STORE-COOKED CHICKENS 
A GLORIOUS RESTAURANT-STYLE BRUNCH WITH JENNIFER NAYLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Looking for short-cut, convenient ways to get
dinner on the table fast? Pick up a rotisserie chicken at a
supermarket and use it as the starting point for a terrific, quick
meal. Once you have removed the chicken from the bones, cut it up
and use it as the main ingredient in a delicious entree.
</P>
<P>
   Although rotisserie chickens aren't cheap _ in the neighborhood
of $5 each for a 1 1/2- to 2-pound bird with all the bones _
they're worth the convenience for those in a hurry. And if you
stretch a whole chicken with plenty of other ingredients, you'll
end up with a main dish that will serve four to six hungry diners.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to handling the rotisserie chicken, remember to
always start your food preparation with clean hands and a clean
working area.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the chicken from the bones is fastest and easiest while
the chicken is still warm and just home from the market. Once
chilled, it takes a little more time. Figure that a 1 1/2- to
2-pound bird will yield about 3 to 4 cups diced cooked skinless,
boneless chicken.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to use only half of the chicken the day you bring it
home, return the rest to the refrigerator and use it within two to
three days (after that amount of time, it will begin to spoil _
it's a quality issue), advised Bessie Berry, manager of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Hotline in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a whole rotisserie chicken, and you're not going to
use it the same day, divide it into halves or quarters, put in
separate shallow containers so it will cool quickly and refrigerate
or freeze immediately, continued Berry. Or you can remove the
chicken from the bones and refrigerate or freeze immediately. Don't
leave the chicken out at room temperature, cautioned Berry, adding
that you want the cooked chicken to cool down to 40 degrees F
within four hours.
</P>
<P>
   After a little experimenting with store-bought rotisserie
chickens, we came up with a week's worth of recipes, five total,
that go together in a jiffy and will get you through dinner on
several days without ever tiring of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rundown of the five meal creations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chicken Asparagus Stir-Fry: &LR;  This one-dish meal is a breeze to
make in a large wok or skillet. Stir-fry asparagus pieces quickly
with chopped green onions and red pepper strips until just
crisp-tender. Then add water chestnuts and garlic and a sauce
consisting of a mixture of hoisin sauce, chili paste with garlic,
sherry, chicken broth and cornstarch. Toss in the diced cooked
chicken, heat through, and dinner's on in under a half-hour. Serve
atop cooked rice _ delicious!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Italian Chicken and Pepper Sandwich: &LR;  Sometimes a sandwich will
do quite nicely for dinner _ and this one, reminiscent of sunny
Italy, is fabulous tasting. Layer chicken pieces, jarred roasted
red and yellow pepper pieces, cheese and tomato slices, and basil
leaves between two slices of toasted sourdough bread drizzled with
a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar. If you have some tapenade
(olive spread) around, spread a little of that on the bread slices
for an extra flavor treat. Close the sandwiches and toast under the
broiler on both sides until golden. These can't be beat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fast Chicken Black Bean Chili: &LR;  Who says you can't make chili
in no time flat? We'll prove it with this rendition, which contains
onions, garlic, chili powder, cumin, cut-up canned tomatoes, tomato
paste, black beans, diced green chiles and the cut-up meat from one
rotisserie chicken. It tastes like you spent more time in the
kitchen than you really did. Heat all the ingredients except the
chicken to boiling, then reduce the heat and simmer 10 minutes
before stirring in the chicken. Serve topped with sour cream,
shredded cheese, tomatoes and green onions for a meal in a dish.
So-ooo good!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Green Chile Chicken Corn Chowder: &LR;  This is comfort food at its
best. Tasters couldn't get enough of this thick, creamy soup laden
with milk, cream, corn, green chiles and chicken. The only part
that takes a little time is heating the milk, cream and corn to
boiling, stirring occasionally. The diced cooked chicken is stirred
in a few minutes before serving. Topped with shredded Cheddar
cheese, this main-dish soup is destined to be a hit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Greek-Style Chicken Pasta Salad: &LR;  While the penne pasta is
cooking, chop up some cucumber, green onions, tomatoes and green
peppers. Rinse the cooked pasta with cold water and return to the
pot. Toss with olive oil and wine vinegar, then add the vegetables
along with ripe olive slices, capers, garlic, Greek seasoning and
the rotisserie chicken. Serve piled on baby greens and top with a
sprinkling of good-quality feta cheese. Accompany with rustic bread
slices and that's it for a festive and tasty meal that will have
diners returning for more.
</P>
<P>
   Now you have five easy dishes that each rely on a whole
rotisserie chicken and will help you succeed in making dinner time
delicious. If you are inclined to get two meals from a single
chicken, use half as much chicken as called for in our recipes _
and make two different dishes using the same rotisserie chicken.
Suit yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Suggestions for using the meat from a chicken cooked on a spit
are only limited by your imagination. Other possibilities you might
want to try in the future include pizzas (chicken salsa pizza or
barbecued chicken pizza), quesadillas, tostadas, nachos, stews, hot
and cold salads, all kinds of sauced pastas, stir-fries, vegetable
and other soups, barbecue-sauced chicken Joe's, omelettes, quiches
and more. With so many options, you may never tire of chicken. This
is reincarnation of a convenience food at its best. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHICKEN ASPARAGUS STIR-FRY &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
3 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 1/2 to 2 pounds fresh asparagus, diagonally sliced into 1-inch
pieces &QL; 
1 bunch green onions, chopped &QL; 
1 large red bell pepper, cut into thin 2-inch long strips &QL; 
1 can (8 ounces) sliced water chestnuts, rinsed and drained &QL; 
2 garlic cloves, pressed &QL; 
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce &QL; 
3 tablespoons dry sherry &QL; 
3/4 cup chicken broth whisked with 1 tablespoon cornstarch until
smooth &QL; 
1 teaspoon chile paste with garlic &QL; 
3 cups cooked diced chicken &QL; 
Salt and garlic pepper to taste &QL; 
Hot cooked rice &QL; 
1/2 cup roasted cashew nuts (optional) &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In a large wok or skillet, heat oil over high heat until hot.
Add asparagus, green onions and red pepper and stir-fry until
vegetables are barely crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in water
chestnuts, garlic, hoisin sauce, sherry, chicken broth mixture and
chile paste with garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Continue cooking over medium high heat, stirring constantly, 2
to 3 minutes, until sauce boils and thickens. Stir in chicken and
salt and garlic pepper to taste. Heat through.
</P>
<P>
   Serve over hot cooked rice, topped with cashews, if desired.
Makes 4 to 5 servings. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ITALIAN CHICKEN AND PEPPER SANDWICH &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
12 slices sourdough OR Italian bread OR 6 long individual serving
size sourdough OR French bread rolls &QL; 
Extra virgin olive oil &QL; 
Balsamic vinegar &QL; 
4 cups cooked chicken slices and pieces &QL; 
3/4 of a 15-ounce jar roasted red peppers, drained &QL; 
6 thin large slices smoked OR regular mozzarella cheese &QL; 
12 tomato slices &QL; 
12 to 18 large fresh basil leaves, rinsed, drained and patted dry &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Place bread slices on a foil-lined baking sheet. Toast under
preheated broiler, watching carefully, until lightly browned on
just one side.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle all toasted slices with a little oil and vinegar. On
EACH of 6 toasted slices place 1/6 of chicken slices and pieces,
then 1/6 of red peppers, a cheese slice, 2 tomato slices and 2
basil leaves. Close sandwiches with 6 remaining bread slices,
toasted sides inside.
</P>
<P>
   Return sandwiches to broiler and toast both sides of sandwich

 &HT;    BIPARTISAN CONGRESS HONORS HOME RUN LEADER AARON
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Sports (s) categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats and Republicans can't agree
on much lately, but there was no debate Tuesday on a declaration
that Hank Aaron deserves ``a permanent place in both sports history
and American society.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century after the former Atlanta Braves
outfielder passed Babe Ruth as baseball's career home run leader,
the House unanimously passed a resolution already approved by the
Senate honoring Aaron for his achievements on and off the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He captivated baseball fans in Georgia and across America and
taught us to follow our dreams,'' said Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.
``Through his hard work and perservance on the baseball field and
his commitment to young people and his community, he has earned a
permanent place in sports history and American society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true,'' said Aaron, recalling his
lifetime journey from Mobile to Milwaukee to Atlanta to now being
recognized by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As a player and executive, Aaron has been associated with the
Braves for more than 45 years. But he told WSB-TV reporter Alison
Burns that he probably wouldn't make it back to Turner Field for
Tuesday night's playoff game against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to do without me,'' he said, adding:
``I'm not going to put the jinx on them'' by predicting a win.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron hit his historic 715th home run on April 4, 1974, passing
Babe Ruth's total and becoming the all-time leader. He finished his
career in 1976 with 755 home runs. In 1982, he was elected to the
National Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments of Aaron's 23-year major league career
certainly deserve Congressional recognition, Chambliss said, but so
do his humanitarian activities in the 23 years since his retirement
as a player. He cited Aaron's Chasing the Dream Foundation, which
helps underprivileged kids in Atlanta to attain their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by his wife, Billie, Aaron was beset by fans as he
walked across the Capitol grounds. He was asked to autograph items
ranging from baseballs to a Capitol policeman's ammunition box.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Barrett, D-Wisc., represents Milwaukee and recalled how
he learned math as a boy computing Aaron's batting average. Sen.
Jim Bunning, R-Ky., _ a former major league pitcher _ admitted that
one of Aaron's home runs came off him.
</P>
<P>
   Start optional trim
</P>
<P>
   Aaron is currently a senior vice president and assistant to the
president for the Braves. He expressed hopes that his foundation
can expand beyond Atlanta to help deserving children aged 9 to 12
``all around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God gives people certain talents,'' he said, but also
``expects you to go beyond your talent'' to help others.

SYDNEY'S ON TOP OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Paris, surely, and New York and probably
London, but after that it's hard to think of another city that
matches Sydney, the home port of the good life, for the sheer
excellence and exuberance of its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Fabulous raw materials _ especially fish and shellfish from the
unpolluted seas that surround this island continent, and tropical
fruits from Queensland _ give Sydney's cooks a head start. Drawn
from a polyglot population, they bring the techniques and
traditions of China, France, Malaysia, Thailand, Italy and a dozen
other nations to their work.
</P>
<P>
   You can taste Greece in Janni Kyritsis' food and French Canada
in Serge Dansereau's, Japan in Tetsuya Wakuda's and Britain in
Daryll Taylor's. Along with home-grown talents like Neil Perry and
David Thompson, they are helping to define a national approach to
food, rooted in a love of Australian produce.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney attracts great chefs for the same reason that the
University of California at San Diego attracts Nobel Prize-winning
scientists: they jump at the chance to work alongside talented
peers in a benign climate. Once here, they are egged on by a horde
of foodies _ prosperous, cosmopolitan folk who think nothing of
hopping onto a jet for a weekend in San Francisco or a week in the
south of France.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of American and other foreign visitors will
travel here for the 2000 Olympics, the Millennium Games. In the
months leading up to the sporting spectacle, which starts in
September, Sydney will offer not one but two world-class arts
festivals organized by Australia's leading impresario, Leo
Schofield.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible optimism among restaurateurs in Sydney
about what the Olympics will bring us,'' said Carolyn Lockhart,
editor of Australian Gourmet Traveller. ``We've been little old
deprived Australia for a long time. Now we're stars. It's
incredible. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the foreigners will be surprised to see passion fruit on
sale for 15 cents apiece at downtown fruit stands, or to find 800
people jamming a single dim sum restaurant on a Sunday, with 200
more waiting, as my wife, Betsey, and I did not long ago. Most will
be astonished by the subtlety and variety of what they find on
their own lunch and dinner plates.
</P>
<P>
   Until the late 1970s, eating in Sydney was about as exciting as
a two-note symphony. The city had more lager louts than epicures.
Most people ate because they had to, and for no other reason. Now
even the grace notes are attended to. Salads are perfectly dressed,
and good coffee, often from Illy or Lavazza or Segafredo in Italy,
has become a national obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant revolution here has been matched in many other
cities, of course. You eat unimaginably better food today in
Toronto and Dallas and Munich than you did only a few years ago.
But in Sydney the change has penetrated much more deeply into the
food culture; it is not just in the most ambitious restaurants that
times have changed. Standards have also improved in the corner
bistros, neighborhood joints, cafes and delis.
</P>
<P>
   Australian wine has also taken giant steps, and service has kept
pace as well. In the United States, we are often told that
overfamiliar, underinformed waiters and waitresses are the
inevitable products of a classless society. But Australia is at
least as egalitarian as we are, if not more so, yet people wait on
table with a perfect mixture of good cheer and deep knowledge of
what they are serving.
</P>
<P>
   Stodge is out, light is in and the Herculean helpings of old
have been banished. In just two years, the compulsion to combine
five civilizations and three continents in a soup bowl has eased.
But the Asian influence, pervasive if not quite omnipresent, still
sets Sydney apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just as happy with chopsticks as a knife and fork,''
says the current edition of The Sydney Morning Herald's
comprehensive ``Good Food Guide.'' ``To us, the Far East is the
Near Northwest, and eating in an Asian manner _ albeit a modernized
one _ is as natural as breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   All by himself, Neil Perry sums up the Sydney food scene. Like
Jean-Georges Vongerichten in New York, he speaks many culinary
languages, all fluently. Rockpool, his home base, is an oasis of
high-tech urban chic in the city's oldest neighborhood, with
brushed-steel chairs and lighting cunningly devised to flatter the
profiles of the city's beautiful people. But Rockpool draws people
from many races, age groups and economic levels, not just the cream
of Nescafe society.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the best Sydney restaurants, Rockpool makes no
distinction between starters and main courses; you choose as you
like, as if you were in China or Japan. We didn't choose at all.
Perry, who wears a ponytail and is habitually dressed in black when
not wearing chef's whites, sent out a series of things he said he
felt especially proud of.
</P>
<P>
   All showed his special talent for fusing improbably matched
ingredients to produce new flavors _ one example after another of
the sum's far exceeding its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: a delicate shrimp custard, shimmying on the plate like
My Sister Kate, with cauliflower puree and just a filament of
spinach oil; translucent slivers of slow-cooked abalone _ often
tough and tasteless, here tender and succulent _ with tree
mushrooms and a noodle salad, and a plate of new-age surf and turf:
a chunk of tuna, cooked Texas-rare, studded with anchovies and
roasted garlic, perched on a bed of mashed potatoes, with bone
marrow and red wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all comes back to produce,'' Perry said after dinner. ``A
cook in London uses Asian vegetables flown from Thailand, usually
two or three days old. We're more like California, with everything
close at hand. Especially fish; Nobu in New York gets some of its
fish from my supplier.''
</P>
<P>
   Wockpool, a second Perry enterprise, is less formal, more
overtly Asian and breathtakingly situated at the edge of Darling
Harbor. Two of the best dishes we ate on this latest trip to Sydney
_ right up there with the most dazzling creations of David
Thompson's Darley Street Thai, which is sadly scheduled to close
soon, when Thompson retires _ came out of the Wockpool kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   A salad including bits of crispy pork, hot chilies, batons of
green pawpaw and slices of cucumber was sweet and acid and hot and
cool, all at the same time. An irresistible dessert combined layers
of ginger ice cream and intensely flavored pineapple sorbet in a
crumb crust, with see-through slices of pineapple on top.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's latest, called Bistro Mars, pays homage to the everyday
cooking of provincial France, with solid renditions of dishes like
ouefs en meurette _ poached eggs in a red wine sauce, with lardons
and tiny onions. The setting is button-bright, with glass-top
tables, buttercup-yellow plastic chairs and a giant Moreton Bay fig
tree just outside, but the service, to tell the unvarnished truth,
reminded us more of Mars than of France.
</P>
<P>
   What Sydney has lacked has been a formal, celebratory space with
first-class cooking. None of the Perry operations qualifies, and
Tetsuya's, Sydney's shrine of fusion cuisine, where the confit of
ocean trout sends many diners into sighs of rapture, is a plain
room in a plainer suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Banc has closed the gap. With tall, octagonal marble pillars,
Limoges plates and Christofle cutlery, it slips easily into its
tony neighborhood, and the food is made for high rollers. I liked a
frothy cauliflower soup with beignets, a fine example of how to
take a cheap ingredient and turn it into something elegant, and an
old favorite given a face lift: tournedos Rossini, with the fillet
rolled in truffle oil, left to marinate for a week, grilled,
stuffed with foie gras and truffles and wrapped in prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   In the same part of town, Sydney has just acquired a gastrodome
on the scale of Dean &AMP; DeLuca in New York, Peck in Milan and KaDeWe
in Berlin, something it has never had.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Simon Johnson, grocer to the city's carriage trade, and Stan
Sarris, proprietor of successful coffeehouses and restaurants,
including Banc, have filled the entire bottom floor of Sydney's
grand old General Post Office with a foodie's fantasy. It includes
an enormous selection of meat and cheese, fish and shellfish,
fruits and vegetables, along with prepared foods from Australia and
overseas and meals to take home.
</P>
<P>
   Also a first-class steakhouse (Prime), which meets another need
here; a bar called Tank, complete with tapas; a sushi bar (So Su
Mi) with a tiny train carrying the goodies to the customers; a
crustacean bar; an espresso bar, and a brasserie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about theater,'' Johnson said. Exotic Australian
shellfish, including antipodean specialties like yabbies, marrons
and Balmain bugs, are laid out on ice. Sides of beef, lamb and game
hang in a glass-sided aging room, and cheeses from Europe and
Australia are kept in a walk-in larder at 95 percent humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing is epic in scale and ambition: 500,000 square
feet of black-and-white marble floors, tile, glass and stainless
steel, representing an investment of about $3.5 million. What also
sets it apart is its location squarely in the city's business
center, on a broad pedestrian plaza called Martin Place. It is as
if Balducci's were to move to Wall Street. No fewer than 67 banks
have offices within a couple of blocks.
</P>
<P>
   If Banc is Sydney's answer to the Four Seasons, Forty-One is its
counterpart to the old Windows on the World. You sit in deep
leather chairs, sipping a glass of Krug, eating Tasmanian oysters
with a Vietnamese dipping sauce, aquamarine walls behind you, the
vast harbor spread out beyond the glass in front of you. That's for
starters. Later, a floor higher, you might try Dieter Sawyere's
Yamba prawns with Indian spices or crown roast of hare, a
masterpiece in miniature.
</P>
<P>
   A Swiss, Sawyere has no patience with the empty flourish, but
his capacity for taking pains with details is vast. ``He missed a
career in microsurgery,'' said Schofield, a gourmand as well as a
showman.
</P>
<P>
   The harbor is also part of the charm at the newly refurbished
Bathers Pavilion in Balmoral, a close-in suburb. The water lies
alluringly just beyond a row of louvered windows, open in good
weather (which is to say about 350 days a year), and the day we ate
there with Australian friends a whale was cavorting offshore, or so
people said. Between bites, they were debating whether it was male
or female, Alexander or Alexandra.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1928, the Pavilion has been transformed by the arrival
of Serge Dansereau, a Quebec native who helped reshape Australian
cooking during his years at the Regent Hotel in Sydney, persuading
farmers to raise crops like fir-apples especially for him. In an
improbably green, deliriously delicious pea soup with garlic and
sorrel, and a chocolate miroir with blood orange sauce, he uses
sharp-tasting secondary ingredients to set off the richness of the
primary products.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good eating city, Sydney has its Italian stars. Bob
Carr, the premier of New South Wales, took us to one of his
favorites, Lucio's, an artists' hangout where Lucio Galletto, who
comes from La Spezia, near Genoa, served us a whole fish
beautifully roasted in a salt crust. Bel Mondo, more modern and
more Milanese in style, serves the best homemade pasta in town, a
barbecued duck with balsamic vinegar and superbly chosen wines. But
I would give the Mediterranean medal to a master from another
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Janni Kyritsis, a soft-spoken Greek, used to cook at Bennelong
in the spectacular Sydney Opera House when it was the toast of
Sydney. Now he cooks in a converted auto showroom called MG Garage,
with a real MG on display (and priced on the menu).
</P>
<P>
   His food is decidedly Mediterranean, and he uses citrus flavors
in many dishes: grilled lemon with a Sicilian-style red mullet,
which he stuffs with pine nuts, and a touch of orange in a
lip-smacking galantine of suckling pig served with broad beans and
lentils.
</P>
<P>
   But he is equally adept at the fusion game. His bone-marrow
dumpling is made from Australian beef, marinated in tapenade from
southern France, encased in an English dumpling batter, served on
wok-fried spinach. It tasted entirely logical, as if it came from
some great-aunt's cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of modern British cooking is writ large in Sydney,
partly because Britain, too, is a kind of gastronomic magpie.
</P>
<P>
   At Jersey Cow, a cozy neighborhood bistro in Victorian
Paddington with charming chalk drawings of bemused bovines hanging
on the walls, the menu lists things like house-made pork sausages
with bean puree, a tomato and caramelized onion tart and Lancashire
hot pot. Daryll Taylor cooked at Franco Taruschio's celebrated
Walnut Tree Inn in Wales, and a couple of its Italian specialties,
like a seafood brodetto, make an appearance as well.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Mangan, another Englishman, and Lucy Allon, an Australian,
greet guests at Salt, another of the city's hot new places, with a
not-quite-hard-boiled quail egg, rolled in salt and celery salt.
Ms. Allon read not long before the restaurant opened that salt
symbolized hospitality and friendship in ancient Greece.
</P>
<P>
   The room is lean and mean, with lavender banquettes. The menu is
packed with innovations like shredded shoulder of lamb with
cabbage, thyme and black olives. But few people can resist, at

   On top of everything else, Australia has developed a cafe
culture to rival Vienna's. Try breakfast at Bill's, a street-corner
spot in the trendy Darlinghurst section. You sit around a big
square table next to media types, moms with kids in strollers and
people from nearby design offices, and you (italics)eat:(end

sweet corn fritters, spring onion pancakes with gravlax, ricotta
hotcakes with butter and honey. Why doesn't my town, or your town,
have something like this?

TO SIP A GRAPE, NOT PLUCK IT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   No one would ever suggest that it is better to drink a glass of
orange juice than to eat an orange, or to drink apple cider instead
of eating an apple. After all, the fruits contain fiber, an
important component in the diet. But that contrary advice is just
what research indicates about grapes. Drinking a glass of grape
juice or red wine may be more beneficial than eating a bunch of
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Not that grapes aren't nutritionally useful. They do contain a
little fiber as well as folate, an important B vitamin; some
vitamin A, and a little vitamin C. Slightly more than three ounces
of grapes, a large handful, has only 100 calories. Besides, those
gorgeously perfumed sweet local grapes at farmers' markets right
now taste so good it's hard to pass them by. They are certainly
much more interesting than what the supermarket has to offer year
round.
</P>
<P>
   But grapes appear to be a rare example of processed being
superior to fresh. There is some scientific evidence that grapes in
liquid form, either in juice or fermented in wine, may help reduce
the risk of heart disease and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Grapes, like all fruits and vegetables, contain flavonoids,
natural antioxidant pigments. Different flavonoids have different
effects. Lycopene, found in tomatoes, may help reduce the risk of
heart disease. Sulforaphane, found in broccoli and cauliflower, may
inhibit breast cancer cells. And certain flavonoids in grapes _
quercetin, rutin and resveratrol _ appear to contain antioxidant
and anti-clotting substances.
</P>
<P>
   These flavonoids are found in the skins and seeds of red, purple
and black grapes, but not in white or green varieties. Very little
of the beneficial flavonoids are in the pulp itself. The skins, the
seeds, the pulp and a bit of the stem are all present during the
processing of juice and wine. Eating fresh grapes, you get only the
skins and pulp, and thus very few of the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Research into these flavonoids began with the discovery of the
so-called French paradox: the French have a lower incidence of
heart disease than Americans, despite their taste for foie gras and
butter. Some scientists have suggested that this could be because
they drink more wine, specifically red wine. There has been
speculation that the alcohol is what accounts for the difference,
and that may be partly correct, but more recent research suggests
that the grapes do not have to be fermented to help prevent heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Grape juice does seem to keep blood platelets, which aid in
clotting, from becoming very sticky and causing dangerous clumps in
the major arteries. Dr. John D. Folts, director of the coronary
artery thrombosis research and prevention laboratory at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School, conducted a study
of 15 healthy men and women and found that consuming 10 to 12
ounces of pure grape juice a day significantly reduced the
platelets' stickiness.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Folts' studies suggested that grape flavonoids
prevent ``bad'' cholesterol from oxidizing and clogging arteries.
His most recent work indicated that grape juice improves the
arteries' ability to dilate and carry blood more effectively. (All
his studies were partly financed by Welch Foods, the maker of
Welch's Grape Juice.)
</P>
<P>
   Another researcher, Dr. Jane Freedman, an assistant professor of
medicine and pharmacology at Georgetown University Medical Center
in Washington, has also found that consumption of pure grape juice
reduces the stickiness of blood platelets. Her work was financed by
the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to pass up great grapes. There is plenty of
reason, however, not to go hog wild with pure grape juice unless
you are trying to gain weight: 10 to 12 ounces a day is the
recommended amount, and adds 180 to 200 calories. As Dr. Freedman
notes, ``There probably is beneficial value to drinking grape
juice, but we don't know how little is effective.''

   Pouilly-Fume Ladoucette 1997, Loire Valley, France. About $20.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful: Pouilly-Fume is not Pouilly-Fuisse. Pouilly-fume is
from the Loire Valley and is made from the sauvignon blanc grape;
pouilly-fuisse comes from southern Burgundy and is made from
chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   As for the names, there are towns named Pouilly and Fuisse in
Burgundy, and there is a Pouilly-sur-Loire in the Loire Valley. But
the ``Fume'' refers to the wine's supposedly smoky taste, not to a
place.
</P>
<P>
   Pouilly-Fume is more closely related to Sancerre and to white
Bordeaux than to any of the Burgundian whites, including Chablis.
To the average wine drinker, there is really no difference between
Pouilly-Fume and Sancerre. Both are flinty, lively and fresh.
</P>
<P>
   An expert will tell you that Pouilly-Fume is richer and higher
in alcohol than Sancerre. It takes a little longer to develop and
will last several years in the bottle.

SMALL EAST TEXAS CHURCH BECOMES HUB FOR ADOPTIONS

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELBYVILLE, Texas _ They were born into homes of neglect or
abuse and many of them were damned to childhoods of shuttling from
one set of foster parents to another.
</P>
<P>
   Then, inexplicably, they began to find permanent homes and legal
parents in the Piney Woods of Shelby County.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a trickle of children &UR;  &LR; into deep East Texas
quickly turned into a cascade sufficient to cause a blip on the
census screen of this sparsely populated landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 14 months, 39 children, mostly from Houston, have
relocated here, and middle-aged couples, many with empty nests
after years of child-rearing, still wait in line to assemble new
families _ and to reunite siblings scattered into separate foster
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is phenomenal,'' says Judy Bowman, a supervisor with the
Child Protective Services division of the Texas Department of
Protective and Regulatory Services. ``We have never come across any
single group that would adopt this many kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``single group'' is the congregation of the Bennett Chapel
Missionary Baptist Church, a small, stark white chapel that juts
out of a clearing on the fringe of the Sabine National Forest, out
beyond Shelbyville, half a mile past the ``end of pavement'' sign
in a settlement known to prior generations as Possum Trot.
</P>
<P>
   It is now called New Harmony, and it was here, amid towering
pine thickets so dense that sun rays cannot enter, that the Rev.
W.C. Martin and his wife, Donna, heard the cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a yearning and a hunger within to put some life into
somebody else,'' he says, surrounded by more than a dozen of the
adopted children and their parents who have gathered at the church
for a birthday party. ``For me, this is a movement of God. We're
just the tools that God is using.''
</P>
<P>
   He watches the children helping themselves to cake and soft
drinks and says, ``You see some of these kids and it blows your
mind. It's like they were designed to be placed with those
families. They even look like their adoptive parents.''
</P>
<P>
   It began with the Martins and Mrs. Martin's sister, Dianne
Sparks, and spread through the congregation with such fervor that
the CPS virtually opened a branch office in the fellowship hall of
his church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting calls from other (CPS) regions in the state
asking us how we did it so they can replicate it,'' says Bowman.
``We have to tell them we didn't do it. There's no way we could go
out and sell something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 50, has been pastor of Bennett Chapel for nearly 16
years and for the first 10 he commuted from Houston, where he lived
and worked for an oilfield tool supply company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone at work one day told me about a program called `one
church, one child,''' he says. ``I think it started in California,
and the idea was to get someone in every church to adopt a child. I
guess that's when we started thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Martin and his family, which included a son and
daughter, then 11 and 6 years old, moved to Center and he became a
full-time pastor. The idea of adopting a child lingered, he says,
but they didn't take action until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a void in my life after my mother died (in 1996),'' says
Donna Martin. ``I came from a big family _ 17 kids _ and I liked
that. My mother was always at home, taking care of us. I was
thinking about that a lot and I heard a voice ... it said `foster
parents.'''
</P>
<P>
   She contacted the CPS office in Nacogdoches and learned that a
class for potential foster or adoptive parents was starting in
Lufkin. Because the children who are wards of the CPS come from
troubled environments, classes are required so the new parents will
know the difficulties they may be facing and the assistance they
can expect from the state until the child turns 18. Some may have
special education or counseling needs, or various health problems,
for which the state will pay the parents up to $475 a month. A
caseworker also is available when needed, Bowman says.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was determined to sign up, and encouraged her sister,
Dianne Sparks, to come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came to me and said, `Dianne, you need another child,'''
Sparks laughs. She was divorced and had a 19-year-old daughter. ``I
thought, yeah, I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Together they made the 50-mile round trip to Lufkin once a week
for 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for people who really want a challenge,'' says
Susan Ramsey, the caseworker who has assisted nearly all of the
Shelby County adoptive families.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the problems they might encounter did not deter the two
sisters. Not long after they completed the classes, Sparks adopted
a 6-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the Martins received a 5-year-old girl and
her 2-year-old brother, whom they promptly adopted. They have since
taken in two other children, a brother and sister, and plan to
adopt them also. They're considering enlarging their four-bedroom
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encouraged our church to get involved in this,'' Martin
says. ``I told them it could really make a turn in society ... the
church needs to get involved in lives, not just souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was surprised by the response, and he discussed it with
CPS officials, who were skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told him, `You get us some families _ at least 10 _ and we
will send someone to your church to teach the classes,''' says Judy
Bowman. ``Twenty-three families showed up for that first meeting.
We were shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of that group, 18 families completed adoptions. Just as
surprising, she says, is that when a second series of classes
began, another 20 were present. Two more series are being planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step for a church to take, a humongous step,''
Martin says. ``We've got all these kids coming in, and we've got to
figure out what to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were warned that the backgrounds of the children
affect their behavior for months or years to come, most of the
adoptive parents interviewed say the children, ranging in age from
2 months to 10 years, have adjusted well so far and show few signs
of the emotional scars they sometimes carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kids came in the door hollering, `Mama,''' says Theresa
Latham. She and her husband, Glen, a supervisor in a hardwood floor
factory, doubled the size of their family by adopting five sisters,
ages 4 through 9. They already were rearing one biological son, an
adopted son and a nephew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always wanted a lot of kids,'' she say, ``but I don't know
if Glen wanted that many girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest adjustment, she says, was making room for the new
brood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought a bigger house,'' she says. ``We've got five
bedrooms, but we need eight or nine more.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the motives were simple.
</P>
<P>
   Fred and Johnnie Brown's four children were grown and gone, so
they adopted four others, three of whom are triplets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got bored,'' Brown grins. ``We got tired of looking at each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he admits it was more serious than that. ``You start
looking at what all these kids are going through and you think,
`Maybe I can help.' I had no idea there were that many kids out
there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Gossett, 42, a logger, and his wife, Lucy, 41, have three
grown children and with their departures, their three-bedroom
mobile home had room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they left, it got lonely,'' Lucy Gossett says. Three
months ago, they adopted a 2-month-old boy and have found three
others they want to bring into their family. ``Our house is big
enough,'' Gossett says. ``And we bought a new van.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston has the largest pool of children seeking adoption, CPS
officials say _ more than 700 _ and until the gates of Shelby
County opened, their prospects were dim.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are hard to place,'' Bowman says. Prospective
parents are permitted to read a child's entire case file, complete
with comments from doctors or psychologists about the child's
particular problems and needs, and that deters many families.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky and Dorothy Cartwright checked out a 5-year-old girl who
had been living in a foster home in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew everything about her,'' Cartwright says. ``We went up
to Wichita Falls and spent a weekend. We were just with her a short
time, and when we left she cried.''
</P>
<P>
   She is now their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman says that before the Bennett Chapel experiment she had
never seen a surplus of families waiting to adopt the children of
CPS.
</P>
<P>
   One of those on the waiting list is Gladys Williams, whose
sister and brother-in-law adopted a little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many kids out there don't have a home,'' she says. ``You
look at these kids walking around the house, happy and loved, and
you thank the Lord for it.''

SAMPLING THE BEST OF ITALY, IN VERONA

<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, Italy _ The center of this ancient city is reserved for
walkers. Not the grim heads-down striders of New York or London,
but relaxed strollers, wandering in and out of shops, chatting,
laughing and casually inspecting each other in the time-honored
Italian way.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the main pedestrian thoroughfare, the Via Mazzini, is
the tiny Via Scudo de Francia. In the middle of the block, a small
electric sign announces the Bottega del Vino, one of the best-known
gathering places in Italy. Politicians, business people, tradesmen,
students, occasional tourists and people from the wine trade fill
the bottega nightly.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, when Verona is host to a big wine trade fair known
as Vinitaly, Bottega del Vino runs almost around the clock. On most
days, service is supposed to end at 1 a.m. but no one seems to
watch the clock. I wandered in for dinner around 11 one night, and
when I left at 3:30 a.m., a handful of die-hards were still eating
dinner _ or a very early breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   As I left, Severino Barzan, the bottega's owner, said, ``You
will be back for lunch, yes?'' The answer was yes because the lunch
had been scheduled in advance; dinner was a last-minute decision.
Lunch, a multicourse, multiwine affair with Barzan presiding in his
own basement dining room, lasted from 1 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   Verona has two Michelin-starred restaurants, but the Bottega del
Vino isn't one of them. The red guide for Italy awards two stars to
Il Desco and one to Tre Marchetti. The Bottega manages to rate only
one crossed fork and spoon, which meansd ``quite comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter. One eats well in Barzan's care. Dishes are
traditional, and portions are generous. Pastas are made fresh
daily, and everything else comes from local farms and butchers. My
favorite dish: bigoli all'anatra, a thick local pasta mixed with
pieces of roast duck.
</P>
<P>
   But food at the Bottega del Vino is a mere backdrop. As the name
implies, this is a serious place for wine.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the 18 different vintages of Penfolds Grange from
Australia that Barzan stocks; forget the Opus One and reserve
cabernets from Robert Mondavi and the 15 vintages of Chateau
d'Yquem, many of them in double magnums and jeroboams.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, concentrate on the Italian wines, especially the wines
of the surrounding region, the Veneto. The glory of the Veneto is
amarone, a rich, powerful red wine. Barzan is an amarone fanatic,
but he confines his passion mostly to two labels, Bertani and Masi.
</P>
<P>
   He stocks 27 vintages of Bertani's amarone riserva, beginning
with 1959, and 35 vintages of various Masi amarones, starting with
1974 and including riservas, classicos, single-vineyard amarones
and even some made especially for the bottega. Also from Masi are
amarones made from the vineyards of the Serego Alighieri Estate,
whose ownership descends in an unbroken family line from the son of
the poet Dante.
</P>
<P>
   Barzan also offers a dazzling display of wines, mostly Barolos
and Barbarescos, from the Piedmont region of Italy: 21 from Angelo
Gaja; 11 from Bruno Ceretto, including a rare 1970 Zonchetta
Brunate; 25 wines from the Marchesi di Gresy and 18 from Prunotto.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Tuscan wines has 57 listings from Frescobaldi,
including all vintages of Luce, Lucente and Danzante, the wines
from the recent joint venture of Frescobaldi and Mondavi.
</P>
<P>
   As with any restaurant whose owner is devoted to wine, some of
the Bottega del Vino's best bottles are not on the list. The only
way to unearth them is to challenge Barzan to bring forth something
truly different.
</P>
<P>
   Like any successful restaurateur, Barzan is omnipresent at the
Bottega. He seems to know half his customers by name. Some bottega
regulars insist there must be two or three Severinos, because he
also owns a hotel and a theme park on Lake Garda, 20 miles west of
Verona, and two restaurants and a supermarket in Yalta, the Crimean
resort on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Yalta ventures came about after Barzan met the mayor of
Yalta when Mikhail Gorbachev visited Italy in the early 1980s.
``That was the time of glasnost,'' Barzan said. ``They invited me
there and gave me everything I wanted. It was almost too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything but what he needed to run restaurants. ``At first, we
brought in 100 percent of what we needed,'' he said. ``Now it's 30
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has a variety of thriving businesses, Barzan's
first love is still the bottega. ``It is a part of Verona,'' he
said. ``In fact, it (italics)is(end italics) Verona.'' He then led
me into a back room whose walls are decorated with old newspaper
clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the war,'' he said, ``this was a meeting place for the
anti-Fascists, intellectuals and political people who needed a
place to gather, to plan the future, or just to eat and play cards.
We keep it just the way it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, working in hotels,'' he added, ``I dreamed
of owning the Bottega del Vino. Now I do. I'll never change it, and
I'll never sell it.''

ANATOMICALLY INCORRECT: DECODING THE PUZZLING PIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: recipes in 2nd take)  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even for experienced cooks, approaching the meat counter can be
a prelude to bewilderment. The names of various cuts of meat often
change from shop to shop, and some seem designed more to confuse
than to enlighten the shopper.
</P>
<P>
   Take the pork cut known as the Boston butt. Since it resembles a
ham and is, after all, a ``butt,'' most cooks assume that it is
from the rear portion of the hog. Wrong. In one of the more
stunning misnomers in culinary history, the butt is not the rump
but rather the shoulder of the animal.
</P>
<P>
   But then, an observant shopper might ask, what exactly is the
``picnic shoulder''? As it turns out, that cut is not the shoulder
but the upper foreleg of the hog. As for its relationship to
picnics, there is a story, but even most butchers today don't know
it.
</P>
<P>
   These puzzling labels are at least partly responsible for the
low esteem in which American cooks seem to hold pork shoulder. But
these cuts are in fact a valuable addition to anyone's culinary
repertory: inexpensive and easy to cook, they have wonderful pork
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in getting acquainted with these worthy cuts is
understanding that their names, if somewhat whimsical, are at least
not totally arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``Boston butt'' dates to Colonial times, when butchers
in Boston devised a popular method of cutting up the shoulder,
typically packing these cuts in barrels called butts for shipping
or storage. Hence Boston butt.
</P>
<P>
   The picnic shoulder acquired its label somewhat later, in the
19th century. At that time butchers began boning this upper section
of the front leg and then curing it to create a more plebeian
version of ham. Not fancy enough for the dinner table, this cut was
thought appropriate for picnics, and the ``shoulder'' designation
was considered more appealing than ``foreleg.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomenclature aside, there are also more tangible reasons that
shoulder cuts have been less popular than those cuts ``high on the
hog,'' like loin or ribs. But these supposed disadvantages can also
be seen as virtues.
</P>
<P>
   First, cuts from the shoulder contain quite a lot of
intermuscular fat. There is an obvious downside to this, but on the
other hand, the fat gives these cuts a deeper, richer flavor. This
can be a boon to those who find the leaner cuts of today's leaner
pork too bland for their taste.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the fat makes shoulder cuts more resilient. If you
overcook a pork loin, for example, you're going to have very dry
meat that's not very tasty. If you overcook a Boston butt, it's no
big deal. This quality makes shoulder cuts ideal for serving to
guests who still mistakenly insist that, for health reasons, pork
must be cooked until it is dead gray all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   Cuts from this area also contain a relatively high proportion of
the connective tissue called collagen. This can make the meat very
tough. But when the proper cooking method is used, the collagen
melts into gelatin. This not only makes the meat tender but, like
the fat, also helps to make it very flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   Both butt and picnic shoulder respond very well, for example, to
braising, a cooking method in which the meat is half-submerged in
flavorful liquid, covered and cooked in a low oven.
</P>
<P>
   The butt is slightly superior for this use because it contains
less fat. The butt is also tender enough for dry roasting, so long
as it is cooked rather slowly and brought to medium-well done.
Shorter roasting leaves it a bit tough.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best use for picnic shoulder is cutting it into
cubes for stew meat. The long, slow cooking under liquid is ideal
for transforming this somewhat tougher meat into tender morsels.
</P>
<P>
   In some markets you will also find the butt, which is the upper
section of the shoulder, made into a smaller cut that is called
shoulder blade steak or, more simply, pork steak. This is the pork
equivalent of the classic seven-bone beef pot roast, with similar
attributes: excellent flavor and better texture than many other
cuts from the front of the animal. It is best braised.
</P>
<P>
   All of these cuts from the shoulder do take longer to cook than
more delicate pork cuts. But the cooking is mostly unattended, and
the flavor rewards are definitely worth the time. The next time you
walk up to the meat counter, you will have good reason to be more
confident than confused. &QL;

   RED WINE-BRAISED PORK STEAKS WITH PEARS AND CINNAMON
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 45 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 10- to 12-ounce bone-in pork shoulder blade steaks, about 1
inch thick
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 red onion, peeled and diced small
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe pears, pitted, peeled and sliced into eighths
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons coarse-grain mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In large saute pan over medium-high heat, heat oil until very
hot but not smoking. Dry steaks with paper towels, sprinkle
generously with salt and pepper, and add to pan in one layer,
cooking in batches if necessary. Cook until well browned on both
sides, for about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove steaks to platter.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour off fat or add oil to pan as needed, so that you have a
total of about 2 tablespoons left in pan. Add onions, and saute,
stirring occasionally, until transparent, for 7 to 9 minutes. Add
pears, and saute, stirring frequently, until browned, for about 5
minutes more. Add chicken stock and wine, and bring to simmer,
stirring to dissolve brown bits in bottom of pan.
</P>
<P>
   3. Return steaks to pan, and add cinnamon, bay leaf and thyme.
(Liquid should come halfway up sides of meat; if it does not, add
more stock or water.) Skim any film from surface, and then reduce
heat to low, and simmer, partly covered, until steaks are tender,
for about 1 hour. To check for doneness, plunge a fork straight
down into meat, and try to pull it out. If fork slides out easily,
meat is done; if meat hangs onto fork, give it more time.
</P>
<P>
   4. When steaks are tender, remove to serving platter, and cover
loosely with foil. Skim any film from cooking liquid, place
roasting pan on stove over medium-high heat and simmer to reduce
liquid. When liquid is slightly less thick than you want it, stir
in mustard, and then swirl in butter, a little at a time, until
sauce is shiny and thick. Remove from heat, and season with salt
and pepper to taste. Top steaks with sauce, and serve with
couscous.

 &HT;    TEXAS CONGRESSMEN SUPPORT PRE-GAME PRAYER RESOLUTION
 &HT;    Moving in Washington (w) and Sports (s) categories.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Texas legislators joined forces Tuesday on a
measure that unites God and high school football _ two topics
sacred to many in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can start each day in Congress with a prayer, why can't
the students in our schools do the same before their football
games,'' said Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, at a Capitol Hill press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla and a few other House members passed around a football
as they expressed disdain for a February ruling by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals at New Orleans that banned the practice of
kicking off games with a sectarian prayer over the public address
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ban sets a dangerous precedent. It is wrong for our
courts to dictate when and where we can pray,'' Bonilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Max Sandlin, D-Texas, shared in the outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we in a position in this country where asking for divine
guidance is a problem?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla and fellow Texan Rep. Charlie Stenholm, a Democrat from
Stamford, introduced a symbolic resolution Tuesday that says
``prayers and invocations at public school sporting events are
constitutional under the First Amendment'' and that the Supreme
Court should uphold them as such.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is the latest in a string of outcries against
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Rural districts across Texas have passed resolutions against the
ban and the attorneys general of nine states have written the
Supreme Court in support of prayer at football games. In addition,
Texas Attorney General John Cornyn and Gov. George W. Bush issued a
joint friend-of-the-court brief strongly supporting the prayer
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, supporters of the ruling say that the prayers are an
inappropriate mixing of schools and religion and impose a
``majority'' religion on all public school children.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for
Separation of Church and State, criticized the House members for
``using prayer as a political football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are obviously trying to manipulate religion to score
points with the folks back home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen House members from Texas have co-sponsored the measure
including Democrats such as Sandlin and Rep. Ralph Hall, and
Republicans such as Reps. Ron Paul and Lamar Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer-at-football-games controversy in Texas started with a
1995 lawsuit against a school district in Santa, Fe, Texas, about
20 miles north of Galveston. Represented by the American Civil
Liberties Union, two anonymous families _ one Catholic and the
other Mormon _ sued the Santa Fe School District for promoting
Christianity through several incidents.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district judge in Galveston eventually ruled that only
``nonsectarian'' and ``nonproselytizing'' prayers could be said at
graduation activities and football games. The 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling on graduation
prayers but banned prayers from football games, reasoning that the
sporting event is not a solemn occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sandlin said the distinction is ``strained at best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is constitutional at a graduation ... than it is
absolutely constitutional at a football game,'' he said.

   INDONESIA-POLITICS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ In a midnight ballot
that all but ended the brief, intense presidency of B.J. Habibie,
the newly independent national assembly rejected his recent
state-of-the-nation address and prepared to vote on Wednesday for
Indonesia's next president. Habibie's loss by just 33 votes, out of
690 that were cast, appeared to intensify the presidential

peacemaking efforts and the ``warmth'' of their reception for him

   SPEND-CONGRESS (Washington) _ President Clinton and

p.m., and the leaders and top White House officials doubtless will
have something to say about it. No big breakthrough is expected.
But this is the first time the president has met with the leaders

Congress are fighting over how much money the federal government
should spend to hire teachers and cops. They are also battling over
how much money the United States should pay to support the Middle
East peace plan. But their bitter standoff is about more than those
issues or the taxpayer dollars they represent. It is about seeking
political advantage as they enter a year of campaigning with
control of the House and the White House up for grabs. It is about
fundamental ideological differences over the size and role of the
federal government. But it is in part about the accumulated
hostility between Clinton and Republicans who fear the president as

just under half say they know someone their own age who has
attempted to commit suicide, according to a New York Times/CBS
poll. But in the more immediate reality of their daily lives, fear
and violence have diminished significantly in recent years, their
responses show. Teenagers report fewer problems with violence both
at school and in the streets than in 1994, and correspondingly
fewer worries: 24 percent said they feared being victimized,
compared to 40 percent in 1994. By Carey Goldberg.

   ECON-REPORT (Undated) _ The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4
percent in September, the biggest monthly increase since April, the

inflation, or leave rates alone and avoid the risk of slowing the
economy unnecessarily. By Louis Uchitelle.

figure long after she first gained fame as the doyenne of the
Nouveau Roman movement in the late 1950s, died on Tuesday at her
home in Paris. She was 99 and also had a country home in Cherence

Sarraute published 16 books, including 10 novels, although in her
very first book, ``Tropisms,'' she already set the tone of her
life's work. By Alan Riding.

INVENTOR TRIES ON-HANDS APPROACH TO STAYING AWAKE

<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. _ You might say that a near fatality, as much as
necessity, was the mother of Larry Leavitt's invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd fallen asleep at the wheel and was heading off a lonely
highway in the middle of the night, when someone flashed their high
beams from behind and that woke me up,'' Leavitt recalled.
``Another two seconds and I would have been dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, 39, of Delmar, a registered physician's assistant, was
discussing the genesis of his recently approved patent application
for sleep-detecting driving gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's patent (his first) and its number will be issued in
the coming weeks, said Charles Brown, an attorney in Windham who
specializes in patent work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is a man of great enthusiasm, eagerness and optimism
that what he's come up with might one day be commercially viable,''
Brown said. ``He's been a very active guy on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6 million U.S. patents have been issued since the first
one in 1790, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The
office anticipates issuing 160,000 patents in 1999, about 10,000
more than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's road to patenthood involved hours of intensive patent
database searching, streamlined by the Internet and the Patent and
Trademark Office's Web site (http://www.uspto.gov) _ which gets up
to 7 million visits each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have to go to Washington, D.C., and go through the
files manually,'' Leavitt said. ``With the Web site, I can search
in minutes what it took me weeks to do before.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt became a patented inventor the low-budget way. Instead
of hiring a patent attorney to do his leg work and searches _ at a
cost that could easily exceed $10,000 _ he did most of the work
himself. Leavitt hired Brown only to handle the final stage of the
patent application and spent about $1,000 from start to finish,
including filing fees.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt did it by following the step-by-step strategy laid out
in a book, ``Patent It Yourself'' (Nolo Press, 1997), by patent
attorney David Pressman.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's invention _ which uses grip-pressure sensors in the
gloves' fingers to detect fatigue or dozing of the driver, who is
then alerted by a shrill warning tone _ grew out of working 24-hour
shifts as an ambulance emergency medical technician in the late
1970s in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only time that fatigue, sleep deprivation and
long commutes caught up with Leavitt. He dozed off at the wheel,
almost lost control of his vehicle and nearly drove off the road
several times on his commute following 24-hour emergency room
shifts in Ticonderoga and midnight shifts at a hospital emergency
room in Columbia County.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt tried to find a remedy. His dad, a traveling salesman of
home-improvement products, gave Leavitt a few tips on battling
fatigue gleaned from long-distance truckers:
</P>
<P>
   _ A pinch of chewing tobacco into the corner of the eye. ``I
tried it. It worked. But it really burned and I wouldn't recommend
it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Driving barefoot. ``It doesn't work. And I speak from
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt also purchased some of the other products available,
including a sensor resembling a large hearing aid that clips behind
the ear to alert a driver once his head begins to nod. ``But by
then it's too late,'' Leavitt said. ``Everything I investigated
seemed impractical or not effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt also knew he wasn't the only one who battled fatigue
while driving. Drowsy drivers caused about half of last year's
fatal motor vehicle accidents, with an annual cost of $12.5 billion
in medical expenses and property damage, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
</P>
<P>
   National surveys have shown that about one in 20 drivers admits
to having had episodes of falling asleep at the wheel and
near-misses when veering off the road. Most of the sleep-related
accidents occur between midnight and 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A report from a New York state task force, titled ``Impact of
Fatigue on Driving,'' found that 55 percent of the 1,000 drivers
surveyed said they had driven while drowsy within the past year, 23
percent had fallen asleep at the wheel but avoided a crash and 3
percent had fallen asleep and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, an inveterate tinkerer with the air of an absent-minded
professor, set his mind to work on the asleep-at-the-wheel
conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he had to consider his own checkered patent-chasing
past. ``This can get obsessive and it's hard on a relationship,''
said Leavitt, who attributed a failed marriage, in part, to his
quixotic quest as an inventor.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, who is remarried, has four children. His wife, Eileen,
is a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   ``With young children, getting enough sleep is a constant
battle,'' said Leavitt,
</P>
<P>
   Much of Leavitt's dream is still in his head. The only tangible
product is a crude prototype he fashioned using a single
right-handed golf glove with about $8 worth of electronic
components from Radio Shack.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Leavitt's idea is a patent in search of a backer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is lining up to invest money yet,'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   The inventor bears an uncanny resemblance to the comedian Dennis
Miller. (He's been mistaken for the caustic comic on more than one
occasion and asked for an autograph.) Leavitt has tried to patent
other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   There was an idea he had for an electronic device that could
determine the optimum opportunity for fertility (``The Fer-Tell'')
_ aimed at couples who desired to conceive. After months of
searching patent archives, Leavitt found that somebody had beat him
to it and a patent already existed for the device.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Leavitt's idea for an electronic
smoking-cessation device. ``It wasn't as practical as I first
thought and I lost interest in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to come up with a protective apparatus for preventing
needle-stick injuries for health-care workers, but abandoned that
one as impractical.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other brainstorms over the years, most of which
grew out of his work in hospitals and health-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing heretofore clicked for Leavitt like the
sleep-detecting driving gloves. He gathered empirical evidence
during long hours of driving _ studying the physiology of how his
grip slackened on the steering wheel with the onset of fatigue and
drowsiness.
</P>
<P>
   His patent search also mined ``a whole file of oddities''
already patented. There was the squirt gun attached to the steering
wheel meant to awaken a drowsy driver with a blast of cold water.
Another device involved an electric shock to jolt a driver awake.
</P>
<P>
   What set Leavitt's eight-page patent application apart were 67
words in the claims section. ``That's all that matters in the whole
deal,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   The unique qualities Leavitt brought to the cluttered table of
operator-alerting devices were these: pressure sensors for
measuring grip pressure between a hand and a steering wheel, an
alarm activated when the grip pressure falls below a certain level,
and remote communication between the right and left hands of the
pair of gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crucial to have that communication between the gloves in
case you drive one-handed,'' Leavitt said. He said the other
important component is software capable of identifying a pattern of
fatigue through a change in finger pressure.

INVENTOR TRIES ON-HANDS APPROACH TO STAYING AWAKE

<P>
   DELMAR, N.Y. _ You might say that a near fatality, as much as
necessity, was the mother of Larry Leavitt's invention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd fallen asleep at the wheel and was heading off a lonely
highway in the middle of the night, when someone flashed their high
beams from behind and that woke me up,'' Leavitt recalled.
``Another two seconds and I would have been dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt, 39, of Delmar, a registered physician's assistant, was
discussing the genesis of his recently approved patent application
for sleep-detecting driving gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's patent (his first) and its number will be issued in
the coming weeks, said Charles Brown, an attorney in Windham who
specializes in patent work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is a man of great enthusiasm, eagerness and optimism
that what he's come up with might one day be commercially viable,''
Brown said. ``He's been a very active guy on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 6 million U.S. patents have been issued since the first
one in 1790, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The
office anticipates issuing 160,000 patents in 1999, about 10,000
more than the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt's road to patenthood involved hours of intensive patent
database searching, streamlined by the Internet and the Patent and
Trademark Office's Web site (http://www.uspto.gov) _ which gets up
to 7 million visits each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have to go to Washington, D.C., and go through the
files manually,'' Leavitt said. ``With the Web site, I can search
in minutes what it took me weeks to do before.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt became a patented inventor the low-budget way. Instead
of hiring a patent attorney to do his leg work and searches _ at a
cost that could easily exceed $10,000 _ he did most of the work
himself. Leavitt hired Brown only to handle the final stage of the
patent application and spent about $1,000 from start to finish,

BIRD RESEARCHERS USE GENETICS TO TRACK MIGRATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Subs entire text.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For a century, ornithologists using the
time-honored tools of leg bands and binoculars have tried and
failed to track the migration routes of songbirds.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to solve this mystery _ where songbirds go to feed during
the winter _ environmentalists have been stymied in reversing a
decline in their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes evolutionary biologist Thomas B. Smith,
associate professor at San Francisco State University and director
of the Center for Tropical Research. Three years ago, he was one of
the first to use genetic markers to link populations of songbirds
as they breed in the north and winter in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Today, using a bird's feather or a few drops of blood, Smith and
his colleagues are beginning to trace the seasonal flight paths of
the sweet-voiced Wilson's warblers, Swainson's thrushes and
MacGillivray's warblers from Alaska and Canada south as far as
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Once perfected, their technique should allow researchers to map
the migration patterns of hundreds of songbird species, potentially
leading to ways to prevent extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's novel is using molecular genetic techniques to relate
breeding and wintering populations,'' Smith said. ``We can then say
this population is OK and this one is declining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other scientists then can tell us the land-use changes such as
crop clearing or grazing that might explain the declines. There's
limited money out there, and it would sure help to know if we
should focus on the breeding ground or the wintering ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have preliminarily determined that the
population of Wilson's warblers that breeds in coastal Oregon and
California winters in Baja California, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's warblers from the Sierra Nevada appear to fly south to
the mountains of Costa Rica. Wilson's warblers at Denali National
Park in Alaska seek highland areas near Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
Breeding eastern Canada Wilson's warblers winter in Oaxaca, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco State researchers chose to track the 4
1/2-inch-high, quarter-ounce yellow-breasted warbler because it is
a real traveler, flying thousands of miles back and forth every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Using genetic markers to tail songbirds is a huge leap forward,
said Geoffrey Geupel, director of terrestrial programs at the Point
Reyes Bird Observatory in California, which is one of the oldest
bird-counting institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fantastic,'' Geupel said. ``We've been trying to find out
this information from wintering grounds for 35 years by putting
bands on birds. We band 10,000 birds a year. That's 350,000 birds.
There have been four recoveries of our songbirds south of the
border. Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the oldest natural history studies in the world is
bird-banding, and we still don't know where they all winter,'' he
said. ``Tom's research will answer these questions. It's hard to
save birds when you don't know where they spend their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The bird observatory has documented that the numbers of Wilson's
warblers caught in bird-banding nets as they stop along the Marin
County coast on the way south has declined by about 75 percent from
1980 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research
and Development last week gave Smith a $330,000 grant to continue
his three-year study.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're interested in birds as indicators of environmental
health,'' Smith said. ``If migrant birds are declining, we need to
know why. We can't answer that question if we don't have some way
of tracking them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists suspect some of the causes for the declining numbers
of birds are the loss of rain forest, savannah and riverine habitat
from decades of development along with logging, mining, farming and
applying pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA also wants to use the tool to track other animals as a
way to improve conservation practices, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   To conduct the research, the San Francisco State scientists use
a ring of 60 sampling locations throughout North America and Latin
America, some at new sites, some at existing banding stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Bird Populations, directed by David DeSante at
Point Reyes Station, has helped by supplying 5,000 feathers from
its banding stations all over North America.

Runs with CELESIDE, CELEBUY, CELEPRICE; has art  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Millennium mania has begun. Take a stroll through
major department, discount, home, party and wine stores, and you'll
feast on a glitzy array of products _ from china and serving dishes
to candles, wine glasses, party goods, foods and wines _ all geared
to celebrate 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New items seem to be cropping up almost daily, and consumers are
snapping them up to use in entertaining now through the first of
the year, or to keep as mementos and remembrances of the year (and
pass down to children and grandchildren). The items range from
simple, reasonably priced but glamorous-looking tableware to more
elaborate and expensive items such as crystal flutes, fancy gold
china plates, crystal wine buckets and more. You'll also find
several new-century patterns in inexpensive paper items, including
plates, cups, tablecloths, table decorations, napkins and candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason 2000 party goods are hitting stores now is that
consumer feedback says `I want the goods now' _ earlier than ever _
so I can start celebrating,'' according to Kathi Mishek, a Hallmark
spokeswoman in Kansas City, Missouri. Research indicates that
people will be throwing a variety of parties celebrating the
millennium before the end of '99 and into January 2000, she added.
``Consumers tell us they they will be going to more parties outside
the home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have jumped on the 2000 bandwagon, and an amazing
variety of products have popped up, Mishek said. ``Consumers are
definitely going to celebrate during the holidays with
2000-designated products.'' They may mix and match paper goods or
china with dishes and other items already in their collections to
keep the budget in check. There are plenty of options in both
colors and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Paper goods tend to follow the season's fashion colors more
closely than china, because they can be manufactured more quickly,
noted Mishek.
</P>
<P>
   ``All color trends this year have indicated that people want
jewel tones _ purples, red, greens, sapphire blue _ really intense
and cozy colors.'' So Hallmark's 2000 party-collection design
features a bright foil-line blue. Since character marketing is also
trendy, Hallmark is offering ``Mil-Looney-Um'' 2000 paper goods
featuring Looney Tunes characters.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, American Greetings has created a millennial color
palette that includes white, silver and purple in its Celebrate
2000 line of paper products (including party goods, ribbons,
candles, balloons, gift bags, etc.), said Deanna Heuschel, the
company's event planner in Cleveland. ``The color purple is making
a comeback as a hot, new color in hues such as eggplant, amethyst
and lilac. Purple is a New Age color, has a religious background
and is rich, regal and historical; kings and queens wore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heuschel advises consumers to begin planning their millennium
parties early and to select a theme, such as a time-capsule party
or a costume-party celebration of the old and new.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Krasnoff, senior interior designer at Macy's Mission Valley
interior design studio in San Diego, thinks people are already
looking at and buying millennial items. ``People are already
thinking about how they are going to entertain for New Year's and
about the type of party they are going to give.'' Create a mood for
a successful party, she advised.
</P>
<P>
   She believes three major entertaining and interior-design
directions that are in vogue will continue into the year 2000 _
drawing-room glamour, country charisma and Asian contemporary _
will influence party decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever they decide, said Krasnoff, ``a lot of people will
be staying at home and entertaining at home. There's already a
resurgence of entertaining at home _ and enjoying the home and
family and friends more.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoff suggests making some favorite food and buying the rest.
``I do a combination, as I have to make certain traditional cookies
that my family remembers from childhood. Tradition, memories and
nostalgia are extremely important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   You can hire a caterer if your budget allows. Or if an Asian
theme is your choice, serve takeout Chinese food. There are plenty
of other to-go options depending on the party theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food served at a beautifully set table always tastes better,''
emphasized Krasnoff, who specializes in creating great, interesting
tablescapes (she's not big on flowers) that generally cost less
than the flowers you'd otherwise order. Look around your home, and
with a little imagination you can turn your favorite things _
paperweights, Limoges boxes, cloisonne or small glass vases or
pitchers, framed pictures, etc. _ into a smashing tablescape that
will create conversation at your dinner or buffet table.
</P>
<P>
   If you're planning a holiday table using gold, go around the
house and collect all the gold items you have _ clocks, watches,
picture frames, candles, etc. For a New Year's bash, a whole
collection of clocks all set to midnight would be a fun table
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoff offers these tips for a great tablescape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ground your collection by placing the objects on palm leaves,
sand, moss, pebbles, fabric or perhaps a mirror.'' Use risers
(acrylic, boxes, etc.) to create different heights and levels, but
be sure you can see over them when seated. If you opt for using
candles of different sizes, be sure they are unscented to avoid
competing with the flavors in the meal, advises Krasnoff. Beautiful
fabrics placed loosely around your treasures makes a lovely
presentation. Accessorize with place cards and napkin rings. Place
cards attached to holiday ornaments are great party favors and
keepsakes. Or use individual miniature gold or silver frames or
small boxes, hand-painted to match the decor with guests' names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bedsheets make fun and impromptu tablecloths,'' says Krasnoff.
``Chargers (charger plates are larger than dinner plates and are
used underneath dinner or salad plates as a service or base plate)
change the scene, adding excitement, color and style. Your guests
should never stare at a blank table. Your table makes the final
statement on the quality of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoff believes it's going to be a gala 2000 and thinks people
will celebrate throughout the year _ not just for a single day.
</P>
<P>
   It's not too early to get in the spirit of 2000 and start
celebrating. There are plenty of tableware and food possibilities
to help make the festivities creative and fun.

 &HT;    Ill Albanian children going home soon, thanks to American
doctors
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With peace slowly settling in Kosovo, Dirajet
Shumoli looks forward to returning with her young daughter _ her
healthy daughter _ to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The pair came to Central Texas six weeks ago because 3-year-old
Azara was struggling with a lack of oxygen in her blood and was
dying of a heart defect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Azara is recovering from open heart surgery performed
Sept. 16 at Children's Hospital of Austin and is expected to have a
normal life. Her mother has ambitious plans for the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to be a doctor someday so she can help other
children,'' Shumoli said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Azara was one of five children from Kosovo with serious heart
maladies who came to Central Texas in September, as U.S.-led
intervention brought an end to the Serbian government's bloody
campaign against the ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Austin pediatric heart surgeons performed the operations, and
four children have already returned to Kosovo. Azara, whose heart
did not work properly because her arteries were in the wrong
places, is taking a little longer to recover from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   She was given the OK to head home Monday after a checkup showed
that steroid medication was working to reduce fluid around her
heart, said Lois Reiter, wife of Dr. Charles Reiter. The Temple,
Texas heart surgeon met the children while volunteering in Kosovo
and committed himself to helping them.
</P>
<P>
   A medical transportation company donated the families' air fare.
They stayed at the Ronald McDonald House in Temple, and they
received free passes to Sea World when the children had recovered
from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons donated their time. Children's Hospital donated
Azara's surgery and performed four others at cost, expected to be
about $75,000 total.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Reiter said he has raised about $30,000 of the hospital
bill and will pay the rest himself if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them (Children's Hospital) that if I didn't get the
money, I'd pay it. It may take me about a year, but I'll do it,''
he said. ``I think it's a great privilege to be allowed to help
these kids out. I've never been allowed to do anything like this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian physician who had been caring for the children, the
only cardiologist in Kosovo, had only a 25-year-old sonogram
machine to examine the children. An echocardiograph has been
donated, allowing the physician to keep an eye on the fluid around
Azara's heart, Lois Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Shumaker, Children's Hospital administrator, said the
hospital staff was also honored to be involved in helping children
who have had such difficult lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families were really gracious and certainly
extraordinarily grateful to everyone,'' Shumaker said. ``Most of us
really have no concept of what their world is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephan Dewan, head of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery at
Children's Hospital, said Azara was lucky in a sense because her
type of heart problem is generally unrepairable by the time
patients are 3. The same heart defect in an American baby would be
repaired when the baby is about a week old, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hardly ever see a child like that in the United
States,'' he said. ``It makes it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sima Grainca, the families' interpreter, said the families, all
ethnic Albanians, were amazed at the kindness and generosity of
Central Texans. The health-care system in Kosovo is fairly
primitive, she said, and the families had become accustomed to bias
and corruption among Serbian health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   They especially appreciated being able to stay with their
children at the hospital because they had often been forced to
leave their children alone in Serbian hospitals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stayed every night and every day with the children in the
hospital'' in Austin, she said. ``It's very nice. They liked it a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties in Kosovo, the Shumolis are eager to go
home, Grainca said. ``It's much better for us Albanians,'' she
said. ``The most important thing is the war stopped. The killing
stopped. There is peace now.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Thatcher writes for the Austin American-Statesman,
Austin, Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Millennium mania has begun. Take a stroll through
major department, discount, home, party and wine stores, and you'll
feast on a glitzy array of products _ from china and serving dishes
to candles, wine glasses, party goods, foods and wines _ all geared
to celebrate 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New items seem to be cropping up almost daily, and consumers are
snapping them up to use in entertaining now through the first of
the year, or to keep as mementos and remembrances of the year (and
pass down to children and grandchildren). The items range from
simple, reasonably priced but glamorous-looking tableware to more
elaborate and expensive items such as crystal flutes, fancy gold
china plates, crystal wine buckets and more. You'll also find
several new-century patterns in inexpensive paper items, including
plates, cups, tablecloths, table decorations, napkins and candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason 2000 party goods are hitting stores now is that
consumer feedback says `I want the goods now' _ earlier than ever _
so I can start celebrating,'' according to Kathi Mishek, a Hallmark
spokeswoman in Kansas City, Missouri. Research indicates that
people will be throwing a variety of parties celebrating the
millennium before the end of '99 and into January 2000, she added.
``Consumers tell us they they will be going to more parties outside
the home this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have jumped on the 2000 bandwagon, and an amazing
variety of products have popped up, Mishek said. ``Consumers are
definitely going to celebrate during the holidays with
2000-designated products.'' They may mix and match paper goods or
china with dishes and other items already in their collections to
keep the budget in check. There are plenty of options in both
colors and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Paper goods tend to follow the season's fashion colors more
closely than china, because they can be manufactured more quickly,
noted Mishek.
</P>
<P>
   ``All color trends this year have indicated that people want
jewel tones _ purples, red, greens, sapphire blue _ really intense
and cozy colors.'' So Hallmark's 2000 party-collection design
features a bright foil-line blue. Since character marketing is also
trendy, Hallmark is offering ``Mil-Looney-Um'' 2000 paper goods
featuring Looney Tunes characters.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, American Greetings has created a millennial color
palette that includes white, silver and purple in its Celebrate
2000 line of paper products (including party goods, ribbons,
candles, balloons, gift bags, etc.), said Deanna Heuschel, the
company's event planner in Cleveland. ``The color purple is making
a comeback as a hot, new color in hues such as eggplant, amethyst
and lilac. Purple is a New Age color, has a religious background
and is rich, regal and historical; kings and queens wore it.''
</P>
<P>
   Heuschel advises consumers to begin planning their millennium
parties early and to select a theme, such as a time-capsule party
or a costume-party celebration of the old and new.
</P>
<P>
   Olga Krasnoff, senior interior designer at Macy's Mission Valley
interior design studio in San Diego, thinks people are already
looking at and buying millennial items. ``People are already
thinking about how they are going to entertain for New Year's and
about the type of party they are going to give.'' Create a mood for
a successful party, she advised.
</P>
<P>
   She believes three major entertaining and interior-design
directions that are in vogue will continue into the year 2000 _
drawing-room glamour, country charisma and Asian contemporary _
will influence party decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever they decide, said Krasnoff, ``a lot of people will
be staying at home and entertaining at home. There's already a
resurgence of entertaining at home _ and enjoying the home and
family and friends more.''
</P>
<P>
   Krasnoff suggests making some favorite food and buying the rest.
``I do a combination, as I have to make certain traditional cookies
that my family remembers from childhood. Tradition, memories and
nostalgia are extremely important to me.''

   LONDON _ Mannesmann AG, Germany's fast-growing engineering and
telecommunications group, confirmed Tuesday that it was negotiating
with Orange PLC, Britain's third-largest mobile phone operator,
raising speculation about yet one more takeover in a fevered rush
to seize chunks of Europe's rich and expanding mobile phone market.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Mannesmann came one day after France Telecom
SA began its own cross-border foray, agreeing to pay $8 billion for
control of Germany's third-largest mobile phone carrier, E-Plus _ a
move widely viewed as a declaration of war on its former partner,
Deutsche Telekom AG.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the fall-out from Mannesmann's move, first reported in
The Wall Street Journal, that telecommunications industry analysts
immediately began speculating about a likely move by Vodafone
Airtouch PLC., the world's biggest mobile phone operator, against
Mannesmann, in which it holds a minority stake, to insure a
presence in continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A possible Mannesmann-Orange deal also threatened to encircle
Deutsche Telekom, which bought Britain's fourth largest mobile
operator, One-2-One, last August. It has said it will seek to
expand further in a market, initially driven by deregulation, where
the likely targets for acquisition are dwindling as big players
gobble up smaller ones, like Orange. Other former state monopolies,
including British Telecommunications PLC and Telecom Italia SpA _
which has Europe's largest mobile business _ have also said they
will expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the name of the game is: who moves faster than
the competition survives,'' said Christian Kern, European
communications analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``Speed of
consolidation is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann declined to say whether it would make a formal bid
for Orange, which is 44.8 per cent owned by Hutchison Whampoa, a
Hong Kong-based conglomerate that is reportedly eager to reduce its
stake in the British operator. In a statement, Mannesmann said the
current talks ``may or may not'' lead to a bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of fit, it's perfect for Mannesmann,'' said Kern.
``But it irritates Vodafone and it may trigger a hostile bid by
Vodafone for Mannesmann. If Vodafone does that, it will have to
move quickly'' to forestall Mannesmann's own expected bid for
Orange, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vodaphone declined to comment on the Mannesmann-Orange talks.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the war for control of mobile phone networks is not just
a booming industry but the hope of even greater pickings from
technology that will provide a new generation of mobile phones with
much faster access to the Internet and electronic commerce. While
mobile phone standards in the United States are fragmented,
European systems share a common digital standard, making it easier
for companies to integrate and cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   Mannesmann's talks with Orange were seen by analysts as a major
step in the German company's effort to build a pan-European
presence straddling the continent's biggest markets. Mannesmann
already controls such major operators as Mobilfunk in Germany, the
country's biggest, and Italy's No. 2 network, Omnitel SpA. It also
has a minority stake in the French SFR network. By adding Orange,
it would have a strong presence in the three leading European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, by contrast, has a wide spread of European networks,
from , but analysts said that presence would be no match for
Mannesmann's presence in bigger markets.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement sent Orange shares up 3.7 percent to
1,388 pence or $23.18, which helped lift Britain's sluggish stock
market as investors anticipating further deals bought other
telecommunications stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Mannesmann's stock fell 1.3 percent to 152.70 euros or about
$163.40, largely because of speculation that the likely price for
Orange _ estimated by analysts at upwards of $30 billion _ implied
a higher price-per-subscriber than Deutsche Telekom paid for One 2
One in its $11.1 billion deal last August.
</P>
<P>
   There was little talk Tuesday of a U.S. company moving into the
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment the U.S. is trying to get its act together and
Europe is trying to get its act together,'' said Kern at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``It's like a game of poker. Everyone is trying to
get the best cards before they play.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jeanswear designers are asking themselves: After
Gucci, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   Stores are flooded with interpretations of Gucci's '70s-inspired
jeans after the look was tested and well received for spring and
summer. After several years of oversized, unisex looks, the market
was primed for Gucci's hippie-chic fantasy, jeanswear designers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing out there right now comes close to the Gucci trend,''
said Carla Slocum, vice president, design, for Lizwear, which
offers subtle Gucci interpretations for fall. ``It has an emotional
appeal, and works for everybody, from older customers who remember
the look the first time, to young people who see it as brand new.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Fiene, chief executive officer of XOXO jeans, said the
Gucci trend represented a larger fashion direction that is
revolutionizing denim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeans had become boring and dull in recent years, but Tom Ford
and other upper-tier designers brought back fun and fashion from
the '70s and '80s and made denim sexy again,'' Fiene said.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO's seven-month-old jeans line is 70 percent fashion and only
30 percent basics, with a variety of Gucci-inspired styles.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Gucci, designer collections _ often with their own denim
groups _ can be a wellspring of inspiration today. Helmut Lang's
dirty washes and knee pads; Versace's embellished capris; Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana's prints and fringe; Martin Margiela's patchworks; John
Galliano's western pony prints and whip stitching have all made
their mark on denim this year.
</P>
<P>
   Designer power is fueled by widespread media attention. A host
of new fashion magazines and TV programs has raised consumer
awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten-year-olds know Prada, Gucci _ all the big names,'' said
Lisa Engelman, national sales manager for the New York-based
jeanswear firm Paris Blues. ``More magazines and in-your-face TV
shows are making teens much more savvy than 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the rising influence of designers, the primary muses
of denim remain streetwear, pop culture and especially music.
Indeed, jeanswear designers say, many kids thrive on setting trends
of their own, rather than slavishly following runway looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any high fashion image becomes dated quickly with kids,
especially when their mothers start picking up on it,'' said Allan
Kemp, design director at Silver Jeans, a firm based in Winnipeg,
Manitoba. ``A big trend now is no-trend, as some kids reject
contrived designer looks in favor of creating their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately ``anti-label,'' with little advertising, Silver
promotes kids' quest for individualism, offering a variety of
inseams and arm seam lengths for different body types. Jeans are
presented without models, so consumers can imagine themselves in
them, rather than conforming to an image.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp said he researches European music and pop culture trends
twice a year in emerging music scenes, such as Manchester, England,
rather than traditional fashion hubs like London.
</P>
<P>
   The wide variety of denim trends now reflects a new diversity in
musical styles from techno to ethnic influences, he said. For
spring 2000, Silver will experiment with East Indian tunics,
crocheted and mirrored looks and Japanese prints, along with
recycled used jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Like Silver, New York-based Zana-Di takes an individual
approach, avoiding anything that smacks of mass production that can
alienate kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're careful to have no two patches in the same place, no two
distressed areas in the same place,'' said Lars Klingstedt, head
designer. For spring, the line will add experimental trends taken
directly from the street, such as paint splatters, tie-dye washes
and ombre shading.
</P>
<P>
   Streetwear, once the domain of the urban scene in the U.S., is
becoming distinctly more global, with cities such as Tokyo, London
and Prague rising as trend centers in music and fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is searching for new direction for the millennium,
and traveling more,'' said Alain Audet, sales and marketing manager
for Parasuco, a Montreal-based jeans line. ``A strong Asian
influence is coming from small Japanese designers and the
technological advances in Japanese mills. Dragon embroideries,
based on the year 2000, Japan's year of the dragon, will also be
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   With hip-hop becoming more mainstream, new ethnic musical
influences abound, trickling down to fashion. Latin music by hot
performers such as Ricky Martin is taking jeans in a sexier
direction, said Audet, who will add more fitted silhouettes and
sheer layering to the spring line.
</P>
<P>
   Along with distressed denim, Parasuco will experiment with
selvage on stretch denim, rubber logo treatments and asymmetrical
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than silhouettes, the biggest new trend frontier is in
treatments, washes and finishes, along with details such as
embellishment and mixed fabrics. Boot cuts and flares that broke
new ground a few years ago have become standard shapes for
designers to play with.
</P>
<P>
   And while capris and shorter lengths will carry over somewhat
into fall, they will serve to make longer silhouettes look fresh
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flares, cargos and bells are basics now,'' said Michelle
Clark, trends manager at the Lee Co. For 2000, Lee will focus on
``smart'' fabrics, with technical, functional or performance
textiles often influenced by activewear. Utility features, such as
attached bags, should add a new dimension to jeans, said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is aiming for a personalized look, with home-crafted, worn
effects and ``busted denim,'' with stress points influenced by the
wearer. While the interest is in distressed light denim now, dark
denim is still important for fall, said Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Variety seems to be the only constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, denim floors were boring, and everything looked the
same,'' said Paris Blues' Lisa Engelman. ``Now everybody's
experimenting with washes and alternative fabrics, and there's
something for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The next trend flash for Paris Blues should be slimmer legs,
with fabrics and ruffles added below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Gucci-inspired jeans end up on the sale rack, they
have had a positive impact on retailers by making once-cautious
buyers more receptive to new trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer have to sell buyers on a trend,'' said Zana-Di's
Klingstedt. ``They used to be afraid of newness. Now they demand
it.'' &QL;

<P>
   Manuel Vitorino Pinheiro dos Santos had just shot four
white-lipped peccaries when he heard it. The horrible
soul-wrenching humanlike cry came from a tangle of vines about 50
meters away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment you hear it, all your hairs stand on end,'' Dos
Santos says.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped the peccary he was carving up, grabbed the lianas he
had cut to lash the carcass to his back and sprinted in the
opposite direction, toward the nearby river.
</P>
<P>
   Dos Santos waited in the water for an hour or so until he felt
safe going back for his peccaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had a knife and no shells and didn't want to face the
creature,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   No one _ not Dos Santos or any of the other villagers of Barra
do Sao Manuel, a tiny settlement on the banks of the Tapajos River
deep in the Brazilian Amazon, or anyone else in the vast rain
forest _ relishes facing it.
</P>
<P>
   Covered in long red hair, standing more than six feet on its
hind legs, emanating a stench so foul it disorients everyone in
sniffing distance, the mapinguari is reputed to be the most
terrifying denizen of the rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   It is said to avoid water, to wander with roving herds of
white-lipped peccaries and to protect them, to forage at night, to
twist huge palm trees apart with its massive claws so it can feast
on the soft insides, to have backward-turned feet, and to be
generally immune to bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The mapinguari is also said to be another Bigfoot, a figment of
the imagination of people like Dos Santos _ and of a prominent
scientist named David C. Oren, whose relentless quest to find one
is growing as legendary as the beast itself.
</P>
<P>
   It is to Oren and his mapinguari-seeking swat team that Dos
Santos relates his encounter some two months later, standing in the
same spot in the forest near Barra.
</P>
<P>
   Oren, an ornithologist and expert on Amazonian biodiversity at
the Emilio Goeldi Museum in Belem, listens intently.
</P>
<P>
   Oren did not always believe in mapinguaris. When he first came
to study birds in Brazil more than 20 years ago, to do research for
his doctorate at Harvard, Oren heard about the creature.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly classified it along with other Amazonian myths: the
activities of the boto dolphin, blamed for all unwanted pregnancies
because it assumes the form of a handsome man, penetrates village
parties and lures young women into the floral night; or the
transformation of the curupira, a protean creature that appears as
an animal or a hairy, ugly man and plagues hunters.
</P>
<P>
   But about 15 years ago, after repeatedly hearing mapinguari
tales, Oren changed his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking with a friend and he said, `David, you are the
biologist, I am the historian. What could this creature be?'' Oren
recalls. ``And it was when I first listened carefully to one of the
stories that the light went on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Oren hypothesized that mapinguaris were indeed real and
that they were none other than the last extant giant ground sloths,
Pleistocene survivors lying low in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   These enormous creatures _ relatives of today's two- and
three-toed arboreal sloths but with higher metabolisms and thus
greater speed _ emerged about 30 million years ago and roamed the
Americas, the Caribbean and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   They were red-haired vegetarians with large claws that curled
under and faced backward when they walked on all fours, they could
stand on their hind feet like people, and some species had dermal
ossicles, bony plates that made their skin tough.
</P>
<P>
   In paleontological time frames, the giant ground sloths had just
disappeared yesterday. Overhunting or climate change or some
combination thereof had wiped them out sometime between 5,000 and
10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed eminently possible to Oren that the greatest expanse
of rain forest in the world could still harbor such beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Stalking the wild-eyed mapinguari in that green hell is not the
easiest way to spend one's time. The terrain is infested with,
among other things, ticks, spiders, malarial mosquitoes whiteflies
(which carry leishmaniasis) and the dreaded botfly. Oren has had
his share of all of the above, but particularly the last one.
</P>
<P>
   His left heel has a dime-size scar surrounded by a web of what
look like varicose veins. A botfly larva _ which probably entered
the skin through a mosquito bite hole _ foraged around his foot for
weeks, growing into an inch-long fly, eating out a new circulatory
system and never staying still or putting up a breathing siphon as
botfly larvae typically do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the Jacques Cousteau of botflies,'' Oren says. ``It had
an Aqua-Lung.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond braving the bugs and many other hardships, Oren and the
team must cover as much ground as possible _ sometimes walking as
many as nine hours a day _ trying to find tracks or traces of
recent peccary passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like looking for a needle in a haystack without a
magnet,'' says Oren as he sits in the dark of the camp.
</P>
<P>
   This trip to Barra is Oren's sixth mapinguari foray since 1994,
when he began looking in the field for hard evidence of the
creature. He has received grants for this work from the Brazilian
Boticario Foundation and a small film company. The rest of the time
he relies primarily on his Goeldi salary, which includes the many
research grants he gets from such places as the MacArthur
Foundation and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the evidence Oren has gathered on these hunts _ a clump
of hair, several fecal samples from different areas and some casts
of footprints _ has led to naught. The hair proved to be that of an
agouti, the fecal samples did not reveal any DNA aside from, in one
case, that of a giant anteater, and the casts don't hold any
scientific weight, as Oren readily points out, ``because they can
be easily faked.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of tangibles is hard to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a kook,'' mutters one ornithologist, who doesn't want to
give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are willing to accept more on faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a bankrupt world it would be if you refused to believe
things existed until you actually had seen a specimen in a museum.
I mean, there are lots of things we are prepared to believe exist
without having seen them,'' says Wildlife Conservation Society
biologist Kent Redford, citing subatomic particles and Madeleine
Albright's accounts of NATO air strikes in Kosovo. ``Why not a
mapinguari?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he is being hoaxed. I think he is being
courageous,'' says Nigel J.H. Smith, a geographer at the University
of Florida in Gainesville who has traveled widely in the Amazon
collecting folktales and legends _ including those of the
mapinguari _ which he describes in his book ``The Enchanted Amazon
Rain Forest: Stories From a Vanishing World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to put local knowledge in a shrine,'' he says.
``But there's a lot of natural history knowledge that scientists
are too dismissive of.''

<P>
   Striding into his office at Aero Vironment Inc. in Monrovia,
Calif., on a June afternoon, a slightly rumpled-looking Paul
MacCready juggles an armful of folders with a bag of take-out Thai
and apologizes for his tardiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up until 3 a.m. the past few nights working on some
projects,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of projects? The gray-haired 74-year-old company
founder hesitates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are patent and proprietary concerns ...'' he says. But
then his enthusiasm gets the better of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may have found a way to make exercise addicting,'' he says,
launching into an energetic description of his ``Micro Gym,'' a
pocket-size exercise machine with a pulse meter that vibrates when
the user reaches an optimal heart rate. ``Just enough exercise to
get that rush of endorphins that will make you want to do it
again,'' MacCready says. ``Wouldn't that be a great service to
humanity?''
</P>
<P>
   From anyone else, the idea might seem pure fantasy. But
MacCready has a knack for making the fantastic real.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, the mild-mannered aeronautical engineer designed the
first plane powered solely by human effort _ a furiously pedaling
pilot _ capable of sustained flight.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Gossamer Condor, the flying machine now sits
alongside the Wright Brothers' Flyer and Charles Lindbergh's Spirit
of St. Louis in the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the Gossamer Albatross, a design offspring of
the Condor, was pedaled 22.25 miles across the English Channel,
cementing MacCready's place in aviation history. Soon after,
MacCready was named Engineer of the Century by the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, MacCready was just getting started. In 1980, he
designed the Solar Challenger, the world's first piloted
sun-powered airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, he set jaws dropping by creating a
computer-controlled, wing-flapping replica of a pterodactyl for the
Smithsonian's film ``On the Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1987, back on Earth, a team of six drivers won a
1,867-mile Australian road race with his Sunraycer, an electric
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's not afraid of making mistakes or dealing with
resistance,'' says Ray Morgan, director of Aero Vironment's Design
Development Center, who has worked with MacCready since the 1970s.
``He's known for saying, 'I bet if we try it this way ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the man called the ``father of human-powered flight''
aims to soar ever higher. Working with NASA support, his team at
Aero Vironment is building a new generation of lightweight
solar-powered planes designed to ascend high into the stratosphere
and then remain there for several months.
</P>
<P>
   A craft called Helios could monitor atmospheric conditions and
perhaps serve as a communications station for relaying high
bandwidth video and teleconferencing signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Aero Vironment team is also busy designing micro air
vehicles, palm-size battery-powered crafts that look like toys but
are equipped with tiny video cameras that could provide real-time
reconnaissance for soldiers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas are always germinating,'' MacCready says. His office is
lined with file cabinets labeled ``Active'' and ``Less Active,''
the latter for projects _ like a hamster-powered miniplane _ that
he hasn't yet perfected but won't give up on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dogged,'' he admits. ``Irrationally persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for his most noted achievements, the Gossamer
projects, came in the early 1970s, when a relative had to default
on a business loan, and MacCready, who had co-signed the note,
suddenly found himself owing $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   While searching for a way to pay it back, he recalled an
18-year-old challenge that had been offered by British
industrialist Henry Kremer to the first person who could complete a
1.15-mile-long figure-eight course using human-powered flight. The
prize? $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the conventional ways to achieve human flight had been
tried,'' MacCready says. ``People were stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   A solution came to MacCready as he was driving cross-country on
vacation with his wife, Judy, and their three sons, Parker, Tyler
and Marshall, and started watching the hawks and turkey vultures
soaring in circles overhead, taking advantage of updrafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for fun I figured a way to calculate a bird's flight
speed and its turning radius,'' he says. ``All you needed to do was
to estimate its banking angle, then use your wristwatch to time how
long it takes it to make a 360-degree turn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the great `Aha!' moment hit,'' he says. ``I realized that
as long as you kept the weight the same, you could take an airplane
and let the wings get bigger and bigger. The flight speed would
decrease, but so would the power needed to make the plane fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in California, MacCready and his colleagues at Aero
Vironment set out to prove that theory with the Gossamer Condor.
They designed 96-foot wings of aluminum tubing, corrugated
cardboard and balsa wood, made them rigid by bracing them with
piano wire, and then covered them with a thin layer of Mylar.
MacCready drafted his sons, then teen-agers, as test pilots.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the Condor's weight down, MacCready insisted on ``no
frills, no safety margins.'' Indeed, when a couple of pieces fell
off the Condor during a test run and the plane didn't crash,
MacCready decided to scratch the parts from the design. Ultimately,
the Condor met Kremer's challenge _ and made aviation history _ at
a mere 55 pounds, not counting the 137-pound pilot, Bryan Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we understood the large-and-light concept,'' MacCready
says, ``it was just a matter of doing the grunt work.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, MacCready also devotes much of his time to public
speaking. Addressing schoolchildren, he encourages them to ``search
for the answers yourself, and trust no one's conclusions but your
own.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are always more projects. He has been studying bird
flight with soaring enthusiasts in an organization called TWITT
(The Wing Is The Thing) and working on a plan to get a real
bird's-eye view of Earth by placing a two-gram video camera on the
head of a pigeon or a parrot.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the Owl, MacCready's design for an affordable
two-seater plane. One day he hopes commuters will abandon their
cars and emulate bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We humans are grubbing around the surface, but at some point
in their lives, something like three-quarters of all the insects in
the world fly,'' he says. ``It's a much more efficient way of
covering territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Aero Vironment's Martyn Cowley won't be surprised if it
eventually takes off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Paul,'' he says with a laugh. ``We're busy working on
the old cutting-edge stuff here. Paul's way out there, working on
the things that will be cutting edge 10 years from now.''

DuBose was given no shot at surviving as Alabama's head coach. But
since then, Alabama has upset Arkansas and Florida and is 5-1 going
into Saturday's game with No. 7 Tennessee. The game will be played
in Tuscaloosa, the first time the Vols have played on Alabama's

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SOBEL-ISRAEL-THEATER (Jerusalem) _ The Israeli theater writer,
Yehoshua Sobol, 60, a former director of the Haifa Theater, looks
back on an earlier era of theater in Israel. His plays includes ``A
Palestinian Girl'' and ``The Jerusalem Syndrome.'' Today he is
concerned that a depressing commercialism has overtaken the Israeli
theatrical scene. By Deborah Sontag. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JOAN-OF-ARC-VIDEO (Undated) _ No particular reason comes to
mind, but on film and video there is a resurgent call for the
French peasant girl with, in the words of one critic in 1929, ``a
face supernaturally illumined by faith, with lips parched through
excitement and with a pair of eyes that see Heaven opening before
them.'' This is how he described the uplifted visage of Maria
(sometimes called Renee) Falconetti as Joan of Arc in Carl Theodor
Dreyer's silent classic ``The Passion of Saint Joan,'' released in
1928 and by far the most interesting of three titles about the Maid
of Orleans to be seen this fall. ``The Passion'' is to be released
on tape by Home Vision and on a fine DVD from the Criterion
Collection on Nov. 9. By Peter M. Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAME-EDNA-THEATER (New York) _ Dame Edna Everage, the Melbourne
housewife, social anthropologist, talk-show host, investigative
journalist and self-styled megastar, has clearly outgrown the
control of her mentor, Barry Humphries. He's the Australian wizard
who, as a young actor and writer, created the character for a
Melbourne revue in 1955 and has been at her side ever since. The
extent to which this gloriously opinionated, mauve-haired golem has
taken over Humphries is now nakedly apparent in ``Dame Edna: The
Royal Tour'' at the Booth Theater on Broadway. By Vincent Canby.

</P>
<P>
   HEART-ART-THEATER (Undated) _ A look at Michael Weller's new
satirical comedy, ``The Heart of Art.'' Weller, 57, best known for
his 1970s plays ``Moonchildren'' and ``Loose Ends'' and his
screenplays for ``Hair'' and ``Ragtime,'' had three other works
produced in the 1970s and '80s by Joseph Papp, the short,
mercurial, cigar-smoking impresario of the Public Theater, a home
to challenging drama and provocative playwrights. By Mervyn
Rothstein.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTALVO-DANCE (Creteil, France) _ With close to 20 years'
experience as a choreographer, Jose Montalvo is hardly a novice,
yet for a long time this tall simpatico Frenchman of Spanish
descent was known _ when he was known at all _ as a peripheral
artist more interested in experimentation than fame. Then he
created ``Paradis,'' a delightful multimedia, multicultural collage
of a work. After that, everything was different. Since its premiere
in March 1997, ``Paradis'' has been performed almost 200 times _
that's about once every four days _ in France and on tour in
Europe, the Far East and Latin America. Now the 60-minute work is
traveling to New York for eight performances at the Joyce Theater
starting on Tuesday as part of the New Europe '99 Festival. By Alan
Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TENORS-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a generation Luciano Pavarotti
thrilled and amused us; Placido Domingo evoked undying admiration.
Jose Carreras gave us early hope, but unwise career decisions,
choices made long before a serious and unrelated illness, left him
with fame, money and a ravaged voice. Opera in general sharpens our
nerve endings, sometimes to the point of hysteria. Tenors, for
better and worse, drive us crazy. We need a couple of big ones. So
audiences and a music business operatives are now taking a hard
look at three new tenors, Roberto Alagna of Italy, Marcelo Alvarez
and, most recently, Jose Cura, both from Argentina. By Bernard
Holland. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIC-ORGAN (Paris) _ Anyone familiar with organ music would
recognize the name. Aristide Cavaille-Coll (pronounced
cah-vah-yea-COLL) developed the ``symphonic'' organ in France and
died 100 years ago this month. The instruments he left behind could
fill vast spaces with sound as varied and powerful as a symphony
orchestra's, and they inspired composers from Cesar Franck, Camille
Saint-Saens, Charles-Marie Widor and Louis Vierne to Marcel Dupre
and Olivier Messiaen to play and write a dramatically expressive
kind of music for the instrument that pipe organs had never been
capable of before. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EAST-RIVER-PIPE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Since 1991, F.M. Cornog in an
upstairs room of his Summit N.J., home, has been writing songs,
recording them and releasing them under the moniker East River
Pipe. Every day, instead of going to work in an office or factory,
or, for that matter, a recording studio _ he goes to this room and
fiddles around and lays down ideas until he has enough material for
an album. East River Pipe's fourth and most recent album, ``The
Gasoline Age,'' released on the independent label Merge, is a
dreamy, Springsteenish meditation on suburban car culture. By Karen
Schoemer. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-MUSEUM (Jerusalem) _ It is never easy building a major
art museum from scratch, but Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of
Jerusalem, has good reason to crow. In less than four decades, he
has seen the Israel Museum evolve from an improbable fantasy into a
world-class institution whose collection now consists of some
500,000 objects _ roughly five times as many as the National
Gallery of Art in Washington. By Deborah Solomon. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POTTERS (Undated) _ Over the last 400 years, the
innovative potters of Puebla, a town east of Mexico City, have done
what potters do best: they have taken dazzling designs from the
ceramics of other cultures and reproduced them. Then, to mark them
as Mexican, they have added images of a cactus here, a parrot
there. The story of how Spanish potters succeeded in transforming
the traditional terra cotta ceramics in Mexico is the little known
story that is revealed in ``Talavera Poblana: Four Centuries of a
Mexican Ceramic Tradition,'' an exhibition at the Americas Society
Art Gallery, in Manhattan, through Dec. 12. By Rita Reif.
</P>
<P>
   SENSATION-ART (New York) _ New art has rarely had as many
reluctant champions as ``Sensation,'' the exhibition of work by
young English artists from the collection of Charles Saatchi, the
English advertising executive, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
People both inside and outside the art world have been defending to
the death the exhibition's right to be seen in a public museum,
while turning up their noses at the art it contains or dismissing
it wholesale. By Roberta Smith.
</P>
<P>
   TSCHUMI-ARCH (New York) _ Alfred Lerner Hall, the new student
center at Columbia University, will plunge some baby boomer alumni
into a cool nostalgic bath. The architect, Bernard Tschumi, has
long made a touchstone of the events of 68: the student uprisings
that for many epitomize the turmoil of the 1960s. Columbia
University's architecture school was one of the epicenters of those
events. Today, the school is run by Tschumi, an architect whose
sensibility was formed by the Paris edition of those
demonstrations. No practicing architect of his generation has
identified himself more closely with the anarchic energies of that
era. By Herbert Muschamp.

<P>
   Marketers of products as disparate as cosmetics sold online and
jams sold in supermarkets are naming or changing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Reflect.com, the Internet company formed last month by Procter &AMP;
Gamble, selected Rapp Collins Worldwide in New York to create
campaigns aimed at driving traffic to its Web site
(www.reflect.com), which will offer customized women's beauty
products and services. Billings have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp Collins, part of Omnicom Group, will work with Critical
Mass Inc. in Calgary, Alberta, the interactive agency of record for
Reflect.com. Rapp Collins, which has worked on projects for P&AMP;G,
has collaborated with Critical Mass on assignments for
Mercedes-Benz USA; last week, Rapp Collins acquired 50 percent of
Critical Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a really interesting partnership between Critical
Mass, the leader in understanding how to use the Internet to
develop one-to-one E-commerce, and Rapp Collins, with its skills in
relationship marketing and data mining,'' said Nathan Estruth, a
marketing director at P&AMP;G in Cincinnati who is co-leader of the
Reflect.com launch team.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns will appear in both off-line and online media.
There will be print ads in magazines like Cosmopolitan,
Entertainment Weekly, Jane, Martha Stewart Living and Vogue; direct
marketing efforts like mailing consumers foldable ``cubes''
inscribed with beauty imagery, and so-called viral marketing in the
form of e-mail postcards consumers can send to friends. The
campaigns carry the themes ``Create your own beauty'' and ``It's
the image of you.''
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G has teamed up to start Reflect.com, which will be based in
San Francisco rather than Cincinnati, with two venture capital
funds, Institutional Venture Partners and its successor, Redpoint
Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   In an agency change, the J.M. Smucker Co., which sells jams,
jellies, fruit spreads and other products under brand names like
Smucker's, Goober and Magic Shell, is parting ways with Leo Burnett
U.S.A. in Chicago after five years. Competitive Media Reporting, a
unit of VNU N.V. that tracks ad spending, estimated spending last
year at $10 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Smucker and Burnett, part of the Leo Burnett Co. unit of Leo
Group, described the parting as amicable and a mutual decision.
``We and the agency believe it is in our collective best interest
to seek out a new marketing partner to help us achieve our future
business objectives,'' said Tim Smucker, the company's chairman in
Orrville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Dempsey, a spokeswoman for Smucker, said the company
would begin a review to select a new agency but declined to
identify participants or give a timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to other changes, two banks are shifting accounts in
decisions that affect three agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet Boston Corp., the company formed after the acquisition
of BankBoston by Fleet Financial Group, named Hill, Holliday,
Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, a unit of the Interpublic Group of
Companies, as agency of record on its brand, retail and corporate
advertising assignments, with billings estimated at $50 million.
Arnold Communications in Boston, a unit of Snyder Communications,
had handled those tasks for Fleet Financial, while Hill, Holliday
had been the agency for BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, we were a little concerned about that,'' said Karen
Kaplan, executive vice president at Hill, Holliday, who will
oversee the account, ``but over the course of the last seven
months, as we worked on a branding project, we won out.'' Three
Arnold sibling shops will continue handling direct marketing,
design and sports marketing assignments for Fleet Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold quickly rebounded in the banking category, landing the
account of the PNC Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh, with billings
estimated at $25 million. PNC is leaving the Southfield, Mich.,
office of Doner, which had been its agency for only six months, for
the Arnold Washington office and siblings that include Circle.com,
which will handle interactive work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had started a brand project earlier this summer with
Arnold,'' said Denise Johnson, chief marketing officer at PNC, who
formerly worked at Arnold, ``which led us to feel maybe we should
put all our business at one agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Doner, meanwhile, landed two accounts with combined billings
estimated at $25 million, potentially compensating for the PNC
loss. One, awarded to Doner Canada in Toronto, was the account of
Blockbuster Entertainment Canada, part of Viacom Inc., with
billings estimated at $10 million. The Doner Southfield office
handles the Blockbuster account in the United States. The Canadian
account had been handled by Bensimon Byrne D'Arcy in Toronto, part
of the D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications unit of
MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   And the Doner office in Newport Beach, Calif., was awarded the
first account of Intellifutures in Aliso Ciejo, Calif., a company
that plans to introduce an online futures and options trading
service in the first quarter of 2000. Those billings were estimated
at $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Celebrity Cruises in Miami, part of Royal Caribbean
Cruises Ltd., awarded its domestic account, with billings estimated
at $35 million, to Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP;
Saatchi P.L.C. Harris Drury Cohen in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the
Celebrity agency for two years, resigned in August.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a two-month review that had been
narrowed to Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi and three other finalists: Bozell in
New York, part of True North Communications; Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Worldwide in New York, part of WPP Group P.L.C., and West Wayne in
Atlanta, which will continue to handle the collateral domestic
advertising duties for Celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber Levett Koenig Farese Babcock in New York, which has an
alliance with Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, will handle the direct marketing
duties.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PENN YAN, N.Y. _ As a gusty wind bit the air and the autumn
colors started to fade around the Finger Lakes, the season's last
loads of freshly harvested buckwheat were arriving at Birkett
Mills, the 200-year-old reason this is the heart of America's
buckwheat country.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwheat, the foundation of sturdy pancakes and delicate blini,
does extremely well with little help from friendly conditions like
rich soil, long growing seasons and moderate temperatures. And so
it positively thrives on about 20,000 acres around Penn Yan, right
alongside the wine grapes that have made the region's fame. There
are some 300 buckwheat farms here, scattered from the edge of the
Adirondacks, north of Syracuse, throughout the Finger Lakes and
west as far as Buffalo on Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota may grow more buckwheat, but nearly of all that is
shipped to Japan to make the silky noodles called soba. New York's
buckwheat stays home.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, some chefs, especially in Manhattan, have begun to
appreciate the robust, nutty flavor it can add to a wide range of
dishes. As the weather cools, Italian restaurants like Felidia on
the East Side feature pizzoccheri, a casserole made with flat
Italian buckwheat noodles. The new Russian Tea Room buys Birkett
Mills' buckwheat flour for blini. Others are experimenting with
kasha, the roasted buckwheat kernels. Marco Polo, a catering shop
near Union Square, adds it to a hearty soup. At Avenue on the Upper
West Side, it bolsters a potato puree. At Thalia, a new midtown
restaurant, puffy buckwheat beignets are served with caviar and
creme fraiche.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Otsuka, Thalia's chef, said he came up with the
buckwheat beignets because he was familiar with the grain: ``I grew
up eating soba. On my palate, the almost tannic nature of the
buckwheat balances the saltiness of the caviar and tames the
richness of the creme fraiche.''
</P>
<P>
   As familiar as buckwheat might seem, it's something of a
surprise in the field. This time of year, the plant itself is a
scraggly, wild looking thing that hardly seems worth harvesting. In
fact, buckwheat has nothing to do with wheat at all. Botanically,
it's a fruit related to rhubarb, and the grain it produces is
actually the seed of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The crop matures in a mere 70 days, and around here it is not
sown until the Fourth of July, often just after fresh peas have
been harvested from the same fields. Fields of buckwheat burst into
white flowers in August. By mid-September, the heart-shaped bottom
leaves have shriveled and the seeds start to fall, indicating that
it's harvest time.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there had been a couple of frosts by the time the
bulky combines finished their rumbling back and forth, stripping
the buckwheat fields of the spiky crop. They cut the two-foot-high
plants down to the brown earth, gathering the seeds in their
hoppers.
</P>
<P>
   All of this harvest was bound for Birkett Mills, a cream-colored
complex of wood and brick that sits beside a stream. Originally,
the fast-running waterway _ actually, the Keuka Lake Outlet _
powered the mill. Birkett Mills is now the world's largest
buckwheat processor.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Schuck, the manager, stood at the back of a farmer's truck
unloading its buckwheat through a grate into the mill. In his hands
the blackish seeds looked to be about the size of apple pips.
</P>
<P>
   George DeGlopper, a second-generation buckwheat farmer whose
family originally came from the Netherlands in the early 19th
century, grows about 45 acres of buckwheat on Grand Island, between
Buffalo and Niagara Falls, and said the allure of the crop was its
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works in rotation with my wheat and hay,'' he said. ``I
don't have too many options, in this climate. You don't have to tie
up a lot of money to grow buckwheat, and the price has held up so
it's something you can make a little money on.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers frequently plant buckwheat as a secondary cover crop to
keep the weeds down, or to make use of land that is too poor to
grow anything else. Because it grows best without any fertilizer,
many organic farmers plant it.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, buckwheat has become an important crop because
farmers can sell it to Birkett Mills, which was built as a
gristmill in the late 18th century but has specialized in buckwheat
for more than 100 years. In the past 20 years, the price of
buckwheat has doubled, to $11 for 100 pounds, said Cliff Orr, an
owner of the mill. With relatively little effort a farmer can gross
about $1,000 on 10 acres of buckwheat.
</P>
<P>
   The mill was destroyed by fire in 1824 and was immediately
rebuilt a little farther downstream. After the Civil War, when the
great industrial rolling mills were established in the Midwest,
local flour mills began to close. Birkett Mills kept going by
specializing in buckwheat.
</P>
<P>
   After the buckwheat reaches the mill, it passes through a
succession of chutes, funnels and boxlike machines, some wood and
some metal, on three floors as the unhulled seeds are first cleaned
of debris, then husked, graded and sifted. To make flour, the
buckwheat is ground fine. For kasha, it is roasted. A floury film
covers everything in the creaky, constantly vibrating building.
</P>
<P>
   The mill's buckwheat flour won a prize at the Paris Exposition
of 1887, but today its biggest seller is Wolff's Kasha, a brand
that originated in Paterson, N.J. Birkett Mills acquired it in
1948, and now it is the only brand of kasha found in many stores.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, buckwheat is not a staple on menus here where it's grown.
Only a couple of places still make buckwheat pancakes for
breakfast, and occasionally, use it in baking.
</P>
<P>
   The region's first buckwheat farmers were the Dutch settlers
moving up from the Hudson Valley in the 18th century. It got its
name from the Dutch boek-weit, meaning beech wheat, because the
little kernels resemble beechnuts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Buckwheat is thought to have originated in Central Asia, Tibet
perhaps, and has always grown in cold, damp places like parts of
Russia, Poland, Finland, northern Japan, Brittany and the mountains
of northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, buckwheat is outpaced by wheat, rice, corn, barley,
millet, oats and rye, but its sales are continually inching up, 2
to 3 percent a year. One reason may be a growing awareness of its
health benefits, Orr, the mill owner, said. Buckwheat's effects on
diabetes and atherosclerosis are being analyzed in several studies.
Because buckwheat has no gluten, it is excellent for people with a
problem digesting this protein.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of gluten, though, means that buckwheat flour, which
has a slightly gritty texture, has limited use in baking. Leavened
buckwheat baked goods, like cakes, pancakes, breads and muffins,
also require some form of wheat flour, or they become doorstops.
The batter or dough should be no more than half buckwheat flour;
the result will be slightly heavier, and slightly earthier, than
with wheat flour alone.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwheat flour can be incorporated with ground nuts in a
wheat-free torte, or used with some wheat flour to make a pie
crust.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of New York state's crop is milled to make
groats, as the hulled seeds are called. Most groats are roasted for
kasha, which originated in Russia and is a staple in East European
cooking, especially in Jewish kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   For most recipes using kasha, the first step is to mix the
groats with a whole egg or an egg white, then toast them in a dry
pan until they separate; this keeps them from turning to mush. Then
liquid is added, and the kasha is usually steamed for about 15
minutes, like a pilaf. Kasha cooked in this manner can be used as a
filling for knishes, strudel and in place of rice or bread in
stuffing. It can also be turned into a salad that resembles
tabbouleh. It does not require the egg or precooking if it is added
to a soup; then it is just tossed into the pot for about 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the groats wind up as kasha in New York City, Los
Angeles and parts of Florida. Some groats are not roasted, and are
popular in small pockets of immigrant Polish communities across the
country where the raw groats are used as filler for sausages or to
mix with ground meat for stuffed cabbage. Raw groats are also sold
in some health-food stores and make a mild pilaf similar to barley
</P>
<P>
   Pure buckwheat flour is the palest ecru. Some of the seeds'
black hulls are often ground into the flour, which makes it cheaper
to produce. ``Buckwheat was used by the poor who couldn't afford
wheat flour,'' Orr said. ``Adding the hulls kept the price down,
and people got used to the idea that buckwheat flour was dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark hulls of the unmilled seeds or the dark flour is also
thought to be one of the reasons buckwheat flour is called sarrasin
in France or grano saraceno in Italy, a reference to the Arabs or
Moors who were thought to have brought buckwheat to Europe in the
1300s.
</P>
<P>
   The flour's darkness was always a negative and as soon as people
could afford it, they switched from buckwheat to wheat flour.
</P>
<P>
   In hardscrabble mountainous parts of northern Italy, like the
Valtellina area in Lombardy, dark buckwheat flour is still used to
make pasta called pizzoccheri. It is relatively coarse and is
traditionally layered with cabbage, potatoes and cheese for a
sturdy, rib-sticking casserole, also called pizzoccheri. Elsewhere
in northern Italy, coarse buckwheat flour is added to cornmeal for
polenta served with a cheese sauce.
</P>
<P>
   But flour and groats are not the only products of the buckwheat
harvest. Orr said the mill can hardly keep up with the demand for
the light, springy hulls to be used as mulch at such places as the
New York Botanic Garden, and also as a filling for pillows,
especially those little travel pillows.
</P>
<P>
   And the bees that pollinate the flowers go on to produce a
robust honey that is dark as molasses. &QL;

GOODBYE AND GOOD RIDDANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr finally gave up
the ghost this week, acknowledging the obvious _ that he'd had it _
but departing with the ill grace and arrogance that contaminated
his entire five-year pursuit of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Good riddance. What a bungler.
</P>
<P>
   He never did get his role right. When it came down to it, he
simply did not have good judgment. With all his unlimited power, he
was scary. And the circumstances of his departure indicate he has
learned nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Starr left without making a final public report and without
concluding his wide-ranging probe into a variety of potentially
criminal allegations that damaged the Clintons politically but have
never made it to court. When the Senate refused to convict
President Clinton of lying about sex with Monica Lewinsky, Starr's
sole major legal victory, the House impeachment, was exposed as
primarily a partisan farce.
</P>
<P>
   He got 14 convictions or guilty pleas, but none from an
important Clinton intimate beyond former Associate Attorney General
Webster Hubble. And except for Lewinsky, all the stories about
wrongdoing by Bill and Hillary Clinton turned out to be just that:
stories.
</P>
<P>
   Starr leaves a record that even he acknowledged in a CNN
interview gave the ``appearance'' of a vendetta. Appearance! That's
the understatement of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Without his staunch Republican credentials, his appointment
never make any legal sense. He had not been a prosecutor, and in
fact he left it to his staff to interview all witnesses, including
Lewinsky, except the president. Before Starr's appointment he had
publicly opposed Clinton on a major issue with potential to damage
his presidency, siding with Paula Jones in her sexual harassment
law suit.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his job as solicitor general when Clinton beat President
George Bush. During the last five years Starr continued his private
law practice, often representing clients who oppose the president.
He publicly associated with individuals and organizations
ideologically out to destroy the president.
</P>
<P>
   His agents interrogated Arkansas women about Clinton's sex life
long before anyone heard of Lewinsky. He harassed White House
officials about Vincent Foster's 1993 death long after his team
decided that Foster committed suicide, a conclusion he declined to
make public for a year while charges by some far-right partisans
went unanswered that the Clintons themselves had killed Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Starr owes the public a lot. At a minimum, we deserve some
detailed explanation of what he has been secretly pursuing and what
conclusions the investigation has reached about the integrity, or
lack of it, of President and Mrs. Clinton. We paid for Starr's
microphone, to paraphrase Ronald Reagan's famous remark during the
1980 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To abandon us with rumors and unanswered questions is
irresponsible and cowardly. It is also, of course, despicably but
predictably partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton probe began with serious charges of financial and
political corruption about a failed Arkansas land investment and
included unprecedented testimony before a grand jury from Hillary
Clinton. It ended in a legal travesty with mistrials of peripheral
figures and Starr himself denouncing before Congress the value of
the independent counsel law that created his job.
</P>
<P>
   After all this, the president is still standing, although
bleeding. Starr himself is barely crawling, a hero to right-wing
Clinton-haters but a pariah in his legal profession. The Supreme
Court seat he once wanted is now beyond his reach.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaking off without finishing his job is typical of Starr. He
used to prattle on a great deal about his obligation to justice and
duty, but he's forgotten all that. He spent $47 million of our
money trying to bring down President Clinton and now he won't tell
us why he failed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel role has been handed by the same
judicial panel that picked Starr _ now there's a reassuring
scenario _ to Robert Ray, who spent most of the last four years
trying but failing to send former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy
to jail. Five months ago, after Espy was acquitted on corruption
charges, Ray joined Starr's staff.
</P>
<P>
   His brief tenure there supposedly gives him expertise in the two
remaining investigations, both based on contradictory testimony
that would be difficult, if not impossible, to translate into a
conviction for illegal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The first is whether a Clinton friend attempted to influence
White House volunteer worker Kathleen Willey's testimony in the
Jones lawsuit that the president had groped her. Pursuing this
would be silly. It is trivial, and there seems to be no way to
prove who said what to whom. Who cares? Not the taxpayers who would
foot Ray's legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The second is whether Hillary Clinton lied about her role in the
firing of White House travel office aides. This too is much ado
about nothing. She says she played no role. A memo suggests
otherwise. So what? The firing itself was technically legal. The
abuses came later, when people were mistreated. In any case, it is
not worth continuing a tired investigation that has run its course.
</P>
<P>
   If Ray has been brought in to wrap things up, fine. If he is
there to keep the probe alive so that Clinton can be indicted for
something once he is out of office next year, not so fine. Ditto if
Ray's final report is timed to disrupt Hillary Clinton's campaign
for the Senate.

   LONE PINE, Calif. _ Not many towns of 1,800 people could hold an
annual film festival showing only Hollywood movies that were filmed
within a few miles. Since 1990 Lone Pine, a little hamlet at the
base of the Sierra Nevada's steep eastern slope, has held one of
the nation's quirkiest and most specialized film festivals, showing
only movies and television episodes filmed in the area and inviting
as its featured guests only the actors, directors, producers and
film technicians who worked on location here, with rare exceptions.
Even films made 50 miles up the road are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' said Dave Holland, director of the Lone Pine Film
Festival. ``We have such a wealth of films and talent to draw on.''
</P>
<P>
   From the 1920s through the '60s, Lone Pine was one of
Hollywood's favorite film locations. The town itself was used as a
set for many movies, but the real attraction for filmmakers were
the Alabama Hills, a 47-square-mile stretch of gnarled,
rust-colored rocks lying just west of Lone Pine. The rocks
scattered throughout the rugged hills are eroded into weirdly
shaped spires, pillars and knobs, some of them piled into mounds
rising hundreds of feet. They contrast with 14,495-foot Mount
Whitney and the rest of the white granite Sierra mountains towering
behind them, offering cinematographers a spectacular and versatile
film setting. Holland said that over 300 movies had used the area
as a film location.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, Lone Pine was the mecca for outdoor locations for
pictures,'' said A.C. Lyles, a producer for Paramount who has
filmed at Lone Pine and was one of this year's festival guests.
</P>
<P>
   The moody Alabama Hills are mainly on federal land and were
named during the Civil War by Confederate sympathizers after a
rebel gunboat, the Alabama. ``The Lives of a Bengal Lancer''
(1935), starring Gary Cooper and set in India, was shot in the
hills, as were several other British army action films, including
the 1939 RKO action classic ``Gunga Din,'' also set in India, which
was probably the biggest production ever made in the hills and was
one of the most expensive movies at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies, science fiction, crime dramas and other films were
also shot in the town but, of course, most of the movies were
westerns. John Wayne was here more than once, both before and after
he became a major star, and so were Gary Cooper, Robert Mitchum,
Gregory Peck, Barbara Stanwyck, Randolph Scott and Clint Eastwood.
The cowboy actors Tom Mix and Hoot Gibson made silent films at Lone
Pine, and later Gene Autry, Roy Rogers and William Boyd, who played
Hopalong Cassidy, frequently filmed in the Alabama Hills.
Television westerns filmed here in the 1950s and '60s included
``The Lone Ranger,'' ``Wagon Train,'' ``Have Gun Will Travel'' and
``Bonanza.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lone Pine's tempestuous real history found its way into
the scripts. In 1862 federal soldiers fought with Paiute Indians in
the Alabama Hills. In later years soldiers pursued outlaws through
the hills, stagecoaches were robbed, gunfights erupted in saloons
and a sheriff was gunned down in the street.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the Lone Pine Film Festival is an unpretentious
event. The films are shown in the town's high school auditorium,
which has been remodeled over the last few years and had its sound
system improved.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Pine is only a few blocks long, and rooms in its few motels
sell out long before the festival, so some visitors have to stay at
lodges 60 miles away. But the event has drawn people from as far as
Europe and South America. One year a man from Rio de Janeiro became
a festival legend when he flew from Brazil to Los Angeles and took
a taxi from the airport 200 miles to Lone Pine.
</P>
<P>
   This year Terry and Trish Cutts came from London to Southern
California to visit friends and timed their trip so they could
attend the Lone Pine festival. ``I like the whole western thing,''
Cutts said.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors are drawn partly by the opportunity to see rarely
screened films. This year's event, which ended on Oct. 10, included
screenings of the 1925 silent film ``The Riders of the Purple
Sage,'' with Tom Mix; an episode of the serial ``Daredevils of the
West''; and a 1940 version of the Lone Ranger story ``Hi Yo,
Silver,'' in which Silver the Wonder Horse received top billing
over the human actors. (The 1938 serial ``The Lone Ranger'' was
also filmed in the Alabama Hills.) Among the nonwestern films made
here was ``Bad Day at Black Rock'' (1955) with Spencer Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   The featured film, shown on Oct. 9 to a sold-out auditorium, was
Paramount's ``Round Up,'' a 1920 silent western that holds special
significance here because it was the first movie ever filmed at
Lone Pine. The film, which was Fatty Arbuckle's first starring
feature, is a drama of betrayal and redemption shot on the town's
streets, which look far different today, and the Alabama Hills,
which look remarkably the same. A local musician, William R. Schuck
Jr., composed and performed a live piano accompaniment for the
screening.
</P>
<P>
   Many festival visitors said their main reason for attending was
the striking Alabama Hills, which can be viewed on guided bus tours
following various scenic routes. A commentary recorded by Holland
details where specific movies were filmed as the buses pass those
sites in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Festival guests from Hollywood this year included the actors
Ernest Borgnine, Joan Leslie and Dale Evans, the director Budd
Boetticher (``The Tall T,'' ``Ride Lonesome'') and four-time Oscar
winner Ben Burtt, a sound designer. The guests, who received no
payment for their appearances, took part in a panel discussion in
which they reminisced about their experiences filming at Lone Pine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my first ride down a hill on horseback in the Alabama
Hills,'' Borgnine said. ``It scared the bejabbers out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lone Pine has contributed to the history of film sound as well.
Burtt, who worked for 15 years for Lucasfilm, said that gunshot
sounds he recorded in the Alabama Hills were used in ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' and in the Indiana Jones films. He
amused a festival audience with a film-clip video he compiled
showing that the same two distinctive gunshot ricochet sounds
originally recorded in the Alabama Hills for ``The Lives of a
Bengal Lancer'' had been reused in hundreds of other films in
decades since.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 1960s to the late '80s, Hollywood movie crews were
a rarity at Lone Pine, but they have resurfaced since the festival
began promoting the location 10 years ago. Recently crews have been
here to film scenes for ``Maverick,'' ``The Shadow,'' ``Star Trek
V'' and ``Star Trek Generations.''

BRUINS TRY MEETINGS OF THE MIND

   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ If death and taxes are the only guarantees
in life, meetings and changes are the only guarantees when a team
is slumping.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' horrid 0-5-3 stretch has only been magnified by the
fact it has come at the beginning of the year. Had it come in late
January, there would be some hand-wringing but not the kind that
we're seeing at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell, who is on the trip,
cancelled a golf date Monday in order to work the phones. While he
was exploring his options, the team was put through a hard
75-minute skate followed by _ you guessed it _ a meeting among
coaches and players, and then a players-only caucus.
</P>
<P>
   As if a victim of the Murphy's Law spiral the club is in, Ray
Bourque was forced to leave the ice after being cut in the ear by
an errant puck. He stayed around for the meetings before heading to
a Phoenix hospital for a couple of stitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something missing,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``I don't
know what it is. I think one of the things is passion. Teams aren't
beating us up. We're close, but close isn't good enough. The
passion of the game has got to be there. We have to quit moaning
about things that have happened and really get down to saying, `We
have to go forward and get the passion back into the game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Burns made a couple of adjustments, most notably putting center
Jason Allison with left wing Steve Heinze and Anson Carter. Allison
is playing well while Heinze and Carter have looked lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that will get something going,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Burns believes his club is working hard. He also acknowledged
that there's been a bit of a hangover effect from the absence of
goalie Byron Dafoe who is holding out, Dmitri Khristich, who was
let go after his arbitration award, and Tim Taylor, who signed with
the Rangers as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with a lot of things but it's not an excuse,''
said Burns. ``I'm going to get (expletive) for this but it's not
the reason for not performing, it's not an excuse. We're feeling
sorry about ourselves because Byron Dafoe is not here, because
Khristich walked, because Tim Taylor is with another team because
Dave Ellett was sent home and Ken Baumgartner was bought out. Sure,
a lot of guys don't agree with it. Some things I don't agree with,
but we're not going to sit around feeling sorry for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are we to question how they're going to spend their money?
I'm not in a position to tell (owner Jeremy) Jacobs or
(president/general manager (Harry) Sinden, they should give the
money to Dafoe. Who am I? I'm just an employee. I'm just a number
in that company. I've spoken to Mr. Jacobs twice in my life. It's
not up to me to decide that and it's not up to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said even if the club had squeaked out a win here or
there, there is still a cloud over the team and change is in the
air. Whether it be a deal involving Dafoe for a forward _ Bill
Guerin and Bob Corkum are names being bandied about _ Burns said he
feels the uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something wrong for sure,'' he said. ``And something
is going to happen. They're not going to let it go like that.
Things just don't seem to work right now, maybe it's the time to be
bad. Maybe there's a time we'll be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the missing ingredient, whether it be passion,
commitment or intensity, Burns said it can't be taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you inject into somebody,'' he said. ``It's
got to be there. I look at (Phoenix forward Keith) Tkachuk, the way
he played the other night. He probably played the best game I ever
saw him play. He was emotional. Maybe we should start a game the
way we finished it, mad. Because something is going to happen, you
can't keep on letting it go. Your top six forwards are going to win
you the game and if one of them is not there, we can't accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he encouraged the players to point fingers, ``wash
the dirty clothes and get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is doing this willfully or intentionally. We're making
mistakes in games. The brain isn't there at all and that has
something to do with emotion. You're working but you're working
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Until such time as the club turns it around _ it has three more
games on this trip _ there will be a level of tension on everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This league is about winning, and winning solves a lot of
problems,'' said Rob DiMaio. ``We can't let things slide too far
because if you get too far behind, it's not good. We're not playing
like the team we know we can be. We're not showing passion or a lot
of intensity. Maybe spots here, spots there, that's really the
reason why we're not winning. We have to be more together as a
group. If you don't play together, you're not going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio missed the workout because of a bad hip. He said he will
play against the Kings Wednesday night. Burns listed him as
doubtful. ``I want to play,'' said DiMaio, who has been one of the
best players through eight games. If he can't go, it's likely
Cameron Mann will take his spot.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said Rob Tallas likely would be in goal against Los
Angeles.

 &HT;    Tough and diverse, conifers rank high among new additions to
Southern gardens
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Oct. 21.
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ozzie Johnson has come to count on conifers and thinks
more Georgia gardeners should, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how many shrubs do you know you can lean on for
support while up 30 feet on an extension ladder? That's how Johnson
prunes each of the two giant Leyland cypresses that tower over his
Roswell-area (Ga.) garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's a flight attendant, so I do this while she's gone.
It makes her so nervous,'' he says, one arm hugging the trunk of a
Leyland, the other snipping away at its furry green branches.
</P>
<P>
   But what really makes conifers a dependable group of tough and
hardy plants are their wide-ranging qualities. Conifers _ mostly
evergreen, cone-bearing trees and shrubs common to the Northeast
and West Coast _ offer such variation in color, size and shape that
they're increasingly finding homes in Southern gardens.
</P>
<P>
   They're also giving many a container garden some much-needed
scale, especially in winter when tall green plants are hard to come
by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, if you said `conifer' in the South, most
people would think `Christmas tree,''' says Kathryn Moomaw, who
maintains the Atlanta Botanical Garden's conifer collection.
``Finally, people are starting to realize there are so many other
varieties that are suitable for landscapes in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Now's the perfect time of year to experiment with those trees
and shrubs. That's because fall planting allows them to spend their
energy developing roots instead of producing flowers or fruit.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the time of year when many gardens become barren and
turn brown because their owners planned only for the warm seasons.
Those bare spots stand out like sore thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Not Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   Every fall, he counts on his more than 300 varieties of conifer
to brighten what otherwise could be a dull landscape with bursts of
emerald green _ and yellow, orange, blue, lavender and even
variegated versions of those colors. (Although most are evergreen,
some, such as larch and cypress, drop their leaves in autumn.)
</P>
<P>
   His shrubs range from miniature varieties planted in pots and
troughs that grow under 2 feet tall to 45-foot Leyland cypresses
he's pruned to reach skyward like skinny columns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a little bit of time, and with a little effort,
you can take a tree and prune it to whatever shape you want it in
the garden. The Japanese have perfected the technique,'' says
Johnson, a horticulturist who has traveled to the Orient with the
Atlanta Botanical Garden staff to collect seeds and specimen
plants.
</P>
<P>
   A devoted volunteer, Johnson helped Ron Determann, the garden's
conservatory superintendent, develop its conifer collection, which
recently was expanded to accommodate some 200 varieties. The
garden's purpose is to demonstrate to homeowners the landscape
potential of these underused plants as well as test varieties for
heat tolerance and cold hardiness in this area.
</P>
<P>
   At the botanical garden, they'll find ideas for their own homes:
accent plants such as tall, pencil-like junipers (Juniperus
formosana); low-growing, creeping ground covers (Juniperus
horizontalis 'Mother Lode'); graceful weeping cedars (Cedrus
deodara 'Crystal Falls'). Their shapes and forms run the gamut,
from squatty and compact to upright and conical to loose and
droopy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays to research their height and width,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Size can be confusing. The American Conifer Society classifies
the plants according to their growth rate: miniatures, less than 3
inches per year; dwarf, 3 to 6 inches per year; intermediate, 6 to
12 inches per year; and large, 12 inches or more per year. (At 10
to 15 years, miniatures reach 2 to 3 feet; dwarf, 3 to 6 feet;
intermediate, 6 to 15 feet; and large, 15 feet and taller.)
</P>
<P>
   Sam and Carlene Jones grow more than 250 cultivated varieties of
dwarf conifers in their garden at Piccadilly Farm, a nursery near
Bishop. They sell about 85 of them in their nursery, priced from
about $8 for a container plant to $25 for a 3-gallon pine.
</P>
<P>
   Sam, a retired botany professor at the University of Georgia,
first was drawn to the plants years ago while teaching and visiting
nurseries. ``We picked up a few conifers in North Carolina, never
thinking we'd become so enthused over them, and gradually became
intrigued by their various forms, kinds, colors and textures,''
says Jones, whose nursery recently sponsored its first ``Conifer
Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, there's just more and more interest, and now the
gardening public wants to know, `How the heck do I use these things
in the landscape?'''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious answer, especially in winter, is for providing
structure. Evergreens are the backbone of a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Conifers can be grouped together to contrast their various
colors, forms and textures. Or they can be mixed with other plants,
such as Japanese maples and ornamental grasses, to emphasize those
features.
</P>
<P>
   They also can be used individually. Conifers make excellent
accents because of their sculptural qualities. In Johnson's garden,
a falsecypress stands majestically in one corner of the lawn like
the perfect Christmas tree your eye's drawn to on a lot full of
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   And smaller conifers make good container plants, giving
apartment and high-rise dwellers an evergreen perfect for gardening
in small spaces _ maybe not one of Johnson's 45-foot Leylands, but
they impart scale just the same.
</P>
<P>
   How to use
</P>
<P>
   Conifers can be used in the landscape to:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Accent the corner of a bed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Frame a doorway or garden entry.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Add winter interest in the garden.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Create foundation plantings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Form a collection in an island bed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Give a container or trough garden structure.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make a screen or hedge.
</P>
<P>
   CONIFERS FOR GEORGIA GARDENS
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for many Georgians to imagine a conifer other
than a cedar or cypress growing in their summer gardens. But the
Atlanta Botanical Garden and others are experimenting with numerous
varieties that are proving suitable for this climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a diversity of what can be grown here,''
horticulturist Mildred Pinnell said. ``But a lot of conifers don't
have common names, so that scares some people off.''
</P>
<P>
   Most prefer sun, though some, such as hemlocks and Japanese plum
yew, can be planted in shade. In general, they don't like wet feet
so plant them in well-drained soil.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some recommendations for Georgia gardens, provided by
Ron Determann of the Atlanta Botanical Garden, Ozzie Johnson of
Johnson Horticultural Services and Sam Jones of Piccadilly Farms:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cedrus deodara 'Pygmaea' _ Deodar cedar
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cephalotaxus harringtonia 'Fastigiata' or 'Prostrata' _
Japanese plum yewa
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Chamaecyparis obtusa 'Tretragona Aurea' or 'Nana Gracilis' _

<P>
   HOW TO PLANT SHRUBS
</P>
<P>
   Fall is the perfect time to plant conifers _ and any other tree
or shrub _ because cool weather gives them time to develop their
root systems without spending it on flowers or fruit, as occurs in
spring. Here's some advice fr om Anita Castro (below) and Kathryn
Moomaw, gardeners at the Atlanta Botanical Garden:
</P>
<P>
   Using a spade, dig a hole two to three times the width of the
root ball but only as deep as the ball. The ball's surface should
rest at ground level once the ball is set in the hole. Gently
loosen the roots to promote their spread into the surrounding
earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back fill the hole with the remaining soil, then pack it to
remove air pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Mound some of the soil 3 to 4 inches high around the root ball
to form a well, which will help the plant maintain moisture during
the first few months. (Be sure to remove the well once the plant is
established so soil will properly drain.) Mulch with wood chips or
pine straw to aid in moisture retention and weed prevention, then
water immediately to eliminate air pockets in the soil.

 &HT;    Summer's `pruning' reveals forgotten wonders
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Oct. 21.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, the brutal summer pays off. Instead of lamenting my
losses to heat and drought _ and there were quite a few _ I'm
enjoying the imposed spareness in my garden, as it shows off
long-hidden plants. Paring down works, even when it's forced.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the force, I might never have seen, really seen,
certain plants that had virtually disappeared in my decade-long
frenzy to cover all my ground. All through the 1990s, I hauled by
the numbers, filling every available space with trees, shrubs and
perennials. Finally, almost two years ago, I got to a point where I
could catch my breath _ only to set about building another garden
in the North Georgia mountains.
</P>
<P>
   That garden offered a way to prune some of the Atlanta plants;
about one-third of the mountain plantings once lived in Atlanta.
Even so, the Atlanta space remained filled to the brim; I could
hardly cite empty spaces resulting from the sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, I enjoyed the fullness, reveled in it. Watching all
those plants grow into and among one another for 10 years amounted
to raising a family; each one had its own personality, its own set
of experiences, close calls, triumphs. Moreover, a full garden _
OK, let's be plain, an overfull one _ is like a stomach stuffed
with culinary delights; you know you've overdone it, but you savor
the excess. Each plant was a testimonial to my inability to pass a
nursery, my refusal to refuse a gift plant. Each newcomer found
ground on Peeples Street.
</P>
<P>
   I might have gone on this way indefinitely but for the summer _
and my acknowledged reluctance to spend my entire gardening life
watering. As the drought wore on, the casualty list grew. So did my
enhanced views of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot pieris that, like many of its kind, had lost several
limbs over the years just up and died altogether this summer _
giving great display to a stand of Christmas ferns in a space free
of competing shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
   Two rhododendrons that always seemed to live life reluctantly in
Atlanta, trying to die one branch at a time, fainting in heat and
rolling up their leaves like cigarette paper in cold, suffered
complete meltdown around July. I pulled them from the ground,
putting them out of my misery.
</P>
<P>
   The spaces they left made a remarkable difference. One opened up
a long-missing view of the creeping fig trying to cover the brick
wall, as well as the high-pruned trunk of a nearby ligustrum _ a
shrub cum tree whose elegant form had too long gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   My appreciation for ligustrum's beauty took a big leap forward
some 10 years ago when I saw a stand that had been tree-formed in
Meridian, Miss. Inheriting one mature one in Atlanta, I set out to
make it resemble those in the Magnolia State, ``cloud pruning'' it
to leave large tufts of evergreen foliage at the ends of branches
arching from the main trunk. In spring, the plant produces tiny,
sweet-smelling blooms that satiate bees, while its clusters of
BB-sized fruit feed birds just as they used to feed boys'
peashooters.
</P>
<P>
   As I worked each year on the ligustrum's form, other plants grew
to obscure it. Amazing that I couldn't see what I was missing until
the rhododendrons left the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the Virginia willow had overgrown the loquat. But when
the drought took the willow, I could see the loquat for the first
time in years. How it has grown; started from a 6-inch gift
seedling back in 1991, it's now 6 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Not only in the ground did drought bring vision to the garden.
Potted ferns, shrubs, trees all burned out like spent candles.
Their legacy: a sparer courtyard that benefits the survivors. How
much better to see what is left.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsai, too, died and left space for other miniaturized trees
and shrubs. I'm down to a precious few now, but they get a lot more
attention and admiration than they ever did when they were part of
many.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, these changes are part of the garden's rhythms, its
cycle of life and death and changes of attitude. Used to be, I saw
the departures of plants chiefly as opportunities to haul in new,
fresh, young ones. Yes, lush excess was certainly fun. But for me,
now, it's even better to enjoy the fresh new look the old plants
have left behind.

SOUTH POLE RESCUE IS DRAMA MADE FOR BOOKS, TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LINDA TRISCHITTA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENVILLE, N.Y. _ The dramatic and historic military rescue of
an ill physician trapped by nature on Earth's southern tip may be
made into a book or film. But the sale of Dr. Jerri Nielsen's story
could bring her riches that may never compensate for a priceless
commodity: good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to say that we've gotten not just constant queries
from the broadcast news shows but from agents and television and
movie producers. She'll have decisions to make,'' said Mary Hanson,
a spokeswoman for the National Science Foundation, which has a
contract with Nielsen's employer, Antarctic Support Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson said Nielsen and her family probably did not realize the
extent of the world's curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``She became a public figure through circumstance and not by
choice,'' Hanson said, referring to how the doctor discovered a
breast lump that prompted the U.S. Air Force to parachute medical
supplies to her at the South Pole. ``It's the kind of spotlight
that most Americans don't experience and there is nothing like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, Karen Gerwin, an agent at International
Creative Management, predicted that Nielsen's story could be a best
seller worthy of ``a healthy six-figure advance'' for its author
and that domestic and foreign sales royalties would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely want to see her manuscript because this was
a woman doing her job who was in a helpless situation,'' Gerwin
said. ``How did she get through each day? ... I would want to know
about her fears, and whether she did administer self-treatment, as
has been reported.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, a New York Air National Guard 109th Airlift
Wing crew landed briefly on the Antarctic ice two weeks earlier
than weather usually allows. Nielsen boarded the unit's
ski-equipped LC-130 cargo plane, leaving behind a replacement
physician for the 41 researchers at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole
station.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 75 news outlets from London to Brazil continue to
ring the phones and beeper of Maj. Bob Bullock, the 109th's
spokesman in Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday night my wife and I were at Cathedral of All Saints in
Albany, for a half-hour organ concert,'' Bullock said. ``I got
seven calls, including two from Cleveland and German television
stations. ... I had to go to a bathroom to grant an interview so I
wouldn't disturb the service. It was unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The 109th Airlift Wing _ featured in books like ``A Perfect
Storm'' about a Nor'easter and ``Icefire,'' a thriller in which
Chinese generals explode nuclear bombs beneath the Antarctic ice
shelf to create a world-shaking tsunami _ has seen its profile
raised higher with this mission than during the previous 45 years
when the Navy flew for South Pole researchers, a duty the Guard
assumed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Edward Fleming, vice commander of the 109th who planned the
U.S. part of the medical evacuation, said the unit had not yet been
contacted by Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably will be offers coming to the 109th,'' said
Fleming, who added that the Guard accepts no money for interviews.
A crew member may write and sell his or her story for personal
profit as long as government computers are not used and the work
was not done during a military shift.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming thought the mission altered the public's perception of
the 109th reservists as weekend warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're operating daily, even though it's the Reserves, doing
missions for the Department of Defense and for the nation,''
Fleming said of his unit, which must prepare for the
four-month-long Antarctic season of shuttling researchers, supplies
and equipment around that continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues we are dealing with are life and death and national
security,'' Fleming said. ``It's real stuff.''

HONG KONG'S SHIFT OF BROADCAST OFFICIAL RAISES PRESS-FREEDOM
CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a move that has stirred new fears about freedom
of the press here, Hong Kong on Tuesday abruptly reassigned the
director of its government-owned broadcaster, Radio Television Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Cheung Man-yee, was named economic and trade
representative to Japan, a post that is the functional equivalent
of an ambassador from this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheung's sudden departure from the broadcast agency has
alarmed people here. At a time when many Hong Kong newspapers and
broadcasters are muting their criticism of the government, Ms.
Cheung, 53, had built a reputation as an outspoken defender of her
stations' editorial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's well known, not just in Hong Kong, but throughout Asia,
for her strength of feeling about press freedom,'' said Terry
Nealon, head of English-language news at Radio Television Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The union that represents the broadcast agency's programming
employees said it was deeply concerned by the abruptness of Ms.
Cheung's departure and by the failure to appoint a permanent
replacement. Ms. Cheung's deputy, Chu Pui-hing, was named acting
director.
</P>
<P>
   What added to the uneasiness was that Ms. Cheung was reassigned
soon after the broadcaster had drawn a rare public rebuke from
Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen. The station had given
air time to a senior Taiwanese official, who sought to explain
President Lee Teng-hui's shift in policy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheung Man-yee made a lot of enemies in the new
establishment,'' said Albert Cheng, a radio talk-show host known
for his criticism of the government. ``Sending her to Japan is
almost like putting her in exile.''
</P>
<P>
   A prominent pro-democracy politician, Martin Lee, said, ``This
spells the beginning of the end of free expression in Hong Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials angrily denied that the reassignment was driven by
political pressure, either local or from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any suggestion that freedom of expression is dead or
press freedom is dead is not only a totally unfounded and unfair
criticism, but an insult,'' said Anson Chan, the No. 2 official in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a statement, Ms. Cheung said she was confident that the
broadcast agency would continue to ``uphold the principles of press
freedom and editorial independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheung did not return a call seeking comment. Officials at
Radio Television Hong Kong said she was traveling in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for Ms. Cheung's departure, experts said
the broadcast agency was on increasingly tenuous ground in
posthandover Hong Kong. Founded in 1923 by the British colonial
administration, it is meant to be a local version of the BBC,
supported by the government but free to criticize it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the broadcaster has maintained its maverick ways since
Hong Kong's handover to Chinese rule in 1997, it has drawn fire
from pro-Beijing forces. Last year, a Hong Kong delegate to the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress derided the
broadcast agency as a ``remnant of British rule'' and urged the
government to clamp down on it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheung leapt to its defense, saying that it was doing its
job. But critics paid more attention to the response of Hong Kong's
chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, who said, ``While freedom of speech
is important, it is also important for government policies to be
positively presented.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the station ruffled feathers by giving a platform to
Cheng An-kuo, who serves as Taiwan's unofficial representative in
Hong Kong. In a weekly radio program, ``Letter to Hong Kong,''
Cheng explained Taiwan's decision to approach relations with China
on a state-to-state basis.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here and in Beijing sharply criticized Cheng and Radio
Television Hong Kong for overstepping the bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government has been increasingly critical of all the
local news media, particularly Chinese-language newspapers, which
it accuses of invading privacy and publishing sensational articles.
It is weighing whether to create a watchdog group that could impose
heavy fines for articles it deems objectionable. Many local
journalists fiercely oppose the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Cheung's case, government officials said she was getting
a well-deserved promotion after 13 years in the same job.
</P>
<P>
   But the broadcast agency's employees noted that she had spent
most of her 27-year career at the broadcaster and relished what is
one of Hong Kong's most glamorous government jobs. They also said
she was only two years from retirement age, and had recently turned
down an offer to be commissioner of tourism.

   WASHINGTON _ Online auction fraud is growing so rapidly that law
enforcement officials can't catch all the crooks. Fraud
investigators with the National Consumers League say consumers must
become more wary and protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The league urges shoppers to observe these guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand how the auction works. Many online auctions simply
list items without verifying if the merchandise exists or is
described accurately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check out the seller. For company information, contact the
state or local consumer protection agency and Better Business
Bureau. Look at the auction site's feedback section for comments
about the seller. Be aware that glowing reports could be
``planted'' by the seller.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be especially careful if the seller is a private individual.
Most consumer protection laws and the government agencies that
enforce them don't deal with private sales.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get the seller's name, street address and telephone number to
check them out or follow up if there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask about delivery, returns, warranties and service. Get a
definite delivery time and insist that the seller insure the
shipment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be wary of claims about collectibles. Get a written statement
describing the item and its value before you pay.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use common sense and ask yourself: Is this the best way to buy
this item? What is the most I am willing to bid?
</P>
<P>
   _ If a seller insists on being paid in cash, he's a con artist.
Whenever possible, pay by credit card so you can dispute the
charges if the goods are misrepresented or never arrive. Or use an
escrow agent, who acts as a go-between to receive the merchandise
and forward your payment to the seller. Another option is cash on
delivery (COD).
</P>
<P>
   _ Inform the auction site whenever you have a problem. They want
to know about sellers who don't deliver or misrepresent their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get free insurance through the auction sites whenever
possible. For example, eBay offers free insurance protection for
items valued between $25 and $200, subject to a $25 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use authentication programs if you are buying stamps, trading
cards, rare coins or some other collectible whose value or
authenticity isn't clear to you. Services exist that verify and
grade products.

 &HT;    GOING, GOING, GONE: THE MONEY OF ONLINE AUCTION FRAUD VICTIMS
 &HT;    With AUCTION-TIPS. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 24.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Why stick up victims on the street when you can rob
people from the comfort of your home?
</P>
<P>
   As Americans flock to online auctions in search of bargains,
profits and fun, law enforcement officials say swindlers are
collecting money from fraudulent auctions without having to worry
much about getting caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, ripping off people is not new,'' noted Lisa Hone,
staff attorney for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), but using
Internet-based auctions is ``a new type of crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Hone said that in the first half of 1998, the FTC's Bureau of
Consumer Protection received about 300 complaints involving online
auction fraud. In the first half of 1999, about 6,000 such
complaints were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, would-be buyers mailed money to con artists who
promised to ship merchandise, but never did. In some cases, goods
were shipped, but were so inferior compared with what was promised
that the transaction amounted to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of auction trickery are soaring at the National
Consumers League as well, according to Susan Grant, director of the
Internet Fraud Watch project of the Washington-based watchdog
group. Just last year, about two-thirds of all Internet-related
complaints to the league involved auctions. This year, 90 percent
of them do.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in ripoffs is not surprising, given the phenomenal
expansion of one-on-one trading through the Internet. Last year,
auction sales amounted to roughly $2 billion, and analysts expect
that figure to more than triple by next year.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's popularity can be traced to the founding of eBay
Inc., the world's largest personal online trading company. The San
Jose, Calif.-based company popularized the idea of matching up
individual bidders and sellers on a Web site. Now more than 3
million items are up for sale daily on eBay, everything from
vintage Barbie accessories to a 10-speed Freightliner heavy truck.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of its success, the company now faces competition
from auctions hosted by Yahoo!, America Online, MSN.com, GO Network
and others.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dell Computer Corp. , Microsoft Corp. and about 100
other companies created a consortium, the FairMarket Auction
Network, to link the auction portions of their Web sites. When an
item is listed on any member's site, bids will be displayed
simultaneously on the Web sites of all partners, a move that could
greatly expand the number of people exposed to the auction
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hone said auctions are popular because they give buyers and
sellers ``wonderful opportunities'' to find each other. ``If I'm in
Alaska, I can reach out all over the world and find a particular
piece of 'mission' furniture or even a Beanie Baby,'' she said.
``The vast majority of the times, it works out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   But online auctions, with their blend of anonymity, greed and
deadline excitement, provide a fertile environment for swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the high bidder mails a check to the seller, who then
ships the merchandise. But sometimes, the buyer sends a check and
never hears back from the seller, or receives an item of lower
quality than the one offered.
</P>
<P>
   Auction operators generally do not screen wares for accuracy of
descriptions, taking no more responsibility for the quality of an
advertised item than a newspaper does for a used car listed among
its classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   With no one to ensure the accuracy of merchandise descriptions,
buyers are at risk, said Jonathan Hammar, a resident of San Jose,
Calif., who has been buying and selling toy cars on line for more
than a year. Despite his online savvy, even he has been defrauded
by people who have cashed his checks and sent him worthless cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had one or two really bad deals,'' he said. ``The cars
were grossly misrepresented'' by crooked sellers who promised
pristine toys, but shipped ones that came in ``little chips'' or
were missing valuable parts.
</P>
<P>
   Hone said that such false advertising is criminal. ``It's a
violation of the law to misrepresent what you are selling, whether
you are on line or not,'' Hone said. ``We have the legal tools we
need: laws involving mail fraud, wire fraud, failure to disclose
and even grand theft.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in stopping fraudulent advertising and outright
theft is that auctions have grown far more quickly than law
enforcement budgets. ``It's a matter of resources,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the FTC has started working with local, state and federal
prosecutors to round up swindlers. For example, earlier this year,
the New York City consumer affairs department cracked down on con
artists using online auctions to peddle baseball memorabilia that
was not signed by the famed players advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Hone says defrauded bidders should file complaints and press
charges to help law enforcement. ``The more complaints we get, the
more we'll know about what things are going on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because people are dealing one-on-one, bidders have a hard time
checking the seller's record. For example, a buyer can't turn to
the Better Business Bureau for a report because the seller is not a
registered corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The auction hosts themselves ``have a moral responsibility to
keep their sites from being used for fraud,'' consumer watchdog
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, many hosts are offering bidders more tools to
protect themselves. For example, eBay provides free insurance up to
$200, minus a $25 deductible. Hosts also typically offer areas
where buyers and sellers can post ``feedback'' about their
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most useful consumer tool is the escrow account,
offered by companies such as i-Escrow, Trade-Direct and
SecureTrades. Typically, in an escrow transaction, the winning
bidder for an item sends payment to the escrow service, using a
credit card, check or money order. When the money arrives, the
escrow company informs the seller, who ships the object.
</P>
<P>
   When the buyer receives the item, he can look it over and either
accept or return it. If the buyer approves the merchandise, the
escrow company mails the money to the seller. If the buyer returns
the object, the escrow account refunds his money.
</P>
<P>
   Hone says escrow companies have an excellent safety record and
their business is growing. Still, millions of consumers ignore the
escrow option because they don't want to pay the fees, which
typically run about 5 percent to 6 percent of the purchase price.
Also, escrowing money delays the delivery of merchandise, which
impatient shoppers hate.
</P>
<P>
   Hammar, the toy car trader, said escrow accounts are seen by
most buyers as being a hassle. ``I've never had anyone want it,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He figures that when he shops on line, he is taking a financial
risk. But then again, he takes a risk every time he displays toy
cars at flea markets, where shoplifters prowl. ``I had $50 worth of
stuff stolen at one flea market,'' he said. ``The people who are
going to cheat you are going to do it one way or another.''

GERMAN CHANCELLOR AND HIS AUSTERITY PLANS ARE UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Tens of thousands of teachers, police officers and
other civil servants closed down the center of Berlin on Tuesday,
protesting Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's plans to trim what his
government has called ``the nanny state'' in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration, which led police to cordon off all streets
near the Reichstag, came despite apparent attempts by Schroeder in
the last week to water down his austerity plans.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he ruled out a ``wealth tax'' on the rich and declared
that spending on pensions must be held down.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder has said recently that he is willing to examine
the possibility of a wealth tax after all, and he has expressed a
readiness to consider one union's proposal to try to reduce
unemployment by lowering the retirement age to 60, from 65.
</P>
<P>
   This apparent flip-flop has given right-wing commentators a
field day and illustrated Schroeder's difficulties in charting a
coherent course, sticking to it, and finding the necessary
political support. The Social Democratic chancellor has been
hammered in a series of state and municipal elections since August.
</P>
<P>
   In a blistering commentary, an influential center-right
newspaper, Die Welt, said Tuesday that Schroeder's ``Berlin
Republic'' is directionless. ``The motto of the mambo chancellor is
two steps forward, one step back _ or vice-versa,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Die Welt is no friend of the Social Democrats, but the view is
widespread that Schroeder's first year in office has been largely
squandered because of internal conflicts in his Red-Green coalition
and his apparent difficulties in deciding whether his most
important constituency is big business or the working class.
</P>
<P>
   Businessmen generally have applauded Schroeder's plans to reduce
the size of the state _ which accounts for close to 50 percent of
economic activity here _ through budget cuts of about $16.6
billion, affecting almost all departments. The plan, which is
before Parliament, also calls for a freeze on pensions and a tight
hold on wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   But the state sector _ including teachers, police and government
agency workers _ has been alarmed and angered by the plans,
prompting Tuesday's demonstration. ``Schroeder, go home,'' said one
banner, expressing the disenchantment of many Social Democratic
voters with what they see as a chancellor who has betrayed his
party's roots.
</P>
<P>
   Public employees and labor unions provide two of the bedrocks of
the Social Democratic Party. Their resistance to plans for reform
appears to have left Schroeder unsure of whether he can garner
enough new votes in the center to compensate for the loss of
traditional supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said Tuesday that he would not change course. ``The
government will not change its policies,'' he insisted. ``The slow
growth of salaries is part of the belt-tightening package.''
</P>
<P>
   But prodded by aides who are alarmed by the slump in his
support, the Chancellor has appeared to wobble over the past week.
Certainly, he seems determined to woo the left once more, or at
least to dampen the anger of a substantial wing of his party.
</P>
<P>
   He has agreed to a study a proposal from Germany's largest
union, IG Metall, that would lower the age at which a worker can
retire to 60 and so, in the union's view, help create jobs.
However, it is not clear how such an idea can be squared with
Schroeder's insistence that pension payments must be capped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who are living longer cannot retire earlier,'' said
Wolfgang Schauble, the leader of the opposition Christian
Democratic Party. ``This idea is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   IG Metall has said the earlier retirement could be financed by
payments from workers into a special fund. The chancellor has now
said that if such funding can indeed be found, early retirement may
be helpful in tackling Germany's 10 percent unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   He has also agreed to submit a wealth tax proposal to a Social
Democratic party congress in December. One left-wing Social
Democrat, Detlev von Larcher, has suggested that Germans with more
than $280,000 should pay out 10 percent of their wealth over 10
years in a one-time tax to help fund the reconstruction of the
former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unlikely that such an idea, or anything like it,
would ever become law. But Schroeder's indecisiveness over the
wealth tax appears to reveal once more his profound uncertainty
over what Germany's Social Democracy now stands for.

 &HT;    CCE moves to clarify management changes
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Henry Schimberg, a highly respected soft-drink
industry executive who helped Coca-Cola Enterprises become one of
the world's premier bottlers, will retire as the company's
president and chief executive officer at the end of the year _ four
months earlier than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made Tuesday, along with the news that John
Alm, one of the two most likely candidates for Schimberg's jobs,
has been named chief operating officer of the Atlanta-based
company, effective immediately. Alm, 53, also will become president
on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   A permanent chief executive officer has not been named to
replace Schimberg, 66. Instead, the company's chairman and
second-largest shareholder, Summerfield K. Johnston Jr., will
temporarily reassume the chief executive title he held until
Schimberg became CEO in April, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next year or so, our board will name a new chief
executive officer,'' Johnston, 67, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and observers were divided over the meaning of
that decision for the world's largest soft-drink bottler, which has
66,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that they don't have their ducks in a row,'' said
Manny Goldman, global beverage analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``I don't
think the changes reflect a permanent organization yet. Otherwise,
you'd have a permanent CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the passing of the baton into the
next generation of CCE management, and it's done in an evolutionary
fashion,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter. ``If John Alm continues to successfully operate CCE, he is
the leading candidate for chief executive.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, generally
agreed with Conway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now know that the day-to-day operations of the company will
be run by John Alm, who is very experienced and well-regarded,''
Sicher said.
</P>
<P>
   Alm came to CCE in 1991 as chief financial officer. Before that,
he spent 11 years in senior management positions at the Johnston
Coca-Cola Bottling Group, which merged with CCE in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg's retirement, which was originally scheduled for April
17, has been the subject of much consternation on Wall Street and
in the industry. Some analysts have attributed part of the
company's recent stock price slide to the unsettled nature of the
transition, which the company moved to clarify Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg said he was retiring early because of ``my confidence
that I am leaving Coca-Cola Enterprises in the hand of an
exceptionally deep and strong management team who will capitalize
on the vast opportunities I see ahead of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have repeatedly spoken in glowing terms about
Schimberg's tenure at CCE. Goldman has referred to Schimberg as the
``Michael Jordan'' of the bottling industry. And Conway called him
the ``world's premier bottling executive. There has never been a
more successful operator than Henry Schimberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg has spent more than 40 years in the business, starting
out as a route driver. He is credited with helping to turn around
CCE after coming to the company in a merger in 1991. He
decentralized much of the management structure so more decisions
were made at the local level, where soft drinks are sold.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, revenues have multiplied three-fold _ through
internal growth and acquisitions _ under Schimberg's and Johnston's
leadership. CCE now accounts for about 74 percent of the Coca-Cola
system's case sales in North America, with more than $14 billion in
annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg will be a tough act for Alm to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry became a legend in the industry,'' Sicher said. ``He'll
be a hard to replace, but CCE has a very deep and talented
management team, thanks largely to Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Alm and Norman Findley were named principal operating
officers of the company, with Wall Street betting that one of them
would succeed Schimberg.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Alm was given responsibility for overseeing all
operations in the central and western parts of the United States
and Canada, while Findley was in charge of the eastern United
States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In June, less than two months after that management change, two
CCE plants in Europe were blamed for making nearly 250 Belgians
ill. The resulting product recall cost $103 million and put a major
blemish on Coke's image.
</P>
<P>
   Schimberg has called that experience the worst of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one is good and 10 is as bad as it gets, this is a 9.85,''
Schimberg said in a recent interview with The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A few analysts speculated that the recall, which happened on
Findley's watch, might have hurt his chances to beat out Alm for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, disagreed, especially since Findley also
oversaw the subsequent rebound.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Findley was named to the newly created job of
executive vice president of business development, responsible for
the company's strategic planning. He will continue to oversee the
European operations until a successor is named, which analysts
expect to happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, Schimberg will remain on the CCE board and
serve as a consultant to the Coke system.

 &HT;    Ill Albanian children going home soon, thanks to American
doctors
 &HT;    By Rebecca Thatcher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With peace slowly settling in Kosovo, Dirajet
Shumoli looks forward to returning with her young daughter _ her
healthy daughter _ to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   The pair came to Central Texas six weeks ago because 3-year-old
Azara was struggling with a lack of oxygen in her blood and was
dying of a heart defect.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Azara is recovering from open heart surgery performed
Sept. 16 at Children's Hospital of Austin and is expected to have a
normal life. Her mother has ambitious plans for the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to be a doctor someday so she can help other
children,'' Shumoli said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Azara was one of five children from Kosovo with serious heart
maladies who came to Central Texas in September, as U.S.-led
intervention brought an end to the Serbian government's bloody
campaign against the ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Austin pediatric heart surgeons performed the operations, and
four children have already returned to Kosovo. Azara, whose heart
did not work properly because her arteries were in the wrong
places, is taking a little longer to recover from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   She was given the OK to head home Monday after a checkup showed
that steroid medication was working to reduce fluid around her
heart, said Lois Reiter, wife of Dr. Charles Reiter. The Temple,
Texas heart surgeon met the children while volunteering in Kosovo
and committed himself to helping them.
</P>
<P>
   A medical transportation company donated the families' air fare.
They stayed at the Ronald McDonald House in Temple, and they
received free passes to Sea World when the children had recovered
from surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons donated their time. Children's Hospital donated
Azara's surgery and performed four others at cost, expected to be
about $75,000 total.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Reiter said he has raised about $30,000 of the hospital
bill and will pay the rest himself if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them (Children's Hospital) that if I didn't get the
money, I'd pay it. It may take me about a year, but I'll do it,''
he said. ``I think it's a great privilege to be allowed to help
these kids out. I've never been allowed to do anything like this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian physician who had been caring for the children, the
only cardiologist in Kosovo, had only a 25-year-old sonogram
machine to examine the children. An echocardiograph has been
donated, allowing the physician to keep an eye on the fluid around
Azara's heart, Lois Reiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Shumaker, Children's Hospital administrator, said the
hospital staff was also honored to be involved in helping children
who have had such difficult lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The families were really gracious and certainly
extraordinarily grateful to everyone,'' Shumaker said. ``Most of us
really have no concept of what their world is like.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephan Dewan, head of pediatric cardiothoracic surgery at
Children's Hospital, said Azara was lucky in a sense because her
type of heart problem is generally unrepairable by the time
patients are 3. The same heart defect in an American baby would be
repaired when the baby is about a week old, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll hardly ever see a child like that in the United
States,'' he said. ``It makes it interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sima Grainca, the families' interpreter, said the families, all
ethnic Albanians, were amazed at the kindness and generosity of
Central Texans. The health-care system in Kosovo is fairly
primitive, she said, and the families had become accustomed to bias
and corruption among Serbian health-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   They especially appreciated being able to stay with their
children at the hospital because they had often been forced to
leave their children alone in Serbian hospitals, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stayed every night and every day with the children in the
hospital'' in Austin, she said. ``It's very nice. They liked it a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties in Kosovo, the Shumolis are eager to go
home, Grainca said. ``It's much better for us Albanians,'' she
said. ``The most important thing is the war stopped. The killing
stopped. There is peace now.''

WHITHER `NYPD BLUE'?; `WASTELAND' WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pressure is on ABC to find a positive solution to the public
relations fiasco regarding its tentative decision to dislodge
``NYPD Blue'' from its longtime home on Tuesday nights at 10.
</P>
<P>
   The fiasco is of the network's own making because of its
maneuvering to find the best scheduling opportunity for the show
that displaced ``NYPD Blue'' on Tuesdays, supposedly temporarily: a
highly praised new drama called ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC Entertainment chairman Stu Bloomberg told Steven Bochco,
executive producer of ``NYPD Blue,'' last week that ABC was
considering leaving ``Once and Again'' where it was and moving
``NYPD Blue.'' Bochco, expecting his show to be back in its regular
spot next month, was stunned by this news, since his show has been
a hit on Tuesday nights at 10 and one of the most dependable series
for ABC for the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   Bocho, who knows how to make noise, made a lot of it. ABC ended
up appearing as if it cared more about a new show, ``Once and
Again,'' that is owned by the network's parent company, Walt
Disney, than an old reliable it does not own. And the network
risked giving the impression that it did not care much about the
fans of a longtime hit series.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said last week that a scheduling decision would
be made this week. Ed Dandridge, an ABC spokesman, said Tuesday
that ``we won't have a decision until later in the week.'' That is
the extent of the network's official comment on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes the schedule plotting is intense and
complicated because it involves not only the ABC Entertainment
division but very likely its affiliate relations division and
possibly its news division as well.
</P>
<P>
   ABC is apparently considering moving ``NYPD Blue'' to Thursday
nights at 9. The network certainly has a hole there: a new series,
``Wasteland,'' has performed poorly and will surely soon be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   But giving a 9 p.m. slot to a show that redefined the boundaries
of the 10 p.m. drama for network television, complete with language
never heard before and body parts never seen before, is giving
pause to some at ABC. It could be especially worrying to
ABC-affiliated stations in the Central time zone, which would be
compelled to broadcast ``NYPD Blue'' at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Many stations had deep concerns about the content of ``NYPD
Blue'' when it first went on the air. Fifty-seven ABC stations held
off broadcasting it on the air for a while. One Central time ABC
affiliate, in Dallas, kept it off for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible place for the show would be on Mondays at 10
p.m., after ``Monday Night Football'' ends for the season. But ABC
executives would much rather hold the 9-to-11 p.m. spot for movies
because ABC has a large backlog this season. And the network would
like a permanent solution to this problem, not one that would
create another problem next football season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives have defended their decision to move ``NYPD
Blue'' by saying that if ``Once and Again'' is removed from the 10
p.m. spot on Tuesdays, a rival show, CBS's ``Judging Amy,'' which
is already developing into a hit, could become an instant smash by
inherit many of the women now watching ``Once and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   But if ABC is really into the game of holding down the competing
networks, it has a more obvious place to relocate ``NYPD Blue''
that would not raise any issues with affiliates who prefer that it
appear later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ABC could move ``NYPD Blue'' to Thursday nights at 10. But any
mention of such a move usually brings gasps from network schedulers
because it would mean going up against the juggernaut ``ER'' on
NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``E.R.'' is inching up in the ratings this season, making it
seem even less vulnerable despite its aging status. But one reason
``E.R.'' has remained so unassailable is that no network has really
tried to assail it, at least not lately. ``E.R.'' has gotten a pass
of sorts by having to face only news magazines as network
competition since the demise of ``Murder One'' in the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, that was another series created by Bochco, so he
may be loath to take on ``E.R.'' again. But ``E.R.,'' like all
great series, has lost some of its hold on viewers and it has also
become much more appealing to women than men.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives have complained for years that NBC maintains its
position as the leading network for advertisers almost exclusively
because of its dominance of Thursday night. If ABC took even a
small bite out of NBC on Thursday, it would erode some of NBC's big
margins.
</P>
<P>
   Going to Thursday at 9 p.m. would mean that ``NYPD Blue'' would
face another NBC hit, the strong comedy ``Frazier,'' though it
would clearly have an advantage over the weaker comedy ``Stark
Raving Mad'' at 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But at 9 p.m. six networks are competing for viewers and both
UPN and WB have success stories at that hour: wrestling on UPN and
``Charmed'' on WB. At 10 p.m. only three networks compete.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC news division would become involved if ABC opted for the
10 p.m. slot because ABC's news magazine there, the low-rated
``20/20 Downtown,'' would have to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC news executives have described that program all along as
an experiment of sorts, and experiments can air at 9 p.m. as well
as they can an hour later. At 9 p.m. ``20/20'' would not face
another news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is ABC to make the move to pit ``NYPD Blue'' against
``ER''? If the history of networks summoning up the courage to take
on ``ER.'' is any indication, not very. But moving ``NYPD Blue'' to
9 p.m. may not help the show much more and could surely bring a
different sort of backlash against ABC, which already could expect
a strong primary backlash from the ``NYPD Blue'' viewers whose
loyalty the network may be shrugging off by moving the show in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   `Wasteland' Worries
</P>
<P>
   The reason ABC says it is holding off the ``NYPD Blue'' decision
until Friday _ aside from Friday's being the best day to announce
news certain to bring negative reaction _ is to check the ratings
one more time for ``Wasteland.'' But that series started slowly and
collapsed in its second time out, with only about half as many
viewers as ``Charmed'' on WB. ``Wasteland'' is probably going to be
canceled officially on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If it is canceled, this will be further evidence for those who
predicted that the networks that were trying to beat WB at its
teen-age game were taking a wrongheaded approach. Already some of
the would-be WB imitators have been less than warmly received,
including ``Get Real'' on Fox and ``Freaks and Geeks'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even include ``Manchester Prep,'' a would-be WB
clone on Fox that was deemed unwatchable by Fox executives and
canceled before it was even broadcast.

 &HT;    President of BellSouth's ISP brings offbeat outlook to work
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``We don't do a lot of chest-pounding,'' says Ray
Smetz, president of BellSouth.net, the online arm of BellSouth. But
the company could if it wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   DotNet, as it's sometimes referred to, is one of the top 10
Internet service providers in the country, with 650,000
subscribers. It hopes to reach 1 million by the middle of next
year. The company also has the second highest number of customers
in the Southeast, behind America Online and ahead of neighbor
MindSpring. But hardly anybody knows that.
</P>
<P>
   Smetz, like MindSpring Chairman Charles Brewer, has an offbeat
management style. Smetz combines a personal touch with a definite
corporate vision. He has a self-effacing sense of humor and a love
of gadgets. (While sending a message on his interactive pager, he
looks up sheepishly and says, ``I can do this without looking, but
I'm not particularly proud of it.'')
</P>
<P>
   He's also one of the few Net executives who seems to really
enjoy surfing the Web for fun, as well as profit.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old also has a well-thought-out strategy for keeping
DotNet _ as it is affectionately called by employees to
differentiate it from its stodgier parent _ in the hearts and minds
of users and potential users. He takes his job seriously, but it's
easy to tell he's having fun running an Internet company at the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get killed for showing you this,'' Smetz says,
popping in an in-house video shown at a recent gathering of DotNet
employees. It's a parody of the recent Austin Powers movie with
Smetz done up as the villainous Dr. Evil in a skit called ``The Spy
Who Buzzed Me.'' He flips off the video and flashes a boyish grin.
``Our culture is very different from the phone company culture,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strategy seems to be working. Since BellSouth went
into the Internet business in August 1996, the division's growth
has been exponential. Last year the company had about 200
employees, the most recent count is 750.
</P>
<P>
   The company has already outgrown its original offices and moved
to another building. Now its almost bursting out of the new space.
</P>
<P>
   The service is available in 47 markets in the Southeast and has
developed a portal service called BellSouth Buzz to serve users in
the nine-state region. The portal, with everything from online
auctions to stock quotes and movie information, will drive traffic
and generate revenue from Web surfers looking for local information
who aren't BellSouth.net subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regional strategy really works well for us,'' Smetz says.
although he admits that having BellSouth pitch his service to every
new telephone customer has given it something of an edge.
``Bundling products and having our bill on the phone bill is a
tremendous advantage,'' he says. ``Think about it, we are the first
or second call you make when you move into the region. It's either
the phone company or the electric company.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a leg up from BellSouth, Smetz says building
BellSouth.net hasn't been easy. ``When we started, we had no word
of mouth, no following.''
</P>
<P>
   DotNet was also in the shadow of Midtown Atlanta-based
MindSpring. Still a regional provider, it had already established
its reputation as the region's hip Net address with an offbeat
approach to business and an emphasis on customer service.
</P>
<P>
   But it has never been Smetz's intention to let the MindSpring or
even the AOL bandwagon roll over DotNet. Wearing a company T-shirt
with the motto ``winning in the war zone,'' Smetz says competition
is inevitable, but winning is the ultimate objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my mottos is `clear thinking in the war zone,''' he
says. ``Everybody wants to eat our lunch. We want to win. If you
are in the trenches with your teammates you are going to pull
together to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes the way to motivate his team to push DotNet to
regional users is to aggressively market the service.
</P>
<P>
   The current ads for BellSouth feature kids, a female repair
technician and a BellSouth ``bucket truck'' used t repair phone
lines. It's all very calculated to target women, kids and other
potential users who like BellSouth's other services.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forbid we should have a bucket truck in the ad,'' Smetz
says. ``But it was a way to tie our service to BellSouth and
develop an image of our service as a brand you can trust. I think
what's happening is that people will go where the most reliable
service is,'' he says. ``As the Net becomes more necessary, people
are going to want something reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is big and nobody's going to have all of it,''
he says simply. ``We just want a really big piece of it.''

`VIETNAM: THE NECESSARY WAR': U.S. PRESTIGE AND GLOBAL CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review) 
(bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Lind begins this intrepid re-examination of the Vietnam
War with a scene from what used to be called the international
Communist conspiracy: Mao Tse-tung, Josef Stalin and Ho Chi Minh
standing side by side at a banquet in Moscow in 1950. To Lind, that
moment reveals an underappreciated truth. Many writers over the
years have portrayed Ho as a Vietnamese nationalist first and a
communist second and thus a leader who was turned needlessly into
an enemy by ignorant and clumsy U.S. actions. In Lind's different
view, he was a committed Stalinist tyrant who from the very
beginning belonged to the forces arrayed against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lind returns to Ho several times in ``Vietnam: The Necessary
War,'' which rejects the vision of the war that might be described
as conventionally liberal, that it was a tragic mistake from the
start. Lind's main point about Ho is that he was a willing and
enthusiastic proxy for the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and it is
the Cold War that furnishes Lind with his main analytical concept.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War was necessary, Lind argues, because it was a
part of the global and epochal conflict between the United States
and the Soviet Union, a conflict that was an extension of the great
hot wars of the century. To have yielded without a fight to a
Soviet-sponsored takeover of South Vietnam would have resulted in a
realignment of global forces in Moscow's favor, Lind contends. He
then gives this not very unusual argument a new twist:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was necessary for the United States to escalate the war in
the mid-1960s in order to defend the credibility of the United
States as a superpower, but it was necessary for the United States
to forfeit the war after 1968 in order to preserve the American
domestic political consensus in favor of the Cold War on other
fronts,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Lind's view, in other words, is that Lyndon B. Johnson did well
by escalating the war in 1964-65 but that Richard M. Nixon did
badly by failing to withdraw from the conflict more quickly, before
mounting U.S. casualties sapped the country's willingness to fight
the Cold War on its many other fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam remains an issue around which opinions have the
unyielding character of religious conviction, so it is unlikely
that Lind will change many minds with this book. Nonetheless, it is
a forceful and fresh look at the conflict, a book whose conclusions
correspond to none of the already well-established positions. Lind
is devastatingly hard on the anti-war left, whose arguments he
slices up with a keen analytical razor. But he also effectively
refutes what might be the main charge made from the other side of
the spectrum _ that a timid civilian apparatus tied the military's
hands, denying it permission to get the enemy where he was, in
North Vietnam, and thereby bringing about a shameful and needless
defeat. It is far from clear that he is correct in everything he
says. But Lind, whose earlier books, like ``The Next American
Nation'' and ``Up From Conservatism,'' showed him to be a bold and
unconventional thinker, continues impressively to be one here.
</P>
<P>
   His argument hinges on several propositions. One is that the
Vietnam War was not an isolated episode that the United States
slipped into almost by accident and fought as a matter of pride; it
was part of the battle for global supremacy itself. Second, Lind
contends, the Vietnam War was justified, not because democracy in
South Vietnam was threatened (he agrees that it never existed) but
because of that country's strategic importance. Third, the
strategic stakes had to do not with controlling the territory of
Vietnam but with prestige and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Lind is not a balance-of-power theorist. He advocates a
bandwagon school of thought, the idea that nations align themselves
with the side that they perceive to be riding the crest of
historical power, which, if the Vietnam War had not been fought,
would have been the Soviet Union. As Lind puts it:
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary danger facing the United States was the likelihood
that if the Soviet Union and/or China helped a proxy state
annihilate an American protectorate, the Soviet Union and China
would be dangerously emboldened, while weak American allies and
neutrals around the world would be frightened into appeasing one or
the other of the two communist great powers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lind mounts a strong argument for that point of view. It is what
might be called the forfeit scenario that seems less solid. To
fight a war on behalf of an ally and then to abandon that war (and
the ally) when the going gets tough seems a dubious principle of
behavior for a superpower. Lind argues that the war and the ally
were abandoned later anyway, at great cost to U.S. prestige and
with the loss of 25,000 more American lives. Those costs, and
especially the cost in lives, cannot be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not seem at all sure, had the war been forfeited in
1968, that the United States would not have suffered the very sort
of blow to its credibility that the war was fought to avoid.
Indeed, it seems likely that a quick withdrawal after 1968 might
have enhanced Soviet prestige even more than the final Indochinese
debacle of 1975 did. China, for example, which in 1972 joined with
the United States in an anti-Soviet alliance, might have felt
compelled to join the bandwagon with the Soviet Union if the United
States had jettisoned Vietnam in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the withdrawal engineered by Nixon and his national
security adviser, Henry Kissinger, left South Vietnam intact.
Kissinger has argued that what led to the eventual debacle was,
first, the Watergate affair, which crippled Nixon politically, and,
second, the consequent refusal of Congress to provide aid to the
South Vietnamese even after Hanoi began its final offensive. Lind
states that only a permanent U.S. troop presence, as in Korea,
could have safeguarded a non-communist Vietnam, but he makes no
real argument to support this position, which readers are under no
obligation to take on faith.
</P>
<P>
   One wants, in other words, to debate Lind, whose main
shortcoming is not that his position is poorly argued but that on
certain points it is not argued enough. Still, his forceful polemic
is one of those rare books that really deserve the overused
modifier provocative. Lind makes you think about matters in ways
you hadn't thought before.

 &HT;    CONSUMER GROUP CALLS FOR LABELING GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans should be informed whenever food they buy
contains products from farm crops that contain transplanted genes,
a representative of the Consumers Union told a House committee
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery manufacturers are not required in the United States to
disclose on food labels that a product contains genetically
engineered products, such as corn that carries a gene to kill
insects or potatoes that contain a virus gene.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, consumers have no way of knowing when they purchase
such products _ which government officials and agriculture industry
spokesmen insist are safe and carefully regulated. Roughly 35
percent of the U.S. corn crop and more than half of soybeans come
from seed engineered to contain foreign genetic material, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Silbergeld, co-director of the Washington office of the
Consumers Union, told the House Science Committee that polls
indicate Americans overwhelmingly want to know if products
contained food from genetically engineered crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not what's going on,'' Silbergeld said. ``The
industry and the government are saying, 'You don't want to know.'''
</P>
<P>
   Silbergeld appeared before the committee, along with officials
of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug
Administration and the Department of Agriculture. All the
government officials defended the regulatory framework, which
attempts to make sure new crops containing transplanted genes are
safe but, once they are approved, does not require them to be
labeled as genetically engineered.
</P>
<P>
   A number of consumer and environmental groups recently launched
an advertising campaign aimed at calling attention to lack of
labeling requirements. The ads contain a variety of warnings,
ranging from the possibility of new allergens in food to the
distant danger that Jews and Muslims might one day find themselves
unknowingly eating food with pig genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlabeled, untested ... and you're eating it,'' stated a
full-page newspaper ad by the groups this week. ``In secret,
genetically engineered foods are showing up on American grocery
shelves. Though other countries now label biotech foods, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration still does not require labels or
safety tests... .''
</P>
<P>
   Silbergeld told the committee that he did not know of any foods
that are unsafe because they contain genetically engineered
products and added that labeling ``need not be a
skull-and-crossbones'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see this as a science issue,'' he said. ``We see it
as a right-to-know issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although only a handful of members of the committee attended the
hearing, most seemed to agree with Rep. Nick Smith, R-Minn., who
charged that ``anti-biotech activists are taking advantage of
consumers' natural tendency to be wary of products which are new
and about which they know little.''
</P>
<P>
   Several expressed concern about growing trade tension between
the United States and European countries that require labeling _ or
prohibit genetically engineered foods altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying by closed-circuit television from his office in
Lincoln, Neb., University of Nebraska food scientist Stephen Taylor
warned of many unforeseeable problems ahead in the trade talks over
the food products.
</P>
<P>
   He told of a Nebraska popcorn producer who exported his corn to
Europe as not genetically modified but had a shipment rejected
because the farmer across the road was using a genetically altered
strain, and pollen drifted across the road, causing some of the
first farmer's corn to contain detectable levels of the
transplanted gene.
</P>
<P>
   Silbergeld warned that U.S. consumers will resist genetically
engineered food as vigorously as Europeans if they are forced to
accept it without being told.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want the right to choose and so long as you say, 'You
don't need to worry about it. Just take what we give you,' you're
not going to get their cooperation,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Earlier this month Pat Quigley, the president and
chief executive of Capitol Nashville records, sat in his office
with a computer printout of the previous week's national CD sales
spread across his table.
</P>
<P>
   He had just seen the first-week numbers for Garth Brooks'
ambitious new project, an apocryphal greatest-hits rock album
released under the pseudonym Chris Gaines, and Quigley was far from
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, the Oklahoma-bred superstar, and Quigley, the brash New
Yorker, knew that the Chris Gaines record would hardly sell as well
as Brooks' country albums, which have shattered sales records by
selling as many as a million copies in one week. But the label had
sent 3 million copies of the rock album to stores, expecting sales
of around 400,000 in its first week. Instead it sold only 262,000
copies, coming in at No. 2 in the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our fault,'' Quigley muttered. ``Fans were confused. We
have to do a better job educating them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Quigley's enemies in Nashville, this was a day of
celebration. Since he moved here from New York just over two years
ago, he has made few friends. Upon his arrival, the local
alternative weekly blared a blood-red headline, ``The Outsider:
Will He Destroy Music Row?,'' and soon after, The Chicago Tribune
dubbed him ``the least liked man in Nashville.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Quigley has done little to change his status as
an outsider. An unapologetic New Yorker, he was wearing a gray East
Hampton sweatshirt and instead of beer in his office, there was a
glass-front refrigerator full of wine bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm certainly not one of them,'' he said, referring to the
denizens of Music Row. ``I don't believe I'll ever be accepted as
one of them. They're probably not going to be in my social calendar
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley is emblematic of the juncture at which Nashville now
finds itself, caught between the old small-town, family-style way
of doing business and a big-city, results-driven attitude,
especially now that the business has been rocked by cutbacks from
the labels' multinational parent companies. The tension is found
not just in country music, with the taste gap widening between
older legends like George Jones and contemporary pop stars like
Shania Twain, but in the city itself, where country charm is being
paved over to make way for urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   The kitschy Opryland amusement park was torn down for a
gargantuan mall, and the once-rustic honky-tonk-filled downtown is
now overrun by scaffolding and cranes promising a shiny
cosmopolitan future. Add to this Dell Computer's recently announced
plan to relocate part of its operations to the Nashville area, the
construction of a $192 million stadium and $140 million arena (plus
NHL and NFL teams to put inside them), and a metro-area population
that has boomed past the 1 million mark, and you have a city with
major growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley is adding to those pains. A strong-willed stranger whose
heart and head remain entrenched in New York and his international
marketing background, he is bent on remaking country in his own
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get Town and Country magazine, and it's very elegant
magazine,'' he said, settling into a couch in his office. ``Country
for me in Manhattan was the Hamptons. Why does country have to be
some backwards place in `Deliverance'?
</P>
<P>
   ``As I watch what is selling in country, the superstars making
traditional country aren't moving big volume anymore. It's the
poppier influenced country music that's really moving the big
volume. Look at the statistics: Faith Hill's No. 1 market is New
York City; Shania Twain's is New York City; Garth's is either New
York, Los Angeles or Chicago. As you start to see the New York,
Chicago, and Los Angeles influence, I think country music gets
afraid that it's losing its identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing his part to add to the identity crisis, Quigley, 49, has
registered the words ``town and country'' as a trademark for music,
hoping to dress country up in new clothes that will make it look
less rural and more middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I own those words for music,'' he said proudly. ``When I do
town and country music, it will also be Bruce Springsteen, Bonnie
Raitt, Bob Seger. America is so much better educated than a lot of
the music this town makes.'' Although Quigley's ambition to think
nationally instead of regionally when selling country music (just
as the pop-music industry has begun to think internationally
instead of just nationally) seems good for the genre, almost every
move he has made here has been dogged by protest or controversy.
These range from his ascendancy as president of Capitol Nashville
(even his supporters say it was a result of a coup engineered by a
disgruntled Garth Brooks) to the unorthodox techniques he has used
to market his albums. Those include paying radio stations to
announce the names of Capitol acts after playing their music,
lowering the prices of new records below the industry norm, and
taking Brooks' old albums off the market before releasing a box set
of his past music.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a music scene as tight-knit and familial as Nashville's,
Quigley makes no attempts to be a team player. This is evident in
Capitol's absence from the board of the Country Music Association,
and in the location of its offices.
</P>
<P>
   While all the other major labels in Nashville are lined up along
the parallel streets of town houses and small office buildings
known as Music Row, Capitol Nashville sits in an anonymous building
more than a mile away. The label's previous president had planned
to relocate to Music Row, but one of the first things Quigley did
when he took over was to break the lease, at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Capitol's isolationism, other record labels have
not been quick to leap to the company's aid. Concerned that no
radio station plays country music in a market as vital as New York,
Quigley once offered to buy half the advertising time of a
prospective New York broadcaster if it would take on a country
format, but only if the other labels in Nashville agreed to buy the
other half. They unanimously declined.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley probably would have been driven out of town if his label
were not doing so well, a success owed to the sales juggernaut that
is Brooks. Even one of Quigley's detractors on Music Row, speaking
on condition of anonymity, admitted: ``While a lot of the music
industry was down on the fact that Pat lowered the price on Garth's
CD's, he shipped 32 million units. I don't think anyone has done
that before or is likely to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year one in every 10 country records that sold was a Brooks
album, making Capitol the most profitable label in town. Although
rival executives may be impressed, they refer condescendingly to
Quigley as a ``Garth robot,'' a figurehead at a label they say is
run by the singer whose album sales pay its bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read something the other day that called me `the
self-proclaimed yes man of Garth,''' Quigley said. ``I do what he
wants _  &UR; my way. &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wariner, a respected singer and songwriter since the early
'70s who began recording for Capitol Nashville last year, said he
had witnessed many arguments between Quigley and Brooks. ``As far
as Pat being a yes man to Garth, that's not true,'' he said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Wariner said one of the reasons he chose to sign with Capitol,
besides his friendship with Brooks, was Quigley's style. Wariner
recalled his first meeting with Quigley: ``He said: `I know your
name. Garth's talked about you. Some of the people here have talked
about you. But I've never heard of you. I don't know any of your
music. I don't know anything about you.' I thought it was
refreshing, and I loved the honesty of the approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is, I lean on Pat a little bit because he does
not want people in Nashville to like him,'' Wariner added. ``He
makes statements that I wish he wouldn't. I find myself defending
him a lot.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Spending time with Quigley, one realizes that one of the most
repeated criticisms about him is true: He is a marketing man, not a
music man. With a background of selling everything from skis to
watches to beer, he is representative of a new breed of executive
in the recording industry, where the music men _ the former
songwriters and producers who have dominated the business _ are
being replaced by international businessmen who could just as
easily be selling Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Quigley often refers to Capitol Nashville not as a record label
but as a marketing company. He is not an executive who uses his
ears, but one who uses his eyes, analyzing audience research
statistics and sales charts. When playing music from a new album by
Keith Urban, who collaborated with the rhythm-and-blues producer
Stevie J., Quigley stopped the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to that lyric, `You're the only one,''' he said.
``Doesn't everyone want to hear that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for Keith to get the female agenda and apply it
to a sensitive new man,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that is not too surprising, considering the sudden
explosion of all-female country groups, Quigley has also been
looking to create a country equivalent of the Backstreet Boys, or,
as he likes to call his pet project, the Backwoods Boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're deep in the inquiry process,'' he said. ``I want these
kids to have something to say to normal people, to America. But
they can't talk to the inner city. They have to talk about
small-town life. That's where America is, that's where their heart
is. Whether you live on 79th Street or Main Street in some small
town, you want to care about each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should be the goal of Nashville to have 33 percent
of all pop radio air play country, and none of the country air play
pop,'' he continued. ``We're culturally important. We're not just
dinosaurs here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So far the Chris Gaines project has been Quigley's first
significant setback in Nashville. Although the album has made
Brooks the butt of many jokes around town, Quigley remains
optimistic about the singer's future. He plans to resuscitate
Brooks' country career quickly with an album of Christmas songs.
And rival executives in Nashville will not be too happy about the
cutthroat price he plans for the full-length CD: $11.99, or $9.99
with a special offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on my family sometimes because there's very little
positive in this town,'' Quigley said. ``But they've got a nice
house, a nice car and a father who seems to be very happy with what
he does. We'll get through it.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous jet stream flow from southwestern Canada into the
northeastern United States will direct a series of disturbances
with chilly air and patchy precipitation toward the Eastern States
during the next several days. Sprawling high pressure will keep
most of the West sunny and unseasonably warm.
</P>
<P>
   A frontal system will gather moisture from over the Atlantic as
it moves to the Eastern Seaboard on Wednesday. Periods of rain will
dampen a large area from New England to the Carolina coast. Some
wet snow will fall in the highest elevations of northern New
England. Farther south, a few thundershowers will be embedded in
the rain area near the Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, clouds and sprinkles will linger into
the afternoon near the Appalachians. A few heavier showers will
occur near the eastern shores of Lakes Huron and Ontario. Gradual
clearing will spread east from the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys
during the day as high pressure moves east from the Mississippi
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty breezes from the west will deliver milder air from the
northern Rockies to the Plains. Abundant sunshine will help boost
afternoon temperatures 8 to 16 degrees above the seasonal average.
Farther west, offshore breezes will bring another very warm day to
much of coastal California.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Jose with central winds near 85 mph will lash the
northern Leeward Islands on Wednesday. The storm will affect the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico with high winds and heavy rain
Wednesday night and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Speedy Storm &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday, Hurricane Irene was racing at 63 mph over the
North Atlantic Ocean _ about as fast as any storm moves across the
face of the earth. Storms are carried by high-level winds that
derive their energy primarily from horizontal temperature
contrasts. Hurricanes in the Tropics, where thermal contrasts are
weak, typically move less than 15 mph. When hurricanes reach the
middle latitudes they can accelerate with startling rapidity. The
fastest moving hurricane to reach the United States tore into New
England at nearly 60 mph in September 1938.

VENTURA'S SINGLE SENDS BASEBALL TO A NEW LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The best play of the baseball season violated
its most fundamental rule. In fact, ``touch 'em all'' has risen
above the game, becoming a universal prescription for excellence
through thoroughness.
</P>
<P>
   But let's salute Robin Ventura of the New York Mets for his
sloppiness, for disregarding the fundamentals. He touched only one
base in the 15th inning Sunday night, skipping the last three,
turning a grand slam into a single.
</P>
<P>
   So why did I hope that young sports fans everywhere were
watching, taking note? Why did I hope that they savored the moment
when Ventura decided that he wanted to be hugged by his Mets
teammates more than he wanted to go on record as the first player
to hit a game-winning grand slam in the postseason?
</P>
<P>
   Because the pursuit of individual glory has become the most
corrosive element in team sports. Because even though I am
generally more amused than annoyed by end-zone dances, I have
become increasingly alienated by the number of football players who
peel away from teammates after a touchdown so that no one
interferes with their choreographed celebrations. In the ultimate
team sport, they want to dance alone.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's abbreviated home-run trot smacked individualism way,
way out of the park. He only needed to bring in one run for the
win, and that's all he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had enough,'' he said after the 4-3 victory, when a
television reporter suggested that he circle the bases belatedly to
try to make the home run count. One RBI, on what is now being
called the grand single, and his team had a win in the bottom of
the 15th. He had prevented the Atlanta Braves from claiming the
National League pennant at Shea Stadium. Enough, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the 1994 strike, nothing has elevated baseball
quite so high as this moment. The Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home-run
races had higher profiles, but, for all their pageantry, those
spectacles still highlighted single players rather than team play.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's hit completed a grand piece of theater. It was 15
innings of baseball at its best, a beautiful display of the game's
timelessness. It made Mets fans out of people otherwise weary of
New York, disgusted by Bobby Valentine's ego and suspicious of Mike
Piazza's paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Before Ventura came Shawon Dunston leading off the 15th and
setting a perfect example. His tenacious at-bat included six
two-strike foul balls, backed by immeasurable determination. In the
top of the inning, he had allowed the Braves to score a go-ahead
run by misplaying a fly ball into a triple. He was in center field
at the time, out of position on a rainy night, but happily filling
a hole for his team.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston entered baseball as an exalted prince, a No. 1 draft
pick, a shortstop with see-the-replays-on-SportsCenter panache.
</P>
<P>
   He never did become a superstar, though. His success was modest,
and so was he. He eventually became known as a battler rather than
a natural.
</P>
<P>
   And that's who he was at the plate in the bottom of the 15th,
fighting to make up for the mistake in center, fouling off pitch
after pitch until he finally found one he liked and rapped it up
the middle for a single. Dunston scored the tying run and later
credited the New York fans for exhorting him to forget about his
play in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura would say that Dunston's at-bat motivated him, as did
Todd Pratt's patient wait for a walk. The Mets, a team assembled
with the usual high-priced glue and staples of modern free agency,
were acting like a team of neighborhood kids who had played
together since kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   What a perfect antidote to the presumption that baseball can't
thrive in the turn-of-millennium climate. Purists _ this one
included _ have been utterly rebuked in the postseason of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thrills have come from the Mets and the
now-vanquished Red Sox. Five years ago, neither of them would have
made it into the playoffs. The wild card, a modern innovation, kept
them in action.
</P>
<P>
   Even Fox's in-dugout microphone, bane of traditionalists,
provided a priceless moment Sunday night. Chris Chambliss, now a
Yankees coach, wore a mike and expressed dismay when he heard that
Ventura's home run had been downgraded. The TV crew had already
shown a clip of Chambliss' 1976 pennant-winning home run against
Kansas City, when he had to run like an NFL fullback to get through
the mob of fans who had clamored onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that lousy or what?'' he said of Ventura's canceled homer.
</P>
<P>
   Team trainer Gene Monahan replied: ``You've got to go around the
bases, just like you had to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss drily reminded him: ``I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   His trip down memory lane was hilariously right on course.
</P>
<P>
   But he was wrong about Ventura's grand single. It wasn't lousy
at all.

 &HT;    Southern Co. posts record profit for third quarter
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. on Tuesday reported record net income of
$615 million for the third quarter, a 19 percent increase from last
year's comparable period.
</P>
<P>
   The increase was attributed to high summer electricity demand,
overseas operations and U.S. wholesale energy sales.
</P>
<P>
   Net income of 90 cents a share was well above the average
forecast of 79 cents per share by analysts surveyed by First Call.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter last year, Southern Co. earned $517
million, or 74 cents a share. Revenue for the third quarter of 1999
was $3.74 billion, compared with $3.46 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Franklin, president and chief operating officer of the
Atlanta-based utility holding company, said net income beat
expectations due mostly to record demand for electricity during the
July-September reporting period. Southern Energy, the company's
unregulated business unit, reported $94 million in third-quarter
net income, compared with $58 million last year. Asian investments
contributed $45 million of that amount, up from $23 million a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co. said Southern Energy's net income was also boosted
by returns from new investments in power plants in New England,
California and New York. The company said one-time charges and
gains resulted in a net decrease of about $7 million in
third-quarter net income. The company reported:
</P>
<P>
   _ An after-tax gain of $78 million from the sale of its share of
the supply business of South Western Electricity, a British
utility.
</P>
<P>
   _ A $69 million write-down after taxes from Mobile Energy
Services, an Alabama subsidiary that lost its major customer when a
pulp mill closed.
</P>
<P>
   _ An after-tax charge of $16 million related to work-force
reductions at Berliner Kraft und Licht, the electric utility
serving metropolitan Berlin. Southern Co. has a 26 percent interest
in the utility.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co. for the first time also reported separate results
for telecommunications operations, primarily its Southern LINC
mobile communications unit. Telecommunications had $34 million in
revenue and a $4 million loss in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, Southern Co. shares closed at $25.43 3/4, down
50 cents.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS URGE HIGH COURT TO RULE ON PRAYER ISSUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thirteen Texas congressmen urged the Supreme Court
on Tuesday to rule that the reciting of prayers at high school
football games is constitutional, saying that God and the gridiron
are inseparable in the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San Antonio, the lawmakers proposed
a House resolution calling on the justices to rule that the First
Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom does not bar players
from praying before kickoff. The resolution, which would not have
the force of law, is intended to express publicly the ``sense of
the Congress'' that pre-game prayers are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not scheduled a vote on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers proposed the measure as the high court considers
whether to hear a Galveston County school district's appeal of a
lower court decision that struck down pre-game prayers as
unconstitutional. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans on Feb. 26 said the student-led prayers violated the
constitution's prohibition on state establishment of religion.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to decide in the next few weeks if
they will hear the Santa Fe (Texas) Independent School District's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed resolution would urge the high court to overturn
the 5th Circuit's decision and rule the pre-game prayers
constitutional. The proposal states that ``prayers at public-school
sporting events are entirely consistent with our American heritage
of seeking divine guidance and protection in all of our
undertakings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla invoked the deadly school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,
last April as he urged his colleagues to support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the recent incidents of violence in schools as evidence
of a decaying moral fiber in America, how can we prevent our
children from utilizing prayer to guide them in their endeavors?''
he said. ``If I can pull a quarter out of my pocket and read, `In
God We Trust,' how can our courts prohibit our children from asking
God to watch over them as they play a little football on a Friday
night?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, a sponsor of the resolution, said he
has often been called upon to recite prayers at high school
athletic events as a member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have some type of religious observance, a prayer, at
an athletic event,'' he said. ``You can do it and not infringe on
people's freedom of religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how the justices ultimately decide the case, one
thing will never change about Texans and their love of the
gridiron. ``People can still worship football even without a
prayer,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Texas sponsors are Reps. Joe Barton, R-Ennis; Kevin Brady,
R-The Woodlands; Larry Combest, R-Lubbock; Ralph Hall, D-Rockwall;
Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi; Ron Paul, R-Surfside Beach; Max
Sandlin Jr., D-Marshall; Pete Sessions, R-Dallas; Lamar Smith,
R-San Antonio; Charles Stenholm, D-Avoca; and Mac Thornberry,
R-Clarendon.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a
religiously diverse group that strictly interprets the First
Amendment, called the resolution a ``politically motivated'' effort
to blur the constitutional wall between government and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has blown the whistle on the inappropriate
mixing of religion and public schools in the past,'' said Barry
Lynn, the group's executive director. ``If this issue comes before
the justices, I am sure they will do so again.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, the Supreme Court in 1992 struck down as
unconstitutional a planned invocation by a rabbi at a high school
graduation in Rhode Island. The justices in Lee vs. Weisman held on
a 5-4 vote that schools may not direct a religious exercise at
graduation ceremonies, noting that students at such events have no
real alternative but to stay.
</P>
<P>
   But the Santa Fe school district, in its high-court appeal, said
the Weisman graduation case does not apply to football games.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has filed a brief urging the court to rule pre-game
prayers constitutional. Louisiana and Mississippi, the two other
states governed by the 5th Circuit, have joined Texas' brief.
</P>
<P>
   But parents of some Santa Fe students, who have so far
successfully challenged the pre-game prayers, urged the court to
reject the appeal. Pre-game prayers, like those at graduation,
violate the Constitution by subjecting players and spectators to
religious expressions with which they might disagree, wrote the
parents' attorney, Anthony Griffin of Galveston, in a brief to the
justices.

FORT WORTH HERD ROUNDING UP POSITIVE PUBLICITY FOR COWTOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ There are new signs affixed to the walls
along Mule Alley in the Fort Worth Stockyards. They are quotations
for the most part. One is a long, gloriously worded account of
Teddy Roosevelt's feeling about Texas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a diagram showing exactly where everyone is
supposed to be in a cattle drive _ the ``Drag,'' ``Point'' and
``Trail Boss'' locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one that really catches their attention,'' said
Fort Worth's trail boss, Dennis Merrell. ``I've seen tourists
taking pictures of it, copying it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are there because people can't seem to get enough
information about the overwhelmingly popular Fort Worth Herd and
the cattle business it represents. The 15-head herd of massive
longhorns has been such a promotional gold mine for Fort Worth that
it surprised even the most ardent supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau is in the process of
adding up the promotional value of the herd to the city, and the
positive publicity is about the equivalent of $1 million in
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hot attraction,'' the bureau's Gil Stotler said.
``We've had visitors from Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Japan,
China. It's mind-boggling. We couldn't ask for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fort Worth Herd has generated more publicity than Bass
Hall and the Texas Motor Speedway.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrell leads the band of cowhands who shuffle the city's
official herd up and down Exchange Avenue twice a day, every day.
When the program began in the spring, it was intended to last
through November. Now, because the longhorns have brought more
visitors to the Stockyards than any other attraction, the herd will
keep hitting the bricks right through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a wind chill of 15 or less and falling, we
probably won't go out,'' Merrell said. ``And if there is any
dangerous footing, we'll stay in. If there is ice or sleet or snow,
we won't go out, but I'll guarantee you on the days we don't go,
there won't be anyone there to watch anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is, Merrell said, his hands will be more than happy to
move some of the herd into the Cowtown Coliseum for an informal
question-and-answer session.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really what our people do best,'' he said. ``They work
one-on-one with the tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the heat of the summer, when there were days of
100-degree-plus temperatures, the herd never missed an outing. ``We
haven't missed a single drive since opening day,'' Merrell said.
``We've been as regular as Old Faithful. The first Wednesday of
every month, we take them to the river near downtown and some of
our riders cross over into downtown and pass out information.''
</P>
<P>
   When the drovers aren't herding the cattle, they are on
horseback in the Stockyards, posing for pictures, talking with
visitors, feeding the western image to tourists hungry for a cowboy
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're just giving the world the image it wants to hold
for Fort Worth and Texas,'' Merrell said. ``We get a lot of people
from overseas who think people in Texas live like this every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do anything to discourage that impression.''

 &HT;    Steakhouse chain moving into four Bertucci's sites
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Durango Steakhouse plans to open four restaurants in
metro Atlanta, its first expansion outside Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Clearwater, Fla.-based chain will take over some of the
space vacated by Bertucci's Brick Oven Pizzeria restaurants, which
has pulled out of the Atlanta market. Over the last few weeks,
Bertucci's has closed all six of its restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Durango restaurants will open at former Bertucci sites in
Marietta, Sandy Springs, Lawrenceville and Roswell. A fifth site is
under consideration elsewhere in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our studies, we think the Atlanta market can take up
to 15 units,'' said Chief Executive Officer Fred Bullard Jr. The
first Durango is expected to open in January.
</P>
<P>
   Durango offers steak, ribs and a Southwestern menu in a middle
price range.
</P>
<P>
   Bertucci's had been planning to leave the Atlanta market for
some time, said Greg Pastori, general counsel for
Massachusetts-based NE Restaurant Co., which acquired the
Bertucci's concept in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been very difficult for the company to give the
restaurants in Atlanta the proper support,'' he said. ``We didn't
think that at this time, as we are going through a refining of the
concept, that we could provide the resources needed in a new market
like Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company decided to focus its efforts on restaurants
closer to home, Pastori said. The company's restaurants are
concentrated in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and New
Jersey. He added that the company plans to return to Atlanta within
five years.
</P>
<P>
   NE had about 250 workers in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Pastori said some of those workers have already been offered
positions at Durango.

COMMENTARY: A WARM, ILLUMINATING EVENING, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KATHRYN VAN SANT   
 Santa Barbara News-Press   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ How much do you think the National Enquirer
would have given for a shot of Anne Heche rocking a baby in her
arms while Ellen DeGeneres cooed about what great mom she'd make?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're debating whether to adopt or get pregnant,'' Anne Heche
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold every baby we see, we're obnoxious,'' Ellen said. The
world's most famous openly lesbian couple finished each other's
sentences and bounced jokes off of each other with pure comedic
timing.
</P>
<P>
   The made-for-tabloids setting was a speech Ellen was supposed to
give at the University of Vermont as part of the politically
correct school's National Coming Out Week. The university has to be
on the left side of everything, being, as it is, by far the largest
school in this state whose residents keep sending a Socialist to
represent them in the U.S. House of Representatives. Vermont is
home to hippies, homesteaders, holsteins, and, perhaps soon,
homosexual marrieds. We'll get to that in a minute. Back to how
Ellen was supposed to give the speech.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, it was announced that the audience would be
getting two for the price of one, sort of like what the Clintons
were boasting about in the halcyon beginning of his first
presidential campaign. Anne Heche would be speaking, too, not just
Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of minutes in the audience, you'd start using her
first name, too. Ellen came off as affable, friendly, the type of
person for whom the term ``a real sweetheart'' was made. Anne Heche
seemed Hollyweird, as were parts of the evening, which started with
the straight members of the audience being asked to raise their
hands so the gay ones could applaud them.
</P>
<P>
   The two uber-lesbians spoke as the nation waits for the Vermont
Supreme Court to release its opinion on the legality of same-sex
marriage. The five justices' decision will have monumental
ramifications. No state or country allows two people of the same
gender to enter into a government-sanctioned marriage. The People's
Republic of Vermont, as those familiar with the state accurately
call it, blew past partner registries, medical benefits and
adoption rights for homosexuals a while ago. Now, a University of
Vermont math and statistics professor and her partner of 27 years
are among three couples who have challenged the state's marriage
law.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, their side fears losing its last live
case, while the other side fears losing God, mom and apple pie _
especially because any gays married in Vermont would surely start
demanding in other states legal benefits that heterosexual marrieds
enjoy, such as employment leave for a sick spouse, hospital family
visitation, inheritance rights, and a say-so at the spouse's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, opponents have won tighter restrictions in the
U.S. Congress and nearly three dozen states. If any place will
support same-sex marriage, it's going to be proudly progressive
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one who is keeping their fingers crossed more than
us. We'd love to celebrate (our marriage) with you,'' Heche told
the cheering audience at the university two Sundays ago on an
unseasonably warm October night for Vermont. Meanwhile in Wyoming,
there was a candlelight vigil for Matthew Shepard before one of his
accused murderers stood trial the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen was funny. She bounded on stage dressed in black, a water
bottle in hand and a bounce in her step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a dream,'' were her first words to the hushed audience,
``and in that dream I am naked and I'm playing racquetball in
Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   During her 20-minute monologue, Ellen's humor gave way to a
wobble in her voice as she spoke of being with Matthew Shepard's
parents in Washington, D.C., the night before and of feeling
terrified about violence against gays and others (``I want to bring
a baby into this world soon ... and I want to bring it into a safe
world. We need to stop the hate.'').
</P>
<P>
   Then she introduced, ``My hero and the bravest person that I
know, my wife, Anne Heche.''
</P>
<P>
   Heche had the same bounce to her step, the same black clothes,
the same water bottle, the same reference to ``my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything else about her was different. Ellen's humanist plea
for peace gave way to Heche's platitudes about ``the need to focus
on passion'' (``I walk into every single room I walk into with a
purpose, by just being who I am. I represent something great _
love.'') and pop-culture spirituality _ she more than once spoke of
herself as being on an evangelical mission.
</P>
<P>
   Then for about an hour, the two women took questions from the
audience, sitting on matching high stools, their two water bottles
on a third stool.
</P>
<P>
   There is a conspiracy in Hollywood, they were quick to tell an
audience member who wanted to know whether Hollywood's most famous
gay couple believes closeted stars have the responsibility to come
out. ``This is a good one to get us started on,'' Ellen joked about
naming names. ``If you give us some liquor, we'll talk.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when they spied a couple and their baby waiting their
turn at the microphones in the audience. They invited them to the
front of the stage so they could grill them about the basics of
lesbian motherhood. Heche took the newborn boy and rocked him for a
good half hour. ``We're just gonna talk about babies for the next
hour so if you're not interested you can leave,'' Ellen said. She
wasn't joking.
</P>
<P>
   With the audience's remaining questions, the evening
deteriorated into idolatry. The manager of the local Ben &AMP; Jerry's
invited them to the scoop shop after hours. One audience member
asked Ellen for a hug (she got it). Heche kept spewing New Age
cliches (``Turn to your brothers and sisters and say, Right on! I
admire you for surviving your bad childhood!'') and referring to
herself as being a godly ambassador of love.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the evening, with National Coming Out Week
officially under way and the Vermont Supreme Court justices still
mum about same-sex marriage, people left the university auditorium
for something everybody, both those for and against gay rights,
could agree is a gift from God _ a warm October night in
hardscrabble, liberal Vermont.

INJURIES, LIMITATIONS HOBBLE 49ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE ADAMS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ As San Francisco 49ers coach Steve
Mariucci participates in his weekly day-after-the-game press
briefing, a rumbling sound often builds behind the door off to the
coach's right.
</P>
<P>
   By coincidence of scheduling, Mariucci holds his press
conference at the same time special teams coach George Stewart goes
over the latest game film with his charges in the adjacent room.
</P>
<P>
   At one briefing last year Mariucci was asked about special teams
just as Stewart's bass voice began rattling the closed door.
Mariucci cupped his ear and said, ``Let's listen.''
</P>
<P>
   There were laughs all around. Things were a bit more somber on
Monday. Stewart, whose kickoff coverage teams are playing poorly,
was relatively subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing as well as they can play,'' Stewart said.
``It's not like we can trade them in. They're here. And they're
playing as well as they can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the 49ers' kickoff coverage team ranks dead last in
the NFC, the team's struggles are typical of the NFL. Free agency
and the salary cap have squeezed journeymen out of rosters, leaving
superstars at the top and rookies at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   It's those journeymen players in the middle who have often been
the backbone of special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years the 49ers have lost a number of
standouts to the salary cap _ players such as Curtis Buckley, Jim
Schwanz and James Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly it,'' Stewart said, adding of the players left,
``They're playing as well as they can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The point Stewart was making, with all the subtlety of an
open-field tackle by kickoff madman Buckley, is that he's left with
a group of mostly raw rookies on his coverage teams.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's loss to the Carolina Panthers, Michael Bates
returned one kickoff 40 yards and another 72 yards. In the Oct. 10
loss to the St. Louis Rams, Tony Horne returned a kickoff 97 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents begin drives following 49er kickoffs at nearly the
30-yard line (29.9), the worst average starting point in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the 49ers have been facing some quality returners.
</P>
<P>
   Horne brought a kickoff back 101 yards against the Atlanta
Falcons Sunday. And Bates has world-class speed, holding a bronze
medal in the 200 meters from the 1992 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci is aware of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a hard look to see if we need to put more of
our veterans on those teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Junior Bryant, who began his career with the
49ers on special teams, was one of the players Stewart mentioned as
having the potential to give a boost to special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem with it,'' Bryant said. ``It's how I made my
mark initially.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the issue of speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of youth charging down the field,'' Mariucci
added. ``We've got to get them faster.''
</P>
<P>
   As one possible solution, Stewart sometimes has kicker Wade
Richey ``pooch'' the ball _ kicking it shorter so coverage men have
less ground to cover. On one of those Sundays, Brian Kinchen
returned the short kick 15 yards, giving the Panthers great field
position at the 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big disparity in speed,'' Stewart said. ``As a group
we're limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart didn't fault Richey for not kicking too deep for
returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade is doing a super job,'' Stewart said. ``I have no qualms
about what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kickers are using a different ball on kickoffs this year _ a
brand new ball marked with a ``K'' in the NFL's answer to
suspicions that kickers have been doctoring balls to make them go
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the task a little more difficult,'' Richey said of
the new stiff balls. ``But that's not an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Richey noted that kicks into the end zone weren't his measure of
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touchbacks aren't my goal,'' he said. ``Starting points are.
And it's terrible this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also notes that special teams have been hurt by
injuries, with Anthony Peterson and Travis Jervey among the players
currently sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once those guys are healthy, help is on the way _ hopefully,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he added of the current coverage teams, ``They're
playing as well as they can play.''

   JOURNAL-HONDURAS _ MARCOVIA, Honduras - It seems relatively

needs to be rebuilt. Donor countries and international charities
step in, providing millions in aid to rebuild infrastructure and
hundreds of volunteers to help provide housing. Slowly, roads are
cleared, washouts filled in, temporary bridges installed and
hundreds of new cement block houses are constructed. But a year
after Mitch's floods, it's clear that rebuilding a poor country
devastated by a natural disaster isn't so easy - at least not if
you want to address the underlying problems that made the disaster
so much worse than it might have been. (Williams, Cox News

   NCFLOOD _ PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ With the Tar River set to crest
again Wednesday, Princeville officials and residents prepare to
meet next week to deal with the future of their town, the first to
be incorporated by former slaves. There's much uncertainty over
whether residents will be able to repair their flood-socked home
and, in some cases, whether people want to move back. FEMA
inspectors are making the rounds, assessing the damage as a
requirement for residents to qualify for federal aid. (Burritt,

   MIGRANT-MAIN _ Missi Roddy says people look at her differently
when she's behind the wheel of the short school bus that says
``migrant'' on the side. It's not that anybody shouts anything or
makes an obscene gesture, but Roddy can tell by the looks on their
faces or by how long they stare. ``Heads don't turn as often when
you're driving the normal school bus,'' she said recently as she
drove the Texas Migrant Council Head Start bus down state Route 571
from Tipp City to New Carlisle. (Springfield News-Sun).

   MIGRANT-TRACKING _ Ohio is hoping a new way of keeping track of

valuable link between the states, he said. Only certain people are

   RANCH-ECONOMICS _ MEEKER, Colo. _ In 1951, a steer brought $100
a head at a sale here, and a rancher could buy a new pickup for
$1,700. Nowadays, though, that steer brings in $500, but the
pickup, integral to ranch operations, costs $38,000. ``Prices
haven't quite kept up,'' said Ginny Love, who ranches here with her
husband. High land prices, low livestock prices and a flood of
imports make it difficult, if not impossible, for newcomers to
break into the ranching business. Seeing the writing on the wall,
some second-generation ranchers are getting out altogether. ``We
just barely made expenses this year,'' said Tom Theos, 80, who's
ranched in the White River Valley of northwest Colorado since 1926
and whose family owns one of the largest tracts of land in Rio
Blanco County. (Vader, Daily Sentinel) MOVED.

   BABYBRAIN-DEVELOPMENT _ AUSTIN, Texas _ At young Kenedy
Franklin's level, everything is a wonder. Seeing a woman walk by
the window at the Ebenezer Child Development Center sends the
9-month-old racing on all fours to press his hands against the
pane. The pink ball that teacher Dorothy Casey shows him prompts
Kenedy to thrust out his short arms to grab. As foster grandmother
Lois Manor sings the pattycake rhyme, Kenedy's eyes widen and he
flashes an open-mouth, two-toothed grin. What's going on in
Kenedy's tiny brain as he soaks in all the activity is the focus of
a new debate among scientists and advocacy groups over what happens
in a child's brain in the first three years of life and what, if
anything, parents can do to make their children smarter. Amid the
clamor has come criticisms that the importance of the first three
years of life are largely myth. (Gamboa, Austin American-Statesman)

AUSTEN'S POWERS: NOW, FIVE OF HER SIX NOVELS ARE MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was an explosion of Jane Austen on film a few seasons
back. Movie makers had long considered Austen's shrewdly observed
comedies of manners as unlikely material for screen translation,
believing that the lure of the narratives lay in the personality of
the author, which couldn't be photographed, or in her witty asides,
which could not be easily transmuted into dialogue. Yet, all at
once, there were sparkling movie versions of ``Sense and
Sensibility'' and ``Persuasion,'' and an ``Emma'' that was somewhat
less captivating but quite acceptable. There also was a splendid
``Pride and Prejudice'' prepared for television, and the old
classic edition with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson had frequent
airings on television and caught the attention of film societies.
</P>
<P>
   Filmdom's Austenmania inspired people to read her works, some
again, others for the first time. Since then, Austen's novels have
remained strong in the marketplace. It was around the time that
stellar actress Emma Thompson picked up an Oscar for her ``Sense
and Sensibility'' screenplay that I suggested our need, also, of a
cinematized ``Mansfield Park.'' It isn't only my opinion that this
is Austen's social comedy of highest order. The movie people may
have shunned it as too subtle, or could have considered it less
sufficiently known than the others. Whatever may have caused the
delay, the wait for ``Mansfield Park'' is over. A British-made
version is reckoned one of the big artistic guns in the expected
autumn blitz of quality films.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Patricia Rozema, who directed 1987's ``I've
Heard the Mermaids Singing.'' In the cast is Harold Pinter, who was
an actor in the years prior to his ascent as England's foremost
dramatist. Pinter is in his 70th year, so we assume he's playing
Sir Thomas Bertram.
</P>
<P>
   So what next? Well, Jane Austen wrote six novels, and with
``Mansfield Park'' now a movie reality, only ``Northanger Abbey''
remains. So here's some modest lobbying for a screen treatment.
``Northanger Abbey'' ought to be a movie. Of the Austen sextet,
it's the one that most easily lends itself to the honored
conventions of the cinematic medium. It may not be as different
from the others as, say, the rustic tragedy of ``Ethan Frome'' is
from Edith Wharton's critical studies of high society in old New
York. But if five Austen novels have very similar ingredients,
``Northanger Abbey'' offers something extra. Whether ``Mansfield
Park'' is or isn't Austen's most exalted comedy, ``Northanger
Abbey'' certainly is her lowest. It's a spoof of sorts, or part of
it is. That it's immature is a fair judgment, for it was her first
completed novel, finished when she was barely out of her teens.
``Northanger Abbey'' was also the first property she sold _ in
1803, to a firm that gave her 10 pounds, then decided against
publishing it. Four Austen novels found print during her lifetime,
but ``Northanger Abbey'' was a posthumous issue (1818), in tandem
with ``Persuasion.'' When Jane was a precocious 12-year-old, she
read Horace Walpole's ``The Castle of Otranto,'' the prototype of
the Gothic novel. Some years later, when Mrs. (Ann) Radcliffe's
similarly constituted ``The Mysteries of Udolpho'' was all the
rage, the Austen whim was to ridicule the popular tradition of
tales of romance and terror set in spooky old castles.
</P>
<P>
   The double-pronged ``Northanger Abbey''foretells the romantic
musical chairs in Austen novels yet to come, but contained within
is a second, beguilingly melodramatic situation as imagined by the
impressionable Catherine Morland after reading Mrs. Radcliffe's
``Udolpho.'' (The late John Gardner told me it was precisely this
device that inspired the novel-within-a-novel gimmick in his
prize-winning ``October Light.'') Here, then, is substance for a
delightfully complex movie. It could even be two movies, each one
played straight _ because even the silliest scary stuff often works
quite well as film entertainment. Such a movie or movies may never
come to pass, and that's no great matter. What does matter is
``Northanger Abbey'' in print. It's a joy to read, and is also to
be appreciated as the herald of a piquant literary giant.

 &HT;    For Alabama, unpredictability might be a good thing
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ Not long after Alabama's devastating 29-28
loss to Louisiana Tech on Sept. 18, Mike DuBose met with Charlie
Stubbs. The Crimson Tide head coach and his quarterbacks coach, who
calls the plays, talked at length about a lot of topics.
</P>
<P>
   But the message DuBose delivered was simple: ``Call the game the
way you see it. And if you don't like what I suggest during the
game, don't feel like you have to call it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stubbs, in his second year at Alabama, the conversation gave
him a freedom few assistant coaches get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gotten into the habit of calling what I thought he
wanted instead of really going with what I wanted in particular
situations,'' Stubbs said. ``For him to put it to me that way
showed that he had a lot of confidence in me. That's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Stubbs got the green light to run the show, Alabama has
consecutive wins over nationally ranked Arkansas, Florida and
Mississippi. In those games, the Crimson Tide has gained 1,354
total yards (an average of 451.3 per game) and scored 105 points
(35.0).
</P>
<P>
   And as the Crimson Tide prepares for Saturday's nationally
televised visit from No. 5 Tennessee (3:30 p.m., CBS), Alabama has
gone from being unranked to No. 10 in the Associated Press poll
since the loss to Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense is playing with a lot of confidence right now,''
running back Shaun Alexander said. ``Now we are very
unpredictable.'' Alexander had 200 total yards against Florida and
214 rushing last week against Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama is unpredictable because it has, in addition to
Alexander, a mobile quarterback in Andrew Zow (1,199 yards, 13
TDs), who improves each game. Zow benefits from good receivers led
by Freddie Milons, who has a school-record three consecutive
100-yard games. In five of six games, Alabama has had a receiver
gain more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Given the quality of defenses Alabama has faced and will face
the rest of the season, that unpredictability is crucial, Stubbs
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where we were relying too much on Shaun
and letting defenses dictate to us,'' he said. ``Now we think we
can dictate to the defense and are giving them something to think
about other than No. 37,'' Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   The Tide's versatility will be particularly important Saturday
against a Tennessee defense that is third in the nation against the
run, giving up an average of 64.4 yards, and 15th in total defense
(292.6). Tennessee's defense has not given up a rushing touchdown
this season and will be bent on stopping Alexander, who has gained
more than 100 yards rushing six games in a row.
</P>
<P>
   DuBose met with Stubbs again Sunday to re-emphasize his desire
to let it all hang out on offense. DuBose thought Stubbs turned a
little conservative last week against Ole Miss once the Crimson
Tide got a 27-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt we got a little predictable, but that's easy to do
with our running game,'' DuBose said. ``In a game like this
(against Tennessee), I think we have to be aggressive and stay
aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get into a more aggressive flow, and I know
that,'' he said. ``It's something you have to do when you face a
great defense.''

 &HT;    Falcons look to shake things up, change their luck
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Falcons go to Pittsburgh on Monday, they will
try to change more than their luck. The lineup probably will be
different, too.
</P>
<P>
   But wholesale changes among starters are not likely, despite the
team's 1-5 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (positions), we don't have the ability to make any
changes,'' coach Dan Reeves said, referring to lack of depth in
some areas. ``We probably will have some changes or give people
more playing time to see if they can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have lost an NFL-record nine games in a row on
Monday night, haven't won in Pittsburgh in four tries and are 1-10
all-time against the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Something has to change, so look for youth.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year wide receiver/returner Tim Dwight and rookie tight
end Reggie Kelly can expect to play more. Before Sunday's 41-13
loss to the Rams, Dwight said, ``I hope to get more involved. I've
got to produce; I haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dwight, who aggravated his back and right hamstring before
the season started, is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Rams, he had two catches for 56 yards; got his first
rush of the season for 9 yards; returned a punt 17 yards, his
longest of the season; and averaged 22.4 yards on seven kickoff
returns. He fumbled once. The performance vaulted Dwight _ who has
the speed to get deep _ into the team's three-receiver rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, the team's second-round draft choice, caught his first
four passes for 86 yards in the last two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who make plays are the people who are going to play
more,'' Reeves said. ``They're making plays. Tim is healthy for the
first time. Reggie is making progress. We will probably use him a
little bit more because he is doing a good job, and we will
continue to use (starter) O.J. (Santiago) because he is doing some
good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight cannot save a running game ranked No. 28 in the NFL, but
perhaps he and No. 3 running back Winslow Oliver, the quickest back
on the team, can help.
</P>
<P>
   The line doesn't have many options, other than playing Calvin
Collins at left guard instead of Bob Hallen or Greg Bishop at right
tackle instead of Ephraim Salaam. On defense, injuries to
linebackers Keith Brooking and Jessie Tuggle leave few options.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's run defense, ranked No. 29, is one of the biggest
problems. Defensive tackle Ed Jasper, who missed the past three
games with a left knee injury, probably will return this week.
Defensive end Patrick Kerney, the team's first-round choice, also
could see more time at both end spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones who go out and make plays deserve to be out there,''
strong safety Marty Carter said. ``We've got to get going.''

A LOST KINGDOM OF SATISFIED KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 24) 
(jt) 
 By PETER MARKS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment of truth arrived, on a serving tray. My daughter, the
grilled cheese maven, fixed her eyes on mine as her favorite lunch
was placed before her. The chirpy Bahamian waiter suggested
ketchup. The guy, I thought, had guts, interjecting himself between
Lizzie and the one meal this heart-rendingly finicky eater would
gladly step over my lifeless body for.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzie took a mouthful. I couldn't bear to watch. If the food
did not meet her exacting standards, this trip to the tropics would
melt down faster than you can say American cheese. With one last
wistful gaze out the window at the shimmering marina, I turned to
face my daughter, who was suddenly bathed in an angelic glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad,'' she said, beaming, ``I ate the crust.''
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to translate. In 7-year-old-speak, ``ate the crust''
meant ``four-star dining experience.'' The sandwich was nothing
less than a coup de cuisine. All I could think was, praise be to
the children's menu at Atlantis, the city-size resort in the
Bahamas to which I took Lizzie in August. The 2,300-room hotel had
passed its first crucial test for child-friendliness, and as I was
to learn over the next three days, it was not to be the last. This
imposing complex on Paradise Island, just over a toll bridge from
Nassau, has grown even more enormous, with the new 1,200-room Royal
Towers; it also has 11 swimming pools, beaches and water slides, 38
restaurants and bars, acres of tanks and waterways filled with
sharks and eels, tropical fish and stingrays, and an array of
child-oriented activities to bring tears to a grown man's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be real. A resort vacation with a young child is not about
sipping Billecart-Salmon champagne on the veranda, or passing idle
hours in the boutiques or disappearing under an umbrella with a
novel. For the parent, it's about finding the right kind of grilled
cheese. It's about spending time in the shallow end of the
Olympic-size pool and retrieving crayons from under the crisply
turned-down bed and stocking the minibar with enough apple juice to
guarantee refreshment at least through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Even more crucially, it's about being able to come up with a
satisfying answer to the eternal query from the Pokemon set: ``What
are we going to do today?''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis is a hotel that has thought long and hard on this
question, and its solution is, quite simply, the best I've
encountered in seven years of trying to intrigue and beguile a
little girl with the glories of room service: it's called the
Discovery Channel Camp, a day camp within the resort. Operating
three sessions a day, the program, for ages 5 to 12, provides a lot
more than the superficial baby-sitting services offered at a
surprising number of top-notch resorts. We have stayed at several
where the idea of children's entertainment was a room set aside
with a few books, a few toys and an old computer. No child is
fooled by such pathetic blandishments; after an impromptu
once-over, Lizzie would quickly surmise that these were not for
her.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with more than a little trepidation that I booked
three nights at the Atlantis for Lizzie and me. We had decided to
make this a daughter-and-dad trip, leaving mom at home to rent the
videos of her choice and devote her maternal attentions to our
Maltese puppy. I told Lizzie about Discovery Channel Camp and
showed her pictures from the brochure, which described treasure
hunts and live-animal touch tanks and expeditions to fossil pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think you would like this?'' I asked her repeatedly
before we left. Each time, she would nod unconvincingly. I was
committing us to a pricey trip _ the cost for two for round-trip
air fare, airport transfers, three nights' hotel stay and three
meals a day came to $2,140. I love spending vacation time with
Lizzie, but I also was looking forward to an hour or two to myself.
</P>
<P>
   A half-filled two-hour flight from Kennedy International Airport
deposited us in the Bahamas at 10:30 that Monday morning; about an
hour later, our minivan pulled up to the Atlantis, whose recent
addition, the Royal Towers, rose on the landscape like a NASA
launching pad. Having been warned that our room in the towers would
not be ready until 3, we had packed bathing suits in a separate
bag, and changed in the hotel's transit lounge, a comfortable
locker room for the recently arrived and soon-to-depart.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis is not what you would call cozy. And it's not just
big: it's Giants Stadium huge. The thing you don't want to lose
there, besides your wallet and room key, is your map. With the
marina, the lagoons, the beach, the river run, the pools and the
water slides, the hotel is a kind of liquid universe, and the
interconnecting towers, casino and conference center bisect the
property like a sprawling, air-conditioned causeway.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As its name implies, the resort is meant to evoke a cosmopolitan
marine world. It so teems with sea life you could say you sleep
there with the fishes; the Atlantis claims to house 50,000 of them
in its undersea habitat. Making your way from the Royal Towers to
the hotel's faux Maya ruins, home to a terrifying water slide, you
cross a bridge over a shark tank. By night, you can watch lobsters
crawl in an artificial lake.
</P>
<P>
   Architecturally, it's the sort of hotel Poseidon would have come
up with, if he had worked in Disney's hospitality division. (The
Royal Towers were actually developed by Sun International.) The
edifice, the color of the pink sands of Bermuda and capped by a
series of cupolas adorned with fish, dominates an immense,
interlocking waterscape.
</P>
<P>
   The interior of the hotel is not so much distinctive as
overwhelming. Its sweeping hallways are lined with upscale
boutiques, cafes and coffee shops, through which pass hordes of
guests from Europe and North and South America. Their look was
Caribbean casual: shorts and tank tops during the day, only a
little dressier at night. Honeymooners abounded (you could identify
them by their matching bride and groom T-shirts), as did young
families. Baby strollers were practically as common as suntans.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a hotel of this magnitude would give me the shakes. I
can weather the crush in Times Square, but lining up for breakfast
is my idea of torment. Any esthetic objections I might have had,
though, were obliterated by the ecstatic little girl in her
favorite pink bathing suit who lay on the clean white sand,
aquamarine waves washing over her.
</P>
<P>
   The beach was a five-minute hike from the hotel on baking
concrete walkways and became packed in the afternoons. We rented an
umbrella for $20 (a charge since dropped) and searched in vain for
beach towels; the hotel alloted one per guest per day, and
irritatingly ran out of them our first full day there. (I learned
to grab them after breakfast.) Under their own umbrellas, Bahamian
women, braiding the hair of other little girls, called their names
out to us, beseeching us to braid Lizzie's. We decided to think
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The sun peeked in and out of clouds the color of steel wool, and
we drip-dried off and hiked through the hotel, past the Great Hall
of Waters, where teeming schools of fish float by the (human) lunch
crowd, and through the blinking casino, to the Coral Towers. There
on the lower level was the reception desk for the day camp,
developed for the hotel by the Discovery Channel, the cable channel
whose logo also is displayed on a chain of science-oriented toy
stores. A staffer handed me a registration form and schedule.
Sessions were three and a halfhours in the morning or afternoon,
for $35 each, or four hours in the evening, for $45.
</P>
<P>
   The counselor, dressed in the camp's safari garb, gave us an
introductory tour. The rooms, equipped with microscopes and
aquariums, looked so inviting I wanted to ask if I could enroll. A
mock-up of a shipwrecked windjammer, anchored in sand, dominated a
storytelling pavilion; a well-stocked arts and crafts room promised
substantive inclement-weather diversion. Lizzie was impressed by
the ship, and positively smitten by the turtle tank. We signed her
up for the Tuesday morning session.
</P>
<P>
   For older kids beyond the day-camp stage, there were banana-boat
rides on the beach, the water slides and a variety of excursions,
from powerboat tours and catamaran voyages, to deep sea fishing and
dolphin encounters on Blue Lagoon Island, 20 minutes away by boat.
Adults could take advantage of all of this, as well as golf and
tennis and what the hotel says is the largest gambling hall in the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Our room on the fifth floor of the Royal Towers was on the less
desirable side of the hotel, overlooking Nassau's working piers and
marina, rather than the glorious ocean (the Bahamas are in the
Atlantic, not the Caribbean). But it was spacious and brightly
furnished, with all of the usual amenities. Lizzie got a kick out
of the wall safe that we could program with her own security code,
and she loved the double-depth bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   We ate that night in the hotel's approximation of an American
deli, called Murray's; the full American plan that I had selected
offered us a limited choice of the hotel's restaurants. If we were
to return, I'd forgo the meal plan. From my standpoint, Murray's
was truly awful, and that dinner was the first of several meals
that tasted to me like only close approximations of food. My burger
was charred practically to the point of cremation, and the french
fries reminded me of school: little yellow pencils to chew on.
Lizzie had a hot dog, which she happily consumed. I was beginning
to think the waiters had all cast a spell on her.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving her knapsack and bathing suit at the counselors' desk, I
dropped Lizzie off the next morning at 9. The camp provides parents
with a beeper if they want one _ an inspired innovation. I took one
and headed to the underequipped gym _ an airy room with a dozen
treadmills and a handful of unimpressive weight machines _ then to
sip coffee by a lagoon and take a turn or two on the Maya slide,
with its heart-stopping drop from a replica of an ancient pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-olds descended serenely. I took the plunge and
suddenly felt 112. I couldn't see anything on the way down: my life
passed before my eyes that quickly. By 11:30, I was lonely. When I
went to collect her at 12:30, I half-expected Lizzie to run
tearfully into my arms and plead for me not to send her back to
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The counselors had to call her four times before she could pry
herself away from the turtle tank. ``Dad, when can I come back?''
were her first words to me.
</P>
<P>
   We booked the evening session.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch in the Cafe at the Great Hall of Waters, a restaurant
in the Royal Towers that is surrounded by an immense aquarium,
Lizzie regaled me, between bites of grilled cheese, with her camp
exploits. Besides a midmorning snack and swimming, there was a
short excursion on the hotel grounds for coral rubbing, and a visit
to an on-site ``fish hospital.'' The counselors, many of them
Bahamian college students, took her to The Dig, a kind of grotto
built into the hotel, where she could reach into a tank and handle
starfish. She told me about a friend she had made and a project she
had started on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what did you do?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, in the artificial seven-acre Paradise Lagoon, we
rented an aquabike, an oversize floating tricycle for two, and
pedaled hither and yon. I exerted; Lizzie steered. We headed to the
beach and the pool, drenched ourselves in a waterfall and hiked the
hotel's adventure trail. We stopped at a poolside cafe for
tick-tack-toe.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard, as I sat there absorbing her happiness, to remember
a time when this feeling was not a part of my life. All the cliches
apply: contentment is that much more intense when it is experienced
vicariously, through your child's pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   We went back to the room and got Lizzie ready for the evening,
during which the counselors would take her stargazing. We both got
the drill down quickly: I grabbed a beeper as she disappeared into
the camp.
</P>
<P>
   I had a meal in the Water's Edge _ a restaurant that heaped on
the kind of massive portions you get on an unexciting cruise _
sipped some wine and went off to lose a few dollars in the casino.
At 10 p.m., I showed up once more at the counselors' desk. It took
several tries before Lizzie emerged from a winning game of ocean
bingo. ``Dad, when can I come back?'' were the first words out of
her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   We booked for the next afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; If you go &LR;
</P>
<P>
   he 2,300-room Atlantis, (800) 285-2684 or (242) 363-3000, is on
Paradise Island, a 35-minute drive from Nassau International
Airport. Doubles cost $170 to $335 to Dec. 12, $295 to $465 Jan. 2
to May 28; holiday rates are higher. For its Atlantis package,
Paradise Island Vacations, (800) 722-7466, flies a charter to
Nassau on most days from Kennedy Airport; www.sunint.com/atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Towers modified American meal plan ($59 a day for
adults, $30 for ages 5 to 12) provides breakfast and dinner. Our
full American plan, no longer offered, allowed us three meals a day
in any of several lower-priced spots among the hotel's 38 bars and
restaurants. The food was plentiful but bland. The best choices
were the Marketplace breakfast buffet, offering everything from
bagels and cold cereals to eggs benedict; lunch at the Cafe at the
Great Hall of Waters (not on the plan but available for a nominal
surcharge), and dinner at Water's Edge, where reservations were
advisable. Jimmie's dished up a mean waffle cone.
</P>
<P>
   In four days and three nights, we never left the hotel grounds.
The Atlantis says its 100,000-square-foot Entertainment Center
contains the largest casino in the Bahamas. The hotel also can
arrange a number of off-property trips for dolphin encounters ($15
to $49), scuba diving ($65 to $95) and sailing and dinner cruises
($40 to $50). The hotel Sports Center has an 18-hole putting
course. Non-guests can use the resort facilities for $25 a day, $19
ages 4 to 12.

AN IDEALIST WHO SEES THE BEAUTY IN DIVERSITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CRETEIL, France _ With close to 20 years' experience as a
choreographer, Jose Montalvo is hardly a novice, yet for a long
time this tall, simpatico Frenchman of Spanish descent was known _
when he was known at all _ as a peripheral artist more interested
in experimentation than fame. Then he created ``Paradis,'' a
delightful multimedia, multicultural collage of a work. After that,
everything was different.
</P>
<P>
   Since its premiere in March 1997, ``Paradis'' has been performed
almost 200 times _ that's about once every four days _ in France
and on tour in Europe, the Far East and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it earned Montalvo and his longtime partner and
principal dancer, Dominique Hervieu, their posts as co-directors of
the Centre Choreographique National de Creteil et du Val du Marne,
one of 18 such centers in France. Now the 60-minute work is
traveling to New York for eight performances at the Joyce Theater
starting on Tuesday as part of the New Europe '99 Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if ``Paradis'' made the Compagnie Montalvo-Hervieu's name
as one of France's most exciting new dance groups, it did not make
Montalvo and Ms. Hervieu. Working together since 1985, they have so
far created six pieces in which they use a potpourri of dance
styles, Baroque music and amusing videos to form what Montalvo
likes to call a ``continuing fresco.'' ``Paradis'' was the fifth
such ``painting.'' The sixth, ``Le Jardin Io Io Ito Ito,'' which
had its premiere in January, is also now touring France.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Paradis'' marked a watershed for Montalvo, who is 45. It
became, in the words of Le Monde, an instant best seller, which is
unusual in the world of dance, where audiences tend to be drawn
more by the name of a choreographer or a company than by a single
hit.
</P>
<P>
   It also brought him critical acclaim on an entirely new scale.
``Montalvo is `paradise' on earth,'' exulted Rene Servin, dance
critic for Le Figaro. ``The show is an absolute delight that
bubbles like champagne. New talents are rare on the morose French
choreographic landscape, and Jose Montalvo provides a welcome burst
of oxygen with 60 minutes that are spiritual, brilliant and
unpretentious.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, ``Paradis'' was Montalvo's most ambitious work to
date. He had begun playing with video images as early as 1993, but
never before had he been able to use such sophisticated
audio-visual equipment. The result is quite magical.
</P>
<P>
   Developing the theme of the real and the virtual, he projects
video images of his dancers, along with a parade of unlikely
animals, onto white curtains at the rear of the stage. Sometimes
the dancers appear vertically on the screen; other times, having
been recorded moving across a floor, they seem to be levitating or
flying. Meanwhile, the real dancers variously mimic, take the place
of and interact with their video selves.
</P>
<P>
   Montalvo was also able to give flight to his ideas about
multiculturalism by embracing everything from African, Caribbean
and break dancing to contemporary, hip-hop and classical styles.
Thus, with some or all of these dances performed concurrently
onstage to music by Vivaldi, he creates what he likes to call a
``poetry of juxtapositions.''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that his 10 dancers are themselves multicultural: they
include a man from Cameroon, three young street dancers of North
African extraction as well as several with classical training,
notably the petite and ever impressive Ms. Hervieu, and a fairly
corpulent dancer from Martinique, Chantal Loial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chantal Loial imposed herself on me,'' Montalvo recalled with
amusement. ``She presented herself one day and challenged me,
`You're always saying how open you are, but not to bodies like
mine.' So I said, `O.K., so what can you do?' She showed me. She
stayed. That was four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just as Ms. Loial was integrated into the Compagnie
Montalvo-Hervieu, ``Paradis'' is itself an optimistic metaphor for
coexistence in a contemporary France where different immigrant
cultures are learning to live and let live within the boundaries of
a surprisingly conformist nation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, had Montalvo been a cynic, he could as easily have
parodied paradise by showing the tensions caused by Third World
immigration here. But he is an idealist. He wants to fight
xenophobia with beauty.
</P>
<P>
   He chooses humor over solemnity. A phrase by Jorge Luis Borges _
``No day goes by without our living an instant of paradise'' _ is
his lantern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there'd be a negative reaction from some parts of
French contemporary dance,'' Montalvo said. ``I realized I was
playing with things that you're not meant to do if you want to be
taken seriously here.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he has never feared going his own way. Born
in 1954 to Spanish Republican parents who fled to Toulouse after
the Spanish Civil War, he discovered dance when he and his
rugby-playing friends decided that dancing was the best way to meet
girls.
</P>
<P>
   They proceeded to sign up for some classic and modern dance
courses at the Centre Choreographique National in Toulouse. It was
meant to be just fun, but the soft-spoken Montalvo caught the bug.
At 20, he moved to Paris to study art and architecture and decided
to take courses given by the American choreographer Jerome Andrews
at the Ballet Moderne de Paris. Andrews, who died in 1992 in Paris
at the age of 84, was to play a critical role in forming Montalvo's
choreographic vision, an influence still apparent in ``Paradis.''

HEART-CORE: PUNK-POWERED, SENSITIVE `EMO' BANDS WARY OF LABELS'
PROMISES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Rock bands hate two things:
</P>
<P>
   Being lumped together.
</P>
<P>
   And being categorized.
   Time and time again, when we interview them we hear: ``We have
our own unique sound. We're not like anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, that's true. Like there is not another band on
this planet that sounds remotely like Primus. And that, believe us,
is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   But when bands, intentionally or not, share a common sound and
similar aesthetics, categories and genres are born _ whether they
like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Rock's latest categorized breed: emo-core bands, punk-rock
groups that pride themselves as much on their abrasive,
hardcore-punk arrangements as on their intelligent, emotional (as
in ``emo'') lyrics and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``heart-core.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emo in its best light is intense, dynamic and incredibly
powerful,'' says Jessica Hopper, who promotes a number of emo
groups through her Chicago-based firm, Hyper PR. ``People say the
whole emo thing is crying at a show. You know, like it's that
dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the genre's origins date back to the mid-'80s _ to a
Washington, D.C.-based act called Rites of Spring _ emo-core has
just lately become an accepted musical tag, prompting a recent
compilation of emo-core acts, recurring major-label interest and a
recent spread in Spin. Perhaps the most disturbing sign that emo is
slowly seeping into pop culture: a nod to emo appeared in Teen
People.
</P>
<P>
   But the bands associated with the movement _ Promise Ring, Get
Up Kids, At the Drive In, Burning Airlines, to name a few _ are not
exactly in it for the attention or money. Most of them subscribe to
the do-it-yourself theories and practices of the yesteryear groups
that pioneered punk and emo.
</P>
<P>
   Early emo practitioners such as Fugazi and Rites of Spring _
both from the Washington, D.C., area _ played small clubs, released
their own records with their own money and treated their fans with
respect. According to the Spin article, the emo-core label was
actually dreamed up by a Fugazi fan who was mad that the band
discouraged moshing at their shows. ``Oh, you guys are so
emo-core,'' he yelled; the label stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene in D.C. had turned into a bunch of white boys
beating (each other up), and someone said to (Fugazi band leader)
Ian (MacKaye), `You need to do something about this,''' says
Hopper. ``After that, they started to sensitize (their music).
They're pretty much the band that was the catalyst for what is now
called emo.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C.'s music scene became a sonic blueprint for other bands in
other cities to follow. This second wave of groups has proven more
influential than the first. Especially pertinent in developing
emo's sound: Unwound, a trio from Olympia, Wash.; Drive Like Jehu,
a quartet from San Diego; and Sunny Day Real Estate, a foursome
from Seattle. None of these groups was interested in politics, only
in conveying emotion through noisy guitars and zealous singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were more personal and introspective,'' Hopper says.
``And dynamic. They weren't so much hardcore. They weren't so much
punk. They weren't straight-up anything. They were fusing together
things, like power-pop and punk-pop, or orchestral and '70s rock
like Sunny Day. That's sorta how the emo you hear now got
started.''
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, major labels have chased some of these
groups, such as the Promise Ring, a Milwaukee-based quartet that
has put out a string of well-received CDs on tiny label Jade Tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've considered signing to a major before, but it doesn't
make sense, really,'' band guitarist Jason Gnewikow says on the
phone before a gig in San Francisco (the group plays Dallas' Trees
Oct. 28). ``We have it pretty good right now. A major label would
have to make a pretty sweet offer for us to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweet offers were obviously made to Jawbox, Jimmyeatworld, Hum,
Seaweed and Drive Like Jehu, some of the emo bands that have been
affiliated with major labels _ and burned by them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a dumb thing for us to do,'' Seaweed singer
Aaron Stauffer said in an interview last year. ``But we'd been
together 10 years, so we figured it was a good time to sell out.
But Hollywood (the major label that signed the band) really didn't
know how to market or promote us or anything. We're better off
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now'' is back to working with a small label. In Seaweed's
case, it's Merge, a tiny record company run by members of popular
pop-punks Superchunk.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jawbox's brief affair with Atlantic Records, though, that
aspiring emo bands think twice about before signing on the dotted
line.
</P>
<P>
   After their two records for Atlantic failed to take off at a
time when industry insiders hoped they would (in the alt-rock-heavy
mid-'90s), the D.C.-based band left the label, then broke up, a sad
ending for one of the most important underground-rock bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof that you're gonna get burned is right there,''
Hopper says. ``Jawbox was twice the size of Promise Ring and some
of these other bands. And that was at a time when alt-rock was
happening. So bands know the reality of signing to a major, and I
think that's why they're reluctant to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, as long as you don't make a super-expensive record,
you can be on a small label and pay your rent for a year off
T-shirt sales. And you get to pick the single, what the posters
look like, what the record looks like, what the record sounds like.
A major label's view of success boils down to money. People who
live in a world that is overshadowed by Fugazi, their version of
success is having control over your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Although emo bands do share common ideologies, they do prefer to
be judged and appreciated for their own talents rather than because
they're affiliated with a scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just four guys who get together and put out records,''
says Promise Ring's Jason Gnewikow. ``I don't feel any connection
to a scene. There are similarities between us and a lot of other
new bands, but there are also similarities between us and Cheap
Trick. If people listened, they'd know these bands are all a lot
different.''

 CRETEIL, France: in ``Paradis.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Andrews came from the American tradition,'' he recalled. ``He
had studied with Martha Graham, he had danced at Radio City Music
Hall in the 1930s, his formation was eclectic. He integrated Thai,
African, Japanese dances. He had a very broad culture. He made me
realize that dance was an art, so what I thought was a hobby became
a profession for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Montalvo abandoned architecture for dance and joined
the Ballet Moderne de Paris, where he discovered Merce Cunningham,
Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs and Pina Bausch. In the early 1980s,
he began teaching dance. And it was as a teacher that he met Ms.
Hervieu, an athletic young dancer 10 years his junior who had just
arrived in Paris from Normandy and was looking to switch from
classical to contemporary dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was his pupil,'' recalled Ms. Hervieu, sitting beside
Montalvo as dancers warmed up for a rehearsal in the company's
studio in this Paris suburb. ``Then he wanted to do some research
together. So I became his researcher, then his dancer, his partner,
his assistant, his co-choreographer and now his co-director.'' She
paused for effect and then added with a laugh, ``But not his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Montalvo began creating short solos _ the first lasted
just three minutes _ for Ms. Hervieu, which they presented at
choreography competitions. They soon picked up some prizes, which
led to other competitions and public performances.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1989, just as their careers were taking off, they
changed directions. While visiting a friend at a psychiatric
hospital, Montalvo was invited to give dance courses to the
institution's patients. He accepted, and he and Ms. Hervieu worked
regularly at the hospital over the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The experience with nondancers led them in turn to an even more
unusual adventure. At the invitation of several theaters around
France, they began to create simple choreography for large numbers
of people _ on one occasion, as many as 7,000 _ who would gather in
an open-air plaza. Two of the company's street dancers were spotted
at such events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to democratize art, to demonstrate that art did not
need to exist only onstage, to blur the frontier between life and
art,'' Ms. Hervieu explained. ``Moments like that can give people
pleasure and change their relationship with their body and their
view of stage performances.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, Montalvo was again being invited to create
choreographies for the stage, starting with ``Podebal,'' which
comprised 24 short dances vaguely inspired by Dada and Duchamp.
Then, with ``Double Trouble,'' a piece for six dancers, he began
his ``fresco'' series by working for the first time with video.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an artist, I had the choice of pretending that technology
did not exist or of exploiting it in a poetic way,'' he explained.
``At first video was a bit of a game because I had always loved
cinema and this was an affordable way of playing with cinema, but
then I saw it as the chain that could link a series of pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, working each time with more dancers ``like a spiral
opening to the diversity and complexity of the world,'' as he put
it, he has created ``Hollaka Hollala,'' ``Pilhaou Thibaou,'' ``La
Mitrailleuse en Etat de Grace,'' ``Paradis'' and ``Le Jardin Io Io
Ito Ito,'' which has 18 dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having forged harmony from diversity in his own company,
Montalvo is to try his hand with a classic troupe, the Ballet of
the Paris National Opera, with which he will create a work called
``Le Rire de la Lyre'' at the Palais Garnier in December.
</P>
<P>
   Reassuringly, his idealism seems to have survived his success.
``Borges once said that, standing at the feet of the Pyramids, he
took a handful of sand and let it run out his hand somewhere else,
and he had the laughable and real feeling of changing the Sahara,''
Montalvo said. ``Well, we have this feeling. It's ridiculous, but
it's true. We think we can change things a bit.''

 &HT;    Half of Ga. middle-schoolers claim cigarette use, survey says
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Half of Georgia middle school students say they've
smoked cigarettes, while 14 percent admit they're already habitual
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   And a new state study suggests that matters may get worse. As
those students enter high school, even more are likely to take up
the habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you're going to have more people in the continuum
as current or frequent smokers,'' said Frank Franklin, a state
epidemiologist. Franklin, who supervised last spring's survey of
1,300 sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders, said 70 percent of
children who try cigarettes become smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The high smoking rates _ among children as young as 12 _ were
recorded despite frequently delivered messages about tobacco's
dangers. Many Georgia youngsters appear to be ignoring those
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they get in middle school and they see other kids smoking
... they're easily drawn in,'' said Linda Lee, chairwoman of the
Coalition for a Healthy and Responsible Georgia, an anti-smoking
group. ``It's like a big line is drawn when they go into that
middle school age. They think everybody in high school is smoking.
They want to try it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it,'' she said, ``is rebellion because we tell them
they can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Most anti-smoking programs are directed toward high school
students. But younger teens present a more difficult challenge,
said Lynn Thogersen, director of the anti-smoking group Health Care
for a Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their hormones are raging, and they want to appear older than
they are,'' Thogersen said. ``It's a tumultuous time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once they try smoking, she said, many ``continue to pursue it.
It really doesn't take very long for them to become addicted to the
nicotine.''
</P>
<P>
   High smoking rates have long been associated with high school
students. A 1993 survey, for instance, found that 24 percent of
Georgia teens in grades nine through 12 smoked. But no studies had
examined tobacco use by younger students in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Of those questioned for the new study, 49 percent said they had
smoked at least one cigarette. Fifty-five percent said they had
used tobacco _ cigarettes, cigars or snuff _ at least once.
</P>
<P>
   And the study identified 14 percent as ``current'' smokers.
Those students said they had consumed at least 100 cigarettes and
smoked one or more cigarettes most days. Experts say such smokers
are addicted to nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   No national studies have measured smoking by middle school
students, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But the University of Michigan reported last year that 46
percent of the nation's eighth-graders have smoked at least once.
The Michigan study said that 19 percent had smoked during the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   The new Georgia findings are ``clearly a bit high,'' said Lloyd
Johnston, who headed the Michigan survey. ``You'd expect it to be
lower,'' because Georgia surveyed children two years younger than
eighth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like, at the very best, Georgia has as much of a
smoking problem among its kids as the rest of the country,''
Johnston said. ``And that's a substantial problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes will propose spending part of the state's $4.8
billion settlement from the tobacco industry to combat teen
smoking, said his spokeswoman, Joselyn Butler. But he hasn't
settled on an amount, she said. The governor also wants to use
one-third of the money for economic development in tobacco-growing
counties. The rest, he has said, should pay for health-care
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smoking groups want at least one-fourth of the settlement
for smoking prevention. They say the new findings demonstrate the
need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are starting earlier and earlier,'' said Kristen Betts of
the American Cancer Society's Georgia chapter. ``It's not
surprising, since we've not committed the resources to deal with
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The time is now to deal with this problem _ and to do it
right,'' Betts said. ``Nickel-and-diming it will not show the
results we need.''

FOR POTTERS FROM SPAIN, A NEW WORLD OF STYLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last 400 years, the innovative potters of
Puebla, a town east of Mexico City, have done what potters do best:
they have taken dazzling designs from the ceramics of other
cultures and reproduced them. Then, to mark them as Mexican, they
have added images of a cactus here, a parrot there.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish artisans began making pottery in Puebla by the 1570s, a
half century after Hernan Cortes routed the Aztecs in the Spanish
conquest. These master potters, who had been sent from Spain to set
up the ceramics workshop in the town, turned out an international
mix of styles in their favorite medium, tin-glazed earthenware.
</P>
<P>
   The first jars, basins and platters to be made there reflected
the bold shapes and elaborate patterns of Spanish and Islamic
cultures. Then, by the early 17th century, they added colorful
Italian majolica, blue-and-white patterns from Ming porcelains and
folk-patterned tiles based on Flemish and Dutch models.
</P>
<P>
   The aim was to match the impressive works being made back in
Spain by the country's finest ceramists in Talavera de la Reina, a
town near Toledo that became Spain's Delft.
</P>
<P>
   Just how brilliantly these Spanish potters succeeded in
transforming the traditional terra cotta ceramics in Mexico is the
little-known story that is revealed in ``Talavera Poblana: Four
Centuries of a Mexican Ceramic Tradition,'' an exhibition at the
Americas Society Art Gallery, Park Avenue, at 68th Street, through
Dec. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The show of 86 pieces, lent mostly by American and Mexican
museums, was organized by the Americas Society and the Hispanic
Society of America, both in Manhattan, along with the Museo Amparo
in Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards chose Puebla as the site of their ceramics
workshops for a good reason. ``Ceramics had been produced in or
near Puebla since 1200 B.C.,'' said Margaret Connors McQuade, the
curator of ceramics and furniture at the Hispanic Society, who
organized this show and wrote the catalogue. ``And while I'm
certain that the Spaniards probably used the ceramics knowledge of
the natives, only pure-blooded Spaniards were permitted to be the
master potters under Puebla's ordinances, which governed the
potter's guild. Perhaps they felt threatened by the skills of
native potters.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the start the Spanish introduced colors, shapes and
motifs never before known in Mexican ceramics. The introduction of
cobalt blue glazes, popular throughout Europe and Asia from the
16th century on, produced the most pervasive change.
</P>
<P>
   Puebla's potters lavished cobalt glazes, imported from Spain, on
their works in ways that far exceeded the density of the imagery
and the intensity of the colors on, say, the Chinese-influenced
Korean and Vietnamese blue-and-white ceramics from the same period.
The rich blues first appeared on traditional pieces in the Spanish
style and in the Islamic or Hispano-Moresque style: gourd-shaped
bottles patterned with leaves, a bulbous jar with serpentine
handles depicting a bullfight and large basins awash with
traditional Islamic strapwork.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 17th century, Chinese blue-and-white porcelains
were the dominant inspiration for Puebla's potters, who translated
Ming imagery of exotic birds and palace gardens to the surfaces of
their earthenware pieces. Some artists replaced foreign motifs with
native ones that depicted a waterbird on a cactus, poised like an
Aztec eagle. They also added parrots and crested quetzal birds to
the foliage of Chinese-style gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The adaptations were probably produced by potters who had
actually seen Chinese porcelains. At the time, Chinese porcelains
were shipped by Spanish galleons from Manila to Acapulco to remain
in Mexico or be sent on to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   While ceramic production flourished in Puebla throughout the
18th century, it declined both times Mexico gained its independence
in the 19th century, from Spain in 1821 and from France in 1862.
Vigor returned to the Puebla potteries after the artist Enrique
Luis Ventosa arrived from Barcelona in 1897.
</P>
<P>
   His illustrator's sharp eye and his training in the Art Nouveau
style proved invaluable to him in producing platters emblazoned
with boldly graphic images like coats of arms and Jazz Age flappers
crowned with peacock feathers, works he sometimes made with Ysauro
Uriarte, who created the shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ventosa's works prompted a re-examination of those by earlier
Spanish potters that are among the finest objects in the show. By
then, Puebla had become a must place to visit for the well to do,
in large part because of the ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1904, Emily Johnston de Forest, the daughter of John Taylor
Johnston, founding president of the Metropolitan Museum, went to
Puebla with her husband, Robert W. de Forest, who later became
president of the Metropolitan. The couple brought back many early
Talavera pieces, which were later sent to the Metropolitan. When
she showed her collection to Edwin Barber of Philadelphia, he
headed to Mexico and assembled a similar selection that is now in
the Philadelphia Museum or Art.
</P>
<P>
   The offbeat earthenware produced in Puebla today looks nothing
like any of the ceramics that came before. But the asymmetrical
crosses, frog figures, cracked eggs and an arklike whimsy are in
harmony with the current interest in funky ceramics throughout the
world. And they inspired the current show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, David Rockefeller, the founder and honorary chairman of
the Americas Society, visited Puebla, where he saw contemporary
tin-glazed earthenware. He was so impressed that he asked the
society to bring the pieces to New York, then helped pay for the
show.

 &HT;    Thrashers' Vujtek preparing for return to ice
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As if to make up for lost time, the Thrashers'
Vladimir Vujtek was the last player off the ice at practice
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a restaurant, they start vacuuming around your feet as a hint
that it's time to go. In an ice rink, the Zamboni driver turns the
key, then sits and wait. Prepare for a number of waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at him,'' Thrashers coach Curt Fraser said at the Duluth
IceForum, watching Vujtek, already drenched in sweat, flying around
the ice after practice. ``He looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Vujtek is upright, conscious and not bleeding.
Those three conditions can't be assumed automatically when the
27-year-old Czech native is playing hockey.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of six months, he was knocked unconscious and
suffered a seizure on the ice during a game in the Czech Republic
in March, then had his face sliced open by a skate blade in a
Thrashers' exhibition game against the New York Rangers Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The cut turned out not to be life threatening. But it required
more than 200 stitches to close and shook Vujtek, who is just
trying to earn a living in a sport he has played since he could
stand. Team officials intentionally made his rehabilitation slow,
to ensure that he was as mentally prepared for a comeback as he was
physically.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser and general manager Don Waddell both think that Vujtek
has reached that point, and they say he is ready to return for
Saturday's game against Colorado. Fraser even talked about pairing
the speedy left winger with rookie Patrik Stefan and right winger
Nelson Emerson, which on paper would be Atlanta's most skilled
line.
</P>
<P>
   But at this point, Vujtek would be happy just to take a shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two times in the last year, I could have died on the ice,''
Vujtek said. ``It's scary. But you have to stay positive. In the
first two weeks (after the facial cut), it was hard. I felt pretty
down. But now I feel pretty strong. I'm looking forward to getting
back in the lineup. As soon as I start playing, I can forget about
all of those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been good because I had some good practices with the team
on the road, and I'll have four this week to get ready. You start
feeling like one of the boys again. It's tough watching the team
play and not being able to do anything. You know that injuries
happen in hockey, but I think this is enough for me. Hopefully,
it's over and I start focusing on the games. I can start having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Vujtek was having a strong season for Vitkovice in the Czech
Republic with 20 goals and 35 assists in 47 games when he was
elbowed in the head, knocked unconscious and suffered a seizure on
the ice. Teammate Milos Holan, who tried out with the Thrashers in
training camp, had to put a stick in Vujtek's mouth and pull out
his tongue so he wouldn't swallow it. That injury followed a virus
that knocked out more than half of Vujtek's season with Tampa Bay
in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Vujtek goes to physical therapy daily and puts a stack of tongue
depressors in his mouth three times a day to stretch out his jaw
muscle, stiffened by the scar tissue. His record is 13 tongue
depressors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get more in the front than if you put them all the way
in back,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   After slurping dinner through a straw for a week, he can eat
solid food again. Now, Fraser wants to see him perform on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so good with the puck,'' the coach said. ``He has quick
hands _ and that's something we don't have much have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be real supportive of him. You look at the
injuries he's had, that would be mentally tough on anybody.
Hopefully, he can get by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Left winger Matt Johnson (groin strain), and defensemen Yannick
Tremblay (hip-flexor) and Maxim Galanov (fractured hand) missed
practice. Galanov is scheduled to be re-examined today to determine
if surgery is necessary. The Thrashers will need to make a roster
move when Vujtek is activated off injured reserve. If Galanov, who
hasn't played, is healthy, Waddell said he would like to evaluate
him in some games. . . . The Thrashers' compensatory draft pick for
Philadelphia's signing of unrestricted free-agent defenseman Ulf
Samuelsson probably will be a third-rounder, but the formula is
based partly on his performance this season. The Thrashers acquired
his rights at the expansion draft.

IN A JOAN OF ARC SEASON, ONE TELLING IS TIMELESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No particular reason comes to mind, but on film and video there
is a resurgent call for the French peasant girl with, in the words
of one critic in 1929, ``a face supernaturally illumined by faith,
with lips parched through excitement and with a pair of eyes that
see Heaven opening before them.''
</P>
<P>
   The uplifted visage belonged to Maria (sometimes called Renee)
Falconetti, most famously and perhaps exclusively known for her
performance as Joan of Arc in Carl Theodor Dreyer's silent classic
``The Passion of Saint Joan.'' Released in 1928, the film is by far
the most interesting of three titles about the Maid of Orleans to
be seen this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by Richard Einhorn's oratorio, ``Voices of Light,''
composed mostly in the 1990s and performed by the Netherlands Radio
Choir and Philharmonic, ``The Passion'' is to be released on tape
Tuesday by Home Vision and on a fine DVD from the Criterion
Collection on Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   For a more standard account, from flaming battlements to palace
machinations, there is Luc Besson's large and long ``The Messenger:
The Story of Joan of Arc,'' which will open on Nov. 12. Of similar
intent, Christian Duguay's four-hour miniseries ``Joan of Arc,''
shown on CBS in May and recently released on tape and DVD by
Artisan, tracks the story from her birth in 1412 to her trial for
heresy and burning at the stake in 1431.
</P>
<P>
   But for brilliance, there is ``The Passion,'' among the greatest
films ever made. A Dane and a director of singular outlook and
ferocious intensity, Dreyer (``Vampyr,'' ``Ordet,'' ``Gertrud'')
skipped the battlefield heroics and went straight to the spiritual
struggle at the trial. ``One can't picture her as a war leader,''
he said of Joan, an encapsulation of history that annoyed the
French no end.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, what is habitually described as a simple story
takes place during a complex period that is explored only sketchily
by the Besson and Duguay films and, despite its ingenuity, hardly
at all by ``The Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Obsessed with visions, Joan spent her 19 years embroiled in the
Hundred Years War with the English, who controlled much of France
in alliance with the Burgundians. About age 13, she began to hear
voices from God, or so she said, who charged her with a divine
mission to unite the country under Charles VII.
</P>
<P>
   The people rallied around her as did the troops. At Orleans she
won a great victory, but soon thereafter she overstepped herself.
An invasion of Paris failed and at Compiegne she was captured by
the Burgundians, sold to the English and put on trial at Rouen.
</P>
<P>
   In the Besson and Duguay films, the two Joans (Milla Jovovich
and the 16-year-old Leelee Sobieski, respectively) brim with
purpose, but one is ever mindful that here we have two fine-looking
young women. Dreyer's Joan would stare at them as she stares at
everybody, in pain and dumbfounded amazement.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a farm woman whose face, and face alone, carries a film
that, in Dreyer's words, is ``a hymn to the triumph of the soul
over life.'' Here also is where two costume adventures part company
with an acknowledged masterpiece of focused, stylized vision.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects ``The Passion'' enjoys a certain kinship with
the story it relates. Apparently lost in not one but two fires
shortly after it was made, Dreyer's original survived in a print
that was found in a closet at a Norwegian mental hospital in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Restored in 1985, it stands as a paragon of silent film
technique.
</P>
<P>
   At Joan's trial, her accusers are the most powerful Roman
Catholic theologians. The goal is to discredit her and weaken
Charles, but at the bottom of the matter lies their extreme fear of
a heroine of the people who insists that she interacts directly
with God without the need of the Church as intermediary. An
interrogator reminds her that no one can be saved without the
Church. She is asked, ``Are you in a state of grace?''
</P>
<P>
   She replies:``If I am, may God keep me there. If I am not, may
God grant it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever answer, which confounds the interrogators. ``The
Passion'' relates the personal contest _ Joan's distraught
consternation and resolve against her judges' sarcasm and anger _
with faces caught in fast-moving close-ups. Dreyer described the
interplay as ``close-quarter combat.''
</P>
<P>
   While the videotape is of good quality, the best way to get into
the drama is on DVD, which projects the black-and-white images with
particular sharpness. At any second one can stop the action for a
longer look at the adversaries, who almost come alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these faces are shown to us so many times, one can't
help getting tired of them in the end,'' one critic wrote. Hardly,
especially Ms. Falconetti's.
</P>
<P>
   The disk has a full-length commentary by the Dreyer scholar
Casper Tybjerg, who explains that the script is drawn from the
Latin text of the trial. Dreyer called the film a documentary and
employed a great deal of camera movement. He also liked low-angle
shots and trenches were dug for camera positions.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted to the courtroom and Joan's cell, the action goes
outside only once, to the stake. Nevertheless, the director
insisted that a full castle be constructed. To the displeasure of
his backers, it is never shown in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Music was often played on the sets of silent movies, but Dreyer
allowed none, nor did he want musical accompaniment to the finished
film. On videotape, ``The Passion'' is shown with Einhorn's
``Voices of Light,'' and on the disk one can watch with or without
it.
</P>
<P>
   The composer stresses that his oratorio, with a text drawn
primarily from ancient writings by medieval female mystics
(including Joan), is not intended to accompany the film. Rather, it
is a piece for soloists, chorus and orchestra that stands
separately from the movie and has been performed either with or
without it since its completion in 1994. ``It's not a silent movie
with music, but a movie that includes music,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his notes he writes that he recorded the church bell at
Domremy, Joan's birthplace, because she often stopped in mid-march
to listen to bells, and he thought she would be pleased. Dreyer,
who died in 1968, may or may not have liked that notion, though he
certainly sought authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   His film was shot from May to November 1927, a period that
corresponds in length to the trial itself. Artificial light was the
only concession to reality. Actors went without makeup, their
``naked faces,'' Tybjerg says in his commentary, ``standing out in
pitiless detail.''
</P>
<P>
   An actor from the Comedie Francaise, Ms. Falconetti never made
another film. The story was that her experience with Dreyer ruined
her for the medium, but it is probable that she simply preferred
live performance. Dreyer drove her hard, meeting alone with her
before every scene. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end, her head is shaved, as was Joan's. All the
actors cried. Ms. Falconetti broke down, and Dreyer had to wait
till she recovered. ``A certifiable lunatic,'' one actor called
him.

 &HT;    Georgia appeals court hears Florida school prayer case
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Allowing students to vote for prayer at high school
graduation is an unconstitutional sham, a lawyer argued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A policy adopted in 1993 by a Florida school board was designed
to circumvent a U.S. Supreme Court ruling banning state sponsorship
of school prayer, Jacksonville attorney William Sheppard said. ``It
allows the school board to use student surrogates to do what what
it couldn't do itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in Atlanta heard arguments against and
in support of the Duval County, Fla., policy. The court's ruling
will make law in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Duval's policy was approved after the Supreme Court ruled
unconstitutional a commencement program in Rhode Island, where a
principal invited clergy to deliver a nonsectarian benediction.
</P>
<P>
   In Duval, high school seniors vote for classmates to deliver
messages at graduation. The message can be whatever the student
wishes to say. School officials have no control over content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fundamental rights are not subject to majority vote,''
said Sheppard, who represents a group of student plaintiffs opposed
to the policy. ``They are designed to protect the minority.''
</P>
<P>
   But several judges on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
wondered how, with such safeguards, can the school board be found
to sponsor prayer at graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't the policy allow ``a dissenter or non-believer to give a
message?'' Judge Charles Wilson asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sheppard replied, but since the policy was adopted,
religious observances have dominated the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Majority vote in the ``Bible Belt'' district almost ensures a
religious message, Sheppard said. The school board's lawyers saw a
way around the Supreme Court's ruling and seized upon it, he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge J.L. Edmondson, who once represented the Gwinnett
school board, chided Sheppard for those arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that's what lawyers did: read cases, distinguish
cases, advise their clients,'' Edmondson said. There is nothing
wrong with that, nor should the term ``Bible Belt'' be considered
negative, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mullaney, general counsel for the city of Jacksonville,
said the policy follows the law and is neutral towards prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jacksonville residents want religious speech and prayer at
graduation and others want a complete prohibition, regardless of
constitutional infringements, he said. ``This policy was designed
for neither group.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Phyllis Kravitch noted that Duval's policy is entitled
``Graduation Prayers'' and the school has almost total control over
graduation ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you acknowledge that the U.S. Supreme Court has said you
can't have something that is a sham?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That message came through loud and clear,'' Mullaney replied.
``We wanted to get ourselves out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision is not expected for several months.

not an endless dinner party. &HT;    Last week, the two culinary icons were holed up in her downtown
hotel suite, cardboard boxes filled with their new book stacked

they spent the morning signing copy after copy. They stopped long
enough for an hour interview with The Chronicle, then it was off to
Macy's for another hour of book signing. They're on the end of an

   Q: How many records does Ty Cobb hold?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.L., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Retiring in 1928 with more than 15 major records, Ty Cobb
currently holds the career record for batting average (.366), runs
(2,245), games played by an outfielder (2,935), single-season
batting championships (12) and steals of home (50).
</P>
<P>
   Cobb once held the career record for hits (4,189), singles
(3,052), runs batted in (1,960), games played (3,034), at-bats
(11,429), total bases (5,854) and extra-base hits (1,136); and the
single-season record for hits (248), stolen bases (96), and total
bases (367).
</P>
<P>
   His .366 lifetime batting average record is generally believed
to be unbreakable. Since 1928, less than a dozen players have
topped .366 in a single season, and Tony Gwynn leads active players
of at least 4,000 at-bats with a .339 career average.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb's record of 2,245 runs is in more jeopardy. Rickey
Henderson of the New York Mets finished the 1999 season with 2,103
career runs. During the past five seasons, Henderson has averaged
90 runs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who sold Underoos for young children?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.C., Grand Prairie, Texas
</P>
<P>

 Just Like Bogie &AMP; Bacall: Two grand French chefs talk
about  California cuisine, America's palate and the value of 
 friendship.   By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Life for Julia Child and Jacques Pepin is not an
endless dinner party.
 &HT;    Last week, on one of the nicest days San Francisco had seen all
year, the two culinary icons were holed up in her downtown hotel
suite, cardboard boxes filled with their new book stacked behind
them. With nothing more than glasses of water on the table, they
spent the morning signing copy after copy. They stopped long enough
for an hour interview with The Chronicle, then it was off to Macy's
for another hour of book signing.
 &HT;    They hoped to break for a good Chinese lunch _ ``someplace that
is really Chinese with Chinese people there and no Americans,''
Julia requested _ before an evening filled with more signings, more
talk, more time being America's royal culinary couple.
 &HT;    Don't feel too bad for them. They did get to eat foie gras four
times the day before.
 &HT;    The San Francisco stop ended an eight-city promotional tour for
their new television show and companion book. The 22 episodes of
``Julia and Jacques: Cooking at Home'' began airing last month on
public television stations nationwide.
 &HT;    Friends for 40 years, the pair owes much to California. Although
they both live in New England, their roots here are strong. Julia
was born in Pasadena and still winters in Santa Barbara. During
last week's three-day trip, she visited her younger sister,
Dorothy, in Sausalito. Jacques also has spent plenty of time here _
San Francisco's PBS affiliate, KQED, has produced six of his
television shows and he is a former board member of the California
Culinary Academy.
 &HT;    When their book and TV show debuted last month, critics seized
on the pair's contrasting culinary approaches. But this is no
prizefight. So what if she likes white pepper and he prefers black?
So she doesn't peel her bell peppers for the nicoise salad and he
does. The point is not to watch two old bulls go at it, but to
realize cooking is, in the end, a creative endeavor based on good
technique. Ultimately, their message is that there is more than one
way to roast a chicken.
 &HT;    In person, the 87-year-old Julia and the 63-year-old Jacques are
as loving as siblings. They've no doubt heard the other's opinions
on cooking hundreds of times before, but listen politely all the
same. He's the intellectual, weaving bits of sociology,
anthropology and economics into his rap. She's the icon, content to
sit back until a particular issue moves her and then offering a
thoughtful but snappy opinion in a way that makes it clear she
doesn't give a damn about what anyone else thinks.
 &HT;    Throughout their careers, hers has been the popular draw, his
the technical one. He, a European-trained chef and former personal
chef to Charles du Gaulle, is a master in the kitchen. She remains
the loopy, practical and talented home cook who sees no harm in
flattening meat with a frying pan instead of Pepin's preferred
French meat mallet.
 &HT;    And that's why the two work together so well. He knows there
must be a way to translate the precision and creativity of the
restaurant kitchen to the home kitchen. And that there is no better
link than Julia.
 &HT;    Under her guidance, America learned that a roasted chicken,
along with a salad made from whatever was on hand could be a fine
meal. She let people be less than perfect in the kitchen. Early
fans of her shows recall an ill-flipped potato pancake that landed
on the stove _ ``Well, that didn't go very well'' _ and her tip
that followed: You can always pick it up if you're alone in the
kitchen.
 &HT;    And there is her breezy, goofy and oft-mimicked style. ``We're
having four vegetarians for dinner tonight,'' she said on an
episode of the ``The French Chef,'' which ran from 1962-73. ``I
mean, we're not going to eat them, but I have to make a vegetarian
dinner.''
 &HT;    Pepin is the professional. His impact on America's home kitchen
is strong, if not as wide-ranging. He is more prolific, with 20
cookbooks. And his television shows demonstrate that one can never
learn too much about technique.
 &HT;    The pair's new show, likely the last time they will undertake a
joint project of such scope, is sort of
vaudeville-meets-Masterpiece Theater. Cooking is mixed in with
eye-rolling shtick. He dresses in a toga for the Caesar salad. She
fires up a chain saw when confronted with an ostrich egg to crack.
It's a little like watching your parents trying to breakdance.
 &HT;    With the cameras off, they drop the antics. But the rhythm they
share in the kitchen translates easily to their conversation.
 &HT;    ``Doing and tasting and doing and tasting and moving forward
with the recipe is the way to do it,'' Jacques says. ``I see people
making a whole recipe without tasting. You follow the food and
react to it.''
 &HT;    Adds Julia: ``And if you know how to do the basics, then you can
simply do what you want.''
 &HT;    Among other subjects they tackled last week:
 &HT;      
 THE STATE OF U.S. FOOD &HT;     _ Julia:  I see unpromising things in pork. They raise it so
lean now that it's tough and doesn't have much flavor. And our beef
_ our beef is now second class. It's too young and it has no
marbling and very little flavor so I think it is actually going out
fashion.
 &HT;     _ Jacques:  When I came to this country there were no leeks, no
shallots, not very good vegetables and only two salads _ iceberg
and romaine. Now there's all these oils and vinegars and
supermarkets that are full of salads and vegetables.
 &HT;    The wine paralleled the growth of food for many years. Then
maybe seven or eight years ago we kind of exploded into bread.
Maybe good bread was common before that in the Bay Area, but all
over the country good bread has only come more recently. The bakery
bread now is incredible. And cheese. Bread and cheese. That's
what's going on.
 &HT;      
 TRENDY FOOD &HT;     _ Jacques:  People are always eating food they think they have
discovered or made new. Now they're bringing back stews and braised
meats and getting crazy with it. At some point they'll probably
bring back quiche and be very happy about it.
 &HT;     rh1   
 _ Julia:  I think (quiche) has come back. It's so good, too. But so
many things get done so badly. I've gotten so that I really hate
pasta. If you get pasta in a restaurant it has been sitting around.
If you go to somebody's house and they don't know how to cook you
get pasta with something tantamount to soup on it.
 &HT;      
 GENETICALLY ALTERED FOOD, ORGANICS AND IRRADIATION &HT;     _ Jacques:  Whether it's an additive, whether it's
biotechnology, whether it's hormones in food, that stuff should be
clearly, distinctly labeled so people can make their own choice.
You want to eat that stuff? Fine, it's your own choice.
 &HT;    If you can breed a tomato that grows without insecticide or
pesticide, why not? If you can have an egg with less fat or
whatever in it, why not? For us as cooks, we're concerned with
whether a tomato is good. Is it juicy, does it have taste? 
 
 _ Julia:  Anything that can improve the tomato I'm very much for. I
don't think you make this a one-unit answer. Every case is
different. There's this business about the monarch butterfly which
does not like biotech corn. I think all of these things you have to
know about. But it's wonderful that you're able to improve things.
We're in absolutely a new frontier and we should all embrace it and
study and know about it. And especially with irradiated food, its
horrifying to think of condemning two tons of hamburger when if it
were irradiated it would be all right to eat.
 &HT;      
 HOW AMERICA'S TABLE WOULD BE DIFFERENT IF JULIA HAD NOT
SPECIALIZED IN FRENCH COOKING &HT;     _ Julia:  Somebody else would have come along because at that
point we were ready. We had (a French chef) in the White House and
anything the Kennedys did was news and suddenly you could get to
Europe in a few hours rather than a few days.
 &HT;      
 _ Jacques:  In the '60s, with women's liberation and organic
gardening and health food stores, the whole idea of looking at
ourselves and our lifestyles began and food was part of that. Of
course, we have turned perhaps too narcissistic and take care of
the me me me. In any case, people started changing and wanted to
see some sort of different food on their plates.
 &HT;     
HEALTHY EATING &HT;     _ Julia:  You find people are afraid of French cooking because
it has a reputation of being rich in fat and so forth. It's a shame
because when you go over to France, you don't see these great big
fat people that we see here. So obviously it's a much healthier way
of eating. It's horrifying to go to Disneyworld or Disneyland and
see these great big chunky people always eating. As we say in the
American Institute of Wine and Food: moderation, small helpings, no
snacking, no seconds.
 &HT;      
 _ Jacques:  So we say after having four servings of foie gras.
 &HT;      
 CALIFORNIA CUISINE &HT;     _ Jacques:  California cuisine is a state of mind. 
  
 _ Julia:  I don't think it seems so terribly different from good
food anywhere. There is a nice informality about it and the weather
contributes to that a lot.
 &HT;      
 WHAT THEY LIKE TO EAT IN SAN FRANCISCO &HT;     _ Julia:  Crab if I'm here in the crab season. Crab with
mayonnaise and lemon.
 &HT;      
 _ Jacques:  Dungeness crab is certainly one of my favorites.
 &HT;      
 TEACHING CHILDREN TO EAT &HT;     _ Julia:  I guess for a long time it was fashionable to say,
``Do you want this or do you want this?'' to your child and now
you're supposed to present it and say, ``This is your dinner.'' If
he doesn't eat it you don't worry too much. 
  
 _ Jacques:  My daughter when she was five would go home and say,
``What's for dinner?'' and my wife would say, ``Food,'' and that
was it.
 &HT;      
 THEIR LEGACY &HT;     _ Jacques:  My daughter.
 &HT;     
 _ Julia:  The joy of cooking and eating. Too bad that that's been
used already.

   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; JACQUES'S NEAR-NICOISE SALAD WITH SAUTEED FRESH TUNA
</P>
<P>
   This recipe is a rather contemporary variation on the nicoise
theme, combining some customary ingredients such as tomatoes,
olives, potatoes and egg wedges with sauteed strips of fresh tuna
and mesclun. The mix of small lettuces and tangy greens originates
in Nice and Provence, but has become a standard item in our produce
sections.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces fresh tuna, in one chunk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup Jacques's Vinaigrette in a Jar (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped scallion
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cooked waxy potatoes, such as fingerlings or small red
or white new potatoes, in 1/2-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons small black nicoise olives
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup thinly sliced red onion
</P>
<P>
   5 or 6 fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 small ripe tomato, cut into wedges
</P>
<P>
   1 hard-boiled egg, quartered into wedges
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   A large handful mesclun or other tender salad greens
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the raw tuna into 1/3-inch-thick slices (about 4 or 5) and
sprinkle with half of the salt. Coat the bottom of a saute pan with
a tablespoon or two of the vinaigrette and set over high heat. When
sizzling, quickly lay all the tuna pieces flat in the pan and cook
for about 20 seconds, until just opaque on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Flip the slices over, cook another 10 seconds, then remove the
pan from the heat, allowing the tuna to finish cooking while you
assemble the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Place the scallions, potato chunks, olives, onion, basil leaves,
and the tomato and egg wedges in a mixing bowl. Drizzle on about 2
to 3 tablespoons of the vinaigrette, season with the rest of the
salt and the pepper, and toss briefly to coat. Add the mesclun to
the bowl and toss again, gently.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the salad out onto a dinner plate, and arrange the chunky
vegetable and egg pieces _ if they are hidden by the mesclun leaves
_ so they are nicely displayed. Lay the tuna slices on top of the
mound of greens and drizzle the juices in the pan over the salad.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 1 or 2.

 &LR; JACQUES'S VINAIGRETTE IN A JAR
</P>
<P>
   You can keep this in the refrigerator for a couple of weeks and
use it whenever needed. However, chopped garlic (or shallots, if
you use them) will develop an off flavor after a while, so, if you
will be storing the dressing longer, add garlic to the vinaigrette
only when you dress your salad _ don't put it in the jar.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper

<P>
   1/4 cup red- or white-wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup extra virgin olive oil or peanut oil, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Put all the ingredients in a 12-ounce glass jar with a screwtop
lid, close and shake very well. Taste and adjust the seasonings,
adding more oil or vinegar, as you like.
</P>

 &LR; STUFFED ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS
</P>
<P>
   Artichoke bottoms are a treat by themselves and make delicious
and attractive little saucers for savory fillings. Even simply
prepared vegetables, eggs or seafood become quite special when
heaped into a shapely and perfectly cooked artichoke bottom _
suitable as a first course, as a garnish to a main course, or as
the featured dish of a brunch or other light meal.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 cooked artichoke bottoms, chokes removed (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Sauteed Spinach Stuffing (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons fresh breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the artichoke bottoms from the blanc; drain and dry.
Season each with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and
arrange in the baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Mound 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing into each bottom.
Combine the breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese and sprinkle over each
one.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 15 minutes, until the crumbs are golden brown and
the artichokes are thoroughly heated. Serve immediately, either in
the baking dish or on individual plates.
</P>
<P>
   (If both the bottoms and the stuffing are freshly cooked and
warm, you don't need to heat them in the oven _ just put them under
the broiler to brown the breadcrumb topping.)

 &LR; SAUTEED SPINACH STUFFING
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh spinach leaves, preferably young and tender
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons heavy cream (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Wash the spinach leaves well; dump into a sinkful of cold water,
swish up and down, and let any dirt and sand settle to the bottom.
(Repeat in fresh water if leaves are still gritty.) Remove the stem
from each leaf, tearing it away with one hand while holding the
folded leaf in the other. Shake off excess water but do not dry.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large saute pan, or wide Dutch oven, with some
water still clinging to the leaves. As the bottom leaves start to
cook, toss the pile with a wooden spoon, bringing the wilted leaves
up so uncooked leaves will start to saute. If leaves seem to be
sticking to the bottom, add a few tablespoons of water to the pan.
Season with the salt and pepper; keep turning the leaves as they
release their liquid.
</P>
<P>
   You can add the optional cream at this point, for a richer
filling, or to soften the taste of older spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for about 6 to 8
minutes _ or longer if you have added cream _ until the spinach is
tender and almost all of the liquid has evaporated. Remove from the
heat, sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the spinach, and stir to
mix.
</P>

 &LR; COOKED ARTICHOKE BOTTOMS
</P>
<P>
   It is worth a bit of effort to shape a very neat artichoke
bottom. They taste luxurious, but can be quite economical. Since
the outer leaves are discarded before cooking, it's fine to use
artichokes with yellowing or spotted leaves. You can often buy such
older artichokes at a fraction of the regular price, and trim them
to make a batch of artichoke bottoms. Here they are cooked in a
mixture of water, lemon juice and flour called a blanc.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   6 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   6 large artichokes (Green Globe variety)
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, halved for rubbing on artichokes
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the flour and lemon juice together in a 3-quart
stainless-steel saucepan to make a smooth paste. Still whisking to
prevent lumps, add, slowly at first, about 3 cups of the water.
Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat, stir
in the remaining 3 cups water and the salt; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Work with one artichoke at a time, frequently rubbing the
exposed surfaces with the lemon half to prevent discoloring.
Starting at the bottom row, bend each leaf back until it snaps,
then pull it down and off the artichoke, leaving a bit of the leaf
base attached. Don't yank the whole leaf off at the base. Rub with
lemon. Continue snapping and peeling off the leaves and rubbing
with lemon.
</P>
<P>
   When you have exposed the entire artichoke bottom and the
interior core of lighter-colored leaves, with a sharp knife, cut
off this inner core crosswise, just above the fleshy part of the
bottom. Trim the cut edge to make it smooth and even. (You will see
the inedible choke but don't remove it until after cooking.)
</P>
<P>
   Using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler, trim away the remaining
green exterior of the artichoke bottom, exposing the whitish flesh
left by the leaves. Cut off the stem. Rub well with lemon. Drop the
trimmed artichoke bottom into the blanc and prepare the remaining
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure all the artichoke bottoms are covered by the blanc;
add more water if necessary. Bring to a boil, and simmer,
uncovered, for 20 minutes, until easily pierced with a sharp knife.
Remove from the heat, but leave the bottoms in the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 6 artichoke bottoms.

 &LR; EGGPLANT AND ZUCCHINI GRATIN
</P>
<P>
   Serve this as a vegetarian main course, or as an accompaniment
to leg of lamb or other roasts or grilled meats. It will have the
finest flavor, certainly, at the end of summer, when ripe locally
grown eggplant, tomatoes and zucchini are abundant and absolutely
fresh. But this can be a midwinter casserole too, as all three
vegetables are generally available year-round in markets.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup or so olive oil, excellent-quality
</P>
<P>
   1 large or 2 medium eggplants, about 11/4 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   21/2 teaspoons herbes de Provence
</P>
<P>
   2 medium zucchini, about 1 pound total
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 ripe tomatoes, about 1 pound total
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup or so fresh breadcrumbs, not too finely ground
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup or so freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the rack on the lower-middle level of the oven and
preheat to 400 degrees. Smear a large baking sheet the baking sheet
generously with 1/3 cup of the olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Trim off the ends of the eggplant and slice it on the diagonal
into ovals 1/2 inch thick. One at a time, lay the slices on the
baking sheet, press to coat lightly with oil and turn them over.
Arrange the slices oiled side up in a single layer and sprinkle on
1/2 teaspoon each of salt and herbes de Provence.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for about 15 minutes, until the eggplant slices are soft
and somewhat shriveled; allow to cool briefly. Leave the oven on if
you will be baking the gratin right away.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, trim the ends off the zucchini and cut lengthwise
into slices no more than 1/4 inch thick. Core the tomatoes and cut
into slices 1/4 inch thick. Spread out the slices and sprinkle them
lightly with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Film an 8-cup gratin or baking dish well with 1 teaspoon olive
oil and sprinkle a teaspoon of the dried herbs all over the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Lay 1 or 2 eggplant slices, lengthwise, against a narrow side of
the dish. Arrange a long slice or two of zucchini in front of the
eggplant, then place 2 or 3 tomato slices in front of the zucchini.
Repeat the procedure to fill the pan with alternating rows of
eggplant, zucchini and tomatoes. Arrange each new row of slices so
the colorful top edges of the previous row are still visible.
Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese and a teaspoon of
the herbes de Provence. Add a tablespoon of olive oil, then toss
and rub it in with your fingers to coat the crumbs, but keep them
loose. Sprinkle the crumbs evenly over the vegetables and drizzle
the rest of the oil over all.
</P>
<P>
   Place the dish in the center of the oven and bake for 40
minutes, until the vegetables are soft, the juices are bubbling,
and the top is a deep golden brown. (If the crumbs need more
browning, you can put the gratin under the broiler for a few
moments.)
</P>
<P>
   Serve hot, directly from the baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

 &HT;       
   
 By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  In this time of eye-popping technology where
kitchen appliances talk to you and the electronic map in your car
chides you for being such a navigational nerd, it is almost
refreshing to hear an unbelievably low-tech way of grape farming.
<P>
   Almost, because the principles of biodynamics, a sort of
``beyond organics'' implies some far-out ideas and practices that
modern folks have long since dismissed as archaic and backward.
</P>
<P>
   Farming by the movement of the planets and the moon, burying a
steer horn packed with manure in the vineyard and spraying vines
with crystals, may sound like weird science but it swayed Jim
Fetzer. He's selling his 100 percent biodynamically-grown grapes to
Fox Creek Winery for the first commercial biodynamic wines.
</P>
<P>
   Fetzer, a member of the Mendocino Fetzer wine family, was once a
traditional California wine-grape grower leaning toward organics.
He now owns Ceago Vinegarden vineyard in Mendocino County, a
certified biodynamic vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Fetzer looked at the evidence of farming the biodynamic way and
how the program replenishes the earth, and was impressed. He found
soils that had become sterile from too many chemicals could be
brought back to health and produce high quality grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can smell the difference in the soil,'' Fetzer says.
``Pick up a handful of dirt from any vineyard and it doesn't have a
smell. The soil in my biodynamic vineyard is aromatic and rich,
with hints of anise and natural elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Although biodynamics is a complex system based on theories
developed in the 1920s by Austrian scientist and philosopher Rudolf
Steiner, many of the practical applications are simple. Biodynamics
does not use chemically synthesized fertilizers, pesticides,
fungicides, fumigants, hormones, antibiotics or growth regulators.
Crop fertility is centered around compost manures, green ground
covers and crop rotation. Weeds and pests are controlled by a
balanced farm ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Brook Winery is owned by Rutherford Benchmarks Group and
housed in the old Fetzer winery in Redwood Valley, Mendocino.
Winemaker Greg Graziano has taken the biodynamically-grown grapes
from Ceago Vinegarden and produced two exciting wines. While
organic wines in general have met with less than enthusiastic
reviews and sales, these biodynamic wines may turn things around.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Brook 1998 Ceago Vinegarden Mendocino Chardonnay ($29) is a
lovely wine with floral and green apple aromas, crisp acidity,
citrus accents and subtle oak notes. Some of the 1997 Fox Brook
Chardonnay may still be in the market; the wine benefits from the
extra year in bottle and is more complex with mineral notes.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Brook 1997 Ceago Vinegarden Mendocino Merlot ($39) is a
concentrated rich wine with deep black cherry and spice flavors,
excellent balance and a long finish. The wine is bright and packed
with flavor and balanced with nicely integrated tannins. If you've
been avoiding Merlot because it lacks personality, try this one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh  &LR; Green Business
</P>
<P>
   Organic grape growing and biodynamics represent a strong
commitment to pro-environment farming, but protecting the
environment goes beyond farming. Recently, the Sonoma County Board
of Supervisors awarded Green Business Certificates to Davis Bynum,
Benziger, Asti, Chateau Souverain, Kendall Jackson-Vinwood Cellars
and Trentadue for ecologically friendly business practices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A Corking Good Year &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the myths that seems to circulate around the wine
industry every year or two is a shortage of high quality natural
cork for wine stoppers. Jochen Michalski, president of Cork Supply
USA, says not to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winemakers can look forward to a stable supply of high quality
corks as a result of another good year for the cork harvest,'' he
says. The 1999 harvest from Portugal and Spain, the two main cork
suppliers, is slightly lower than last year's but both countries
have had outstanding cork harvests the three previous years.
</P>
<P>
   The string of good cork harvests also means that prices for wine
corks should not increase. Although the cork is a small part of the
overall cost of a bottle of wine, anything that helps to keep the
cost down is good news.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Riesling Reprieve &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For years, a growing number of wine writers and concerned wine
drinkers have come out against the use of foreign names and terms,
like Champagne and Chablis, on U.S. wines, and most have been
eliminated. One, however _ Johannisberg Riesling _ seems to have
more lives than Morris the cat. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms has issued a ruling allowing the use of the term
``Johannisberg Riesling'' on American wine labels for seven more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Johannisberg is a German place-name and, like Champagne, doesn't
belong on American wines. What's wrong with just plain old
``Riesling?''

EDITORS NOTE: The Chronicle regularly features ``Best Way'', a
column in which the Food staff tries to establish the most reliable
way to cook many of our favorite foods.  BEST WAY: Beating Egg Whites  
   
 By Lynne Bennett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Is the centuries-old tradition that says copper
bowls are imperative for making meringues fact or myth? Do egg
whites beat higher when they're at room temperature or straight
from the refrigerator? Does cream of tartar help?
<P>
   These are just some of the variables that can affect the best
way to beat egg whites, which can make or break souffles,
meringues, cakes, chiffon pies and mousses.
</P>
<P>
   To find the best way to whip whites, The Chronicle's food
department whipped egg whites straight from the refrigerator and at
room temperature, in a stainless steel bowl and in a copper one,
and with or without cream of tartar.
</P>
<P>
   For each batch, we used 1/2 cup of egg whites (approximately 3
extra-large whites). We beat the whites with a hand-held mixer with
a standard beater attachment at low speed for 1 minute, then
gradually up to high speed for approximately 3 minutes until the
whites formed moist stiff peaks. When we used cream of tartar we
added 1/2 teaspoon to the whites after they became foamy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BEST WAY
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; We found the best way to achieve firm, creamy fine-textured,
stable egg whites is to beat room-temperature whites in a copper
bowl. The whites rose to the greatest volume and stayed there for
the longest time. The copper in the bowl also acted as a stabilizer
to help prevent the effects of overbeating.
</P>
<P>
   We brought the egg whites to room temperature by placing
uncracked eggs in a bowl of hot-from-the-tap water for about 5
minutes. This made separating the whites from the yolks a little
more difficult than if the eggs had come straight from the
refrigerator, but it also made beating them easier.
</P>
<P>
   The worst results came from beating refrigerated whites in a
stainless steel bowl without cream of tartar. These whites had the
least volume and were most fragile, breaking down quickly. The
texture of the whites was coarse, with large bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; AN APPEALING ALTERNATIVE
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  We found that adding cream of tartar to room-temperature whites
beaten in a stainless steel bowl improved the results dramatically.
The whites stayed at full volume nearly twice as long as the whites
beaten in the stainless steel bowl without the cream of tartar.
</P>
<P>
   The texture of the beaten whites will not be as fine as the
whites from the copper bowl, but if a copper bowl is unavailable,
cream of tartar can help make up some of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   When egg whites are overbeaten, they separate. Cream of tartar
mimics copper in helping stabilize the foam, allowing leeway for
overzealous beaters.

EDITORS NOTE: Each week, The San Francisco Chronicle's panel of
professional tasters tries a different product available in
supermarkets.   TASTER'S CHOICE: Brand Names Crunch Corn Flake Rivals  
   
 By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With something as simple as corn flakes, could
there really be that much difference between brands? Today's
tasting panel thinks so.
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were surprised to find nine versions of corn flakes,
including name brands, store brands and health food brands. Seven
had remarkably similar ingredient lists _ corn, sugar, salt and
some kind of malt product. The other two had neither sugar nor
malt.
</P>
<P>
   The cereals were served dry, with milk on the side.
</P>
<P>
   There didn't seem to be a consensus on the best cereal. Still
one brand came out well ahead of the competition. For the most
part, name brands did well, while all of the health food brands
scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kellogg's &LR;  (12 ounces, $2.49-$2.99 at many supermarkets) was
the overwhelming favorite. Two panelists described it as the
classic corn flake. Another thought it had a pleasant corn flavor,
but one found it too salty and still another thought it was too
toasty. Four would buy it; one might.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Post Toasties &LR;  (18 ounces, $2.29 at Draeger's) and  &UR; Trader &LR; 
 &UR; Joe's &LR;  (15 ounces, $1.89) tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   Three panelists thought Post Toasties were too salty, but two of
them liked the corn flavor. Another panelist described the flavor
as too malty at the end. One would buy it, three might buy it, and
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   One panelist liked the sweet-salty balance of Trader Joe's, and
two others liked the crunchiness. But one panelist disliked the way
it quickly turned to mush with milk, and another described it as
``tasting like vitamins.'' Two would buy it, two might buy it, and
one would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Total &LR;  (10 ounces, $4.49-$4.69 at many supermarkets) ranked
just below Post Toasties and Trader Joe's. One panelist compared it
to a corn chip; another called it a ``corn flake wanna-be'' and
especially disliked the way it fell apart in milk. Others liked the
toasty corny flavors and light texture. Three would buy it; two
would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lucky &LR;  (18 ounces, $2.59) came in fourth. Three panelists said
it lacked flavor, but two of them liked the crunch. Two others
objected to the harsh texture.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield, Safeway, Arrowhead Mills and Erewhon were also
tasted but ranked too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Shelley Handler,
food writer and consultant; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson, Chronicle staff writer; and

 flavorful cacciatore.  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Chicken cacciatore is a classic recipe that has
been gently updated by May Ditano at Columbus Restaurant in the
Marina. Instead of cooking everything together, each item is cooked
separately and then combined, making a vibrantly fresh dish.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chicken may be served immediately, but it's great made
ahead, refrigerated, and reheated the next day. Surprisingly, it
retains its fresh character even after reheating.
</P>
<P>
   Ditano's food is probably the closest thing to Italian home
cooking as you'll find at a restaurant. Before moving to the
Marina, she presided over a sliver of a space on Broadway between
North Beach and Chinatown for 25 years. With a 10-seat counter and
only five tables, she cooked before customers' eyes as well as
waiting tables, with only a dishwasher/busboy to help her.
</P>
<P>
   Ditano became legendary for her strong personality and her great
cooking. If she liked you, cloth napkins would replace the paper
ones, and you'd likely get a special pastry for dessert. If you
offended her, she would register her displeasure with an arched
eyebrow and silence _ if you were lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Once when a customer asked, '`What's good?'' she shot back,
``Why do I have to sell my food? It's so good I shouldn't have to
sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago Ditano moved into a grander space that once
housed Cafe Adriano. Now she has waiters and help in the kitchen,
but she still cooks one of the best cacciatores around.
</P>
<P>

rosemary and saute until the chicken is golden-brown on all sides,
about 10 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   While the chicken is browning, heat 1 tablespoon oil in another
saute pan. Add the yellow and red peppers and saute until soft,
about 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peppers
to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same pan, add 1 tablespoon oil and heat over
medium-high heat. Add the onion and saute until golden, about 5 to
10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the onion to a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the same pan. Add the
tomatoes and mushrooms and saute over medium-high heat until the
mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange the browned chicken in a large casserole. Top with the
peppers, onion, tomatoes, mushrooms and olives. Pour the wine over
all, then season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>

 COOK'S BOOKS: Julia and Jacques Battle Basics   By David A. Steinberg 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  I would have to say that of all the personalities
in cooking circles, Julia Child is by far and away my favorite.
<P>
   Always a fan, I fell in love with ``la Julia'' while living in
Boston, when I took one of her classes. Her undeniable charm is
made more evident when you witness her, first hand, whack the
bejeezus out of a batch of brioche dough or offer up a creme brulee
firestorm with her always-handy propane torch.
</P>
<P>
   Many would argue that others have better technique or better
teaching methods, but I defy anyone to find someone who has made
cooking more fun. Add to that the unmistakable art of Jacques Pepin
and how can you go wrong? You can't.
</P>
<P>
   The two have collaborated on ``Julia and Jacques: Cooking at
Home,'' a book that accompanies the new PBS-TV series. Together,
they're not only a tour de force in the kitchen but have an
undeniable chemistry as well.
</P>
<P>
   The book's format frames each recipe with comments _ Child's on
the left side and Pepin's on the right. They are integral to each
dish, demonstrating the varying perspectives these two
strong-willed cooks have about preparing similar dishes.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the chemistry comes from the way Child and Pepin
handle their good-natured conflicts. Their differences range from
subtle ones to being completely at odds _ only pointing out the
fact that recipes are not written in stone.
</P>
<P>
   Child's and Pepin's mantra is that once you understand the basic
techniques of handling basic ingredients, you can adapt a recipe
with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   To further this goal, they divide much of the book by ingredient
_ a chapter on eggs, another on fish and so on. There are
relatively few recipes for such a large volume _ 100 or so spread
over 430 pages _ but they are rock-solid, heavily French in
influence but remarkably approachable.
</P>
<P>
   Child's Caesar salad recipe notes she is probably one of the few
people alive who had it prepared by Caesar Cardini himself. It is
simple in ingredients _ no anchovies! _ and method, but the flavors
are clear and vibrant. It makes you wonder why restaurants charge
so much for it.
</P>
<P>
   Pepin's apple tart/galette is more complex. While somewhat
time-consuming, it is remarkably easy to prepare, and the results
are picture perfect, literally _ for once, what came out of my oven
looked EXACTLY like the photo in the book. And, it received
effusive praise even when it was a day old and cold from the
refrigerator. The flaky pastry dough (Child's recipe) lives up to
its name and is amazingly flavorful.
</P>
<P>
   Pepin's recipe for Crab Souffle sounded too good to pass up.
Never having made a souffle before, I went through some uneasy
moments, especially when after the allotted time the souffle didn't
poof up. But I realized that the souffle's collar was probably
keeping the heat from the center _ the one time when Child's
suggestion led me astray. With the collar off, not only did the
souffle do what it was supposed to, but the dish was everything a
good souffle should be _ delicate, silky and superbly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a traditional cookbook with a lot of recipes and
instructions. It is far more of a visual textbook on how to cook,
with recipes used to illustrate technique. The book is visually
engaging with extensive photographs and expansive, detailed
directions. If you want a cookbook that will help with basic
technique and to expand your repertoire, this one is it.

 &LR; JULIA'S CAESAR SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   18 to 24 crisp, narrow leaves from the hearts of 2 heads romaine
lettuce, or a package of romaine hearts (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain toasted croutons (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup or more excellent olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 whole lemon, halved and seeded
</P>
<P>
   Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
</P>
<P>
   Special Equipment
</P>
<P>
   A large mixing bowl; a small frying pan
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   If using romaine heads, remove the outside leaves of the romaine
until you get down to the cone where the leaves are 4 to 7 inches
in length _ you'll want 6 to 8 of these leaves per serving.
Separate the leaves and wash them carefully to keep them whole,
roll them loosely in clean towels, and keep refrigerated until
serving time. (Save the remains for other salads).
</P>
<P>
   To flavor the croutons, crush the garlic clove with the flat of
a chef's knife, sprinkle on 1/4 teaspoon of the salt, and mince
well. Pour about a tablespoon of olive oil on the garlic and mash
again with the knife, rubbing and pressing to make a soft puree.
</P>
<P>
   Scrape the puree into the frying pan, add another tablespoon of
oil and warm over low-medium heat. Add the croutons and toss for a
minute or two to infuse them with the garlic oil, then remove from
the heat. (For a milder garlic flavor, you can strain the puree
through a small sieve into a pan before adding the extra oil and
croutons. Discard the bits of garlic.)
</P>
<P>
   To coddle the egg, bring a small saucepan of water to the
simmer. Pierce the large end of the egg with a pushpin to prevent
cracking, then simmer it for exactly 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mixing and serving the Caesar:  &LR; Dress the salad just before
serving. Have ready all the dressing ingredients and a salad fork
and spoon for tossing.
</P>
<P>
   Drizzle 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the romaine leaves and
toss to coat, lifting the leaves from the bottom and turning them
toward you, so they tumble over like a wave. Sprinkle with a
generous pinch of salt and several grinds of pepper, toss once or
twice, then add the lemon juice and several drops of
Worcestershire; toss again. Taste for seasoning, and add more, if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Crack the egg and drop it right on the romaine leaves, then toss
to break it up and coat the leaves. Sprinkle on the cheese, toss
briefly then add the croutons (and the garlicky bits in the pan, if
you wish) and toss for the last time, just to mix them into the
salad.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange 6 or more leaves in a single layer on individual plates,
scatter the croutons all around and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2 or 3.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Plain Toasted Croutons:  &LR; Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Remove the crusts from 4 or more thick slices of home-style white
bread and slice bread into 1/2-inch strips and then the strips into
1/2-inch cubes, to make 4 cups. Spread the cubes in a single layer
on a cookie sheet and set in the oven for about 10 minutes, turning
once or twice, until lightly toasted on all sides. Spread the cubes
on a tray to cool before using or freezing.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Editor's note: According to studies, uncooked eggs may not &LR; 
 &LR; be safe since, in rare instances, they may carry salmonella. &LR;

   Q: How many records does Ty Cobb hold?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.L., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Retiring in 1928 with more than 15 major records, Ty Cobb
currently holds the career record for batting average (.366), runs
(2,245), games played by an outfielder (2,935), single-season
batting championships (12) and steals of home (50).
</P>
<P>
   Cobb once held the career record for hits (4,189), singles
(3,052), runs batted in (1,960), games played (3,034), at-bats
(11,429), total bases (5,854) and extra-base hits (1,136); and the
single-season record for hits (248), stolen bases (96), and total
bases (367).
</P>
<P>
   His .366 lifetime batting average record is generally believed
to be unbreakable. Since 1928, less than a dozen players have
topped .366 in a single season, and Tony Gwynn leads active players
of at least 4,000 at-bats with a .339 career average.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb's record of 2,245 runs is in more jeopardy. Rickey
Henderson of the New York Mets finished the 1999 season with 2,103
career runs. During the past five seasons, Henderson has averaged
90 runs a year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who sold Underoos for young children?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.C., Grand Prairie, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Underoos, a line of children's costume underwear featuring
licensed characters such as Superman, Batman, Yoda and The A-Team,
was introduced in 1978 by Fruit of the Loom.
</P>
<P>
   Underoos were sold through the mid-'80s. In the Fruit of the
Loom 1998 annual report, Chairman of the Board William Farley
states that the company's childrenswear division is working on a
``rejuvenated line'' of Underoos.

ISRAELI SETTLERS PREVENT DISMANTLING OF ILLEGAL OUTPOST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHVUT RACHEL II _ A few dozen Israeli settlers staked out on a
West Bank hilltop Tuesday prevented the government from taking down
an illegal outpost that had been slated for dismantling.
</P>
<P>
   The group used a makeshift roadblock of boulders and old tires
to prevent a flatbed truck from reaching a hilltop where a solitary
green and yellow container had been perched as a claim to the land.
</P>
<P>
   The settlers danced, waved Israeli flags and sat on the ground
in front of the boulders on a narrow strip of asphalt leading to
the top of the hill. An hour later, the truck drove off empty.
</P>
<P>
   The hilltop outpost, called Shvut Rachel II, was to be the first
of 12 rogue settlements removed voluntarily by the settlers'
council over the next two weeks. Their removal was part of an
unprecedented deal worked out between veteran settler leaders and
Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Barak's government determined that 15 of the 42
settlement outposts put up under the previous government, led by
Benjamin Netanyahu, were established without proper government
permits.
</P>
<P>
   After consultation with the settlers' council, the prime
minister agreed to dismantle only 12. In return, settler leaders
promised to cooperate peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   But younger settlers, calling themselves the Second Generation,
defied the terms of the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that giving up parts of the land will not
go without comment,'' said Shivi Drori, a 26-year-old settler who
is one of the spokesmen for the Second Generation movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to know there's still Zionism here and Jewish
values can still rule,'' said Drori, who lives in an outpost that
will be permitted to stand. ``We hope we will gather many people
who will fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the protest remained small, with no more
than a few dozen young people camped out on the hilltop planting
olive trees.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli soldiers passed by in jeeps intermittently without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   But the protests are likely to get louder as the settlers'
council moves to take down the rest of the illegal outposts.
</P>
<P>
   This first hilltop, near the Palestinian town of Nablus in the
northern West Bank, was uninhabited. Most of the others are filled
with trailer homes of young idealists. Some of the younger people
insist they won't go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them belong to Second Generation, a movement established
two months ago. That was about the time that Barak's government
began talking seriously about tearing down some of the 42 so-called
``satellite'' settlements _ outposts located on hilltops near, but
not adjacent, to existing settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The sons and daughters of the early settlers of these biblical
hilltops say they are carrying the torch of the men and women who
staked claim to West Bank land just after Israel captured the
territory from Jordan in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   They see a religious connection to the land that has not been
altered by peace agreements that have ceded chunks of the territory
around them to Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that after 2,000 years of Diaspora, God has brought
back the people of the bible to the land of the bible,'' said
Ariyeh Lipo, a 26-year-old protester with a reddish-brown beard
hanging down to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sure that Jews cannot agree to give willingly one inch
of the land God gives us,'' said Lipo.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians hope those same hilltops will one day become part
of the independent state they plan to create in the West Bank and
Gaza. They maintain all settlements are illegal and object to what
they say is a false distinction between legal and illegal
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Barak said he expected the Settlers' Council to
live up to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Settler leaders said they would try again to remove the
container at Shvut Rachel, put there by a tomato farmer some months
ago to use as a tool shed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they lauded the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wouldn't have protested, I would have been very
disappointed,`` said Yehudit Tayar, spokesman for the settlers'
council. ``We're very proud of our youth,'' she said. ``Those kids
you saw up there, they're very, very linked to the land of Israel.
We're very proud for them for standing up for Jewish rights.''

CAMBODIANS READY TO ACCEPT U.S. PLAN ON WAR CRIMES TRIALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Hoping to break a deadlock between the
Cambodian government and the United Nations over how to bring
former Khmer Rouge leaders to trial for war crimes, the United
States has proposed the outlines of a compromise plan, an American
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Phnom Penh said that the Cambodians appeared ready
to accept the proposal. But American and U.N. officials said that
there are still many details to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The American plan would create a war crimes tribunal of five
judges _ three Cambodians and two foreigners. In August, after
lengthy consultations in Cambodia, the U.N. proposed a tribunal
with a majority of international judges because legal experts here
thought that the Cambodian judiciary system was weak and vulnerable
to political pressure. A number of former Khmer Rouge officials
from the movement that devastated the country from 1975 to early
1979 are now in government or other influential positions.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia objected to a foreign panel of judges, arguing that
this kind of tribunal would violate the country's sovereign powers,
and the national parliament effectively vetoed the idea. Last
month, Prime Minister Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge regional
official before he defected to Vietnam in the late 1970s and
returned to head a Vietnamese-installed government in 1979, also
flatly rejected the U.N. plan during talks with Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen was also dismissive of the U.N. proposals in talks with
senior State Department officials here in September. He argued that
the Cambodian legal system was capable of running its own
investigations and trials. There have been no credible efforts to
do so, however.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new American plan presented to Cambodia by Ambassador
Kent Weidemann last week in Phnom Penh, while Cambodians would
outnumber foreigners on the panel, four judges on the six-judge
tribunal would have to agree to a verdict, making it impossible for
the two foreigners to be automatically overruled by the Cambodians.
This does, however, leave open the question of whether a series of
hung trials could result because of fundamental legal differences.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which has been pressing for several years for
war crimes hearings and possibly genocide trials for Khmer Rouge
leaders, many of whom have died or been killed, is trying to save
the U.N. plan as a starting point for more negotiations with the
Cambodians, a senior American official said Tuesday. The United
States, and other governments also trying to broker compromises,
have been in continual consultation with the U.N. legal team, the
official said, although legal experts here remain wary of making
concessions to the Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials have behind them the mixed experiences of the
Balkans and Rwanda tribunals _ both sought by the United States _
as they tackle the older unsolved problem of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia was one of the modern world's most
brutal regimes. Under a radical form of communist revolution, more
than a million Cambodians died in purges, of overwork or disease,
as the movement's leaders tried to completely restructure Cambodian
society and rid it of a middle class. Prime Minister Hun Sen, said
in Phnom Penh Tuesday that he favored the new plan, according to an
Associated Press report from Cambodia. ``I have agreed to this
proposal, so the trial of the Khmer Rouge is no longer a concern
for us, nor for the United Nations, nor anybody else,'' Hun Sen was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The senior American officials said that there were many more
details to be discussed before the plan could be described as
accepted, however. Questions remain about how the prosecutorial
system will be constructed and function and how much international
involvement there will be in gathering evidence and framing cases,
among other issues.

just under half say they know someone their own age who has

poll. But in the more immediate reality of their daily lives, fear
and violence have diminished significantly in recent years, their
responses show. Teenagers report fewer problems with violence both

TENSIONS BETWEEN KOSOVARS AND U.N. AUTHORITIES WILL RISE, ANNAN
WARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretary-general of the United Nations, Kofi
Annan, warned Tuesday that the ``built in tension'' between the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo who want independence and the United
Nations, which is administering the territory as part of
Yugoslavia, would mount as time went on.
</P>
<P>
   Annan suggested that he had no immediate solution to the problem
but stressed that holding quick elections was not an easy answer.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was determined that the United Nations should not
repeat what he called the ``mistakes'' made in Bosnia, where the
results of national elections held nine months after the Dayton
peace accord ``legitimized those who caused the war'' when
hard-line ethnic leaders were voted into office.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters here after his first trip to Kosovo last
week, Annan said: ``We have a mandate to administer the territory
as part of sovereign Federal Republic of Yugoslavia but those we
are administering want independence. This ambiguity is going to
bring problems down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   It well could develop, he said, that the ethnic Albanians who
make up the overwhelming proportion of the population regard the
U.N. administrators as an ``occupation force.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials who have recently visited
Kosovo acknowledge that relations between the people of Kosovo and
U.N. administrators have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this was due to unrealistic expectations on the part of
the ethnic Albanians, who believed that the United Nations would
bring instant independence, and some was partly due to the slow
progress of rebuilding damaged homes in time for winter.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was not helped, administration officials have
said, by the continuing high level of tension between the estimated
97,000 Serbs who have remained in Kosovo and the ethnic Albanians,
as well as by tensions among different Albanian factions.
</P>
<P>
   Annan did not commit himself to a date for elections but said he
favored holding local elections first. He will receive an
assessment in about two weeks on the technical aspects of holding
elections in a place where voter rolls are mostly destroyed and
where ethnic Albanians have not participated in elections for more
than a decade to protest rule from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It was essential, Annan said, to give new political parties time
to organize so that entrenched political forces did not
automatically win.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has said it would like to see municipal
elections held next spring. But the Balkan Action Council, a
non-governmental organization headed by former senior U.S.
diplomats, argues that ``rolling municipal elections'' should start
immediately.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With quick registration of voters in one or two towns, there was
a chance for new political parties, including one formed by a
break-away group from the Kosovo Liberation Army, to gain ground,
said James Hooper, the executive director of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said that in administering Kosovo, the United Nations had
to tread a fine line between making decisions that would help
create an independent entity and relying on the authorities in
Yugoslavia and its leader, Slobodan Milosevic. According to the U.
N. mandate, Kosovo is to be administered as a self-governing
autonomous region of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But Annan said this was a difficult task, particularly in
building a sustainable economy. For example, the mines of Kosovo,
traditionally one of the major employers there, are owned by Serbs
who now live in Belgrade. It was not clear how ownership of such
properties would be decided until the final status of Kosovo was
decided, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some everyday issues had demanded action _ like the recent
decision to use the German mark instead of the Yugoslav dinar as
the currency _ which some interpreted as a move toward
independence, Annan said. But in fact, the currency and new license
plates for cars were practical matters that had little to do with
the final status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And the final status may not be decided until Milosevic is no
longer in charge in Yugoslavia. It was not ``realistic, Annan said,
to engage Milosevic in a discussion on the future of Kosovo.

   SHVUT RAHEL, West Bank _ When Motti Katz drove his truck up to a
hill near this Jewish settlement Tuesday to remove an empty
shipping container planted on the hilltop, he ran into barricades
of boulders and barrels.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 15 teen-age protesters carrying Israeli flags sat
singing in a circle on the ground, surrounded by reporters and
photographers. In no mood for a fight, Katz waited two hours and
finally drove away, handing a victory to the young demonstrators,
students at religious schools in West Bank settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, played out like a well-rehearsed script, was laden
with symbolism for the actors.
</P>
<P>
   Katz's truck had been sent by the settlers' umbrella council as
part of an agreement reached with Prime Minister Ehud Barak last
week to dismantle or move 11 illegally built settlement outposts
perched on West Bank hills.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them were put up in the last year with the intention of
blocking the handover of more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
The settler leadership agreed to take them down after Barak agreed
to leave 31 other outposts in place.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most outposts, where people live, the hilltop
container near Shvut Rahel _ the first structure to have been
removed under the agreement _ was used as a tool shed by settlers
farming the surrounding land. It was an outpost by name only.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen young protesters, defying the settlers'
leadership and the government, rallied round the shed Tuesday to
prove that not even a rusty container would budge. The attempt to
remove it, they said, was nothing short of a dry run for an
eventual evacuation of entire Jewish settlements as part of a final
peace agreement with the Palestinians, and they were determined to
block it.
</P>
<P>
   Youths in knitted skullcaps danced and sang on the rocky
hillside, planted trees and built a stone wall. Some clambered onto
the container, festooning it with Israeli flags and posters that
said: ``Today the outposts, tomorrow Jerusalem'' and ``One small
step for Arafat, a disaster for the Jews,'' referring to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Malachi Levinger, 28, the son of Rabbi Moshe Levinger, who
founded a different Jewish settlers' enclave _ in the West Bank
town of Hebron _ more than 30 years ago, helped direct the protest,
echoing the rhetoric of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evacuation starts with a container, then goes on to an
outpost and finally reaches a settlement,'' Levinger said. ``Barak
is testing the ground for giving up settlements in a permanent
agreement, and we want to make clear to him that it's not only hard
to evacuate an outpost, it's even hard to remove a lone container
on a hill. We're not prepared to give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlers' council made no real effort to prevent the protest
or rein in the demonstrators, who are members of a ``Next
Generation'' movement of young settlers critical of what they call
the complacency of their mainstream leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In marked contrast to the council's settlement attempts in the
past, which were often carried out in secrecy and in the dead of
night, the council sent Katz's truck in broad daylight after plans
to remove the container were made public. No council members
arrived to clear the protesters and their barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Later a council spokesman said that plans to remove the
container had been thwarted by a leak from Barak's office, and that
the council would try again another time, without prior notice.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the council said that it had taken down a water
tower from an adjacent hilltop, another point that had to be
vacated under the agreement with Barak. ``What the settlers'
council promises, it delivers,'' the council said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement to remove some outposts has divided the settlement
movement, with younger, more militant settlers _ many of whom have
grown up in the West Bank _ vowing to resist nonviolently the
removal of the outposts and to return to the hills if they are
cleared. They have been backed by militant rabbis from some
settlements who have issued religious rulings against the
evacuation of the outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Signs posted at Shvut Rahel on Tuesday urged residents to
bolster outposts threatened with evacuation. ``We won't allow the
uprooting of a Jewish community in the Land of Israel,'' said one
notice that urged support for Havat Maon, an outpost of militants
south of Hebron. ``We will fight the conspiracy with all our
might,'' it said. ``It shall not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But hardly anyone from Shvut Rahel showed up Tuesday to prevent
the removal of the container on the hill, and it was left to the
religious students to man the barricades. After nightfall, 10 of
them were left near the container, huddling around a campfire
against the evening chill.
</P>
<P>
   To the Palestinians, the tug-of war between Barak and the
settlers over the outposts was of secondary importance. ``What is
required is the dismantling of all settlements,'' said Nabil Abu
Rudeineh, an adviser to Arafat. ``All settlements are illegal.''

WARNER REBUKES MRS. CLINTON FOR HER COMMENTS ON TARGET RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
criticized First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday for urging
a permanent end to Navy and Marine Corps bombing at the target
range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the chairman, rebuked Mrs. Clinton for
her statement in favor of shutting down the target range as he
convened a testy hearing that heard Puerto Rican political leaders
vow to never allow the Navy and Marines to resume shelling the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Their hardline comments underscored the difficulties that the
White House and Congress face in trying to resolve a dispute over
the fate of the target range where a Puerto Rican security guard
was killed in a bombing accident in April.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats on the panel urged the Puerto Rican
leaders to open negotiations with the Navy with the goal of
allowing ships to practice air, sea and amphibious attacks on
Vieques. The Navy says that the battle group escorting the aircraft
carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower needs to practice on the target
range in early December before departure for the Persian Gulf on
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello and Rep. Carlos
Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico, resolutely rejected the appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Warner convened his committee a day after a four-member Pentagon
panel appointed at President Clinton's request failed to come up
with a compromise plan for Vieques' future that was acceptable to
Puerto Rico's political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Warner set the tone by attacking a statement issued by Mrs.
Clinton on Monday during her latest visit to New York as part of a
prospective New York Senate campaign. The first lady endorsed
Puerto Rico's insistence that the Navy permanently end its
bombardment of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live ordnance training should not take place on a small,
inhabited island,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner argued that many Americans put up with the sounds and
dangers of live fire training ranges near their homes, including
his fellow Virginians living near the Marine base at Quantico, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I wonder what the first lady would have to say about
(this) to the rest of the portions of the United States that do
accept this as their contribution to national security?'' Warner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, a former Navy secretary who dealt with a similar issue
involving a target range on the neighboring island of Culebra in
the early 1970s, pressed witnesses for some sign of flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to solve this problem,'' Warner insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossello emphasized that his Democratic administration will
not negotiate with the Pentagon over resumption of bombing on an
island that is home to more than 9,300 civilians living on a swathe
of land between two parcels of Navy-owned land totaling 22,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any bombing of Vieques is unacceptable to us,'' Rossello said,
adding that ``not one'' bomb will be permitted to hit the island.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello reiterated his threat to seek a temporary restraining
order in federal court if the Clinton administration presses ahead
with efforts to resume live fire training.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to go to court, we will do so,'' Rossello said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo, equally pressed by senators, said the 3.8
million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are ``adamant about not having
any more bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   None? Warner asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the position of the people of Puerto Rico,''
Romero-Barcelo replied.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Hernandez Mayoral, who is challenging Romero-Barcelo for
his seat, warned that thousands of Puerto Ricans stand ready to
join dozens of protesters already staging a civil disobedience
occupation of the 899-acre target range to prevent resumption of
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be in Vieques until the Navy leaves. And it will
leave,'' Mayoral said.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello echoed the warning, saying that any effort to arrest
and remove protesters will backfire. ``I'm giving you what I think
is good advice _ don't push it,'' Rossello said.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's governor told reporters after the hearing that his
administration would open discussions with the Clinton
administration only ``if we all agree that there will be no more
bombing in Vieques.''

</P>
<P>
   Senators' frustration broke into the open as the depth of the
stalemate became evident. Warner periodically rose from his chair,
jabbed his right arm on his hip and leaned against an adjacent
chair like a skipper at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who served with the 82nd
Airborne Division troops landing on D-Day at Normandy, walked out
of the hearing after several hours, declaring with a wave of his
arm: ``Too much quibbling. Let's move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., challenged Rossello to repudiate the
civil disobedience of protesters encamped on the target range.
Forecasting a potential accidental detonation of unexploded
ordnance by a trespasser, Inhofe demanded: ``Say something to
discourage those trespassers or that blood will be on your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, citing the death of a security guard in April, told
Inhofe: ``Someone has already died. If the bombings continue and
someone dies, that blood will be on your conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., who has declared his candidacy for
president in 2000, accused President Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore of having pre-judged the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cited a handwritten note by the president to national
security adviser Samuel Berger dated July 26 in which Clinton said
it would be ``wrong'' for the Navy to resume combat training with
live munitions on the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Inhofe cited Gore's support for Navy withdrawal
relayed through both Rossello last August and again last week
through New York State Sen. Olga Mendez, a Puerto Rico-born Bronx
Democrat, who met with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have Vice President Gore playing with you in concert
to try to do this,'' Inhofe told Rossello, citing the Puerto Rico
Democrat's role as Gore's chief fund raiser in Puerto Rico. ``How
can you get more political and partisan than that?''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello, openly admitting his efforts to persuade Clinton and
Gore to order the Navy off Vieques, told Inhofe: ``Me thinkst the
senator doth protest too much.''

   The Pentagon panel proposed resumption of limited live fire

assistance; and Navy-supported studies of residents' claims that 58
years of target practice has contributed to a high incidence of
cancer.

EGYPT HOPES TO LURE TOURISTS WITH OPERA BY THE PYRAMIDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)   By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIZA, Egypt _ Not for the first time, Egypt has hitched its star
to Giuseppe Verdi.
</P>
<P>
   It was Verdi, after all, whose opera ``Aida'' was commissioned
by Khedive Ismail of Egypt in 1870 to give life to Egypt's ancient
past. Now Egyptian leaders have embraced ``Aida'' again, hoping
that its magic will entice foreigners to visit.
</P>
<P>
   For six nights that ended on Sunday, here beneath the Great
Pyramids a lavish production of ``Aida'' featured arias that soared
across the desert sand _ all part of the tale of love, war, power
and betrayal in the era of the Pharaohs.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak says that the multimillion-dollar
spectacle will become an annual affair. It is an effort to turn
around the effects of an attack two years ago _ in which the opera
played a role _ that has kept visitors away.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, 58 foreign tourists were killed by Islamic
militants at the Temple of Hatephsut in Luxor. It emerged that the
killers had initially planned to carry out the attack during a
performance of the opera at the temple several weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For many months afterward, most foreign visitors kept a fearful
distance, depriving Egypt of vital tourist dollars. But a
government crackdown has now all but eliminated any signs of
militant violence, opening the way for a campaign to persuade
foreigners that this is a land of romance, not machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can prove that this country is safe and stable better
than a huge show like `Aida' performed year after year in front of
the most important tourist site in the world,'' said Nazmi Amin, a
top official of Egypt's Tourist Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Already there have been signs of a remarkable rebound in Egypt's
tourism. For the first time since the Luxor massacre, the number of
visitors arriving here has returned to its earlier pace, with the
total this year expected to set a record at more than 4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms and cruise boats that stood mostly empty a year ago
are almost fully booked. At sites like the Egyptian Museum, buses
once again jostle for space at a parking lot that was all but
deserted for months after a September 1997 attack that killed 10
foreign tourists there.
</P>
<P>
   With its centuries of experience, Egypt has long become adept at
exploiting the ancient monuments that are its greatest gift.
Egyptians long ago realized that an enduring fascination with the
ancient outweighs factors like distance, heat and dirt that might
otherwise keep travelers at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as any promoter knows, there are times when it helps to
give that pull a push. The Ottoman-era ruler who commissioned
``Aida'' did so as part of a kind of coming-out gala that followed
the inauguration of the Suez Canal in 1869. The Cairo Opera House,
where ``Aida'' was first performed in 1871, has staged the opera
many times since.
</P>
<P>
   But in the government's current international advertising
campaign, footage from a 1998 performance so dominates the screen
that a viewer might mistake the ``Triumphal March'' for Egypt's
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to recapture travelers' attention, the Egyptian
government had already offered up the Pyramids to be used as the
backdrop for other unorthodox events, including _ this year alone _
a fashion show and squash and tennis tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, in what may be the biggest bash of all,
thousands of people are expected to turn out for a millennium
celebration featuring an all-night performance of a pop opera by
Jean-Michel Jarre, the French composer and the multimedia artist.
</P>
<P>
   At precisely midnight, as the highlight of the festivities, an
Egyptian helicopter is supposed to lower a 28-foot-tall,
pyramid-shaped gold-colored cap onto the Great Pyramid of Cheops,
the largest in the world, thereby temporarily restoring the
4,800-year-old structure to its original 450-foot height. The aim
is to flood the Pyramids area with golden light, reflected from
laser beams bounced off the new structure, and thereby to entice
television networks around the world to broadcast the scene as a
symbol of the beginning of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt, which prides itself on a history that dates from 4,000
B.C., has sought to distinguish the celebration from others around
the world. ``We will be the only country in the world celebrating
its seventh millennium, not just the third millennium like everyone
else,'' the minister of culture, Farouk Hosni, said at a news
conference the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone in Egypt is so enchanted with all the
glitz and pageantry. Archeologists say the influx of cars and
people to the Pyramids area cannot help but do harm, no matter what
precautions are taken. Travel agents say that operas and big galas
may be well and good, but that most of the tourists now returning
to Egypt come with cut-rate package tours and are not big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics of the government have denounced all the hoopla as
a self-indulgent waste, in a country still suffering from
widespread poverty. ``We find it unbelievable that anyone would
insist on spending millions of dollars on phony events like the
repeated failure ``Aida,'' the opposition newspaper Al Wafd
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was directed by an Egyptian, Abdel Moneim Kamel, and
organized by the Ministry of Culture, this year's production
featured mainly Italian stars along with a 120-member chorus from
Verona. In its own defense, the government said it saved money
wherever it could, bringing it in with a budget of less than $3
million by making the production a kind of national undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Among those enlisted was the Egyptian army, which provided 700
soldiers as extras and the team of engineers who built an
impressive 230-foot-wide modern stage. The national airline, Egypt
Air, shuttled cast members between Europe and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's six-night run, most of the 5,000 seats in a
grandstand erected for the occasion were full, though the average
price of $35 paid by most ticket holders was far from enough to
cover the costs of the production.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Egyptian officials insist that the real revenues
transcend short-term loss. ```Aida','' said Amin, the Tourist
Authority official, ``is our way to keep the image of Egypt alive
in people's minds.''

   PARIS _ Nathalie Sarraute, the Russian-born French novelist who
remained an influential and innovative literary figure long after
she first gained fame as the doyenne of the Nouveau Roman movement
in the late 1950s, died on Tuesday at her home in Paris. She was 99
and also had a country home in Cherence in Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   In a writing career that lasted more than six decades, Mrs.
Sarraute published 17 books, including 10 novels, although in her
very first book, ``Tropisms,'' she set the tone of her life's work.
She took the book's title from the biological term for the
involuntary reaction of plants to external stimuli and used it to
describe the human impulses that precede gestures or words.
</P>
<P>
   All her subsequent books can be understood through the prism of
these tropisms, which she once described as ``the interior
movements that prepare our words and actions at the limits of our
consciousness.'' On another occasion, she spoke of her writing as
``sub-conversation'' through which she captured and conveyed
half-formed ideas and feelings in often hesitant dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   While ``tropisms'' became her tool for exploring the human
spirit, her purpose was to break with the 19th-century novel of
Balzac and Flaubert, which in her view, had been made obsolete by
Kafka, Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. She considered these
writers to be her mentors, but she went further, creating a stark
literary form stripped of characters, plot and chronology, a form
that Jean-Paul Sartre tagged the ``antinovel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that, through my novels, I showed that it was
possible to write novels where the purely fictional element was
freed from the conventions that encumbered it, just as the purely
pictorial element in painting has freed itself from subject matter,
perspective, and so on,'' Mrs. Sarraute wrote in an essay in The
New York Times Book Review in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, her innovative approach drew her toward several
young French writers, among them Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor,
Marguerite Duras, Claude Simon, and Robert Pinget, who came to be
identified with the Nouveau Roman (a term borrowed from a critic
for Le Monde). But while she enjoyed being discovered as a ``new
novelist'' when she was already well into her 50's, her attacks on
traditional literary form both anticipated and survived the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Born into an intellectual Jewish family in Ivanovo, Russia, on
July 18, 1900, Natasha Tcherniak _ as she then was _ had an
unsettling childhood. Her father, Elie, a chemist, and her mother,
Pauline, a writer, separated when she was 2 and remarried, and she
was painfully shuttled back and forth between two countries and two
sets of parents. She went to Paris with her mother in 1902, moved
to St. Petersburg in 1905 and then returned to Paris in 1908, where
she was then brought up by her father and his new wife, Vera.
</P>
<P>
   Soon fluent in German and English as well as French and Russian,
she studied law and literature at the Sorbonne and Oxford
University before joining a Paris law firm in 1925, the same year
that she married a fellow lawyer, Raymond Sarraute. After Germany
occupied France in 1940, she escaped the fate of 76,000 Jews who
were deported from France to German death camps by hiding out in a
village and posing as Nicole Sauvage, the governess of her own
three young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   She never returned to the Paris bar. In 1932, she had begun
writing ``Tropisms,'' a book comprising 24 short sketches. She
finished five years later, but it was not until 1939 that she found
a publisher. After the war, dedicating herself entirely to writing,
she became friends with Sartre, who offered to write a preface for
her first novel, ``Portrait of a Man Unknown'' (1948), which he
famously described as ``an antinovel that reads like a detective
story.'' He noted, ``Nathalie Sarraute has a horror of the tricks
of the novelist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Sarraute was not drawn to existentialism, she
remained friends with Sartre until Simone de Beauvoir came between
them. ``She separated us completely,'' Mrs. Sarraute recalled in a
1990 interview with The Paris Review. ``But I heard that she
couldn't bear Sartre having an intellectual relationship with
anyone, male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many French writers then and now, Mrs. Sarraute liked to
work at a table in a cafe, in her case one at the Trocadero near
her home in the 16th arrondissement. In his memoir ``Paris in the
Fifties,'' the American journalist and author Stanley Karnow, who
was briefly married to Mrs. Sarraute's eldest daughter, Claude,
paints a portrait of the writer as ``a lean, severe-looking woman
with a hawk nose, piercing black eyes and combed-back ebony hair.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Karnow recalled, he moved in with his wife's
parents, although he was unsure whether Mrs. Sarraute's
``unpredictable Slavic temperament'' would prove too much. ``She
could be uptight and relaxed, cantankerous and amiable, dour and
cheerful,'' he wrote. ``Even so, I adored her _ or perhaps it was
the intellectual electricity of her company.'' Mrs. Sarraute is
survived by her daughter Claude and two other daughters, Anne and
Dominique.
</P>
<P>
   In her second novel, ``Martereau'' (1953), Mrs. Sarraute used
the natural intrigue of an extended family to explore her tropisms.
The book sold few copies, but it sufficed to identify her as a
``new novelist.'' Just three years later, when she published ``The
Age of Suspicion,'' this book of essays about her approach to
literature was presented to the public as ``the first theoretical
manifestation of the Nouveau Roman school.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sarraute was not prolific. After she published ``The
Planetarium'' in 1959, it would take more than a decade for her to
complete her next three novels _ ``The Golden Fruits'' (1963),
``Between Life and Death'' (1968) and ``Do You Hear Them?'' (1972)
_ which had in common a complex and humorous self-criticism of her
own creative process hidden inside a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Quintessentially French in its intellectual playfulness, ``The
Golden Fruits'' revolved around a discussion of the merits and
demerits of an imaginary much-acclaimed book, also called ``The
Golden Fruits,'' a discussion that enabled Mrs. Sarraute to
demystify the solemn language of literary criticism through parody
and caricature while, at the same time, raising disturbing
questions. ``It is my most abstract work,'' she said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Well received in France, ``The Golden Fruits'' appeared obscure
to some American critics. ``The fact that this misty book contains
some valid satirical points does not make it a rewarding novel,''
Orville Prescott wrote in The New York Times in February 1964.
``When the experimental techniques shrink the size of fiction and
squeeze the juices of life out of it, they are fruitless indeed.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Albeit eliminating even the narrator from some of her books (in
which characters may be reduced to ``he,'' ``she'' and ``they''),
Mrs. Sarraute was in fact always present as a form of mischievous
puppeteer. In her 1983 autobiographical work, ``Childhood,''
however, she showed herself, at least how she remembered her
turbulent first 12 years of life. Typically, she recalled them
through the impact of single words, like ``stupid'' and
``tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Childhood'' was written in her ``predialogue'' style, which
she defined as the ``little bits of something still alive'' on the
border of consciousness, ``something prior to language _ a
sensation, a perception.'' These feelings, she said, must be
captured before they're labeled with adult words because adult
words both falsify experience and render it traumatizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Childhood'' was adapted as a one-act play and presented in New
York with Glenn Close. But it was less successful than several
pieces that she wrote as radio plays and that were later staged,
among them ``The Lie'' and ``Silence.'' In writing for theater, she
was also forced to become more explicit. In novels, she said, the
dialogue skimmed the surface of the sub-conversation. But in plays,
the ``predialogue'' became a fully fledged dialogue. ``They later
said my plays, in relation to my novels, were like a glove turned
inside out,'' she told The Paris Review.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing down in her later years after the death of her husband,
Mrs. Sarraute nonetheless never stopped writing, occasionally
demonstrating that she remained as fascinated with her explorations
of language as she had been a half-century or more earlier. ``You
Don't Love Yourself,'' published in 1990, is a dialogue about
self-hate in which, as often is the case, there is a counterpoint
between language and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' published in 1995 in France and in 1997 in the United
States, just as Mrs. Sarraute's complete works were being reissued
in France's legendary Pleiade Series, is as always a novel without
plot or characters or perhaps, as suggested by Richard Burgin
writing in The Washington Post, ``a poetic essay of ideas'' in
which the author pursues ``the power and poverty of words.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, ``Here'' was described by some critics as Mrs.
Sarraute's final testimony, an apt summation of her oeuvre. But she
had not yet finished. In September 1997, at the age of 97, she
published ``Ouvrez,'' or ``Open,'' a 130-page book in which she
denounced the impoverishment of the French language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems completely mad,'' she remarked in one interview,
``but at my age one is allowed to write things that are completely
mad.'' She was working on yet another book at the time of her
death. &QL;

BELL ATLANTIC OPENS NETWORKS TO COMPETITORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boosting the Bell Atlantic Corp.'s bid to sell
long-distance communications services to New York consumers by the
end of the year, the New York State Public Service Commission told
federal regulators Tuesday that the company has opened its local
networks to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Bell Atlantic, the No. 2 local phone company,
filed its long-distance application for New York with the Federal
Communications Commission last month, the New York commission's
chairman, Maureen O. Helmer, signaled that she was inclined to
support the petition.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's formal comments in support of Bell Atlantic appeared
to set in motion a chain reaction of government approvals that will
most likely culminate in Bell Atlantic's becoming the first Baby
Bell to win long-distance entry.
</P>
<P>
   After the old American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. was broken up
in 1984, the Bell companies _ now known as Bell Atlantic,
BellSouth, SBC and U S West _ were prohibited to sell long-distance
service.
</P>
<P>
   But the Telecommunications Act of 1996 said a Bell could enter
the $80 billion long-distance market on a state-by-state basis
after convincing the FCC. that it had opened its local systems to
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has rejected applications covering Oklahoma, Michigan,
South Carolina and Louisiana but the recommendations of regulators
in those states did not carry anywhere near the weight of New
York's filing Tuesday. That is because New York has pushed Bell
Atlantic incessantly to open its network, forcing the company to
delay its long-distance plans for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   New York's support of Bell Atlantic is not binding on the FCC,
but it does appear to indicate that the Justice Department, which
has opposed each of the previous applications, will support this
one. Last year, the New York regulators and the Justice Department
jointly struck a deal to support Bell Atlantic once the company
satisfied various technical tests.
</P>
<P>
   It would be extraordinary if the New York regulators and the
Justice Department parted ways at this point, and it would be a big
surprise if the FCC rejected an application that had the Justice
Department's support.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Bell Atlantic's competitors maintain that the
company is still far from fully opening its systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our impression is that Bell Atlantic has not yet satisfied the
competitive checklist to make it entry into long-distance in New
York,'' said Jonathan Askin, vice president for law for the
Association for Local Telecommunications Services, a trade group in
Washington that represents about 80 competitive local
communications carriers.

MANDELA CONCLUDES FIRST VISIT TO ISRAEL

 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ It was a trip intended to heal old wounds, and as
Nelson Mandela concluded his first visit to Israel Tuesday he took
pains to praise ``my friends'' _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
President Ezer Weizman _ for their regional peacemaking efforts and
the ``warmth'' of their reception.
</P>
<P>
   The 81-year-old South African leader, recently retired from the
presidency, called Barak ``a man of vision'' for his pursuit of a
settlement with Syria. And Mandela made it clear that he
understands Israel's need ``for Arab recognition of its existence
within secure boundaries.'' Without such recognition a regional
armistice would be ``foolhardy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the visit was marked by continuing undercurrents of distrust
between Mandela, a staunch champion of the Palestinian cause, and a
country that once helped arm the apartheid regime that Mandela
drove out of power.
</P>
<P>
   Before traveling on to Gaza for an afternoon meeting with
another ``good friend,'' _ Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader _
Mandela reiterated his unwavering opposition to Israeli control of
Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk of peace will remain hollow if Israel continues to occupy
Arab territories'' he said, sitting at a conference table in
Israel's Foreign Ministry, where such sentiments are rarely heard.
``I understand completely well why Israel occupies these lands.
There was a war. But if there is going to be peace, there must be
complete withdrawal from all of these areas.''
</P>
<P>
   And, leaving little doubt about his lingering resentment of
Israel's diplomatic and military ties to his former jailers, he
tartly noted that upon his release from prison in 1990 he had
received invitations to visit ``almost every country in the world,
except Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the psychological distance he traveled to get here,
he equated his meetings with officials here to his rapprochement
with the leaders of the apartheid regime.
</P>
<P>
   By one South African count, Mandela had received and rejected at
least four previous invitations to visit Israel since 1994, and his
decision to come now was a clear endorsement of Barak's revived
peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   His two-day stay here followed brief stops in Jordan, Iran and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has emerged from all my conversations is that the
yearning for peace is very intense'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has turned over the presidency of South Africa to his
successor, Thabo Mbeki, and his visit was billed as a private visit
by a man with no official status or title. But he was received as
if he were a head of state, beginning with a ceremonial luncheon at
Weizman's official residence with Cabinet ministers and Supreme
Court justices. Both his hosts and the guest of honor were intent
on public reconciliation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Accompanied by South Africa's chief rabbi, Mandela made the
rounds of official and ceremonial Israel, trailed by a posse of
Israeli reporters. He was given a guided tour by the director of
Yad Vashem, the holocaust memorial, and jotted down his impressions
afterward in a guest book : ``A painful but enriching experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected encounter at Barak's office on Monday, he met
the Israeli son of the Jewish lawyer from Johannesburg who had
given him his first full-time job as a lawyer half a century ago.
It was a reminder of Mandela's close relationships with Jewish
South Africans who also opposed the Afrikaner governments and
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe a debt of honor to the Jews, even if sometimes I have
made restrained remarks about Israel'' he said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Mandela well say he had long wanted to visit
Israel, both because of his ties to the Jewish community in South
Africa and because of his conviction that he could serve a useful
mediating role in the region. And they are certain that this first
visit will not be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was unfinished business for him'' said Benjamin Pogrund,
the former editor of the Rand Daily Mail, in South Africa, who now
runs a social research center here. ``He has a lot of admiration
for Israel, because of all his Jewish links. He sees himself
playing a role here, and he wants to play a role.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pogrund added that Israelis should understand that Mandela's
goal in the region has always been consistent: an independent state
for the Palestinians, his allies during the long fight against
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   And they should not expect any apologies for his decision to
bestow South African state honors on the Libyan dictator Muammar
Gadhafi. Pogrund said Mandela counts his role in brokering an end
to U.N. sanctions against Libya as one of his signal international
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his visit, the genuine admiration for Mandela here
was tempered by open skepticism toward his foreign policy views.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Monday with Barak and Weizman, Mandela conveyed his
view, based on his conversation with President Hafez al-Assad in
Damascus the day before, that Syrians ``want a sincere and real
peace'' with Israel. But Weizman scoffed at Mandela's optimism,
saying that Assad had silently rebuffed Weizman's own repeated
entreaties.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, Mandela had pleased his hosts but distressed Israelis
by laying a wreath on the grave of Ayatollah Khomeini, the late
father of the Iranian revolution, and warmly greeting his powerful
political heir, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing one key Israeli concern, Mandela said Tuesday that in
his meetings in Iran with Khamenei and President Mohammed Khatami
he had discussed ``in detail'' the arrests of 13 Iranian Jews
accused of espionage on behalf of Israel, a charge they and Israel
vehemently deny.
</P>
<P>
   He said Khatami had responded that while an investigation was
continuing, the government did not yet have sufficient evidence to
proceed with prosecution _ a possible signal that Iran may yet back
away from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mandela also reported what he described as ``a very serious
accusation'' by the Iranians that Israel and the United States have
been made aware of what Iran contends are legitimate grounds for
the charges. And he repeated the assurances of Iranian officials
that the accused spies would receive ``a free and fair trial'' with
full access to official documents and legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy, sitting at his side, bristled at
Mandela's report. ``What has been said here is untrue and is an
injustice'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He turned to Mandela and said, ``If, when you were held captive,
you had to rely only on the service of lawyers, then your nation
would not have seen dramatic change, and would not have seen your
leadership, and you would perhaps not be here at this moment.''

 (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an air of wishful thinking in the world of operatic
tenors, and it blows from east to west. Three times in the last
three years the rumors hummed, and feature writers came running.
Evangelical words, and a compact disk or two, crossed the Atlantic.
The wait is over, they called out. The new Radames/Rodolfo/Don Jose
is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   For a generation Luciano Pavarotti thrilled and amused us;
Placido Domingo evoked undying admiration. Jose Carreras gave us
early hope, but unwise career decisions, choices made long before a
serious and unrelated illness, left him with fame, money and a
ravaged voice. Opera in general sharpens our nerve endings,
sometimes to the point of hysteria. Tenors, for better and worse,
drive us crazy. We need a couple of big ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Domingo and Pavarotti voices have earned both men, not to
mention their managers and publicists, large amounts of money. As
these two ease into and past middle age, both singing better than
we have any reason to expect them to, audiences and music business
operatives are nervous. Hence the extraordinary public puffery that
preceded the visits of Roberto Alagna, Marcelo Alvarez and, most
recently, Jose Cura.
</P>
<P>
   Before his 1996 Metropolitan Opera debut in ``La Boheme,'' and
with not a note yet sung in New York, Alagna had been elected the
``Fourth Tenor'' in Europe, joining the Pavarotti-Domingo-Carreras
trio in the pantheon of big and beautiful noises. Of course, he is
no such thing: a singer of elegance and accomplishment, to be sure,
now in the midst of an honorable career, helped not a little by his
wife, the ambitious, tough-minded and talented soprano Angela
Gheorghiu.
</P>
<P>
   Alagna has made some exquisite appearances in the French
Romantic repertory and has evidently chained his European
public-relations hounds to their kennels.
</P>
<P>
   The cases of Alvarez and Cura are more depressing. Both,
curiously enough, are from Argentina and made their initial
splashes in Europe. Alvarez entered the cast of Franco Zeffirelli's
Met production of ``La Traviata'' by default last year, when Alagna
and his wife withdrew. Having been praised in print for his
elegance and musicality, Alvarez stumbled through opening night
both physically and vocally.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputed a certain pleasantness to his sound, but the
distracted shuffling onstage and general lack of forethought in
musical matters made one wonder where those stellar predictions
were coming from.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, a Zeffirelli production is heavy competition for any
singer, but there was certainly no mistaking Alvarez for the great
new tenor hope. Cura got pretty much the same advance treatment:
beautiful sound, serious musicianship _ everyone was saying it.
</P>
<P>
   The sound is definitely there, somewhere, although a jerry-built
technique does not allow it to be heard with any consistency.
Cura's top is tight, and his advance to it awkward. One fantasizes
a good voice teacher taking this raw talent to pieces and
reconstructing it wholly.
</P>
<P>
   But Cura is already 37 and should be at his prime. There is also
his self-esteem, reported to be considerable. How much advice he
would brook is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary reports on Cura's musicianship seemed strange once
one had heard his recent debut here, as Turridu in ``Cavalleria
Rusticana.'' Mascagni begins famously with an offstage serenade
sung to harp accompaniment in the orchestra pit. Closed-circuit
television has made long-distance musical communication in the
theater easier than it once was, but without cooperation, duets
from afar are still a treacherous business.
</P>
<P>
   Turridus who care about music and their colleagues sing as
straightforwardly as possible. Cura's surges and meanderings of
tempo and phrase accomplished several things: making the job of the
Met's harpist impossible, damaging the beauty of Mascagni's music
and presenting the audience with near-chaos before the opera proper
had even begun. This is not what one calls musicianship. A lesson
in that was to come an hour or so later, when Domingo sang
``Pagliacci'' with splendid calculation and control.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Turridu, one can argue, invites a certain
unruliness. Maybe Cura is more of a musical gentleman elsewhere.
Not according to several Italian professionals I talked to, who
remember Cura's recent ``Manon Lescaut'' at La Scala in Milan as
similarly uncouth. ``The color of a great tenor and the singing of
a young bull'' was one opinion. ``Doesn't phrase like a musician''
and ``Looks at the conductor all night'' were others.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the hype keeps blowing in our direction. Do its
generators simply have bad taste? Or is their contempt for the
public's discernment so great that they think people can be won
over by verbal praise alone? The cynical explanation is that these
promotions are short-term enterprises, and knowingly so. Make a
buck (or franc or mark) while you can, then find the next young
tenor to fling precipitately into the world.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, each of these men has the looks modern opera
wants. I have heard a couple of young tenor voices in the last few
years that were housed in unfortunate bodies but far more effective
musically than those of these two Argentines. Such is the current
paradox that demands productions peopled with good-looking singers
in roles too mature for them: singers whose voices will probably be
wrecked by the time they are ready for those roles.
</P>
<P>
   Birgit Nilsson once complained to a theater intendant that a
glamorous young soprano was being placed in parts that would
guarantee her vocal demise in five years. ``In five years,'' he
answered, ``I'll find someone else.''

 &HT;    Bonner, Wildcats continue last season's magic
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Kentucky quarterback Dusty Bonner expects about 20
family members and friends to attend the Wildcats' game Saturday in
Georgia's Sanford Stadium. Otherwise, the sophomore from Valdosta
insists, nothing is special about playing Georgia between the
hedges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in Valdosta, I was pretty much a fan of the high
school team,'' Bonner said. ``My stepdad went to school at Georgia,
and I kept up with them when Herschel Walker played for them. But
when you live in Valdosta, you grow up wanting to play for the high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner didn't dream about playing for Kentucky, either, but his
presence in the Bluegrass State is a big reason why the Wildcats
(5-2, 3-1 SEC) are tied with 14th-ranked Georgia (5-1, 3-1) for
second place in the SEC's Eastern Division. With Florida off this
weekend, the winner of Saturday's game will be tied with the Gators
for first.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers expected Kentucky to have a far worse record
eight weeks into the season. The Wildcats, who were 7-5 and played
in the Outback Bowl last year, were expected to drop off once
quarterback Tim Couch left after his junior season and became the
NFL's No. 1 draft pick. But Bonner, an unheralded recruit who got
only limited Division I-A interest, has picked up where Couch left
off. He is leading the SEC in passing (307 ypg) and total offense
(292 ypg).
</P>
<P>
   Bonner has thrown for at least 250 yards in all seven games and
has thrown at least three touchdown passes in four games. He has
completed 196 of 288 passes for 2,152 yards with 17 touchdowns and
six interceptions and leads the SEC in pass efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner has exceeded almost everyone's expectations. Those
numbers are comparable to Couch's through seven games his sophomore
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've exceeded anything,'' Bonner said this week.
``As long as I come in and do what the coaches tell me and we win,
I really don't worry about what other people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely is the 6-2, 208-pound Bonner given credit for being as
good a quarterback as Couch. Instead, his success is usually
attributed to coach Hal Mumme's offensive system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you've got a good passing offense like they do, you
should transfer the talents to the next guy coming in,'' Georgia
coach Jim Donnan said. ``Look at Coach Mumme's teams over the
years; he's always had a good quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner doesn't have a problem with that perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great system; if that's people's opinion, that's
fine,'' Bonner said. ``I'm happy to be in a system like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's No. 1 target this season has been tight end James
Whalen, who leads the SEC and is fourth nationally with 8.14
receptions a game. But the Wildcats average 41 passes a game.
Running back Anthony White and wide receiver Dougie Allen average
40 and 43 yards a game, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia should have one of the better defenses against the
Wildcats. Although they have allowed 255 yards a game passing, the
Bulldogs remain the nation's 16th best team in pass-efficiency
defense, lead the SEC with 15 interceptions and are first in the
nation in turnover margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their whole team is full of great athletes,'' Bonner said.
``They've got great talent across the field. We're just going to
take what they give us and try not to do too much. From what I've
seen, they're not vulnerable to a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, neither is Bonner.

STREAMLINE.COM BUYS SUBURBAN CHICAGO COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streamline.com of Westwood, Mass., said Tuesday that it plans to
buy a similar company, Scotty's Home Market of suburban Chicago, in
a stock deal estimated to be worth nearly $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Scotty's has only 4,000 customers and expected 1999 sales
of $7.5 million, Wall Street analysts said the price tag seemed
reasonable; despite losses and big startup costs, they think the
on-line grocery industry could enjoy huge growth some day.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is one of the first in an industry that could
see rapid consolidation as the dozen or so regional players shake
out into four or five large survivors, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   With projected 1999 sales of $15 million, Streamline.com aims to
be one of those survivors. The acquisition of Scotty's is ``an
ideal strategic fit,'' said Timothy DeMello, who founded
Streamline.com in 1993 and who took the company public in June.
</P>
<P>
   Streamline has just expanded into suburban Washington, D.C., and
Scotty's gives it a third market as it looks to be in 20 regional
markets by 2004, said DeMello. DeMello plans to announce the
company's fourth regional market later this month.
</P>
<P>
   While plans call for Scotty's management team to remain in
place, Scotty's will change its name to Streamline.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Streamline.com, we have a partner who shares our vision for
the future and has the ability to be a major player in this
space,'' said founder Scott DeGraeve of privately held Scotty's.
</P>
<P>
   Even by the most generous estimates _ and projections vary
widely _ consumers will buy only about $400 million worth of goods
from on-line grocers this year _ a pittance when compared with the
$436 billion worth of groceries that US consumers buy in a year,
according to the Food Marketing Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Profits, meanwhile, are nowhere in sight for an industry that
needs to invest heavily in both technology and a brick-and-mortar
infrastructure of delivery-fulfillment warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is going to be in the investment phase for the
next few years,'' said PaineWebber analyst James Preissler.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wall Street seems bullish on the concept. With
many affluent suburban households pressed for time and with
consumers becoming more comfortable with e-commerce, some envision
a $70 billion annual business some day.
</P>
<P>
   The fiercest competition among often scattered regional on-line
grocers may be for the capital needed to expand into new markets,
said Dain Rauscher Wessels analyst Mitchell Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   Greater Boston has four on-line grocers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Streamline.com, there is Westwood-based ShopLink Inc.,
Somerville-based HomeRuns, and Peapod Inc., which ships deliveries
in this market with the help of Stop &AMP; Shop Cos.
</P>
<P>
   HomeRuns is seeking additional investors, and ShopLink just
unveiled plans to expand into parts of Connecticut and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, much attention has focused on Webvan Group Inc., a
California company with ambitious expansion plans. There are also
regional players in Dallas, Minneapolis, and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   There could be alliances as well as consolidation ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod, for example, has allied with Food.com, a restaurant
takeout-and-delivery service, said analyst Arvind Bhatia at
Southwest Securities Inc. In some markets, consumers can order
meals from local restaurants at Peapod's Web site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With most on-line grocery services, consumers use a personal
computer to visit the company's Web site to place an order.
</P>
<P>
   Working with HighPoint Systems Inc. of Cambridge, Scotty's has
devised an alternative way for customers to order by combining a
scanning device with a PalmPilot hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   A customer swipes this device over an item's bar code in a paper
catalog. After a shopping list has been completed, it can be
down-loaded to Scotty's Web site with a special modem.
</P>
<P>
   This device may be offered to some Streamline.com customers as
the two companies integrate technologies and fee structures.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal closes early next year, Streamline.com plans to
give Scotty's 4.3 million shares of its stock. Tuesday,
Streamline's shares closed at 6 3/4, down 1/8, on the Nasdaq
market.

COMMENTARY: CRAZY IN ALABAMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can think about the tug of war between the Republicans and
President Clinton over the State Department's budget in a lot of
ways. I prefer to think about it like this: Out of every dollar
spent by the U.S. government each year, about one penny goes to pay
for our embassies and diplomats abroad, democracy support programs,
denuclearizing Russia, foreign loans and foreign aid. One penny.
The Republicans now want to take that penny and cut it back more.
</P>
<P>
   One might have understood this if the U.S. economy were doing
poorly or if the United States were not the keystone of the whole
international system. And one might have understood this if the
Republicans were acting out of some coherent global strategy. But
they aren't. Rather, the Republicans' drive to cut the foreign
operations budget by 15 percent, or $2 billion, below what Clinton
is seeking (He vetoed their budget Monday) is all part of a cheap
gimmick led by the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, and his merry
band of right-wing nuts, whose only guiding principle in world
affairs is: ``Dumb as we wanna be.''
</P>
<P>
   Think about it for a second. What possible foreign policy
strategy would prompt a Republican lawmaker to want to reduce by
some $300 million the amount of money the United States spends on
its Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative, which pays for taking
apart Russian nukes and chemical weapons and employing Russian
nuclear scientists in commercial fields so they won't go to work
for Iran or Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   What possible foreign policy strategy would prompt him to want
to reduce by 37 percent the funds the U.S. deposits in the global
development banks, which are promoting capitalism in Africa and
Latin America by lending to small businesses so they become
America's customers?
</P>
<P>
   What possible foreign policy strategy would say, ``Let's help
Israelis and Palestinians reach an agreement at Wye, but then not
give them the money we promised to help them institute it _ even
though we know, as Clinton said, that the cheapest Mideast war
would cost us far more than the most expensive peace''?
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that pro-Israel lobbies on Capitol Hill are
deeply distraught about where the Republican Party is heading
today, since the GOP seems determined to shrink the foreign
operations budget. The Republican strategy is to silence the Jews
by giving Israel its full foreign aid allotment (but not the Wye
supplement), and cutting everyone else. But Jewish groups
understand that this will only isolate Israel and eventually
imperil its aid too.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, DeLay &AMP; Co. have no adult supervision anymore.
Republican internationalists like Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich are
gone; Trent Lott and Dennis Hastert together don't add up to zero;
George W. is still learning basic geography; and Ronald Reagan, who
built up our foreign affairs budget because he knew how critical it
was, is now a fading memory. The GOP is now led by people with no
sense of how important America is to the world, both as an example
and as a stabilizer. Bill Clinton has made the Republicans crazy.
</P>
<P>
   So to embarrass Clinton, the Republicans have decided to pit the
State Department budget against Social Security and to say that if
you are for giving money to Ghana you are for taking it away from
Grandma. The foreign operations budget, says DeLay, ``will come
straight out of the pockets of American seniors.'' Hogwash. There
is no more direct connection between Social Security and foreign
aid then there is between Social Security and the Marine Band.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? As Rep. Sonny Callahan said during the House
debate, back home in Alabama ``when I say, `Folks, I voted against
increasing foreign aid,' they seem to like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes sir, I bet they do. But when the next Alabama exporter shows
up in some country and needs help from the embassy commercial
officer but the job has been cut; when the next U.S. embassy gets
blown up because the world despises an America that tells everyone
what to do but won't pay its U.N. dues; when a Russian-designed
nuke shows up in Iran; when an environmental disaster in Mexico
washes up on Alabama's shores, we'll see how much the people of
Alabama like that.
</P>
<P>
   They might just say: ``You mean we could have prevented this
with just one penny out of every budget dollar, and we cut the
penny? Who was the idiot who did that?''

 &HT;    European rebound helps Coca-Cola Enterprises
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Enterprises, which saw its European sales
rebound from a product recall, posted a better-than-expected 20
percent rise in third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the Atlanta-based bottler, the largest in the
Coke system, also benefited from price increases in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose to $103 million, or 24 cents a share. That
compared with $86 million, or 21 cents a share, in the same period
last year, excluding a one-time tax benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been expecting the company to earn 21 cents a share
in this year's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 9 percent to $3.83 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly encouraged by the strong European volume
rebound, which reflects the strength of our brands and the success
of our marketing efforts,'' Henry Schimberg, CCE's president and
chief executive, said in a statement. ``Demand for our products in
Europe... is at or above levels achieved prior to the product
recall.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, two CCE plants were blamed for producing soft drinks
that made nearly 250 Belgians ill. The resulting product recall
cost the company $103 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were pleased with the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's a very good performance in Europe, although part
of it relates to the restocking of shelves following the recall,
rather than because of consumer takeaway,'' said Marc Cohen, an
analyst for Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter case sales rose 15 percent in Europe. In North
America, by contrast, case sales dropped 2 percent, largely because
of a 4 percent price increase. But the price rise more than
compensated for the sales decline, boosting CCE's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are adjusting to higher price points,'' said Andrew
Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen said he thinks investors still want to see ``more
recovery'' in North American case sales before CCE's stock price
makes substantial advances.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of CCE rose 18 3/4 cents to close at $22.87 1/2. The
stock is down nearly 36 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which owns 40 percent of CCE, is expected to report
its third-quarter earnings on Thursday.

CLINTON SUPPORTERS COMPLAIN ABOUT NEW INDEPENDENT COUNSEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Robert W. Ray, the newly chosen independent counsel
in charge of the closing stages of the wide-ranging investigation
of President Clinton, was interviewed and hired by Rudolph Giuliani
to be a federal prosecutor in New York nearly 11 years ago, a
spokesman for Ray's office said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ray did not start work as an assistant federal prosecutor
until after Giuliani resigned as U.S. Attorney for Manhattan and
thus never worked for him, said Edward J. Page, a deputy
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of President Clinton complained this week that the
selection of Ray to succeed Kenneth Starr had an inherent conflict
of interest. Giuliani is expected to be the Republican nominee for
the U.S. Senate for New York next year and his likely Democratic
opponent is the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a young lawyer, Page said, Ray sought a job in the
prestigious office of the federal prosecutor in New York. He was
interviewed in the fall of 1988 by several lawyers in the office
and, as is customary, by Giuliani, Page said.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Giuliani called Ray and told him he was being
hired. But Giuliani left the prosecutor's job at the end of January
1989, and Ray began work on Feb. 26, in an office then under the
supervision of Benito Romano, Giuliani's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Page said the dates showed that Ray never had any working
relationship with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, James Carville, a longtime Clinton aide who has been
outspoken in his criticism of Starr and the investigation of the
Clintons kept up his criticism of the Ray appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to tell me in a nation of 280 million people and
a gazillion lawyers, we can't find one for this job who is not tied
in some way to Rudy Giuliani?'' Carville said. ``I just can't
believe it.'' &QL;

BREAST FEEDING MAY HAVE ANTI-CANCER BENEFIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by ew York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Infants who were breast-fed for six months or more were almost
one-third less likely to develop childhood leukemia than infants
fed on formula, according to a large study reported in the Journal
of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the anti-cancer benefit of breast-feeding isn't
clear, said the researchers, but may involve stimulation of the
babies' immune systems by substances in mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   The study is the largest yet to examine the hypothesis that
breast-feeding _ already known to reduce the risk of a number of
infections and childhood diseases _ can also cut cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an important finding related to leukemia risk in
children,'' said Dr. Joseph P. Neglia of the University of
Minnesota Cancer Center, and an author of the report. ``And it adds
to the number of well documented reasons for breast-feeding if at
all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that breast-feeding could lower the risk of childhood
cancers is only a decade old but has been studied by a number of
scientists, primarily in Europe, said Neglia in an interview. It's
been long known that mother's milk contains a number of antibodies
and other infection-fighting proteins, and breast-fed infants have
lower risks of ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia, meningitis and
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Two previous studies had indicated that risk of leukemia was
lower in breast-fed infants, but the difference wasn't
statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   Based on telephone interviews, the new study compared the early
feeding histories of 2,200 infants diagnosed with leukemia of two
types (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, and acute myeloid
leukemia, or AML) and 2,418 infants without cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Infants who had been breast-fed for one month or more had a 21
percent lower risk of ALL or AML compared to infants fed on
formula, the scientists reported. That reduction grew with the
duration of breast-feeding: AML risk was reduced by 43 percent and
ALL by 28 percent in infants breast-fed for more than 6 months.
After 12 months of breast-feeding the additional reduction in risk
wasn't statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the study probed the suspicion that leukemia is
increased in children who live near electric power lines, but no
such link was found, said Neglia.
</P>
<P>
   The two types of leukemia strike about 2,900 children annually
in the United States, and ALL is the most common cancer in
children, said Neglia. Improvements in treatment have increased the
cure rate to about 80 percent in children, Neglia said, but
research has failed to identify the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of ALL peaks between the ages of 2 and 4, said
Neglia, while AML is equally common at all ages. The children in
the study were 1 to 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The protective effect of breast-feeding supplies ``only pieces
of the puzzle,'' said Neglia. ``No one is suggesting that if all
babies were breast-fed none of them would get leukemia.'' He added
that women who can't or choose not to breast-feed shouldn't feel
guilty. Cancer in any individual child results from a combination
of factors that turn normal cells malignant, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dimitri Trichopolous, professor of cancer prevention at the
Harvard School of Public Health, said that the notion ``makes
sense'' in light of some suspicion that viral infections may cause
childhood leukemia, and ``the antibodies in mother's milk may
neutralize this.''

STUDENTS ANNOUNCE FORMATION OF GROUP TO MONITOR OVERSEAS APPAREL
FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Pa., N.C., Ind., Wis., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their latest effort to fight sweatshops, students
from more than 100 colleges on Tuesday called upon their
institutions to join a new student-created group that would set a
strict code of conduct for overseas factories that make apparel
bearing university names.
</P>
<P>
   The students, from Columbia, Duke, Notre Dame, Wisconsin and
other institutions, said the group they were creating, the Worker
Rights Consortium, would alleviate sweatshop conditions by
inspecting apparel factories worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The students also urged their universities to withdraw from a
group backed by the White House, the Fair Labor Association, which
human rights groups and apparel companies, including Nike and Liz
Claiborne, set up to inspect factories to make sure they were not
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, in Manhattan, members of United
Students Against Sweatshops, a nationwide student coalition, said
the Fair Labor Association would not go far enough to improve
factory conditions because companies would pick the inspectors of
their factories and because the group did not require that workers
be paid a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fair Labor Association will serve to cover up abuses,''
said Maria Roeper, a senior at Haverford College. ``Companies like
Nike will choose the monitors that monitor their factories, will
choose which factories will be monitored and will tell their
factories ahead of time they will be receiving a knock at the door.
That doesn't really monitor anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization created by students would call for a living
wage and require that manufacturers disclose the names and
addresses of their factories to make it easier for church and labor
groups to monitor working conditions. The students said their group
would carry out unannounced spot inspections of factories where
workers had complained of poor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   University officials praised the students for their efforts. But
several officials, and members of the Fair Labor Association,
questioned whether the student-created group would have the
financial resources to monitor factories in more than a dozen
countries, where manufacturers like Champion, Nike and Reebok
produce $2.5 billion worth of goods each year bearing the names of
hundreds of colleges. The students' consortium would be financed
from 1 percent of the commissions that licensees paid colleges for
using their logos.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Posner, a member of the Fair Labor Association and
executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights,
praised the students' effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome any new initiative that broadens the base of
information and monitoring of factories,'' he said, adding, ``To my
view, this is complimentary to, not a substitute to, the Fair Labor
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``This is a big industry, and there needs to be a
comprehensive system that looks at the industry across the board,
and that's the Fair Labor Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown University president E. Gordon Gee announced Tuesday that
Brown would join the Worker Rights Consortium, while remaining in
the Fair Labor Association, to which 120 other colleges and
universities belong. But Gee said Brown might choose between the
two groups, weighing which was doing more to cooperate with the
other and to protect workers' rights.

ON EVE OF ELECTIONS, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT IS HURT BY KEY ASSEMBLY
VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In a midnight ballot that seemed to spell
the end of the brief, intense presidency of B.J. Habibie, the newly
independent National Assembly rejected his recent
state-of-the-nation address and prepared to vote Wednesday for
Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's loss, by just 33 votes out of 690 that were cast,
appeared to heighten the presidential competition between his two
rivals, the popular favorite, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and a
prominent Muslim leader, Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which sparked a period of last-minute political
tradeoffs, weakened but did not automatically end Habibie's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a new president will complete a tumultuous
transition from Indonesia's autocratic former president, Suharto,
who was forced to resign in May 1998. The vote against Habibie, a
close associate of Suharto who took his place as president, was a
sign of the continuing momentum of democratic reforms in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the assembly members who will choose the president were
elected last June in Indonesia's first free nationwide ballot in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the vote on Habibie, the chairman of the assembly,
Amien Rais, announced that the group had decided by consensus to
end a quarter century of Indonesian rule in East Timor, the former
Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   That decision formally accepted the results of an Aug. 30
referendum in which 87.5 percent of East Timor's voters endorsed
independence. The referendum was followed by a wave of violence
that caused the deployment of an international peacekeeping force
that is still struggling to pacify the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia would hand over
formal control of East Timor to the United Nations before the end
of the year. The United Nations plans to administer the territory
for two to three years as a transition to independent rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a session that took several significant steps toward remaking
Indonesia's political structure, the assembly also agreed by
consensus to limit the president to two five-year terms and to
shift lawmaking power from the president to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   These steps toward establishing a more democratic and
accountable government were mirrored by the free-wheeling demeanor
of the assembly, flexing and admiring its new muscles after three
decades of subservience to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the past several days, representatives of each of
11 parliamentary factions presented lengthy _ and mostly damning _
critiques of Habibie's state-of-the-nation address, which he
presented Thursday. The speeches were interrupted repeatedly from
the floor by legislators who, under Suharto, would have been
ejected for their effrontery.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Habibie sat to one side of the speaker's podium,
like a reprimanded schoolboy, grimacing and scribbling notes.
</P>
<P>
   No Indonesian president had ever been subjected to such
humiliation _ or such democracy. There was a certain dignity and
even bravery in this. Habibie is the first Indonesian president to
maintain a measure of humility about his role.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was suffering not only for his own perceived sins but
for those of his mentor and friend, Suharto, who was the real foil
for the changes taking place here.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations leveled at Habibie over the past few days in the
assembly had their roots in the abuses of Suharto's 32 years in
power: corruption, violations of human rights, the debacle of
Indonesian rule in East Timor and Habibie's refusal to pursue his
predecessor in the courts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Indonesia's Supreme Court _ apparently no
longer feeling the need to support Habibie _ ruled that an
auditor's report must be released to the Parliament in a
high-profile bank scandal that has badly damaged his political
standing.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy over the allegations that $80 million of bank
restructuring money had been channeled to Habibie's supporters had
led to a suspension of $4.7 billion in international loans.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Monday's vote, his candidacy had been further
wounded when the armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, went on
television Sunday to announce that he would not accept Habibie's
invitation to stand as his vice presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement suggested to some analysts that the military
had made a political judgment that Habibie was not likely to win
the election and that it would be politically damaging to be allied
with him. The general's withdrawal from the race also freed
military officers in the legislature to vote against Habibie. The
military controls a block of more than 40 votes in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many poignant moments for Habibie, a marginal
figure under Suharto who tried in vain to fill his shoes as
president. Wiranto had played a key role in May 1998 in telling
Suharto that the time had come for him to step down. He had then
become Habibie's first and most crucial ally.
</P>
<P>
   With his damning announcement Sunday, Wiranto earned the
distinction of having signaled to two successive presidents that
they had lost their political power.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater of Indonesian public life, where all Suharto had
to do was smile enigmatically to demonstrate his power, the past
few days of unabashed criticism appeared to have drained Habibie of
his public standing.
</P>
<P>
   The reading of the votethat sealed his future Monday night,
with each tally marked on a large white board at the front of the
chamber, was accompanied by hoots and cheers and catcalls that one
local reporter compared with the irreverence of schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   When the final count was announced, many of the assembly members
raised their palms in Muslim prayer and shouted, ``God is great!''
Some hugged each other. Ms. Megawati's youngest brother, Guruh
Sukarnoputra, wiped away tears.
</P>
<P>
   In the press gallery above, Indonesian reporters began to dance
and clap and wave their arms. They led the hall in the singing of
the national anthem: ``Free, free Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on whether to accept what is formally known as the
president's ``accountability speech'' was 355 for and 322 against,
with 9 abstentions and 4 spoiled ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a no-confidence vote, Monday's ballot had no formal
effect on the president's position. But it served as a test of
Habibie's standing in the hours before Wednesday's presidential
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is ever finished until it's finished in Indonesia, but
I think this is about as close as you can get to having him
effectively politically dead,'' said a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   He said the vote seemed to demonstrate that Habibie's backers
were unable to buy a victory and that therefore money politics
might be playing a smaller part in the presidential race than had
been feared.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``This is another example of how everything is coming
down to the wire. Think of all the time and effort and money that
we've seen since Suharto fell in getting to this moment, and now,
here we are, it's actually the 20th and we still don't have any
idea how it's going to come out.''

   Many high schoolers apparently learn the facts of life before
the facts about birth control, HIV and other sexually transmitted
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey of public high school students by the Kaiser
Family Foundation turned up surprising gaps in sexual health
awareness among kids in grades 9-12, despite the fact that a third
of the 1,012 students surveyed said they had had sex.
</P>
<P>
   One in two high schoolers said they need basic information about
HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, and more than 40
percent said they didn't know enough about birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly says something about information getting to
them too late,'' said Tina Hoff, a spokeswoman for the Henry J.
Kaiser Foundation, which studies national health care issues.
``They're already sexually experienced, but they don't know about
things like birth control.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half of all students, and 39 percent of those who have
had sex, did not know birth control pills can be obtained without
parental permission.
</P>
<P>
   More shocking was the finding that 15 percent of sexually active
teens do not know that condoms can be purchased without a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't 12-year-olds,'' Hoff pointed out. ``Most of them
are going to be sexually active by the time they're 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidential contraceptive and HIV/AIDS and STD services are
available for adolescents in all 50 states. In Georgia, teens do
not need a parent's permission to obtain birth control pills or be
tested for HIV and other STDs.
</P>
<P>
   To help boost awareness of sexual health among teens, the Kaiser
Foundation and MTV have collaborated to produce a 30-minute
program, titled ``I Need Sex Rx.'' The show features several young
people, including a college student getting an HIV test, a woman
going for her first gynecological examination, a young man getting
screened for STDs and a teen mother seeking counseling about her
sexual experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The program will air at 10 tonight (WEDNESDAY) on MTV.

INFLATION STAYS IN CHECK IN SEPTEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Inflation rose a moderate 0.4 percent in September, the federal
government said Tuesday, as overall price levels stayed relatively
flat despite rising oil costs and higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   While the much-anticipated report showed that inflation remained
under control, it did not eliminate fears by some analysts that
inflation will rear its head later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have been on tenterhooks in recent weeks, buying or
selling stocks _ contributing to wild swings in the market _ at
each report of good or bad economic news. Wall Street investors'
reaction to a mixed consumer price index report was confusion, with
early-day euphoria followed by a late-day fade.
</P>
<P>
   The CPI was a notch higher last month than the 0.3 percent rise
in each of the prior two months, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported. A 0.4 percent rise in the CPI may be ``something to worry
about,'' in the view of Doug Cliggott, managing director of J.P.
Morgan in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense to me that there was a fade'' in the stock
market at the end of the day, Cliggott said.
</P>
<P>
   The report _ combined with some strong third-quarter profit
reports _ touched off a morning rally that pushed the Dow Jones
industrial average up more than 200 points. But by the end of the
day, the Dow had settled back, closing at 10,204.93, up 88.65
points, or less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq, which has slid sharply over the
past week, was virtually unchanged. The index dipped less than 1
point, closing at 2688.18. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, a
broader measure of the market, gained 7.19 points, closing at
1261.32.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market was unhappy with the inflation report. The yield
on bellwether US Treasury bonds maturing in 30 years rose 3 basis
points to 6.35 percent _ that is close to a two-year intraday high
of 6.36 percent reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For economists, Tuesday's September CPI report was within their
expected range and provided no new information to add to a
wholesale price report released last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That report showed producer prices spiked 1.1 percent last month
in their biggest monthly jump in nine years. The news drove the Dow
down 266.9 points. September's CPI showed that producers have been
unable to pass on their higher costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No news is normally good news but it didn't really amount to
much this time,'' said William Cheney, chief economist for John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The forces pushing up last month's CPI are, to date,
identifiable and probably won't persist, economists said. Clothing
prices last month had the biggest single jump _ 1.2 percent _ of
any category of goods during a time of year when Americans buy more
expensive woolens and other clothing in preparation for winter.
</P>
<P>
   Continued increases in energy prices and a one-time hike in
tobacco prices also pushed up the CPI. Transportation costs, which
include prices for gasoline, rose 0.6 percent last month. That is
below the average increase of nearly 1 percent for each of the past
two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same culprits you wrote about in the PPI: tobacco,
energy, automobiles, and food,'' said Denis McSweeney, regional
director in Boston for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``No news.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Nicholas Perna, chief economic adviser for Fleet
Financial Group Inc., sees some reason in Tuesday's report to be
worried about inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation must be watched closely, he said, because it is
trending up slowly. For example, inflation for the 12-month period
ended in September was 2.6 percent _ that is more than the 2 to 2.5
percent inflation rate forecast for 1999 in a speech last summer by
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.6 percent annual inflation rate currently compares with a
1.5 percent rate for the year ended September 1998, Perna said.
``Clearly, the best is behind us on inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``core'' inflation rate _ the CPI, minus energy
and food prices _ came in at its highest rate in five months. The
core CPI increased 0.3 percent in September, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics said. The core rate rose only 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston metropolitan area, the CPI rose 0.9 percent during
a two-month period ended in September. That is up from 0.6 percent
in the prior two months. Much of that increase was driven by higher
gasoline prices in Boston, McSweeney said. At nearly $1.31 a
gallon, gasoline prices are at their highest since September 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While all eyes were on the CPI, economists maintain wages are a
bigger concern.
</P>
<P>
   Wages may begin to rise due to a tight labor market, which has
given workers more leverage when asking for wages or when seeking
new jobs with higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the new data, ``inflation does not look as if it's
looming,'' John Hancock's Cheney said. ``We have to worry about
(inflation) because we have this very tight labor market.''
</P>
<P>
   The employment cost index, a closely watched measure of
Americans' wages, will be released Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Investors on Wall Street are looking for any sign that wages and
consumer prices are picking up steam, which would give the Federal
Open Market Committee reason to raise rates yet again when it meets
in mid-November. The Fed has already increased rates by a half
percentage point in two separate hikes in June and in August.
</P>
<P>
   With signs of global economic strength improving and with
inflation low all over the world, ``the real wild card is US
inflation and Fed policy,'' Leila Heckman, a market analyst for
Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ``Every little hiccup one way or
the other is being watched not only in the US but also globally.''

   Future of N.C. town as uncertain as murky waters engulfing it
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: With NCBOX.)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   C. 1999 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   PRINCEVILLE, N.C. _ The Tar River is rising again, cresting
today in this abandoned, flood-socked town founded by former
slaves. But Murray Morning plans to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my home,'' he said, sitting on the brick steps of his
double-wide mobile home, destroyed by Hurricane Floyd's historic
flood waters a month ago. ``I plan to rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   But across town, past the leaning houses with blown-out windows
and past the stinking piles of shoes, mattresses and spoiled food,
Isaiah Dickens, 55, is leaving Princeville for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come back,'' he said, loading his black pickup
truck with a big-screen TV and other household items he hopes will
dry out and, somehow, work again.
</P>
<P>
   It could be months, even years, before Princeville's future
becomes clear. Now as town officials conduct business in nearby
Tarboro and federal inspectors assess damage to water-soaked houses
standing in buggy pools, prospects for the town seem as murky as
the brown film left by receding waters.
</P>
<P>
   This week's culprit is torrential rains from Hurricane Irene,
swelling the Tar River above flood stage. Within a few days, the
new problem could be rains from Hurricane Jose, although
forecasters remained uncertain whether that storm, threatening
islands in the eastern Caribbean on Tuesday, would hit the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Irene's floodwaters were not expected to breach the
crescent-shaped earthen levy along the Tar River. For more than 30
years, until Floyd, the man-made wall had protected Princeville
whenever the river rose above its banks.
</P>
<P>
   This week, as the Tar's black water rose silently, Morning
strode across the levy. He stopped at the sandy spot first breached
by Floyd's flooding, before it covered all but Princeville's
highest rooftops and church steeples in foul swirling water.
</P>
<P>
   He gazed toward the abandoned town, where officials vow to
rebuild in this flood plain originally named Freedom Hill by freed
blacks who settled here in 1865. Others, however, are talking about
relocating all but Princeville's most historic buildings, and
rebuilding on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see it come back,'' said Mayor Pro Tem Milton
Johnson, 58, who like the town's other 2,100 residents evacuated
during Floyd and lost most everything he owned.
</P>
<P>
   Princeville's troubles in recent years go beyond flooding. In
1997, the state of North Carolina took over the town's finances
amid allegations of mismanagement and neglect by town officials.
</P>
<P>
   Now with most buildings declared ``unfit for human habitation,''
people haven't returned to Princeville. Living with family and
friends, in motels and in other temporary housing, residents
haven't seen much of one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes people to make a town,'' said Johnson, a 30-year
resident. ``But I don't know what is on people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville residents will get the chance Monday to speak up
when the town council convenes a meeting at Edgecombe Community
College in Tarboro with representatives of federal and state relief
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials are waiting for a signal from Princeville's
leadership. According to Town Manager Sandra White, officials plan
to repair buildings and rebuild those that were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to tell Princeville what to do,'' North
Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said. ``I think they will want to take steps
to see that this doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``How it is going to be done, I don't know,'' Hunt said. ``You
can say move to a high area, or raise the levy, or put everything
on stilts. There are a lot of ways you can do this, and Princeville
is going to determine its own future.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaks in the levy have been repaired temporarily. Officials are
determining whether Floyd's flooding at Princeville would be
considered to be at greater than the 100-year level.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, then federal laws would allow Princeville
to rebuild where it is, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the owners of buildings that were more than 50 percent
damaged would have to rebuild under current, stricter codes if they
want to qualify for federal flood insurance, officials said. Or the
structures could be raised on stilts to the100-year flood level.
</P>
<P>
   Few property owners in Princeville had flood insurance. Few
imagined that the Tar River would rise higher than the levy, 48
feet above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Good gracious, I reckon, where did all that water
come from?'''' Morning recalled. ``Wherever it came from, it wiped
us out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now recovery has a long way to go. The stoplights in Princeville
don't work. Residents venture back into their homes wearing rubber
gloves. At the police station, officers recovered soaked uniforms
and draped them over squad cars to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks haul away the debris, at least what's discarded by the
roadside. At Mutual and Greenwood boulevards, eight feet above the
ground, a tan lounge chair is hooked over a dogwood limb. Beside it
is a white wooden bench stuck on a utility pole hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to construct the whole town like it was,'' said
Rodney Cogdell, 31, Princeville's acting police chief. ``In fact,
it is going to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought we were going to bulldoze the whole town,''
he said, ``but we are not.''
</P>
<P>
   White, the town manager, said pledges of money and physical
labor for rebuilding Princeville are coming in. Outside of Raleigh,
fast-growing, prosperous Cary has adopted the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the infancy,'' White said. ``You cannot put a
time table on this type of devastation.''

 Karen Schoemer is a former music critic for Newsweek.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way some guys feel about their sports car or their
Frisbee-catching golden retriever, F.M. Cornog feels about his
Tascam 388. This simple eight-track analog recorder sits silently,
splendidly, on a table in an upstairs room of his Summit, N.J.,
home, bathed in natural light from windows framed by leafy suburban
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Cornog sits down in his humbly appointed home studio, which also
includes a few scattered instruments (guitars, a selection of
keyboards, a bass with just two strings on it), some Asbury Park
souvenir postcards tacked up as art and a taped-up picture of his
musical inspiration, Paul Christopher Moschette, a lounge singer on
a Jersey Shore cruise boat.
</P>
<P>
   Cornog regards his Tascam with the benevolence of a man who is
deeply content: the rows of multicolored knobs, the old-fashioned
pointer dials, the not-too-complex array of buttons. This is
Cornog's link to the outside world; this is the recording device
that carries his musical message far and wide. ``This is a really
beautiful machine,'' he says with a sigh. ``I love this machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornog punches a button on the Tascam and sounds come out: the
puffy click-beat of a drum machine, an ethereal hum of keyboards,
chiming electric guitar and then Cornog's voice, a high-pitched
whine singing formless words that float along with the melancholy
chord changes of the keyboard. This snippet is just one of his many
works in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, Cornog has been writing songs, recording them and
releasing them under the moniker East River Pipe. Every day,
instead of going to work in an office or factory _ or, for that
matter, a recording studio _ he comes upstairs to this room and
fiddles around and lays down ideas until he has enough material for
an album.
</P>
<P>
   East River Pipe's fourth and most recent album, ``The Gasoline
Age,'' released on the independent label Merge, is a dreamy,
Springsteenish meditation on suburban car culture. He recorded all
the instruments and sang all the vocals and harmonies himself. He
doesn't tour. He doesn't do much promotion. The Tascam is his
bandmate, his songwriting partner, his producer, his ear, his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Cornog is just an extreme example of a current trend. More and
more these days, independent rock musicians are shunning the
prestige and expense of recording studios in favor of the
affordability and intimacy of working at home. Having a home studio
is nothing new: a multimillion-dollar studio is a status symbol for
any rock star. And as musicians become better adept at getting the
sounds they want out of equipment like computers, samplers and
sequencers, more commercial recordings, especially in genres like
hip-hop and electronica, are being made on home systems.
</P>
<P>
   But what's happening in indie rock is a little different: it's a
response as much to what these musicians see as the
depersonalization of the global pop marketplace as to the increased
accessibility of home technology. In an era defined by mass-culture
icons like Ricky Martin and the Spice Girls, brave and alienated
rock musicians are looking for a way to speak to listeners one by
one.
</P>
<P>
   Cornog's hermetic guitar-pop compositions, with their brief,
haiku-like lyrics about tawdry romance and lives going in circles,
are the equivalent of private music. They're tapped straight from
his mind into yours, with no whiz-bang overdrive music business
machinery getting in between.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hollywood, the music business isn't geared to work on a
small scale. From recording to distribution to marketing, today's
industry is intended to serve artists who want to sell millions of
albums as quickly as possible. What's missing in the mainstream is
the sense of rock-and-roll as an outlet for quirky visions and
individualistic voices.
</P>
<P>
   Home recordists, most of whom came of age in the do-it-yourself
atmosphere of '80s and early-'90s punk, are content to make
themselves heard on the fringes. And the fringe, in this context,
doesn't mean the second stage at Lilith Fair or MTV's ``120
Minutes''; it means albums that sell by the handful to a devoted
corps of listeners who are as desperate to connect as the musicians
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Home recording stalwarts include Lou Barlow of Sentridoh, whose
1994 album ``Winning Losers: A Collection of Home Recordings'' is a
benchmark of the genre, and Stephin Merritt of the New York-based
one-man band Magnetic Fields. But the roster is growing. Terre
Roche, of the folk trio the Roches, recorded her 1998 solo album
``The Sound of a Tree Falling'' alone in her Manhattan apartment.
And Kathleen Hanna, formerly of the punk-rock riot grrl band Bikini
Kill, released a 1998 solo album under the alias Julie Ruin, which
she recorded on her own in Olympia, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Most home recordists agree that the process has less to do with
accumulating fancy equipment than with achieving a certain feel in
their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about performance, not technology,'' says Tim Foljahn of
Two Dollar Guitar, who recorded his 1998 album ``La Lengua
Asesina'' in his apartment in Hoboken, N.J. ``At home, you're so
much more relaxed. If you want to do it again, you can, and all
you've lost is time.''
</P>
<P>
   Although home recording is cheap _ Cornog bought his vintage
Tascam 388 for about $900, the cost of a few of hours in a high-end
studio _ the quality is good enough that it doesn't have to
(italics)sound(end italics) cheap. ``No one's enamored of lo-fi
anymore,'' says Foljahn. ``If I hear an album full of scratches and
hiss, it annoys me, because it's just not necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What appeals to many of the practitioners is that they're
getting back to the same limited-track technology that was
responsible for some of the greatest records of the '60s, from Phil
Spector's Wall of Sound productions to the Beach Boys' ``Pet
Sounds'' to the Beatles' ``Rubber Soul.'' And unlike the robotic
perfection of contemporary hit records, home recording leaves room
for the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always glad when a fire engine goes by and it gets on
there,'' says Foljahn.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hanna was originally inspired to try home recording when she
heard an early cassette tape by Liz Phair, which had been done on a
four-track machine. ``I listened to it, and I really got the
feeling she was in control of what she was doing,'' says Ms. Hanna.
The Julie Ruin album is a charmingly unruly jumble of sounds and
influences: the cheesy tick of a drum machine up against the manic
buzz of electric guitar, the frenzied spirit of punk overlapping
the demure coo of '60s girl groups.
</P>
<P>
   As in Bikini Kill, Ms. Hanna uses songs as an outlet for her
deliberately adolescent notions of feminism and social injustice.
``Crochet'' rails against the popular media concept of women in
rock. ``You make we want to go away,'' she sneers. ``You make me
want to crochet.''
</P>
<P>
   But as with Cornog, Ms. Hanna's point of view here is primarily
personal. Apartment walls come to represent the limitations that
keep us all separate from one another. ``At the time I was doing
the album, a neighborhood male was harrassing me, and I felt really
frightened,'' she says. ``I'm trying to do this record in an
apartment, and I had to wear headphones because I didn't want to
disturb my neighbors. I was afraid I wouldn't hear if he was
banging down my door because I had my headphones on so loud. So I
would have to stop in the middle of singing and turn around and
make sure nobody was at my door, over and over. I think a lot of
women can relate to that: we don't feel safe in our own homes. I
was writing personal songs about it that were really sad, and I
realized I needed to reach out to this community of women and say,
`You're not alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cornog is the Brian Wilson of home recording. His songs tap into
that space of wounded isolation Wilson so eloquently memorialized
in the Beach Boys' 1963 hit ``In My Room.'' Cornog has also had his
share of personal difficulties fighting alcoholism and mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '80s, after walking off a job in a New Jersey light
bulb factory, he wound up living in SRO hotels and eventually
homeless, sleeping in the Hoboken train station in the dead of
February. An acquaintance named Barbara Powers took him in, helped
him sober up and bought him some recording equipment. After several
years living in Queens, Cornog and Ms. Powers bought a house in New
Jersey. Why Summit? There's a pause. Then Ms. Powers says, ``Um,
the hospital was close by?''
</P>
<P>
   People are always telling Cornog that he should try recording in
a ``real'' studio, but he says they just don't get it: he has
everything he needs, right here at home. Sitting in his living
room, looking workmanlike in blue jeans, a blue polo shirt and a
baseball cap, he gestures at a piece of folk art hanging above the
mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view what I do as akin to what that guy does _ R.A.
Miller,'' Cornog says. ``He's like a 90-year-old guy that lives in
Gainesville, Fla. Not unlike Howard Finster _ he's a little cruder
than Howard Finster. He just gets tractor paint and cuts metal
pieces off a side of a shed and washes it in red and paints
something on top of it _ puts four angels with birds flying off
their heads. That's kind of what I do. It's like saying to that
guy, `Hey, why don't you get professional oils and take lessons
down at the Florida art academy?' Pretty soon it's not even you
anymore. It's something else.''

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton renewed his call to Congress to
approve a far-reaching gun control bill on Tuesday, but prospects
for its passage appeared increasingly bleak as lawmakers remained
deadlocked over the pivotal issue of regulating gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the backdrop of a daylong series of Capitol Hill
events on youth violence to scold the Republican-controlled
Congress for failing to tighten gun restrictions six months after
13 people died in the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Congress to help us keep guns out of the wrong
hands,'' Clinton told more than 300 high school students from
around the country who are attending a two-day conference sponsored
mainly by House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Broad bipartisan support exists for a range of gun-control
measures, including a requirement for child-safety trigger locks, a
ban on imported large-capacity ammunition clips and new
restrictions on the possession of semiautomatic weapons by children
under 18.
</P>
<P>
   But these provisions, as well as scores of other unrelated
juvenile crime measures, are imperiled because of the major
sticking point on gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat-sponsored provision approved by the Senate in May
required all vendors at gun shows to conduct mandatory background
checks on customers within three days. Currently, only licensed
dealers must conduct background checks, also within three days,
while hobbyists and collectors are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill technically has no gun-control provisions,
although Representatives approved several new restrictions on
firearms before the entire package was defeated in June, largely by
Democrats who were protesting the relative weakness of that package
in comparison with the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators have met only once since then to
reconcile the rival versions. The difficulty has been finding a
compromise that a majority of Democrats, who are the main
supporters of gun control, and a significant number of Republicans
can embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, House and Senate Republican leaders met to assess
what compromise, if any, could be reached. The meeting ended
inconclusively. Even if Republicans are able to hammer out a
version among themselves that a majority of the House and Senate
could approve, Clinton has vowed to veto any bill that falls short
on the gun show provisions.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, critics and
supporters alike said public outrage would likely bridge the gulf
over what has been an intractable political issue. But in the
intervening months, both sides have hardened their positions and
compromise now seem remote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., accused Republicans on Tuesday of
being captive to the National Rifle Association, which opposes the
tougher gun show provisions, and said Congress will pass a bill
``only if the gun lobby tells the Republican leadership it can.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said the White House and congressional
Democratic leaders were refusing to compromise in order to use gun
control as a campaign issue next year. ``Staging photo
opportunities will not solve anything,'' Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who
is one of the House negotiators, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's events on Capitol Hill, capped by Clinton's address,
illustrated Democrats' continued confidence that most Americans
share the party's advocacy of stricter gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   The key to any deal lies with the House. The two top
negotiators, Reps. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., have tried for weeks to find common ground. The latest
Republican offer includes a provision giving vendors 24 hours to
conduct the mandatory background checks, unless that check turned
up a disqualifying arrest or felony conviction. In that event, the
dealer would have three days to complete the check.
</P>
<P>
   Conyers was receptive to this proposal, but only if other
problems could be ironed out. Democrats, for instance, objected to
Republicans' definition of a gun show being at least five vendors.
Under this definition, they say, four vendors selling thousands of
guns would be exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to me that the loophole-loving Republican
leadership will sabotage any effort to arrive at meaningful
legislation to close the gun show loopholes,'' Conyers said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has faced an uphill fight selling any compromise to his own
leadership, notably Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip.
DeLay has used gun control as an effective fund-raising tool,
raising fears among conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton and the anti-gun lobby are using the tragedies at
Columbine High School and Georgia to stop you from exercising YOUR
RIGHT TO OWN A GUN AND PROTECT YOUR FAMILY!'' DeLay said in a new
fund-raising letter sent this month.

STOCK PRICES GENERALLY FIRMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices were generally firmer Tuesday, helped by
positive earnings reports from big drug makers and inflation
numbers that were in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture was not uniformly rosy. The bond market, which
initially reacted positively to the consumer price report, turned
sour during the afternoon. Technology stocks, which were up in the
morning, fell as market interest rates began to climb. A negative
earnings report from Dell Computer did not help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a period of repair, with the market putting in a
bottom,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``Given the macro issues that have caused the
market to fall off to this level, the best we could hope for is
what we are seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Procter &AMP; Gamble and Merck, which all
posted gains of more than 2 points, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 88.65, or 0.9 percent, to 10,204.93. Early in the
session the blue-chip average was up more than 200 points. Still,
it was the first time in a month the Dow has posted consecutive
daily gains.
</P>
<P>
   Drug and financial stocks helped to boost the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index by 7.19, or 0.6 percent, to 1261.32.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index was little changed, as big
declines in Intel and Dell Computer offset gains in a number of big
biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Nasdaq composite index stood at 2688.18, down
0.97, or 0.04 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small-company
stocks rose for the second straight session, gaining 2.03, or 0.5
percent, to 410.93.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively benign consumer price figures served as a useful
backdrop to the pricing of two widely anticipated initial stock
offerings from Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia and World Wide
Wrestling Federation Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Initially priced at $18 a share on the New York Stock Exchange,
the 7.2 million shares of Martha Stewart that were offered soared,
and closed at 35 9/16, up 17 9/16 on the day.
</P>
<P>
   World Wide Wrestling did not fare quite so well. The 10 million
shares of stock, which were offered to the public at 17, gained 8
1/4 on the day, to 25 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   David Manlow, president of IPO Financial Network, said the
market's reception was not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has been besieged by uncertainty about interest
rates, but the consumer price numbers gave us a day off from
that,'' he said. ``These were the No. 1 and No. 2 deals in terms of
class and quality. They are real, money-making machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Manlow added that investors pushed the stocks up to
unsustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuations are now way ahead of where the stocks should be
trading,'' he said. ``We view both issues as ones that can be
accumulated on dips.''
</P>
<P>
   A warning from Dell Computer damaged the computer manufacturer
as well as Intel, its biggest supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Dell fell 2 13/16 to 38 1/2 after it said higher prices would
cut into profits for the quarter ending this month.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement prompted a Merrill Lynch analyst to report that
rising prices for benchmark computer chips could also have a
negative impact on Intel. Joe Osha, the analyst, said he was
removing Intel from the firm's list of 10 favorite technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Intel closed at 65 1/8, down 4 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks had a very good day, led by Johnson &AMP; Johnson and
Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson contributed 26 points to the rise in the Dow
Jones average, increasing 5 1/4 to 99 3/4 after it said
third-quarter profits rose 14 percent. Pfizer led the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index higher after it released earnings that were better
than expected. The stock gained 2 15/16, to 39 15/16. And Bristol
Myers Squibb gained 4 5/8, to 76 1/8 after it said earnings rose 14
percent in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While most big technology stocks were weaker Tuesday, Microsoft
may give the group a bit of a lift during Wednesday's trading.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed, the software giant reported earnings
for its fiscal first quarter that were well above consensus
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which fell 1 9/16, to 86 5/16 during the official
trading day, was up nearly 3 points a share in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that Congress is close to passing a comprehensive
financial services bill helped to push up bank and brokerage
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, a Dow component, gained 2, to 139 7/8.
Citigroup rose 1 1/4, to 44 15/16. Merrill Lynch closed at 65 1/16,
up 1 5/16. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter gained 2, to 92 3/8.

BLAST AT ILLEGAL FIREWORKS WAREHOUSE KILLS AT LEAST ONE

<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ The top law enforcement officer for the
state of Tamaulipas vowed Tuesday to ``punish with severity''
anyone found responsible for the latest deadly explosion at a
hidden fireworks operation in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Grim-faced investigators and shaken neighbors sifted through the
debris of a candy store in the search for human remains in the
explosion of the fireworks operation. The blast Monday evening
killed at least one person and wounded another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found a foot here and a torso there. It was terrible,''
said Eduardo Garza Rivas, attorney general for the border state of
Tamaulipas. ``We will punish with severity those responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The candy store owner, Fermin Huerta, was charged with illegal
possession of fireworks and homicide for the death of employee
whose body was torn apart by the force of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion rocked a West Side neighborhood here and was
Mexico's third major fireworks-related accident in two years and
the second in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   At least 58 people were killed and more than 340 were wounded in
September in Celaya when a clandestine fireworks cache behind a
candy store exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Three explosions blew through Tultepec, Mexico's self-proclaimed
fireworks capital in October 1998, killing as many as 10 people and
wounding 51.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen city workers armed with shovels cleared
debris from the surrounding streets on Tuesday as state and federal
investigators combed the remains of a yellow, two story cement
building at 5 de Febrero street.
</P>
<P>
   Chunks of cement, paper and other debris from the explosion
covered the rooftops and patios of several surrounding homes in the
crowded working-class neighborhood known as Mirador.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous windows were blown out, including stained glass at the
nearby Iglesia San Gerardo, a Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said it would be impossible to know how many illegal
fireworks warehouses and factories are still operating, but he
called on citizens to help authorities root them out.
</P>
<P>
   Covert fireworks operations often use legitimate fronts such as
candy stores to carry out their operations within the confines of
residential neighborhoods, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers guarded the charred remains of the candy store Tuesday
as angry neighbors sifted through nearby rubble of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to check all over the place _ they need to make
sure this does not happen again,'' said Lorena Moreno, 26, a single
mother who lived next door to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God my baby and I are all right,'' said Moreno, who
along with her neighbors spent the night in hotel rooms paid for by
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors said they knew the candy store owner peddled
fireworks, but they had no idea he was running a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   City investigators were evaluating the damage to surrounding
homes as Mayor Horacio Garza Garza vowed to provide assistance to
help residents whose homes were damaged.

 &HT;    Tour de France's Armstrong gets Wheaties honor
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sixty five years ago, folks at General Mills
decided to adorn their orange Wheaties cereal boxes with a photo of
the fictional character, ``Jack Armstrong, the All-American boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the company decided to use real people _ athletes _
to spice up their Wheaties boxes. And on Wednesday, the company
unveiled its newest cover boy whose name is about as All-American
as the original.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Armstrong, the reigning Tour de France champion, proudly
showed off a box of Wheaties Wednesday morning featuring a photo of
him wearing a yellow jersey on his way to the Tour championship
last July.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed appropriate that Armstrong, an Austin, Texas resident
and cancer survivor, unveiled the box in the lobby of the Austin
Children's Hospital while surrounded by a dozen youngsters being
treated for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such an honor,'' Armstrong said. ``When you're growing
up and you're watching the Olympics and Super Bowls and World
Series, and you see all of those athletes who have been on the
cover, this is really a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong is the only cyclist ever to be selected for the cover.
</P>
<P>
   The boxes, which will be distributed nationally, will hit stores
this week. Armstrong received an endorsement fee of about $25,000,
and that amount will be donated to the Lance Armstrong Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stapleton, Armstrong's agent, said his client has agreed to
another ``exclusive rights'' deal with General Mills that will run
through the end of 2,000. Stapleton declined to say how much that
deal was worth, but such recent deals with Armstrong have paid him
in the six-figure range.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new deal, Armstrong's photo will appear on another
Wheaties box next spring, with a portion of the cereal sales going
to the American Cancer Society. In addition, Armstrong, his wife
Kristin, and possibly his newborn son Luke, will appear in a
Wheaties television commercial next year.

TOKYO EXPRESSES DISPLEASURE WITH NISSAN CUTBACK PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With sidebar, NISSAN-REACT-U.S.)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Less than 24 hours after Nissan Motor Co. announced a
far-reaching overhaul that includes plant closings and job cuts,
the No. 3 Japanese automaker learned that candor does not play well
politically in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and various Cabinet officials and
politicians on Tuesday rushed to chide the company and offer
assurances that the government would try to mitigate the impact of
the plan on suppliers and residents in the communities surrounding
the plants that the company intends to close.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in a position to interfere in individual management
decisions, but we believe it is necessary for them to cope as much
as they can with the plan's effects on the company's employment
situation and subcontractors,'' Obuchi said.
</P>
<P>
   He ordered the Labor Ministry to produce a report
``immediately'' on the restructuring plans at Nissan and its
various affiliates, which were announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mikio Aoki, chief cabinet secretary and the government's top
spokesman, also suggested that Nissan, which is partly owned by
Renault SA, the French car company, was forgetting its obligations
to society. ``Restructuring is necessary, but we believe that
companies should also shoulder big responsibilities that are
brought about by such a step, such as unemployment problems,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how far the government, which once ruled Japan's economy
with an iron fist, is willing to allow restructuring to go has been
a looming issue for foreign investors, whose enthusiasm for the
corporate reforms announced here so far has pushed the Japanese
stock market to highs few market strategists envisioned at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities (Japan)
Ltd., said the comments about Nissan's plan suggest that the
government is still not willing to let go of its influence over the
economy, although in fact there is little it can do to prevent
companies like Nissan from making stringent reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bevacqua also said that should such reforms become popular, the
fragile Japanese economy will suffer. ``If a lot of companies
started adopting these sorts of harsh restructuring plans, the
economy would really tank,'' he said. ``To the extent that the
politicians don't want that, you can understand why they're saying
what they're saying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although other Japanese companies have also announced sweeping
reorganizations, they have offered few details and tended to
downplay their intent to pare their workforce. NEC Corp. and Sony
Corp. are eliminating 15,000 and 17,000 jobs, respectively, or
roughly 10 percent of their workforces, and a report Tuesday in the
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, said
National Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp. has submitted plans to cut
20,000 jobs, or 16 percent of its workforce, to its labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   NTT , in which the government holds a significant stake, would
not confirm the report, but it did say that it had begun discussing
``the severe situation and the necessity of business reform'' with
its unions.
</P>
<P>
   But while Nissan adopted the same cautious language when
describing how it intended to eliminate 21,000 jobs, or 14 percent
of its workers, the stunning specificity of its plan made its
broader impact on the Japanese economy painfully clear.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of Nissan's parts and services suppliers will lose
their contracts over the next three years, and three new plant
closings were announced, bringing the total number of plants the
company will close by 2002 to five.
</P>
<P>
   Major Japanese companies are also leaning heavily on their
suppliers to pare costs by reducing employees and merging. It is
far easier for smaller companies in Japan to eliminate jobs than
larger ones, and so the suppliers are logical targets.
</P>
<P>
   But Nissan made the potential impact of its plans so plainly
clear that Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government
would consider tax breaks and other assistance to alleviate the
impact of Nissan's plan on local communities and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announced plan may be much more drastic than what
subcontractors and residents in the regions had expected, and that
may be a departure from Japan's traditional paternalistic
relationship between management and laborers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was clearly a political element to Tuesday's criticism.
Obuchi has said an upcoming special session of Parliament should be
devoted to promoting the interests of small businesses like those
to be the most affected by Nissan's plan.

   DETROIT _ Nissan's plans to eliminate 1,400 jobs in the United
States as part of its broad restructuring will not be accomplished
by layoffs, and the company may even add workers at its Tennessee
assembly plants, a spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's U.S. cutback plans include the sale of a forklift
division and computer operations unit with a total of 910 people,
as well as a reduction of 490 jobs through attrition among its
11,000 employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Employment might even rise at Nissan's assembly plant and engine
factory in Tennessee if new models are successful, said Jason
Vines, a company spokesman. By avoiding layoffs and paying the same
wages as Detroit automakers, Japanese automakers have prevented the
United Automobile Workers union from organizing their work forces,
except at their joint ventures with Detroit automakers.

   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ The top law enforcement officer for the
state of Tamaulipas vowed Tuesday to ``punish with severity''
anyone found responsible for the latest deadly explosion at a
hidden fireworks operation in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Grim-faced investigators and shaken neighbors sifted through the
debris of a candy store in the search for human remains in the
explosion of the fireworks operation. The blast Monday evening
killed at least one person and wounded another.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found a foot here and a torso there. It was terrible,''
said Eduardo Garza Rivas, attorney general for the border state of
Tamaulipas. ``We will punish with severity those responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   The candy store owner, Fermin Huerta, was charged with illegal
possession of fireworks and homicide for the death of employee
whose body was torn apart by the force of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion rocked a West Side neighborhood here and was
Mexico's third major fireworks-related accident in a year and the
second in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   At least 58 people were killed and more than 340 were wounded in
September in Celaya when a clandestine fireworks cache behind a
candy store exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Three explosions blew through Tultepec, Mexico's self-proclaimed
fireworks capital in October 1998, killing as many as 10 people and
wounding 51.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen city workers armed with shovels cleared
debris from the surrounding streets on Tuesday as state and federal
investigators combed the remains of a yellow, two story cement
building at 5 de Febrero street.
</P>
<P>
   Chunks of cement, paper and other debris from the explosion
covered the rooftops and patios of several surrounding homes in the
crowded working-class neighborhood known as Mirador.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous windows were blown out, including stained glass at the
nearby Iglesia San Gerardo, a Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said it would be impossible to know how many illegal
fireworks warehouses and factories are still operating, but he
called on citizens to help authorities root them out.
</P>
<P>
   Covert fireworks operations often use legitimate fronts such as
candy stores to carry out their operations within the confines of
residential neighborhoods, Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers guarded the charred remains of the candy store Tuesday
as angry neighbors sifted through nearby rubble of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to check all over the place _ they need to make
sure this does not happen again,'' said Lorena Moreno, 26, a single
mother who lived next door to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God my baby and I are all right,'' said Moreno, who
along with her neighbors spent the night in hotel rooms paid for by
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Some neighbors said they knew the candy store owner peddled
fireworks, but they had no idea he was running a warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   City investigators were evaluating the damage to surrounding
homes as Mayor Horacio Garza Garza vowed to provide assistance to
help residents whose homes were damaged.

BARTER IS SKEWING THE FINANCIAL PICTURE FOR INTERNET COMPANIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the first cave man exchanged his favorite club for a
neighbor's animal pelt, barter has been an accepted form of
commerce. Now some Internet companies have turned themselves into
virtual trading posts, making barter a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Sportsline USA, whose sports-related Internet site is
relentlessly promoted during broadcasts of football games and other
sporting events on CBS, the television network that owns a stake in
Sportsline.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of this year, nearly a fifth of Sportsline's
$24 million in revenue involved no cash payments. Instead,
Sportsline gave to other companies that amount of advertising space
on its site in exchange for advertising and other services and
goods on their World Wide Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   These types of exchanges have become so common that they may be
skewing the financial picture for the Internet industry. Since
these new companies rarely have profits, revenues are often the key
determination of their value. Strong revenue growth, thus, can
translate into higher stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Barter accounted for more than 10 percent of revenues at
Internet companies including Ivillage, Salon.com, Earthweb,
Verticalnet and Edgar Online in the second quarter, the companies
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it represented 7 percent of the $693 million in
Internet advertising recorded in the first quarter of the year,
double the percentage of just three years ago, according to a
survey of Internet advertising conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers
and the Internet Advertising Bureau, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet analysts say these numbers are far too low. Were
companies to take into account deals in which two Internet
companies simply agree to scratch each other's back _ selling equal
dollar amounts of advertising to each other for cash _ barter would
account for more than 15 percent of all Internet ads, the analysts
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In few cases do investors have any idea how big barter has
become. Most companies that include barter deals in their reported
revenue, like Sportsline, do not mention the practice in their
earnings news releases. Only by reading far into a company's
quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission would an
investor find disclosures about such transactions. The SEC requires
companies to break out the deals if barter accounts for 10 percent
or more of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about the practice doesn't smell right to me,'' said
Robert A. Olstein, portfolio manager of the Olstein Financial Alert
fund, a $350 million mutual fund that tries to find undervalued
stocks by parsing companies' financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be okay according to generally accepted accounting
principles, but I'm not sure anything truly economic is happening
in these transactions,'' he said. ``I like to see independent
transactions where cash is exchanged, and the company that receives
it can consciously decide where to spend every dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Major accounting firms all sign audited financial statements of
Internet companies that recognize some barter transactions, giving
the practice legitimacy. The exchange of advertising is important
to companies trying to get their names before the Web-surfing
public.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the peculiar characteristics of the Internet
business, accountants and securities regulators are taking a closer
look at the issue. On Monday, the SEC's chief accountant, in a
letter to the Financial Accounting Standards Board, requested that
the board's special task force on emerging issues take up the issue
of accounting for barter transactions, calling it one of four
``priority level 1'' issues accounting and securities regulators
face.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting for barter transactions has long been governed by an
old rule that says the deals must be recorded at the ``fair value''
of the goods exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Fair value of advertising is easily determined for established
media companies that sell nearly all of their advertising space for
cash. But an Internet company may now collect payments on only a
small fraction of its space. Much of the rest goes unused, so
exchanging a part of it with another Internet company has little
downside.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some cases, I don't know what fair value is on the
Internet,'' said George Neble, a partner in the high-technology
practice in Arthur Andersen's Boston office. ``Current practices by
companies are all over the place. Given the infinite amount of
space on the Internet, I think you have to demonstrate that you can
get cash for these spots from independent parties and that you have
a pattern of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neble added, ``Valuations for these companies are being driven
by revenues, and barter creates the potential for distortion in a
company's revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, says he, too, has grown
uncomfortable with some companies' extensive use of barter. ``We
want to make sure that the information being reported gives
investors a true notion of what is really going on with revenues
and that they are reliable numbers,'' he said. ``We're always
concerned that someone will push the envelope too far.''
</P>
<P>
   While most Internet companies engage in some form of barter,
some refuse to recognize those transactions as revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it's fraudulent,'' said Alan M. Meckler,
chief executive of Internet.com, which runs a network of Web sites,
electronic newsletters and discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   Meckler has been around the Internet for almost as long as the
Internet has been around. As the former publisher of Internet World
magazine, the organizer of Internet trade shows and the creator of
the online magazine Iworld, he is no stranger to the arenas of
publishing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked into the vortex of barter transactions for
Internet advertising, Meckler said he saw a sort of black hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company would possibly take barter for something they could
sell, unless they were getting something back that is worth more,''
he said. ``What's more, advertising on the Internet has no shelf
life _ and if it has no shelf life, it has no value that should be
recognized as revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Internet.com engages in some ``immaterial'' amounts of
barter, it does not record any revenues or expenses for those
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Most barter transactions are recorded as even exchanges, meaning
that equal dollar amounts of revenue and expense are recorded.
Thus, the transactions do not affect a company's bottom line, its
cash flow or taxes. But companies that recognize barter
transactions generally say they are valid because they both give
and receive something of value.
</P>
<P>
   Barter helps young companies, because it gets a company's name
and brand in front of more people without expending any cash.
Salon.com, the online magazine, said that barter rose to 16 percent
of revenues in the year ended March 31, up from 7 percent the
previous year and zero percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salon believes that these barter transactions have been
important to the establishment of the Salon brand and expects to
continue to engage in these transactions in the future,'' the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all companies appear at ease with the recognition of barter
revenues, though. In Sportsline's case, CBS, its largest
shareholder, gets royalties of 15 percent of revenue _ calculated
by excluding any revenue received in the form of barter.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wahl, a Sportsline spokesman, declined to discuss why
barter accounts for so much of the company's revenue. ``We don't
disclose anything additional with regard to barter, even our
rationale, beyond what's in our financials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a company that barters advertising records two
transactions of equal value. For the advertising space on its own
site that it gives away, a company records a given dollar amount of
``expenses.'' At the same time, it records an equal amount of
``revenues,'' representing the value of the ad space on another
company's Web site that it received in exchange.
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some companies report that barter is quite important to their
financial health. Ivillage, the Web site dedicated to women's news
and information, said in its SEC filings it ``is dependent on
barter transactions which do not generate cash revenue,'' but which
still accounted for 20 percent of 1998 revenue and 12 percent of
the $14.6 million in revenue it posted in the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Stell, a spokesman for Ivillage, said that because the
company breaks out the amount of its barter transactions, ``people
can take that into account when they do their models'' to value the
company.
</P>
<P>
   For many Internet companies, preserving precious cash is nearly
as important as getting their brand name in front of Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Internet companies don't have the resources to purchase
content or advertising and promotion,'' said Debbie A. Simon, a
vice president at Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, a Los Angeles
investment banking firm, who specializes in Internet transactions.
``So we definitely are seeing an increasing trend toward barter
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   A liberal use of barter can work against companies as well, said
Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the Internet Advertising Bureau. ``If
you're willing to barter, it's hard to sell ads at the full rate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Petrusky, director of the new-media group at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that though barter has doubled as a
percentage of total Internet ad spending in the last three years,
he believed it would fall back to about 5 percent, as larger
companies come to dominate the industry's ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are not so sure. Marissa Gluck, an advertising
analyst for Jupiter Communications, thinks barter accounts for a
far larger percentage of online advertising _ at least 15 percent,
or up to three times the trade group's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a significant chunk of revenues out there that are
probably barter, where it looks like money is changing hands,'' Ms.
Gluck said, but where in fact two companies simply buy equal
amounts of advertising on each other's Web site. ``It's a somewhat
insidious practice that is hard to track.''

MILD INFLATION REPORT LEAVES QUESTIONS ABOUT FUTURE FED POLICY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in September, the
biggest monthly increase since April, the Labor Department reported
on Tuesday. But only petroleum prices exerted any lasting
inflationary pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fully expected and essentially mild inflation report
seemed to stoke rather than settle a debate over what the Federal
Reserve should do next: raise interest rates to pre-emptively
stifle inflation or leave rates alone and avoid the risk of slowing
the economy unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   The representatives of the stock and bond markets _ mainly Wall
Street's economists and forecasters _ are pushing for a rate
increase, preferably at the Fed's next policy meeting, on Nov. 16,
and then perhaps a signal from the Fed that no more increases are
in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Fed is in a tightening mode, the markets are always
looking for a signal that the tightening is over, and right now
they don't have that signal,'' said Joshua Fineman, chief economist
for Deutsche Asset Management, referring to the Fed's announced
stance in favor of raising rates, if any action is taken at all.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the opposite tack, two powerful representatives of the
companies that make and sell the nation's goods and services _ the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of
Manufacturers _ urged the Fed to leave rates alone. They insist
that inflation is nowhere on the horizon and higher rates will slow
the economy unnecessarily, hurting business _ just when the economy
may be slowing on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rate increases at this juncture might be a situation of piling
on too much downward pressure,'' said Martin Regalia, chief
economist for the Chamber of Commerce. He noted, for example, that
retail sales had eased off in September, as did housing starts.
They fell by 3.2 percent, to 1.618 million, the Commerce Department
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides agreed on one point: that inflation, as measured
by the latest CPI report, is not accelerating. The CPI has risen by
2.6 percent over the last 12 months, slightly faster than last
spring. But when food and energy are removed, the so-called core
inflation rate rose 0.3 percent in September and 2 percent over the
last year _ down slightly from last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our way of thinking, there has not been any clear upside
breakout in underlying inflation,'' said John Youngdahl, a senior
money market economist at Goldman, Sachs. ``But that said, the big
issue for the markets is whether we are at an inflection point, at
which labor costs or prices or both will begin to rise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Investors, pleased at first by the mild inflation report, pushed
up the Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday by more than 200
points in early trading but then let prices fall, and the Dow
average closed up 88.65 points, at 10,204.93. Bond traders, in a
similar reaction, drove down interest rates and then let them rise
as the concern about inflation reasserted itself _ and with it, the
pressure from Wall Street for an interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are starting to perceive that the Fed could be
falling slightly behind the curve and to catch up should raise
rates at the November meeting,'' said David M. Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., a bond trading house.
</P>
<P>
   The excitement level on Wall Street rose considerably last
Friday when the Labor Department announced a 1.1 percent jump in
the Producer Price Index for September. Those are the prices that
manufacturers charge for their finished products. But the producer
price jump failed to carry through to the much broader CPI, which
measures what the public pays not only for goods but also for
services.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the September increase in the CPI came from a
rise in cigarette prices (20 percent of the total increase), hotel
room rates (13 percent), apparel (14 percent) and petroleum
products (20 percent), the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor
Statistics said.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette prices jumped in response to a recent increase imposed
by the manufacturers. Apparel prices jumped 1.2 percent, apparently
reflecting the introduction of winter clothing. And hotel room
rates rose sharply in September because the bureau has not yet
adjusted its formulas to a change in the way hotels price their
rooms from season to season.
</P>
<P>
   None of those prices are likely to post similar increases this
month, said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist in the bureau
division that calculates the CPI. And there are no signs yet of
inflationary pressures in other key categories that turned in mild
performances in September.
</P>
<P>
   Home prices, for example, are rising smartly in many parts of
the country, but in the bureau's eyes, the purchase of a home is an
investment, not a cost of living. What the CPI calculates is the
``consumption cost'' of operating a home from month to month. That
monthly consumption cost was up only 2.5 percent over the last
year, including less than 0.3 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
   Medical care costs continued their unexpectedly mild rise _ 0.3
percent in September and 3.4 percent over the last 12 months. And
new vehicle prices, up sharply in September at the producer price
level, rose only 0.2 percent in the show rooms, mainly because of
differences in the ways factory and retail prices are calculated
for new models. Over the last 12 months, vehicle prices at the
producer and consumer levels paralleled each other, Jackman said,
and they are both down 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Petroleum prices are another matter. As long as the main
oil-producing nations continue to restrict their output, gasoline
and heating oil prices are likely to continue rising, analysts say.
In time, there should be secondary effects, pushing up airline
fares, for example, or food and apparel costs once truck shipping
rates rise in response to higher fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``These secondary effects have not shown up yet, or they may be
muted by other factors,'' Jackman said. ``Airline fares, for
example, fell in September. One of the arguments in airline fares
is that the airlines have more flights and more seats available and
they have to fill those seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Excess capacity in many industries appears to play a role in
holding down prices. The percentage of industrial capacity needed
to meet demand, for example, fell in September to the low rate of
80.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets expect a rate increase from the Fed,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, ``but the fact that
the inflation data remain benign gives them encouragement that
there won't be a series of tightenings.''

STUDENTS ANNOUNCE FORMATION OF GROUP TO MONITOR OVERSEAS APPAREL
FACTORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Pa., N.C., Ind., Wis., N.Y.)  (Duplication warning: story has also moved in `a' news file)

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their latest effort to fight sweatshops, students
from more than 100 colleges on Tuesday called upon their
institutions to join a new student-created group that would set a
strict code of conduct for overseas factories that make apparel
bearing university names.
</P>
<P>
   The students, from Columbia, Duke, Notre Dame, Wisconsin and
other institutions, said the group they were creating, the Worker
Rights Consortium, would alleviate sweatshop conditions by
inspecting apparel factories worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The students also urged their universities to withdraw from a
group backed by the White House, the Fair Labor Association, which
human rights groups and apparel companies, including Nike and Liz
Claiborne, set up to inspect factories to make sure they were not
sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, in Manhattan, members of United
Students Against Sweatshops, a nationwide student coalition, said
the Fair Labor Association would not go far enough to improve
factory conditions because companies would pick the inspectors of
their factories and because the group did not require that workers
be paid a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fair Labor Association will serve to cover up abuses,''
said Maria Roeper, a senior at Haverford College. ``Companies like
Nike will choose the monitors that monitor their factories, will
choose which factories will be monitored and will tell their
factories ahead of time they will be receiving a knock at the door.
That doesn't really monitor anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization created by students would call for a living
wage and require that manufacturers disclose the names and
addresses of their factories to make it easier for church and labor
groups to monitor working conditions. The students said their group
would carry out unannounced spot inspections of factories where
workers had complained of poor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   University officials praised the students for their efforts. But
several officials, and members of the Fair Labor Association,
questioned whether the student-created group would have the
financial resources to monitor factories in more than a dozen
countries, where manufacturers like Champion, Nike and Reebok
produce $2.5 billion worth of goods each year bearing the names of
hundreds of colleges. The students' consortium would be financed
from 1 percent of the commissions that licensees paid colleges for
using their logos.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Posner, a member of the Fair Labor Association and
executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights,
praised the students' effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I welcome any new initiative that broadens the base of
information and monitoring of factories,'' he said, adding, ``To my
view, this is complimentary to, not a substitute to, the Fair Labor
Association.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``This is a big industry, and there needs to be a
comprehensive system that looks at the industry across the board,
and that's the Fair Labor Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown University president E. Gordon Gee announced Tuesday that
Brown would join the Worker Rights Consortium, while remaining in
the Fair Labor Association, to which 120 other colleges and
universities belong. But Gee said Brown might choose between the
two groups, weighing which was doing more to cooperate with the
other and to protect workers' rights.

<P>
   The All-Star Game, Ryder Cup, ALCS between the Red Sox and
Yankees . . .
</P>
<P>
   And now the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   What did we do to deserve all this in a single summer/fall?
Boston sports fans truly are the luckiest people in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Fall Classic between the Red Sox and the Braves opens
Saturday in Atlanta. Next Tuesday, Olde Fenway plays host to its
first World Series game since Bruce Hurst beat the Mets in Game 5
in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox-Braves. The hardball gods decided to finish the century
with a classic matchup between American and National League charter
franchises who stared at one another from oppostite ends of
Commonwealth Ave. for more than four decades.
</P>
<P>
   We thought Red Sox-Yankees was good. We thought Sox-Mets was a
classic. But what could be better than Sox-Braves?
</P>
<P>
   It's Ted Williams vs. Ted Turner, apple trees vs. peach trees,
Aerosmith vs. R.E.M., and the Jean Yawkey Trust against the Jane
Fonda Trust Fund. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino and Atlanta Mayor
Billy Campbell have already made the traditional cornball bet.
Menino put up some chowder and lobsters against Campbell's grits
and pecan pie.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Spahn, who pitched for the Boston Braves, and Hank Aaron
will throw out the ceremonial first pitches this weekend in Atlanta
(plenty of good seats still available at Turner Field). Teddy
Ballgame gets the nod at Fenway in Game 3 Tuesday. Julia Ruth
Stevens comes back to Fenway for Game 4. Her dad started his big
league career with the Red Sox and finished with the Braves. In
between Boston stints, the Babe spent a few forgettable years in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In an astounding gesture of goodwill, Major League Baseball and
players from both teams have pledged to donate all World Series
proceeds to the Jimmy Fund. The Jimmy Fund was started by the
Braves in 1948 and became the official charity of the Red Sox when
the Braves left town in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, Boston almost had its own Subway Series. The Braves won
the National League and the Sox finished tied for first with
Cleveland. Boston lost a one-game playoff and the Tribe smoked the
Braves in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves represented Boston from 1871-1952 and also were known
as the Red Stockings, Red Caps, Doves, Beaneaters, Rustlers, and
Bees before finally becoming the Braves. They won 10 National
League pennants (eight in the 19th century) and one World Series in
1914. The Braves played on Sundays before the Red Sox. They also
had night games and televised games before the Sox. Old New England
baseball fans remember the Knothole Gang and the Jury Box at Braves
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlborough-based Boston Braves Historical Association (452
members) is attending the games in Atlanta this weekend. The
Glavine family of Billerica, Mass., has chartered an aircraft and
is scheduled to fly out of Hanscom Field this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be Billerica's Tommy against Boston's Pedro in Game 1.
Then comes Ramon Martinez against Kevin Millwood. The Sox aren't
sure about their starters in Boston next week. Borrowing from the
``Spahn and Sain and a day of rain'' mantra of the old Braves, Sox
manager Jimy Williams is going with ``Martinez and Martinez and two
days of pain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the Dean brothers won all four games against the Detroit
Tigers in the 1934 Series,'' said Jimy. ``Why can't Pedro and Ramon
do the same thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Braves makes this a homecoming for Jimy. He won't
need that Cheatin' Cleveland camera to figure out what the Braves
are doing. Jimy served as Atlanta's third base coach for six
seasons and got a World Series championship ring in 1995. The Sox
also have lefty Kent Mercker, who spent seven seasons in Atlanta.
Steve Avery, another lefty who pitched for the Braves and Red Sox,
said he'd like to make the ceremonial first-ball toss if there's a
fifth game in Boston. Avery named his new ranch after Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston University marching band will perform at all Fenway
World Series games. When BU still had football, the band played at
Nickerson Field, which used to be Braves Field. A section of old
Braves Field still honors the site of the Sibby Sisti Braves of
1952.
</P>
<P>
   Fenway is in good shape for the Fall Classic. Ted Turner and
Jane Fonda will take the box seats next to the visitors dugout and
there will be a pregame wrestling match between Wally the Green
Monster and Chief Nocahoma. Sox fans promise not to spill beer on
any wayward Braves fans caught doing the moronic tomahawk chop in
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   You thought the Sox-Indians series was good? You liked the Red
Sox-Yankees war to end all wars? Just wait until the Sox and Braves
go at it this weekend in the final World Series of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sign, don't you think? Red Sox-Braves.
</P>
<P>
   This must be the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Teddy Kollek, the former mayor of Jerusalem, is now
88 years old, but every Thursday he still goes to his office at the
Israel Museum. He founded the museum on a stony hilltop in 1965,
and it remains one of his pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   On my way into his office, his secretary warned me that he was
in a crabby mood. But sitting at his desk, chomping on a cigar and
barking orders, Kollek was the image of octogenarian contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that a new country needed a new art museum,'' Kollek
said, recalling the museum's chaotic origins. Before he even had a
building, he went around asking every art collector he knew if they
had a masterpiece or two to spare.
</P>
<P>
   His first gift came from the family of Baron Edmond de
Rothschild of London, who offered one Gauguin, one Cezanne and two
van Goghs. Kollek was pleased. As he says, ``The moment you have
received four paintings like that, you can't accept schmutz
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   It is never easy building a major art museum from scratch, and
Kollek has good reason to crow. In less than four decades, he has
seen the Israel Museum evolve from an improbable fantasy into a
world-class institution whose collection now consists of some
500,000 objects _ roughly five times that of the National Gallery
of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Privately run, the museum is kept alive in large part by
American art collectors with Zionist sympathies; it seems almost
disproportionately big for such a small country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even success stories can raise lingering questions, and in
the case of the Israel Museum, the question is this: Has the museum
been overly shaped by the taste of American art collectors? In this
city where the biblical past is so insistently alive, one expects
the museum to be something more than a Middle East outpost of the
Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, in an age when museums seem increasingly
homogenized, do we really want to travel all the way to Jerusalem
to see the same Andy Warhol or Donald Judd that we can see at
museums in New York?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. The Israel Museum is a singular, highly quirky
institution that currently seems divided between Judaica and
archeology on one hand and cutting-edge contemporary art on the
other. Call it an amalgam of the very old and the very new, a cross
between ancient Samaria and SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of another museum where a handsewn wedding
dress for a long-ago Jewish bride hangs not far from a Cindy
Sherman photograph that features the artist in a terry-cloth
bathrobe, looking as if she just woke up after an extremely rough
night.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the museum still suffers from an image problem. Most
people think of it as a Jewish museum, a place to see room after
room of polished menorahs, 18th-century Haggadahs and silver Torah
ornaments. They remember it as the home of the Dead Sea Scrolls,
those fabled biblical fragments housed in the Shrine of the Book, a
marvelously eccentric building whose curvy roof looks a bit like a
Hershey's chocolate kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these days the museum seems increasingly Americanized, and
Exhibit A is surely James S. Snyder, the museum's widely admired
director. He arrived in Jerusalem from the Upper West Side of
Manhattan in 1996 and, by his own admission, was not well versed in
Israeli culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been on a trip to Israel, not even a teen tour,''
he said, chuckling. ``And I only spoke bar mitzvah Hebrew.'' A
47-year-old native of Belle Vernon, Pa. (``It's where they grow Big
Ten football stars,'' he said), Snyder studied at Harvard and held
various high-level posts at the Museum of Modern Art before joining
the Israel Museum as its first non-Israeli director.
</P>
<P>
   We were sitting in his office when Kollek came ambling in on his
cane. The two men are a study in contrasts. While Kollek is big and
noisy, Snyder is trim and fastidious. While Kollek is a forceful
visionary who is widely credited with having built modern
Jerusalem, Snyder is known as a crackerjack administrator. When
Kollek flicked some cigar ashes in an ashtray, Snyder looked
horrified and ran to empty it.
</P>
<P>
   They speak about each other with surprising frankness. Asked to
describe Snyder's strengths, Kollek said, ``Americans are good at
PR and box office.'' Snyder gave him a look.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Kollek has an eye for art, Snyder replied: ``No. What
Teddy has is an eye for people, especially people who have art to
give away.'' This time it was Kollek's turn to give Snyder a look.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Peretz, the editor in chief of The New Republic and a
longtime supporter of the museum, said later by telephone: ``There
was a lot of skepticism when Jim came, because he doesn't know
Hebrew, but he has professionalized the museum. Part of Teddy's
greatness is that he doesn't know about art. He brought so much
classical music to Israel, but I can't remember seeing him at a
classical music concert where he wasn't asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, they are a perfect team, with Kollek dreaming up plans
and Snyder getting them done. Of course, it helps to have the
support of America's leading art collectors. The long list of
donors in the latest issue of the Israel Museum Journal includes
many familiar names: Ronald Perelman, Eli Broad, Barbara Schwartz,
Ronald Lauder, Saul Steinberg, Maureen and Marshall Cogan, Judy and
Michael Steinhardt, and so on. Should we worry that the Israel
Museum is draining donations from museums in New York?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Snyder insists not: ``The philosophy that built the museum was,
`Just give us one painting, as opposed to your whole collection.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, recent donations have far exceeded the museum's
cutely humble, give-us-one expectations. Arturo Schwarz, a poet and
art dealer from Milan, last year gave the museum his unparalleled
collection of 700 Dada and Surrealist works. It includes 30 pieces
by Marcel Duchamp, among them ``Tzanck Check,'' an enlarged check
for $115 that the artist made out to his dentist, Daniel Tzanck, as
payment for his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Kollek and Snyder do agree on one thing: they want the
museum to be the Louvre of Israel, a premier, encyclopedic
institution. ``We are not a Jewish museum,'' Snyder said with a
note of insistence. ``We are a secular museum. We don't have
Holocaust art here.'' Kollek added, ``Only one great artist died in
the Holocaust: Felix Nussbaum.''
</P>
<P>
   In the three years since Snyder's arrival, the museum has
expanded in every which direction. Its endowment has more than
doubled, from $25 million to $62 million. And thanks to a $42
million gift from the New York financier Martin Gruss in memory of
his parents, Caroline and Joseph Gruss, the museum is now building
an entrance pavilion designed by the American architect James Ingo
Freed. It probably ranks as the most ambitious gateway since I.M.
Pei, Freed's partner, designed the Grand Pyramid for the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the museum still has a way to go before it
collections can be deemed complete. Consider what might be called
the Pissarro curse. Of all the major French Impressionists, Camille
Pissarro was the only one who was Jewish; as a result, collectors
keep giving the museum more Pissarros. They think the museum wants
Pissarros, when really what it would love is a painting by Edouard
Manet.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the museum has eight Pissarros and not one Manet,
although Manet was far more central to the development of
Impressionism.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Israel Museum is not the Louvre, but what it lacks in
comprehensiveness it makes up for in personality. One advantage of
its relative youth is that it occupies an architecturally youthful
site: a 20-acre campus with six buildings done in a chaste Bauhaus
style.
</P>
<P>
   And you couldn't ask for more dramatic scenery. The museum sits
at the crest of a hill opposite the Knesset; to reach the main
building you ascend a steep path. There are olive trees and orange
trees and, when you look out, the pink-hued stones of Jerusalem
shimmer below. It feels less like a museum than a pilgrimage site.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the experience is as much outdoor as indoor. Or so
it seems in the Billy Rose Art Garden, a six-acre sculpture park
designed by Isamu Noguchi. It's an inspired place. Here, among
other things, is a superb installation by the California artist
James Turrell. His ``Space That Sees,'' of 1992, is a stone shrine
with a vast rectangle cut out of the ceiling. You walk in and sit
down on a bench that wraps around the room. You look up and see a
bright rectangle of open sky. Time passes. Suddenly you realize
that the sky is the ultimate Minimalist masterpiece: it weighs
nothing and has no substance but somehow glows with more blue than
you find in a Matisse. Nifty.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the origins of the sculpture garden, Kollek snapped:
``It's not a sculpture garden. It's an art garden.'' He explained
that when the museum was founded, ultra-Orthodox Jews balked at the
prospect of a sculpture garden, with all that it implies about the
heathen worship of idols.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we changed the name to art garden in order to avoid a
controversy,'' Kollek said. ``In Israel, everything becomes
political.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he added in a confidential tone: ``You know, my father
used to take me to the museum in Vienna every Saturday when I was
young. I do have an eye for art.''

SENATE FILIBUSTER KILLS CAMPAIGN-FINANCE LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A 20-year effort to revamp the nation's
campaign-finance system failed again Tuesday as a Republican-led
filibuster thwarted a majority in the Senate from advancing the
landmark initiative.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of election watchdog groups, the legislation's
defeat cleared the way for the national political parties to raise
and spend hundreds of millions of dollars in largely unregulated,
special-interest contributions in the 2000 campaigns. The same type
of ``soft money'' donations were at the heart of numerous
corruption charges stemming from the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   In back-to-back roll calls, the Senate foes of soft money fell
short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster on two measures
that would have altered the way US elections are financed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and leaders of the movement to change the
system, including Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, vowed
to press on. Senate Democrats immediately began a parliamentary
effort to force definitive votes on the soft-money ban and a more
comprehensive overhaul plan, while Republicans were poised to block
the effort on a party-line vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The failure of the Senate to adopt real reform is a victory
for the politics of cynicism, and it leaves unchecked the influence
of moneyed special interests,'' Clinton said. ``The people of this
country want reform, and the Senate cannot stand in their way
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, who controls Senate
procedures and opposes changing campaign-finance laws, predicted in
a news conference that the effort to alter the system before the
2000 elections was destined to fail. ``It's dead for the year,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The filibuster's leader, Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell,
defended his parliamentary tactics as a battle to preserve the
democratic process. Citing court rulings that have equated free
speech with the freedom to donate money to political causes,
McConnell praised his Republican colleagues ``who resisted the
temptation to support a measure that would have quieted the voices
of American citizens and destroyed the effectiveness of our
national political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, the chief fund-raiser for Senate Republicans, noted
that an effort to end a similar filibuster last year also fell
eight votes short. And he asserted there ``is no momentum
whatsoever for this kind of measure that seeks to put the
government in charge of what people say and when they may say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, McCain, who was the chief Republican sponsor of the bill,
said he will ``persevere'' and will try to attach the proposed ban
to other legislation before Congress adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   In killing the initiative for the fourth straight year, the
Senate voted, 53-47, to cut off the GOP-led filibuster on the
proposed soft-money ban, seven votes short of the 60 necessary. An
attempt to short-circuit a filibuster on a more comprehensive
overhaul plan failed, 52-48, eight votes short.
</P>
<P>
   The House had passed the broader measure, which also would have
banned soft money, 252-177, and Clinton had vowed to sign the bill
into law in time to change the rules for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The votes marked the 20th time since 1987 that GOP leaders have
killed campaign-finance changes by filibuster, a tactic they have
used since 1979 to block efforts to overhaul the system.
</P>
<P>
   The ``bill was again blocked by the pre-Halloween trick-or-treat
parliamentary maneuverings of reform opponents,'' said Scott
Harshbarger, the president of Commmon Cause and former
Massachusetts attorney general, who saw promise for the movement
despite the setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a farce,'' Senator John F. Kerry said on the Senate floor
of the filibuster tactics. ``What a joke to pretend somehow that
the US Senate has done anything serious on campaign finance
reform,'' said Kerry, a supporter of revamping the system.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy called it ``a disgrace that the
Republican leadership is resorting to a filibuster to maintain the
corrosive power of special-interest money and block this needed
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining all 45 Senate Democrats in supporting the proposed ban
on soft money were eight Republicans, including Senators Olympia J.
Snowe and Susan M. Collins of Maine, and James M. Jeffords of
Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Voting with every Senate Democrat on the more comprehensive
proposal were seven Republicans, including Snowe, Collins,
Jeffords, and Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. The broader
bill also would have restricted ``issue ads'' financed by soft
money and run by independent groups that are not required to
disclose the source of their funds.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the soft-money ban argued they had made progress
by picking up three more GOP backers: Senators William V. Roth Jr.
of Delaware, Sam Brownback of Kansas, and Tim Hutchinson of
Arkansas. But two other Republicans who have previously supported
campaign-finance legislation _ Chafee and Senator Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania _ opposed the soft-money ban in favor of the more
sweeping alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Although the net gain was a single vote, the measure's chief
sponsors _ McCain and Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin
Democrat _ said they will continue to try to reduce the influence
of special-interest money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what parliamentary tactics are used to prevent
reform, no matter how fierce the opposition, no matter how
personal, no matter how cycnical this debate remains, the senator
from Wisconsin and I will persevere,'' said McCain, who has made
the issue the cornerstone of his campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas Governor George W. Bush sprints ahead of his rivals in
the presidential fund-raising race, McCain Tuesday picked up an
ally in the GOP field, as Gary Bauer offered partial support for
the soft-money ban. Bauer urged McCain in a letter to beef up
elections laws by requiring unions to obtain permission from their
members before using their dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer's proposal, a popular theme among Republican leaders, is
strongly opposed by Clinton and congressional Democrats.

NEGOTIATIONS WITH WHITE HOUSE ON FINANCIAL OVERHAUL TO CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans and senior officials in the
Clinton administration failed to agree Tuesday on legislation to
overhaul the nation's financial system, and said they would resume
negotiations on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers are nearing completion of a bill that would repeal
more than 60 years of laws that restrict the ability of banks,
insurance companies and securities firms to expand into each
other's industries.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, the differences between the White House and
the Republicans have substantially narrowed, raising the prospects
for legislation that Congress has tried unsuccessfully to adopt for
more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Tuesday that the
administration was satisfied with the law's provisions on consumer
privacy. Consumer and privacy groups said, however, that the
measure would do little to protect customers from having their
confidential information disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the progress in resolving most differences over the
legislation, strong disagreements remain between Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, who heads the Senate Banking Committee, and President
Clinton, over the measure's treatment of the Community Reinvestment
Act, a 1977 law aimed at eradicating discrimination in lending.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has stood strongly behind civil rights groups and the
Congressional Black Caucus, which was a crucial ally in the
presidential impeachment proceedings. The president's top aides
have denounced provisions of the legislation that they contend
would make damaging changes to the Community Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has maintained that the act is unduly burdensome on small
institutions and that the changes he has suggested would not
undermine it.
</P>
<P>
   These are the Community Reinvestment Act issues in dispute:
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether a new kind of financial business known as wholesale
financial institutions _ and nicknamed woofies _ must meet the
requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act. The new
institutions take deposits of more than $100,000 and are not
subject to many of the regulations that affect traditional banks.
The legislation produced by the conference committee would
authorize companies to set up woofies but would exempt them from
the act. That has raised concerns that woofies would create large
new loopholes, allowing traditional institutions to avoid
compliance with the act.
</P>

   _ Whether community groups, which often make deals with banks
about their community lending practices, must make such

   In talks at the Capitol Tuesday, Gramm, Treasury Secretary

adviser, failed to resolve the differences.

<P>
   In recent days Sperling has met regularly with the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, who has been critical of the banking legislation. Jackson
contends that the legislation fails to provide adequate protection
for minorities and others who have been historically denied access
to credit.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists from the financial services industry said they
expected that a deal could ultimately be reached. Nonetheless, they
were concerned that differences remained between the White House
and Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating because we're very very close and have not
gotten the ball over the finish line,'' said Tom Block, a senior
vice president in charge of federal relations for Chase Manhattan
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come so close and solved so many of the issues,'' he
added. ``We can't be this close and not solve the problem, but
crazier things have happened. It is a highly charged political
issue that is hard for some to negotiate on. CRA should be
resolvable. The banks have learned to live with CRA.''

BRADLEY AGREES TO 7 APPEARANCES WITH GORE; GORE WANTS MORE,
SOONER  
(DW)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after Vice President Al Gore personally
challenged him to a series of debates, former Sen. Bill Bradley
said Tuesday that he had agreed to participate in at least seven
joint appearances with Gore before the New Hampshire primary, the
nation's first.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign said that the vice president has agreed to six
of those events, and that they were trying to find a better date
for the seventh. The two men are the lone contestants for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokeswoman for Gore's campaign criticized Bradley for
accepting only a few of the dozens of invitations she said the two
men have been offered, and for refusing to debate earlier. They are
scheduled to appear together at a town hall meeting in New
Hampshire next Wednesday, and then not again until Dec. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both campaigns have been offered more than 40 debates and
forum opportunities, many beginning immediately,'' said Kiki Moore,
Gore's campaign press secretary. ``The fact the senator can't find
even one acceptable debate in the next two months is an insult to
the voters of New Hampshire and Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has stepped up his calls for debates in recent weeks as
Bradley has pulled even with him in New Hampshire and New York,
according to a number of polls. At a major speech before Iowa
Democrats on Oct. 10, Gore forcefully challenged Bradley to weekly
debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about it?'' Gore said, fairly taunting Bradley, who sat
in the audience. ``Let's have a debate on agriculture in Iowa right
now. What about it, Bill? If the answer is yes, stand up and wave
your hand.'' Bradley did not wave his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley's aides say they are determined to keep their
campaign operating on its own schedule, which over the next few
weeks calls for him to lay out his policies on a few major issues
and to meet with small groups of voters in intimate settings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to next week's town hall, the two campaigns said
they had agreed to the following joint appearances: a town hall
meeting in Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 17; a debate in Manchester in
early January; a debate in Iowa on Jan. 8; a forum in Des Moines on
Jan. 17; and a debate in Manchester on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Both camps have said they are willing to go on NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' together, but they have been unable to agree on a date.

 By ALISON MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the fourth year in a row, Senate Republicans on
Tuesday blocked final votes on legislation to overhaul the campaign
finance system. The Senate majority leader declared the issue
''dead for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader from Mississipi, indicated
that he planned to pull the bill off the Senate floor after
supporters of changing the campaign finance law mustered a majority
in two test votes, but fell short of the 60 votes needed to
overcome a Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   All 45 Senate Democrats supported both efforts to break the
filibuster, joined by a shifting group of up to eight Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate kept the battle against special-interest money
alive as an issue for the presidential campaign season and also
virtually assured that unlimited and unregulated donations to
political parties will continue to flow into the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that at least $525 million in such donations
will be contributed to the six major political party committees by
November 2000. That is more than double the $262 million of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who has put his crusade to change the
campaign finance law at the center of his bid for the Republican
presidential nomination, blamed both parties for this year's
impasse. He vowed that he and his co-sponsor, Sen. Russell
Feingold, D-Wis., would fight on.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what parliamentary tactics are used to prevent
reform,'' he said, ``no matter how fierce the opposition, no matter
how personal, no matter how cynical this debate remains, the
senator from Wisconsin and I will persevere.'' McCain said he and
Feingold might attempt to add their bill as an amendment to other
legislation in the next few weeks as Congress tries to wrap up its
business for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opportunity exists for an up or down vote for taking
the $100,000 check out of politics, we will do so,'' he said. The
campaign finance overhaul bill would ban so-called ``soft money,''
the unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties, as
opposed to specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But only 53 senators voted to cut off a filibuster against the
soft money ban _ almost the same number as last year. ``I'd call it
no progress whatsoever,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who led
the opposition. ``I'd call it pretty, pretty dead.'' Lott flatly
told reporters, ``It's dead for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the debate over the campaign finance law began
last week, McCain and Feingold admitted that their effort was a
long shot. In the Senate, it is often not enough for a bill to
garner a majority vote. If an opponent mounts a filibuster to block
legislation, it takes 60 votes to cut off the debate and bring the
bill to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans led by McConnell have used filibusters to block more
comprehensive versions of the McCain-Feingold legislation every
year since 1996, arguing that the bill amounts to an
unconstitutional infringement on free speech. It is also the case
that Republicans traditionally raise more soft money than
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Even the controversy surrounding the 1996 election failed to
propel the measure forward. Campaign finance was put front and
center as an issue after the Democrats returned several million
dollars in donations because of questions about whether they were
legal, and when it was revealed that President Clinton rewarded
fund-raisers with stays in the White House Lincoln bedroom and big
donors with White House coffee sessions.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in an attempt to change the dynamics of the issue,
McCain and Feingold scaled back their legislation so that it was
essentially just a soft money ban. They eliminated provisions that
would have regulated issue advocacy ads, which are often thinly
disguised campaign commercials attacking or promoting candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The more comprehensive version of their bill passed the House
last month, 252-177.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said they hoped to pick up more votes by focusing
only on soft money and then allowing senators to amend their bill
on the floor. On Tuesday, the Democrats assured that a pair of test
votes would come on two amendments. One, like the underlying bill,
would have banned soft money donations. The other would have
replaced the McCain-Feingold bill with the original more
comprehensive legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But by a vote of 53-47, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes
needed to break a filibuster against the soft money ban. And it
also fell short, 52 to 48, against the filibuster on the more
comprehensive bill.
</P>
<P>
   Three new Republican senators supported the soft money ban _ Sam
Brownback of Kansas, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and William Roth of
Delaware. But two previous Republican supporters voted against the
overhaul proposal: John Chafee of Rhode Island Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania. Their aides said they thought the measure had become
too narrow. In all, eight Republicans voted with the Democrats
against the filibuster on soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had committed to five days of debate on the issue,
Lott then announced he was ending the campaign finance debate and
moving the Senate on to legislation to ban a particular form of
abortion. His move drew protests from Democrats and from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question about whether or not we're going to keep
our word,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South
Dakota, ``whether or not we will have the opportunity to finish the
debate on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the afternoon and into the evening Democrats took to the
floor to demand that the campaign finance debate continue. But
senators from both parties said they expected Lott to prevail
Wednesday morning in shifting the Senate to the abortion debate.

NOTING THAT GOOD CITIZENSHIP IS A VIRTUE, BISHOPS URGE CATHOLICS TO
VOTE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J.)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling the election year 2000 both a ``great spiritual
milestone'' and an ``important civic challenge,'' the nation's
Roman Catholic bishops are to issue a statement Wednesday saying
participation in the political process is a moral obligation for
Catholics and asking them to reflect on how politics can be used to
advance church principles like stopping abortion, helping poor
children, protecting immigrants' rights and providing families
affordable housing.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, ``Faithful Citizenship: Civic Responsibility for
a New Millennium,'' is directed at America's 61 million baptized
Catholics. They are the country's largest single religious group;
once strongly Democratic, they are now far more politically
divided.
</P>
<P>
   The document, which the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
will send to all 19,000 American parishes in January, is carefully
nonpartisan in tone. It explicitly disavows any intention by the
bishops to try to create ``a religious voting block'' _ an effort
that would most likely be doomed from the outset anyway, given how
socially and ethnically diverse the American Catholic population
has become.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its central point _ that major church teachings should be
considered in the voting booth _ may carry important weight among
churchgoing Catholics with no firm commitment to either Democrats
or Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Catholic tradition,'' the statement says, ``responsible
citizenship is a virtue; participation in the political process is
a moral obligation.'' It also says Catholics ought to measure
candidates and political platforms by ``whether they enhance or
diminish human life, dignity and human rights; and how they advance
the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, N.J., chairman of
the bishops' International Policy Committee, who had a major hand
in developing the document, said in a telephone interview Tuesday
that the bishops viewed it as a way to convey the practical
implications of the church's social teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to speak to the questions that are around
today,'' McCarrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops have a tradition, dating from 1975, of issuing
statements on Catholics' civic responsibility in the autumn before
a presidential election year. But the new document differs from its
predecessors in that it is more plainly written and, at 17 pages,
considerably shorter, and in that it urges Catholics to steer clear
of political cynicism _ an implicit recognition of how politics has
been roiled by President Clinton's impeachment, and of the bishops'
disappointment over the failure of recent efforts to enact
legislation curbing a late-term abortion procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it seems few candidates and no party fully reflect
our values,'' the statement says. ``But now is not a time for
retreat. The new millennium should be an opportunity for renewed
participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement places the church's teachings against abortion and
physician-assisted suicide at the top of a list of concerns that
also include protection of the environment and workers' rights.
Unlike its predecessors, the statement gives a high profile as well
to certain other issues, like opposition to the death penalty and
support for efforts to relieve poor nations of their foreign debt,
that have drawn particular attention from Pope John Paul II and the
bishops this year.
</P>
<P>
   Once a fairly reliable Democratic constituency, Catholics have
become a far more difficult group to categorize politically since
the 1960s, populating as they do all economic classes and including
a large and growing number of immigrants from Asia, Africa and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Within this diverse population, however, the group that
political scientists describe as white, non-Hispanic moderates _
about one-third of all Catholics, and 7 percent to 8 percent of the
electorate _ may be most moved by the bishops' statement. In its
politics, this group is ``genuinely ambivalent'' with regard to
party affiliation, said Professor John Green, director of the Ray
C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Green said surveys showed that moderate Catholics had been
politically mobile during the last five years. A majority voted
Republican in 1994, helping that party capture control of Congress.
But they split their ballots in 1996, supporting both Clinton and
congressional Republicans, and last year they sided largely with
the Democrats, helping the minority to pick up House seats.

BRUINS REGROUP FOR KINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ The Bruins worked out here Tuesday, then
left the perfect sunshine for even more sun in Los Angeles, where
they will open the new Staples Center in a game against the Kings
Wednesday night. As nice as the climate has been, Boston's season
thus far (0-5-3) has been one giant black cloud, but as Don Sweeney
pointed out, the sun did come up.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings are over, for now. The Bruins are hoping to stop
talking about their slide and put an end to it. By discussing what
was wrong, Sweeney said, the players were attempting to help each
other through it rather than assigning blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no finger-pointing,'' said the veteran defenseman.
``We're a pretty young team that's been together for a while so I
think it does help to sort through things. If anybody does have an
issue or feels uncomfortable with what they're going through or how
they feel, they can sit there and say, `I don't feel like I'm
playing very well, what does somebody else see?' I think the main
thing was passion, that intensity, that
going-through-the-wall-no-matter-what attitude, has to be brought
out in everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The slump has been magnified because it comes at the start of
the season; it's the Bruins' worst start in 35 years, in fact. Many
around the team believe that if this happened in late January,
there wouldn't be as much scrutiny. However, the consensus opinion
in preseason was that it will take 90 points to make the playoffs.
If that's the case, the Bruins are going to have to turn things
around quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have some younger guys who are in some key roles
and situations on this club but I think they all want to be there
and I think they all want to grab the ball and run with it,'' said
Sweeney. ``Maybe they're a little reluctant to do it but we need
everybody to do it. We need everybody, we have a big team, we have
a fast team, but we need to have all those ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes that because Byron Dafoe is unsigned, Dmitri
Khristich is not here, and Tim Taylor is gone, all that might have
been a distraction earlier, but there's no excuse now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This business is about winning,'' said Sweeney. ``Everybody
can talk about distractions but it really doesn't have an impact on
the fact that we lose games. We haven't won in eight and that's
nothing but us. We played a good game against Dallas and we came
into an opponent's building (in Phoenix) that you know is going to
come hard and we weren't there in the first period. Luckily we were
still in the hockey game and still had a chance to win. That's the
internal problem we have, we're not doing what we need to be doing,
all 20 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The mental errors the Bruins are making, the myriad breakdowns,
are coming from a failure to take charge of the situation and
instead letting the situation take charge of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've fallen into a little bit of a trap of waiting and not
just reacting,'' said Sweeney. ``We need to be jumping, we need to
pressure teams and utilize our speed, and the intensity and passion
would keep rolling over. Then it becomes an infectious thing where
everybody is going. Some guys are more skilled than others, some
guys are more physical than others. It all tends to get the ball
rolling when you play with that intensity and that passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran right wing Rob DiMaio, who was a vocal opponent of the
Bruins not re-signing Taylor, thinks the club isn't in need of a
major overhaul. His feeling is that if the players all do what
they're capable of, the wins will start coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about the guys we (lost) who were important
guys,'' said DiMaio, ``but the guys who are here, they're here
because management feels they can do the job and we just have to
show we can do the job. The skills are there, it's just the
determination and those intangible things, they have to be there as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio acknowledged that some teams simply have the wrong
chemistry, but he doesn't believe that's the situation with the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bad chemistry,'' he said. ``What we had, we have to
find again. Once we do that, we'll be all right. Hopefully we'll
get this out of our system and we never have to go through it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio, who has a sore hip, attempted to skate Tuesday but was
on the ice only briefly. He remains questionable for Wednesday
night's game . . . Rob Tallas will be in net against the Kings . .
. Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said there was nothing
in the works with regard to a trade or other personnel changes . .
. Ray Bourque, who required stitches after being struck in the ear
by a puck in practice Monday, was back on the ice Tuesday.

<P>
   Among American teen-agers, just over half believe a murderous
rampage could erupt at their schools, and just under half say they
know someone their age who has tried to commit suicide, according
to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
</P>
<P>
   But in the more immediate reality of their daily lives, fear and
violence have diminished significantly in recent years, teen-agers'
responses indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers reported fewer problems with violence both at school
and in the streets than in 1994, and correspondingly fewer worries:
the percentage who said they feared being victimized dropped from
40 percent in 1994 to 24 percent now. And contrary to perceptions
of big-city dangers, the teen-age sense of safety now differs
little whether respondents are urban or rural dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond issues of violence, the Times/CBS nationwide telephone
poll of 1,038 young people ages 13 to 17 offered a snapshot of what
some call Generation Y, a swath of adolescents so cyber-savvy that
63 percent report using a computer at home _ up from 45 percent in
1994 _ and 42 percent have their own e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Among this contingent coming of age during a long economic boom,
general adolescent suffering seems to be down as well: just 43
percent said they believed it was harder for them to grow up than
their parents, compared with 70 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And despite social critics' widespread laments about parental
permissiveness, almost all the respondents in the poll, which was
conducted Oct. 11-14 and had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points, said they had to tell their parents where they were going
when they left the house.
</P>
<P>
   But signs of trouble abounded, such as in the findings on
suicide. Although the poll did not ask more detailed questions
about suicide, striking demographic differences in its prevalence
emerged. Many more girls knew about attempts than boys: 56 percent
compared with 37. And the numbers were much higher among whites
than blacks: 50 percent of whites compared with 28 percent of
blacks, with Hispanics, at 39 percent, falling in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The broad reach of suicide in general _ 46 percent of teen-agers
over all said they knew someone their age who had tried it _ jibed
with a spate of recent expressions of concern from both federal
health authorities and experts like Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison,
author of ``Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide'' (Knopf,
1999).
</P>
<P>
   The most recent federal studies, Dr. Jamison said, ``show that
one in five high school students had considered suicide in the
preceding year, and one in 10 had attempted it, which is absolutely
terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Actual teen-age suicides, as opposed to attempts, appear to have
declined slightly from a 1994 peak of 11 per 100,000
15-to-19-year-olds, said Dr. Lloyd Potter, leader of the youth
violence and suicide prevention program at the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. But nonetheless, he said, ``when
you look at young people, it's the third or fourth leading cause of
death.''
</P>

<P>
   Suicide tends to get little attention, however, compared to the
media coverage of events like the massacre at Columbine High School
in Colorado and the political response to them. President Clinton
on Tuesday attended a conference on youth violence on Capitol Hill,
and told the gathered teen-agers that in the wake of school
shootings in Columbine and elsewhere, ``We know that more and more
students feel unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 52 percent of teen-agers polled said they thought a
Columbine-style shooting spree could strike their school, despite
the new security measures, from cameras to guards, that about half
said had been installed in the last year. And about one-quarter
said they wished their schools would take more safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their awareness of the distant possibility of mass slaughter
seemed to pale next to the heightened sense of safety stemming from
the drop in crime against them. Over all, 45 percent considered
their school safe or extremely safe, and 42 percent said it was
somewhat safe. Which, some experts say, may reflect some solid good
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that kids are in denial _ I think they probably have
better perspective than many parents,'' said James Alan Fox, Lipman
Professor of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. ``In the
last couple of years, there have been about four dozen school
shootings each year. But there are 50 million schoolchildren, so
the chances are literally one in a million.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Montgomery, a 17-year-old high school senior in
Wytheville, Va., who was called for a follow-up interview after the
poll, said, ``There are people out there that are crazy, and
anything is possible. I'm not saying it couldn't happen. It's just
that if I'm afraid all the time, what is my life worth?''
</P>
<P>
   Students' perceptions of greater safety fit nicely with surveys
by the CDC indicating that for all the media attention to
shootings, violence in schools has been declining slightly, said
Potter. Between 1991 and 1997, they found, the number of students
who reported having been in a physical fight decreased by 14
percent; those who said they had been injured in a fight decreased
by 20 percent; and those who said they carried a weapon decreased
by 30 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The exact reasons for all this good news have yet to be
pinpointed, Potter noted, though theories range from the effects of
greater parental supervision to better policing and a decline in
the use of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that school violence is down for the same reason
that community violence is on the decline: mainly, because we're
finally supervising our youngsters,'' said Jack Levin, director of
the Brudnick Center on Violence at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that does not seem to have changed is access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, 45 percent of teen-agers said they or someone in their
household owned a gun. Teen-agers in rural areas were twice as
likely to have a gun in their households: 32 percent of urban
teen-agers said they or someone in their household owned a gun,
compared with 62 percent among rural teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers also reported extensive weapon-carrying at school,
about as extensive as in 1994. Asked how many kids at their school
frequently carried a weapon, 2 percent replied that most did, 7
percent said that half did, 15 percent said that some did and 63
percent said that only a few ``carried.'' (The question did not
offer them the option of ``none,'' although 8 percent chose it
nonetheless.) Asked how many of the weapon-toting students carried
guns, just 4 percent said that some did, and just 2 percent said
that most or half did.
</P>
<P>
   Having is not the same as using, however. Only half as many
teen-agers were worried about being shot in 1999 as in 1994, and
the percentage of teen-agers who said they knew someone who had
been shot in the last five years dropped to 34 percent from 40
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   That drop in concern came despite an abundance of peers they saw
as potential attackers. More than half of teen-agers reported the
presence in their schools of students they considered ``especially
troubled, antisocial or perhaps prone to violence,'' and the most
common answer they gave for the causes of school violence were
``people being made fun of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the alternative kids have been trouble,'' said Amy
Nelson, 15, of Davenport, Iowa. ``If you bump into them, and God
forbid you do, they give you a dirty look.''
</P>
<P>
   Syanda Miley, 13, of Princeton, Ind., said, ``There's not really
an outcast group where you're thinking, `What are they going to
do?' But you never really know.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the general trend was toward greater safety and less
violence _ perhaps, Potter suggested, because, ``Things had gotten
so bad they just had to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   In many other ways, things seem to have been getting better for
American teen-agers. Certainly, no other generation has been so
connected _ to computers, and to each other through technology.
Nearly two-thirds have computers at home, 10 percent have cellular
phones, 17 percent have their own telephone number at home and 18
percent have pagers. A full 48 percent said they regularly went
online.
</P>
<P>
   Delbert Billman, a 15-year-old ninth grader in Moses Lake,
Wash., said his computer was ``really important'' to him: ``It
helps me get better grades and it saves time when I'm doing
reports, graphs or any kind of homework,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without a computer, said Whitney Bowles, 16, of Portland, Ore.,
``I would feel left out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it's an every-day essential for people to get by with,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the alarm-sounding about the growing gap between the
information ``haves'' and ``have-nots,'' computer use appears
strikingly uniform among teen-agers. White teen-agers were just
slightly more likely than blacks to say they regularly used a
computer at home; boys and girls reported similar levels of use, as
did rural and urban teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   And the disparity between rich and poor was surprisingly slim.
Among teen-agers whose households had income below $30,000 a year,
50 percent said they regularly used a computer at home, compared
with 75 percent of those with household incomes over $75,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers also reported generally respectful, honest and
firmly structured relations with their parents (though the poll's
sample may have over-represented dutiful children because they were
more likely to be at home to receive phone calls.) Nearly 90
percent said they had rules on when to be home at night, and a
quarter said they had to follow rules about how much time to spend
on the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there is one constant about adolescence, it is that
each generation struggles as if its growing pains had just been
invented.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just more serious about things now,'' said Jason
Howell, 15, of Erin, Tenn. ``They take things very personally.''

<P>
   How the Poll of American Teen-Agers Was Conducted
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News Poll of American teen-agers is based
on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 11-Oct. 14 with 1,038
teen-agers throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 in 5 households contains a teen-ager from the age
of 13 through 17. Thus, from January 1999 through August 1999 The
Times/CBS News Poll asked on each of its regular adult surveys if a
teen-ager lived in the home. The households saying yes were
subsequently called back for the poll of teen-agers. If a household
had two or more teen-agers, one was randomly designated to be
surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The original samples of telephone exchanges were randomly
selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000
active residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange random digits were added to form a complete
telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and
unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to adjust for the number of
teen-agers in the household, the number of telephone lines into the
residence, geographic region, the teen-agers' age, sex and race,
and the education of the original adult respondent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the poll results will differ
by no more than three percentage points in either direction from
what would have been obtained by seeking out all American
teen-agers. For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is
larger.
</P>
<P>
   The complete results of the poll, as well as results from past
polls, are available from The New York Times on the Web:

FIRING RANGE MUST STAY CLOSED, GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO TELLS
SENATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a standoff with powerful senators, the governor
of Puerto Rico told a congressional committee Tuesday that the U.S.
military could never resume live firing exercises on a range on the
territory's island of Vieques, despite the recommendation of a
presidential panel that the exercises resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one bomb?'' asked Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., chairman of
the Armed Services Committee, which held the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' answered Pedro Rossello, the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rossello's strong words, President Clinton will
ultimately decide whether any more live ammunition is fired on the
range, which is the property of the Navy and takes up nearly
two-thirds of the 20-mile-long island. The four-member presidential
panel recommended on Monday that the U.S. military be permitted to
resume the exercises but that the range be shut down within five
years. Since April, when a Marine pilot killed a Puerto Rican guard
in a bombing accident on the range, Puerto Rican protesters have
occupied it and prevented any firing exercises.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators said Tuesday they feared that political
calculations would take precedence over the report's
recommendations. Vieques is a major issue for Puerto Ricans who are
unusually united against the firing range and are using their
electoral strength to lobby Democratic candidates. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in New York,
said on Monday that she was opposed to the resumption of exercises
there.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing, Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., and a
committee member, said the firing range should be reopened
immediately. He said it was the only site on the East Coast where
American sailors and Marines could engage in live firing exercises
over the next few months, which is critical in preparing for
combat, a point also made in the panel's report.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's report said the Navy should be able to find
alternatives in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also heard testimony from members of the
presidential panel, who criticized the Navy for creating this
crisis by failing to address long-held grievances of the people of
Vieques. They said the range was largely responsible for an
unemployment rate of 25 percent, as well as environmental and
health problems on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the Navy has lost the respect and confidence of the
people of Puerto Rico and Vieques,'' said Gen. Richard I. Neal, a
panel member who is retired from the Marine Corps and who admitted
under questioning that he was an official in the Marines when the
situation deteriorated in Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said at Tuesday's hearing that he
accepted several recommendations of the panel and would appoint a
two-star admiral to begin improving relations between the Navy and
Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Jay L. Johnson, chief of naval operations, argued for
reopening the range by pointing out that in Operation Desert Fox
against Iraq, pilots who had trained at Vieques were nearly 20
percent more effective in hitting targets than those who had not
trained there.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that Puerto Rico was a friend of the Navy,
Rossello said the Vieques firing range had to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the Navy has repeatedly been a shabby
steward of the delicate ecology of what was once one of the most
uniformly beautiful islands in the Caribbean Sea,'' the governor
said.

&HT;        SOUTH TEXAS YOUTHS ASK CONGRESS TO CURB YOUTH VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 - Teenagers from around the country met in
the nation's capital Tuesday to identify causes of youth violence
and to share their experiences and recommendations with
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called on the 350 students attending the
Voices Against Violence conference, hosted by House Democrats, to
present Congress with their specific ideas. On Wednesday, six
months to the day after the Columbine High shooting, participants
will give Congress a resolution asking for legislative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``No serious person believes that America is as safe as it ought
to be,'' Clinton told the students. ``I want you to help us while
you're here. What else can we do? How do we make our schools
sanctuaries of safety?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do our part and we're proud of your leadership in doing
yours,'' said Clinton, whose efforts to strengthen gun control
after the Columbine shooting have been derailed in the GOP-led
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited a Department of Education report released Tuesday
that showed school crime to be decreasing. School crime rates fell
from 155 in 1993 to 102 in 1997, the study showed. However, murders
at schools increased from one in 1994-1995 to five in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Raymondville eighth-grader Adam Barrera was eager to share his
thoughts with his congressman, Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-15th , who
sits on a bipartisan working group addressing youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera said he was ``very scared'' of going to school. Not so
much of guns, but of being picked on by other students. One student
came up to him in the hallway and punched him without punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am vulnerable, and a lot of kids are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His school, Myra Green Middle School, sees few weapons due to
strict rules. If a student were to be caught with a weapon, they
would be expelled, and they must wear transparent backpacks, said
Carla C. Haynes, the school's principal.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wolf, a Gregory Portland High School senior, said funding
for education is key to preventing violent behavior among teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good deal of it is tolerance and giving people a forum to
talk to each other in,'' he said. ``This includes after-school
programs, which a lot of schools don't have. We should give more
grant money to these after-school programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's school has instituted what have come to be common in the
effort to combat gun-related violence: security cameras,
drug-sniffing dogs that prowl the hallways before class, and
unannounced searches of a student's locker without the student
knowing. Brian said Gregory ``mirrors the Columbine school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How easily it could happen there, it could happen at our
school,'' he said.

U.N. COUNCIL IN RARE ACCORD: FIGHT TERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ At a time when the U.N. Security Council often
has trouble reaching agreement on whether one crisis or another
constitutes a threat to international peace, the 15-member panel
has been able to coalesce solidly on the growing dangers of
international terrorism. Tuesday, the council voted unanimously to
wage a common fight against terrorists everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resolution adopted today is, in a way, an anti-terrorist
manifesto,'' said Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, who
introduced the measure while serving as the council's president
this month. Russia has recently been the target of a series of
terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that one can fight against terrorism only
jointly, on a solid foundation of international law,'' Lavrov said
during a rare open Security Council debate. His remarks echoed
those of others in speeches that were unusually harmonious, given
the varied histories of member nations and their representatives.
They include former revolutionaries who would once have justified
as political acts what others would have called terrorist crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That these acts may be of a political character do not make
them any less reprehensible,'' said Agam Hasny of Malaysia, a
country that has not been quick to join campaigns of interest to
Western powers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. representative, said: ``We must
not be dissuaded by phony arguments about `just causes.' All of us
have a stake in this fight, and all of us have a responsibility to
act accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote Tuesday followed another unanimous decision last week
on a bellwether resolution threatening the Islamic Taliban movement
in Afghanistan with sanctions for harboring Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi-born financier and Muslim militant who is wanted by U.S.
prosecutors on charges of complicity in the bombings of U.S.
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution calls for better cooperation and the sharing of
information among nations and international organizations. It also
asks governments to prevent terrorist groups from raising money, to
deny such groups safe haven and to be vigilant against false
refugee claims made by terrorists seeking new bases of operation.

ADMINISTRATION, CONGRESS AGREE ON PLAN LEADING TO DAM REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government will be expected to purchase
two dams on Washington state's Elwha River by the end of February
and immediately begin planning how to demolish them under an
agreement reached between the Clinton administration and
congressional negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Three key political players _ Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., Rep.
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt _ have
agreed to a plan that removes the most significant roadblocks in
the way of removing at least one of the dams on the Elwha River on
the Olympic Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Dam removal was authorized by Congress in 1992 in an effort to
restore diminished salmon runs on the Elwha River, but the project
has been stymied by a host of political and financing woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have broken the logjam we seem to have been stuck on for
a number of years,'' said Shawn Cantrell of the environmental group
Friends of the Earth. ``This is a significant breakthrough after a
lot of frustrating years.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Dicks hosted five key members of the House
Appropriations Committee, including two subcommittee chairmen, on a
tour of the Elwha River and its dams. Dicks believes the tour
helped persuade the lawmakers that the Elwha is a good candidate
for restoration because the area has been protected as part of
Olympic National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is attached to a controversial proposed budget for
the Interior Department that likely will be vetoed by President
Clinton. But the budget would then be rewritten, and Gorton, the
chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, and
Dicks, the senior Democrat on the House Interior Appropriations
Committee, said they believe the Elwha language will remain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the obstacles removed by negotiators: Gorton dropped his
insistence that removal of the Elwha dams be linked to a promise
not to remove any dams on the lower Snake River, and Babbitt
dropped his refusal to buy the Elwha dams without the money in hand
to demolish them.
</P>
<P>
   The two Elwha River dams are owned by James River Inc. and
supply electrical power to Daishowa America, the owner of a paper
mill in Port Angeles that, with 300 employees, is the largest
employer in Clallam County.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress set aside $29 million for the purchase of
the dams; this year, Congress is poised to set a Feb. 29 deadline
for the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seven years that have passed without the federal
government following through to acquire the dams have made business
planning very challenging for Daishowa,'' said the company's
lawyer, Harry Grant. ``For that reason, Daishowa welcomes the most
recent steps by Congress, which appear to make acquisition
imminent. That would be a result that is good for the environment
and good for our company.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of this year's bill, congressional negotiators have
proposed providing another $12 million for the Elwha project. Half
that amount would be used to protect the drinking water supply for
the city of Port Angeles, which currently draws its water from the
Elwha. The other half would be used to plan the dam demolition
work.
</P>
<P>
   Once the dams are sold, Daishowa will buy replacement
electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration through Port
Angeles City Light.
</P>
<P>
   Still unresolved is whether to remove just the lower Elwha Dam,
as Gorton wants, or to remove both the Elwha and the Glines Canyon
Dam, as Dicks and Babbitt want. And Congress has yet to come up
with the money for removal, which could run as high as $110 million
for both dams.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, the parties seem content to celebrate
agreeing how to acquire the dams, and seem confident that removal
will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step forward ... that will allow us to go
ahead and acquire the dams and move toward dam removal over a
period of time,'' said Dicks, whose district includes the Elwha
River. ``I'm very pleased that we were able to get Senator Gorton
and Secretary Babbitt to agree to this language.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt declined to comment because so many other provisions of
the Interior bill remain problematic for him.
</P>
<P>
   But both Dicks and Gorton said Babbitt had agreed to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secretary Babbitt and I are now in full agreement, and I've
assured Secretary Babbitt that, whether he's here or not, as long
as I'm here we're going through with ... the removal of the lower
dam and the protection of the water supply for the city of Port
Angeles and the preservation of the largest private employer in
Port Angeles, the Daishowa mill,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he remains skeptical of the value of the removal.
But he pledged that even if a Republican is elected president, he
will continue to support removal of the Elwha Dam because that is
what local officials want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an expensive process _ my guess is it's going to cost us
$60 million,'' he said, referring to the cost of removing just the
lower dam. ``I question whether the results are going to be worth
$60 million, but we're going to try.''
</P>
<P>
   The 45-mile Elwha River, most of which is within the Olympic
National Park, was dammed in 1913, when construction of the Elwha
Dam was completed five miles from the river's mouth. In 1927 the
Glines Canyon Dam was completed eight miles above the Elwha Dam.
</P>
<P>
   The dams _ illegally, according to Babbitt _ have no fish
ladders, and migratory fish have been blocked from most of the
river and its tributaries for decades. Ten native Elwha River fish
runs have been diminished, and at least one, the Elwha River
sockeye, is thought to be extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of the Elwha dams has been a top priority for
environmental groups, and Clinton cited the project as among his
top priorities on Earth Day 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the project has dragged on, despite a lack of much direct
opposition, and not everyone is so sanguine about the significance
of this year's development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been going on for so long, it's hard to believe
anything anybody says,'' said Russell Hepfer, chairman of the Lower
Elwha Klallam Tribe, which traces its creation to the river. ``When
the law first came out from Congress, everybody was excited, but
it's been seven years. Now we've got to wait and see if it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's position on the Elwha has evolved over the past several
years.
</P>
<P>
   Always a skeptic of the value to salmon of dam removal, Gorton
last year said he would reluctantly support removal of the lower
Elwha Dam in an effort to placate ``environmental extremists within
this administration'' and as ``a small price to pay'' for a promise
that the lower Snake River dams would not be removed without
congressional authorization. But the Clinton administration refused
to support any linkage between the Elwha and Snake river dams, and
Gorton withdrew his offer.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Gorton dropped the linkage, saying it is no longer
necessary. He said he believed that the Clinton administration is
backing away from its desire to remove dams on the lower Snake
River, and that in any case there is not enough time in the Clinton
administration to effect dam removal on the Snake.

POLITICAL MANEUVERING AND HOSTILITY ARE HALLMARKS OF BUDGET
BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related story, SPEND-CONGRESS) 
(bl) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this year's version of their annual budget
showdown, President Clinton and the Republican Congress are
fighting over how much money the federal government should spend to
hire teachers and police officers. They are battling over how much
money the United States should pay to support the Middle East peace
plan. They are at odds over whether mining companies should be able
to dump unlimited quantities of waste on public land.
</P>
<P>
   But their bitter standoff is about more than those issues or the
taxpayer dollars they represent. It is about seeking political
advantage as they enter an election year in which the White House
and control of the House are up for grabs. It is about fundamental
ideological differences over the size and role of the federal
government. And it is about the accumulated hostility between
Clinton and Republicans who fear the president as much as they
loathe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget battle is to some degree a symbol of the hostility,
magnified by the fight for control of the House,'' said Thomas
Kahn, the Democratic staff director of the House Budget Committee.
``Having said that, it's a mistake to underestimate the
significance of the fundamental philosophical differences between
the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met Tuesday evening at the White House in a first
attempt to bridge the differences, and both said afterwards that
they were off to a good start. Specifically, Republicans said, both
sides had reaffirmed their commitment not to dip into the Social
Security surplus to pay for any programs.
</P>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton is unlikely to rush into a deal. If the past
several years are any guide, the Republicans will grow increasingly
eager as the fall goes on to adjourn and go home, and will prove
willing to meet Clinton's key demands to do so. Republicans, some
of whom blame their disappointing showing in last year's
congressional elections on giving in to Clinton's budget
priorities, ruefully refer to it as an exit fee _ the levy, in
concessions on spending, that Clinton will charge to let them out
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the president is going to get most of what he
wants, and it's going to look like a Democratic victory,'' said
Stanley Collender, managing director of the Federal Budget
Consulting Group at Fleishman Hillard, the public relations firm.
``The question is whether the Republicans can do it in a way that
doesn't annoy the Republican base like it did a year ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt Clinton that Republicans are stalled in their
efforts to complete work on the budget for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1. Every day that Congress remains in session is another
day in which newspaper headlines will inform voters of the gimmicks
Republicans are adopting to pass spending bills (Thirteen-Month
Fiscal Years! The 2000 Census: The Fiscal ``Emergency'' No One Saw
Coming!).
</P>
<P>
   But having been burned repeatedly by Clinton in past budget
negotiations, Republicans have a strategy this year. They say that
every dollar that Clinton wants to add to spending bills will come
out of the portion of the budget surplus generated by Social
Security, a new and somewhat arbitrary standard of fiscal
discipline, but one with undoubted political resonance.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Republicans have already won that fight. At the
beginning of this year, Clinton was proposing to spend some of the
Social Security surplus. Under pressure from Republicans, he
adopted their position this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge victory for every American who sends money to
Washington from every paycheck and expects that money to be saved
for their retirement,'' said House Majority Leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, spending some or all of the Social Security surplus _
something that Washington has done routinely for decades _ has no
direct effect on the retirement system's finances and is a
completely separate subject from attempts to extend the system's
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican shorthand _ that spending the money amounts
to a ``raid'' on Social Security _ is already being used by the
party in television advertising aimed at vulnerable incumbent House
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Republicans is that they have yet to show they
can meet their own standard. Despite using every budget trick they
can think up, Republicans are still billions of dollars short in
their efforts to pass all the spending bills without using Social
Security money. They are down to some last-ditch options, including
an across the board reduction in all spending, a meat cleaver
approach that leaves Republicans vulnerable to charges from
Democrats of gutting popular programs.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton would rely on increased cigarette taxes
and other tax hikes to provide the money for his spending
priorities. But the tobacco tax is anathema to Republicans and has
critics even among Democrats, and without it Clinton is in the same
spot as the Republicans, claiming a level of fiscal virtue he
cannot live up to.
</P>
<P>
   In a friendlier political atmosphere, Clinton and the Republican
leadership would probably sit down and agree to take joint
responsibility for spending some of the Social Security surplus one
last time. But given the almost total lack of trust between them,
they seem more intent on maneuvering to assure that the other guy
takes the political hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is really about which side gets blamed for fiscal
malfeasance,'' said Thomas Gallagher, a political analyst with the
International Strategy and Investment Group.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by the standards of the last two decades, when the mounting
budget deficit was one of the most serious economic and political
problems facing the country, there will be no fiscal malfeasance.
Even if spending amounted to tens of billions of dollars more than
either side currently contemplates, the government would still run
a large Social Security surplus this year and reduce the national
debt by at least $100 billion.

 &HT;    President of National Baptist group suggests fasting, prayer
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The biblical story of Peter's deliverance from
prison is a tale of triumph over adversity and a lesson in the
power of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the new president of the nation's largest black
church group called on the faithful to remember Peter's story as
the National Baptist Convention USA rises from the scandal and
corruption of its recent history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a hopeless situation,'' the Rev. William J. Shaw
reminded about 1,000 people who gathered at Mount Enon Missionary
Baptist Church on Monday for the first service in a three-day
revival. But, he added, an angel freed Christ's apostle only after
``prayer was made without ceasing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we never needed the Lord before, we sure do now!'' Shaw
shouted, and the church's worn wooden floor rumbled as the choir
from Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church sang.
</P>
<P>
   He called on his fellow Baptists to commit to 40 days of prayer
and fasting, ``so that God might empty us, cleanse us and then fill
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The scandal that rocked the roughly 8 million-member convention
was painful, but brings an opportunity for the group to hone its
sense of purpose, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's predecessor, the Rev. Henry Lyons, was convicted earlier
this year on charges of using the group's status to bilk or steal
more than $4 million from businesses and organizations. Trial
testimony revealed a lavish lifestyle of mistresses and luxury real
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who has been pastor for 43 years at a church in
Philadelphia, was chosen to lead the group at its annual meeting
last month in Tampa, Fla. He is the first minister from the
Northeast to lead an organization that has been dominated by
Southerners for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has promised an audit of the group's finances, facilities
and personnel to streamline operations out of its headquarters
building in Nashville, Tenn. He wants to present a reorganization
plan to the board by January.
</P>
<P>
   Membership numbers will also come under scrutiny. Actual
membership has been estimated as low as 1 million by some. ``The
numbers matter in terms of others recognizing who we are,'' Shaw
said. Knowing the strength and composition of membership is also
necessary for effective ministry, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. J.F. Cunningham, pastor of Mount Enon, has been elected
to a five-year term as statistician for the nationwide count. Mount
Enon has 1,200 families in its congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said the group will work its way back to the three-pronged
ministry that is found in the New Testament itself: preaching,
teaching and healing. Healing would take the form of political
action, advocating for the underinsured and the uninsured, who are
``at the lower level of income and educational opportunity, simply
by being black.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 69, was born in Marshall, Texas, and got his call to
preach at the age of 11. He received his doctor of ministry degree
at Colgate Rochester Divinity School at Crozer Theological Seminary
in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He is considered to be one of the most charismatic preachers in
the country. On Monday night, dressed in a black suit, white shirt
and gray tie, he looked like a corporate executive. But as he told
Peter's story from Acts 12, his voice grew to that of a man twice
his size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter recognizes that deliverance is real, and that this is
the Lord's doing. He goes to that community that had prayed for
him. This is another footnote for us . . . if the Lord delivers
you, don't commit the sin of being quiet about it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Shaw has been to Mount Enon, and,
despite the busy schedule he'll have as convention president, he
promised it won't be the last. ``Being president is not the highest
thing in my life,'' he told the congregation, and the congregation
answered: ``Amen!''

 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dame Edna Everage, the Melbourne housewife, social
anthropologist, talk-show host, investigative journalist and
self-styled megastar, has clearly outgrown the control of her
mentor, Barry Humphries.
</P>
<P>
   He's the Australian wizard who, as a young actor and writer,
created the character for a Melbourne revue in 1955 and has been at
her side ever since. The extent to which this gloriously
opinionated, mauve-haired golem has taken over Humphries is now
nakedly apparent in ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour'' at the Booth
Theater on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The show was ``devised and written by'' Humphries, who is also
the star, supported only by a male piano player and the Ednaettes.
These are two well-formed young women who smile a lot and wear
tight skimpy costumes that look as if they might chafe and pinch
the odd place. Oldtimers will associate the Ednaettes' gear with
the Playboy Clubs about the time the servitude of Playboy bunnies
was exposed by Gloria Steinem, long before Ms. was either a
magazine or an accepted title of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have had the opportunity to see Dame Edna before, but
only on Broadway can she receive the kind of legitimate attention a
megastar has every right to expect. She played a brief run at the
Theater Four Off Broadway in 1977 and appeared in ``Barry McKenzie
Holds His Own,'' a dim (to American tastes) Australian film comedy
made in 1974 and released here without success in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably she starred in ``Dame Edna's Hollywood,'' two NBC
television specials in 1991 and 1992. Though often riotous, these
specials never quite raised Dame Edna to the megastardom that is
hers in England and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1970s, Humphries has devoted himself more or less
exclusively to Dame Edna, appearing in a series of one-man shows
that have won him a special niche in the London theater. Dame Edna,
wearing her rhinestone-studded glasses (she calls them ``face
furniture''), is a beloved mini-industry and someone with a life of
her own.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which the fiction and the reality of Dame Edna
have become confused was brought home to me recently by her
subversive tell-all autobiography, ``My Gorgeous Life,'' published
by Simon &AMP; Schuster. At least, that confusion is apparent in the
notes scribbled in the margins of a copy of the book borrowed from
the New York Public Library.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dame Edna mentions Humphries in the text from time to
time, usually in demeaning terms as ``my manager,'' the
hard-working fellow is otherwise ignored, receiving credit nowhere
in the book, either as a writer or a deviser.
</P>
<P>
   This may be why an earlier reader appears to have accepted as
fact the broadly satirical tome (Dame Edna would never call it a
book), and been carried away as if it were a work issuing from
Barbara Cartland's chintz-stuffed ivory tower. Jotting in either
pencil or green ink, dotting the ``i's'' with tiny circles, this
anonymous reader sometimes congratulates Dame Edna on her insight,
at other times offers blunt comments and, occasionally, even
corrects her syntax.
</P>
<P>
   When Dame Edna makes a bigoted wisecrack at the expense of
well-heeled Japanese tourists crowding into post-World War II
Australia (she wonders why Australia ever bothered to fight the
war), the reader adds an encouraging ``Amen!'' He/she underlines
many of Dame Edna's random apercus, including her remarks about the
foolishness of calling World War I ``the Great War'' even though
``no one ever had a good word to say for it,'' and Andy Warhol,
about whom Dame Edna writes, ``Frankly I never quite saw the point
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   To Dame Edna's pronouncement that ``we women hardly ever think
about sex at all unless there's something radically wrong with
us,'' the reader adds his/her own, somewhat nasty, ``or if there's
money in it.'' But he/she is also a stylist. When Dame Edna employs
the phrase ``may I ask,'' the reader uses green ink to suggest a
better choice: ``prithee.''
</P>
<P>
   This fictional dame has clout. If she can be so convincing on
the printed page, you can imagine the assault on common sense that
is prompted by seeing her, larger than life, on the Booth stage,
wearing spangled gowns with skirts slit up to the waist.
</P>
<P>
   There are two people in blissful symbiosis within Edna Everage:
the dame herself and the man from whose brain she sprang, which
creates a lot of spookily comic tension. Dame Edna is not a
conventional female impersonation. The person we see is the
tart-tongued, self-assured megastar, the merry widow of poor,
boring, cancer-riddled Norm Everage, who died after a prostate
implant was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   She's a woman who tirelessly travels the earth ``caring and
sharing,'' advising heads of state and little people (or, as she
says modestly, ``giving of myself'') and who is never at a loss for
a homily: ``I always say there are no strangers in this world, just
friends you haven't met yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurking alongside her is a possibly still-lecherous male of a
certain age, a man whose mind works at speed and whose observations
and opinions remain uncensored by political correctness. Dame Edna
kids without mercy: Janet Reno, poor people who can't afford
orchestra seats, the young gay man who designs her frocks (her son
Kenny), incontinent old folks, military people, politicians,
Japanese tourists (again), even an inn in Montauk where Humphries
seems to have been treated badly.
</P>
<P>
   His wit has a cutting edge without any of the bile that shows
through the work of a stand-up performer like Jackie Mason, but
then Humphries is not a stand-up performer. He is an astonishing
actor, still vividly remembered in London for his Fagin in the 1967
revival of ``Oliver!''
</P>
<P>
   If you saw Humphries in his NBC specials, you will be prepared
for the dichotomous effect he has. The television productions had
the format of a talk show originating from Dame Edna's ``spacious
Hollywood mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cher was never funnier than when she seemed unable to
distinguish between the formidable Australian female megastar and
the man within who was subliminally flirting with her. Kim Basinger
turned the tables around, fondling the dame's knee to the erotic
point where Humphries was almost unmasked.
</P>
<P>
   Looking surprised and not unpleased, Edna muttered something to
the effect that Ms. Basinger was going to make her forget herself.
But she is strong; she has the dignity and force of a battleship,
one camouflaged in a mauve wig.
</P>
<P>
   On one show, Robin Williams, coming onto the set as a pizza
delivery man, also nearly exposed Dame Edna as Humphries. Launching
into one of his inspired not-to-be-interrupted riffs, speaking in a
melange of Neapolitan double-talk and English, he threatened to
co-opt the show. Pretending to be misled by the dame's big hair, he
took her for Elizabeth Taylor and pressed for news of ``Larry,''
Larry being the Taylor husband of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna, her face clouding behind her harlequin specs, finally
managed to be elder stateswoman-firm. ``Now, Robin,'' she said, in
her most commanding falsetto, ``stop it!''
</P>
<P>
   These television shows appear to have been written, blocked and
rehearsed to a degree not attempted in ``Dame Edna: The Royal
Tour.'' They also featured guests who seemed to enjoy dealing with
a mind as fast and unpredictable as that of their overwhelming
host. The exception: Jack Palance who, though he was always game,
behaved as if he wished he were somewhere else, especially when
setting up a double-entendre gag for Dame Edna. (The gag had to do
with his real first name, Vladimir, as in Vlad the Impaler.)
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that Humphries prefers to work in the less restrictive
format he is using in ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,'' which is cozy,
gaudy and free form, something like a pocket-size London pantomime.
He is giving us an audience-participation show, at times even a
sing-along, something that English audiences have grown up with and
adore. (One song: ``I Never Thought I'd See So Many Friends of
Kenny.'')
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who goes ashen at the thought of being dragged onto the
stage is counseled to sit in the balcony, among the members of the
audience Dame Edna calls ``Les Mizzies,'' or ``the Miserable
Ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The show opens with a montage of video clips, a sort of ``story
thus far,'' which introduces Dame Edna to those who don't know her
and sets the tone for all that comes after. There are clips
recalling Humphries' (and Edna's) humble beginnings (or, as Dame
Edna once said, ``I'm humble. Yes, I am humble,'' followed by a
wide-eyed grimace, ``or I would be if I knew how''). We glimpse
Edna in the company of _ or being hailed by _ the sort of people
whose names can be dropped with dramatic effect, including the
pope.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Edna's tiny, ``wizened New England bridesmaid,''
Madge Allsop (Emily Perry), who was featured on the NBC specials,
comes on the screen to ``sign'' (she never speaks) a short
discourse on how people should behave in the live theater. Among
other things she signs is the reminder that ``if Dame Edna speaks
to you, she can see and hear you.''
</P>
<P>
   The show that follows is leisurely and possibly as intimate as a
Broadway production ever gets. Wearing a bizarre cloak that appears
to be composed of horizontal strips of aluminum foil and fake
rabbit fur dyed pink (designed by Kenny), Dame Edna makes her
entrance across an elevated white platform and down a Disneyland
stairway from the stars. Thereafter she shares the stage with her
pianist (Andrew Ross) and the Ednaettes (Roxane Barlow and Tamlyn
Brooke Shusterman), none of whom says much.
</P>
<P>
   She tells stories, she sings, she confides, often introducing
such confidences with ``Call me old-fashioned, but ... '' She chats
with members of the audience, thus to get a line on those she'll
bring up later to dress up as members of the British royal family.
</P>
<P>
   At the performance I attended one lucky mother and daughter had
to sit on the stage to eat pasta and sip wine provided by the
management. There is no sane way to describe the show's penultimate
image, which brings to mind the descent of the Angel in Tony
Kushner's ``Angels in America.''
</P>
<P>
   All this is risky business: if the people she corrals aren't
especially responsive or funny or eccentric or sassy, she must
exercise all her wiles to keep things uproarious. Sometimes it can
be just that. Often, too, it can be only amusing, sometimes a
little bit embarrassing: ``There, but for the grace of God, go I.''
</P>
<P>
   Dame Edna resembles Jack Benny in no way whatsoever. Yet ``Dame
Edna: The Royal Tour'' reminds me of the format of the old radio
shows of the great Benny, who could transform a succession of
seeming anticlimaxes into a singular form of epic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   A Benny show might open with Jack announcing that he must go
downtown to rent a tuxedo, followed by his running into the members
of his entourage (Mary Livingston, Phil Harris, Rochester and the
others), each of whom somehow gets in the way of his day's goal.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Jack hasn't accomplished anything. He's still on his
way to rent the tuxedo, but his audience has been as mysteriously
cheered as it was thoroughly entertained. Sometimes missions left
unfulfilled are a kind of relief. Shapely narratives can impose an
order on life we know to be bogus. ``Dame Edna: The Royal Tour''
functions in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Are Americans ready for Dame Edna? I hope so, though it takes a
while to find her wavelength. If we don't, I'm afraid it will mean
that America is still even more uncivilized than London, or even
Melbourne. I'm not being sarcastic or rude. As Edna herself likes
to say, I mean that in a caring way.
</P>
<P>
   Sit back and let the magnificent Dame take charge. ``Dame Edna:
The Royal Tour'' has no intermission. Instead, there is ``a
15-minute pause for reflection.''

THE PATRIOTS ARE AT A CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ With the Red Sox in their familiar resting
place, the focus of the Boston-area sports scene once again becomes
football. While the Red Sox overachieved all season, the Patriots
have been underachieving the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For those just tuning in, this may be either a good time or a
volatile time to jump back on board. The Patriots have lost two
straight. Beaten by the Kansas City Chiefs, 16-14, when Adam
Vinatieri missed a 32-yard field goal with four seconds remaining.
Beaten by the Miami Dolphins last Sunday, 31-30, after they
couldn't hold a 14-0 lead the defense provided in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They are 4-2 and seem to be in their annual October swoon, with
the Denver Broncos coming to town Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big game. This is not the Denver team that has
plastered the Patriots in the recent past, but the Broncos have won
their last two, including last Sunday against Green Bay, after
losing four straight. So perhaps they are on the road back.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are at a serious crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five reasons why they might be ready to break out, and
five reasons why they might continue to decline:
</P>
<P>
   THEY CAN BREAK OUT BECAUSE . . . &QC;
</P>
<P>
   1. Unlike the past two seasons, when they also began to lose
after strong starts, they are not getting crushed. Arrowhead
Stadium is one of the worst places to play for an opposing team,
yet the Patriots had the game won if the field goal was converted.
And even though the offense put only one touchdown on the board
against Miami, the Patriots did prove that they can play with the
Dolphins, who were widely considered the class of the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   2. The offense is only a temporary concern. In this region of
short memories, don't forget that the Patriots rebounded from a
28-7 deficit to beat Indianapolis. Don't forget that in their first
three games they were behind and had to come back to win with
offense. At one point this season, Ernie Zampese was being hailed
as a genius.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Patriots have enough good players on defense to create
problems for the opposition. Willie McGinest has been healthy and
chasing the quarterback (five sacks); Lawyer Milloy has emerged as
a leader and is hitting harder than ever; Ty Law is still one of
the best cover corners in the league, and against Miami he returned
an interception 27 yards for a touchdown; and Chris Slade showed
All-Pro form last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   4. They have a healthy Terry Glenn. Oh, sure, he was held
without a reception by the Dolphins, but they are one of the best
defensive teams in the league. Will this happen every week?
Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   5. In the past, Drew Bledsoe has found a way to get it done
without a great running game. The team still feels that if the game
comes down to Bledsoe leading them to a score in the final minute
or two, he'll get it done.
</P>
<P>
   THEY CAN DECLINE BECAUSE . . . &QC;
</P>
<P>
   1. So far, they can't run. The numbers are absolutely pathetic:
2.9 yards per carry, no gain or a loss 19 times, only 25 rushing
first downs, only 184 yards on first downs. The Patriots fired
assistant coach Paul Boudreau last offseason; will they blame this
poor running game on Dante Scarnecchia?
</P>
<P>
   All through training camp, we heard that Kevin Faulk was further
along than Robert Edwards was at that point. Well, it's Game 7 and
Faulk has been a nonfactor. Plus, Terry Allen can't get through
cracks, he needs a hole. The loss to Miami was a direct result of
not being able to work the clock when they had the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots will likely be able to run against certain teams,
but against tough teams when they have to get a tough first down?
That's the issue.
</P>
<P>
   2. The rumors about Pete Carroll needing to win to save his job
could restart with another loss _ so if they do, rip up the rest of
your season tickets and try again next year.
</P>
<P>
   3. You've got to cut a little here and a little there to get
under the salary cap, but it appears that Willie Clay was the wrong
cut. Carroll says that some of Chris Carter's shortcomings are
``correctable,'' but they'd better be corrected soon. At a position
where the Patriots have gotten big plays in the past, they're
getting few now.
</P>
<P>
   4. The Patriots have been a good home team in part because the
Foxborough crowd makes it difficult on the opposition, which is the
way it should be. But when Milloy says the Dolphins were able to
check off at the line of scrimmage because the crowd was quiet,
that's a problem. Maybe they need Tim Tschida to get them going.
</P>
<P>
   5. Apathy or dissension could tear this team apart. Sure, the
players were saying after the Miami loss that, nah, the defense
isn't blaming the offense. The mantra was, ``We win as a team and
we lose as a team.'' But the fact that the players bring it up _
sometimes without anyone asking _ means they're thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy addressed the issue of apathy after the Miami game. He
looked over to the sideline during the Dolphins' winning drive, he
said, and ``all the people on the bench _ offense, special teams
players, and even some of the players in the huddle on the
defensive side _ were going through the motions. Our fans weren't
into it. It was pretty dead out there. The whole atmosphere was not
championship-caliber all around. It really made me sick to my
stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Red Sox fans, welcome back to football. You missed the best
of times (the 4-0 start), you were half-watching the worst of times
(two late-game losses), and now . . . who knows?

CAMPAIGN REFORM BACKER IS RAISING OWN SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CAMPAIGN-FINANCE) 
(sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle was one of the
staunchest backers of the campaign finance reform bill that died in
the Senate on Tuesday. The bill would have banned so-called ``soft
money,'' the unrestricted contributions that fall outside federal
election law.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, Daschle created his own political action
committee, which immediately began raising soft money. Last summer,
Daschle's DASH PAC, which stands for Dedicated Americans for the
Senate and House, began its fund raising with a dinner here
highlighted by a performance by the singer Lyle Lovett. By
mid-year, DASH PAC had raised a total of $800,000, which Daschle
could eventually dole out to his political allies.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle is not alone in pressing the frontiers of fund raising
into soft money by establishing so-called leadership PACs that can
raise soft money. All year, as the Congress has been locked in
ultimately futile wrangling over reshaping the federal election
laws, lawmakers in both chambers and both parties have been busily
increasing the number of pockets they have for campaign
contributions, especially soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate minority leader decided he needed his own PAC ``to be
competitive'' with the Republicans, Daschle's political director,
Michael Meehan, said on Tuesday. ``After trying this entire decade
to pass the campaign finance bill and to see it dying out there on
the floor, we feel we had to come up with another way to be
competitive and elect people to the Senate who will pass it,''
Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 30 senators and representatives have created PACs
that are now raising soft money. That group includes Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., both of whom worked hard to defeat the campaign finance
reform legislation, called the McCain-Feingold bill.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the states where the PACs are based do not require the
lawmakers to identify their donors or limit the amount of
contributions they accept. Daschle, however, reports all of his
soft-money donors' identities to the Federal Election Commission
and limits his soft-money contributions to $10,000 a donor, his
aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-money PACs are permitted to collect the unrestricted
corporate and individual contributions because the politicians do
not spend the money directly to congressional and presidential
campaigns, which would fall under the purview of Federal election
law. Instead, they can spend the money on things like travel and
fund-raising events or transfer the money to colleagues' PACs.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, politicians have used leadership PACs to promote
their personal careers and political agendas. More than 30 senators
and 75 representatives have them. Leadership PACs are the
fastest-growing segment of political fund raising, according to
Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I encourage leadership PACs,'' Lott said recently. ``The more,
the merrier.''
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, PACs like Dashle's operated only on the
national level, where contributions are restricted and disclosure
mandatory. But now many lawmakers are raising soft money for their
PACs on the less restrictive state level, a relatively new, though
rapidly expanding phenomenon. Even if Congress had passed
legislation banning soft money, campaign finance experts said they
feared that it would not have curtailed the growth of state-level
soft-money PACs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with these PACs is their Cayman Islands quality,''
said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy 21, a public
policy organization here. ``Secret, unlimited money is about as
dangerous as you can get in American politics in terms of
corrupting the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, the executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics, said that nobody knows how many soft-money
PACs are in operation in individual states by Senate and House
members. ``This is a completely invisible, brand new area of fund
raising,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is made by Public Disclosure Inc., a campaign
finance research firm here. On its Web site, the group lists 30
PACs held by current legislators that have the ability to raise
soft money. Twenty-four are led by Republicans. ``Those are just
the ones we know of,'' said Kent Cooper, a former Federal Election
Commission official who is a co-founder of Public Disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress, even some Republicans, say they are
troubled about the increasing dependence by lawmakers on the
soft-money PACs. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said that he is most
alarmed by the committees' lack of disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all kind of tiptoeing around the bushes here on this
stuff,'' Hagel said. ``People have found ways to develop loopholes
and get around the law and violate completely what the intent of
all this is supposed to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel created his own leadership PAC in June, but it only
accepts ``hard-money'' donations, which are strictly regulated and
disclosed. Already, his PAC, named Sand Hills for a large swath of
prairie in Nebraska where Hagel grew up, has raised $100,000.
Before the November 2000 elections, Hagel hopes that his PAC will
raise a total of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts project that the total fund raising for leadership
PACs will easily exceed $20 million before the 2000 elections. In
the first half of this year, House House Speaker Dennis Hastert
raised more than $1.5 million for his leadership PAC, named Keep
Our Majority PAC.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of these PACs is part of what is shaping up to be a
banner year of fund raising by federal lawmakers and by the two
major political parties. The party committees affiliated with the
House and Senate are both raising record amounts of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   All 19 Republican Senate incumbents who face a competitive race
next year have already raised at least $1 million each, said
Stewart Roy, the spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Senate Majority Celebration Dinner, held at
the Ronald Reagan International Trade Center, raised a record $6.1
million. And in late May, yet another fund-raising committee _ a
joint House and Senate committee _ held its annual dinner. More
than 3,300 people attended, and in one night the committee raised
$9 million, another record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very good year,'' Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are not pausing to mourn the death of the
McCain-Feingold bill either. On Wednesday night, the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee will hold its annual fall gala at the
Buildings Museum here. Vice President Al Gore and the singer
Melissa Etheridge are scheduled to attend. The event is expected to
raise $2 million. Of that amount, committee officials said, more
than $800,000 will come from soft-money checks.

LEGISLATORS TRY TO EXCLUDE FOOD, MEDICINE FROM SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A coalition of agricultural state lawmakers Tuesday
launched a renewed attempt to overturn U.S. laws prohibiting the
sales of farm products to countries such as Cuba, Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers argued that U.S. economic sanctions against rogue
nations have failed as a tool of foreign policy and have caused
economic hardship to U.S. growers, who lose an estimated $1.2
billion in foreign markets each year to competitors as a result of
U.S.-imposed economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Among those farmers hurt by U.S. sanctions are Washington state
wheat growers, who once exported heavily to Iran, and Washington
state pea and lentil growers, who once exported heavily to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors of the sanctions reform legislation, including Rep.
George Nethercutt, R-Wash., argued that it makes no sense for the
United States to demand at next month's World Trade Organization
meeting in Seattle that foreign countries drop barriers to
agricultural trade while the United States continues to maintain
its own barriers based on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural groups suggested that some foreign countries may
cite U.S. sanctions policy as a reason they should be allowed to
retain their own market barriers to agricultural trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to end foreign trade barriers, and a number of us are
urging that in the Seattle round of the WTO talks that we curtail
the kind of barriers and walls that prevent our farmers from having
a fair shot at foreign markets,'' said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
``Not only do we need to eliminate the barriers that foreign
countries place between our farmers and markets, but we need to end
our own barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate this year voted 70-28 to add a provision to the
budget for the Agriculture Department that would have barred the
inclusion of food and medicine in sanctions programs. But the
measure was struck from the bill at the insistence of House
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Ashcroft, Nethercutt and others said they would try to
pass a standalone measure that would lift all food and medicine
embargos and require congressional approval for reimposition. They
said prospects in the Senate are good, but in the House, where
support for the Cuba embargo is stronger, the bill faces an
uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy as a government is wrong,'' Nethercutt said. ``We
should not use food and medicine as a foreign policy weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Cuban American members of Congress, Reps. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., denounced the
measure. They said agricultural products should be sold to Cuba
only if all political prisoners in Cuba are freed, political
parties and labor unions are legalized, and free elections are
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart as well as the ethical thing to do is to wait and do
business with Cuba when it is free, not to do business with the
jailers of the political prisoners who will be the future leaders
of a Democratic Cuba,'' they said in a joint statement. ``U.S.
agriculture makes a critical mistake in taking steps which may be
perceived as contributing to the perpetuation of the Cuban
tyranny.''

 &HT;    Bailey's partner puts greedy government in bad light
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The government may have wanted the millions
earned by William J. McCorkle's infomercial empire, but it did
nothing to stop F. Lee Bailey from taking $2 million in fees for
himself, Bailey's partner testified when he took the stand in
Bailey's defense Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of a hearing that could ultimately send Bailey
to jail over the $2 million, Orlando attorney David Horwitz tried
to shift blame to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the responsibility of the government, not Mr. Bailey,''
said Horwitz, who joined Bailey in defending McCorkle and his wife.
``I always looked at it from the side of the government, which has
the ability, doesn't tie it up, then that's sending a message.''
</P>
<P>
   But during six sometimes tense hours of cross examination,
assistant U.S. Attorney Marie DeMarco tried again and again to
shake Horwitz, grilling him on how he defended his client,
McCorkle's wife Chantal, and the strategy he and Bailey used in the
case. DeMarco painstakingly detailed the 1998 trial to try to prove
Horwitz knew the money was dirty.
</P>
<P>
   DeMarco will likely pursue the same argument today, when Bailey
is expected to testify in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The government is threatening Bailey with contempt of court and
jail because he refused to surrender $2 million stashed by the
McCorkles in an account in the Cayman Islands. Last year a jury
sentenced the couple to 24 years in prison for fraud and
money-laundering in a get-rich scam that involved buying foreclosed
property. In reality, the couple earned very little from real
estate, but made millions selling video tapes of their scheme.
Jurors also ordered them to turn over $10.6 million in assets.
Bailey says the $2 million covers his fee and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the perpetually embattled attorney who defended Patty
Hearst and master-minded part of the O.J. Simpson defense, spent 44
days in a Gainesville jail after he refused to surrender about $17
million in stock in a separate but similar dispute with U.S.
prosecutors. Bailey ultimately dropped his claim on the money in
that case and asked the federal claims court in Washington to award
him a fee for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey's attorney, Richard Lubin, has argued that Bailey doesn't
have to turn over any money _ dirty or not _ because he already
spent it.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the case is very simple, Lubin questioned Horwitz for
less than a half hour and plans to call only Bailey to bolster his
defense. Several times Tuesday, he tried to prod the magistrate to
speed the prosecution's cross examination. And throughout the long
day, Bailey routinely tugged at his elbow and whispered comments.
Lubin maintains that if the government wants the money, it must sue
Bailey in civil court.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop DeMarco from hammering away at Horwitz.
Surely, she said, Horwitz knew McCorkle lied in his infomercials,
refused to give refunds and used fraudulently obtained credit
cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to see salesmen who get carried away and say
things they probably shouldn't. But I felt it was a viable
product,'' he said. ``This was not a case where someone was selling
dope or a ponzi scheme where they're not selling anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz said that when the Cayman courts ruled that the $2
million could be used to pay legal bills there and the U.S.
government failed to object, he assumed prosecutors agreed it
covered bills in the U.S. as well.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing, initially scheduled to conclude today, is expected
to resume Thursday.

RED SOX LOOK BACK ,  AND AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ideally, Dan Duquette would like a little more power in the Red
Sox lineup, preferably from an experienced hitter, but he said it's
unlikely the Sox will be very active in the free agent market. Jimy
Williams mentioned that, for him, pitching is always the key.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, in the aftermath of the Red Sox' elimination from
the playoffs, the general manager and manager were caught between
looking ahead to the 2000 season and back at the improbable season
just completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot to be proud of, a lot to build on,'' said
Duquette, who held an impromptu press conference late Tuesday
morning at Fenway Park in part so he could personally thank the
team's fans on the noon TV news spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the All-Star Game, the All-Star MVP in Pedro Martinez,
and we had a chance to play in the American League Championship
Series. We'd like to be the celebrating team. There's a little more
work to do, but we're getting closer and closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, wearing a sweater bearing the logo of the Yokohama Bay
Stars, the Japanese team from which the Sox acquired top pitching
prospect Tomokazu Ohka, said he believed the Sox would still be
alive in the playoffs if they'd played better defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we caught the ball, we'd still be playing,'' he said. ``We
needed to make fundamental plays to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Red Sox made 10 errors, an LCS record, a fatal flaw
in a series in which two Yankee wins were decided by one run and
the other two were close until the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said the core of this team will be returning. He
mentioned not only the usual suspects _ Nomar Garciaparra, Troy
O'Leary, Pedro Martinez, and Jose Offerman _ but also John
Valentin, whose subpar regular season, plus the performance of
rookie Wilton Veras, has led to speculation that the Sox will try
to trade their veteran third baseman, who has two years left on a
contract that pays him $25 million for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin's terrific performance in the postseason could work in
one of two ways: Either it guarantees his return next season or it
increases his trade value.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to get the type of production he gave us
during the postseason during the regular season,'' Duquette said of
Valentin, who expects to have surgery beneath his left kneecap this
winter. ``That would be a big plus for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could explain the disparity, Duquette said, ``I
don't have an answer for that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last offseason, when the Sox endured the loss of Mo
Vaughn to free agency, the only position player who will walk after
this season is Reggie Jefferson, whom the Sox will make no attempt
to re-sign. Jefferson, who signed a two-year, $6.6 million
extension during the '97 season, didn't expect to come back even
before being left off the roster for the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have decisions pending on three players. They have
the right to exercise a $3 million option on the contract of
pitcher Pat Rapp and the $2 million (plus $450,000 in incentives
met) on lefty reliver Rheal Cormier. Pitcher Kent Mercker,
meanwhile, has the right to exercise a $1.75 million option on his
contract for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said those decisions must be made within 10 days of the
end of the World Series. Indications are that the Sox will keep
Cormier and let Rapp become a free agent, while Mercker will try to
find a National League team willing to pay him more than $1.75
million.
</P>
<P>
   The team also has five arbitration-eligible players in DH Butch
Huskey, outfielder Damon Buford, catcher Scott Hatteberg, and
pitchers John Wasdin and Rich Garces. The latter three aren't
likely to make a killing in arbitration; Hatteberg was hurt most of
the season, Wasdin was up and down, and Garces was paid just over
the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey, who was paid $1.5 million last season, could come close
to doubling his salary based on his numbers in 1999, but probably
will still be invited back. Buford, who was paid $1.1 million, can
expect a hefty raise, though the Sox might deem him expendable if
they add a better-hitting alternative who could make Darren Lewis
or Trot Nixon the fourth outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox already have $16.25 million committed to the Martinez
brothers, Pedro ($11 million) and Ramon ($5.25 million), for next
season. Bret Saberhagen, who expects to have arthroscopic surgery
to clean out his right shoulder, also will be back, and a number of
younger pitchers _ Ohka, Brian Rose, Juan Pena _ are expected to
compete for spots in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   In limbo is Tim Wakefield, who has never been a favorite of
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan and who was left off the ALCS roster.
Wakefield is due to be paid $4.5 million next season, with a club
option of $5 million in 2001, but talks of a contract extension
have been tabled. Wakefield could be shopped, though a more likely
scenario is that the Sox, who know he is good for 200 innings, will
pencil him back into the rotation next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they've also committed $7.5 million to two closers of
suspect health: Rod Beck ($3.5 million) and Tom Gordon ($4
million). Beck, who gave up home runs in the ALCS to Bernie
Williams and Ricky Ledee, clearly hasn't recovered from May elbow
surgery; Gordon, who missed most of the season with a partially
torn ligament, anticipates an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Their presence on the roster would seem to preclude the Sox from
making Derek Lowe their closer. Lowe says he would prefer starting
to being a setup man, while Kerrigan said his thought for the
moment is that the Sox are better served with Lowe pitching 70
times a season instead of 30.
</P>
<P>
   Another player with an uncertain future is second baseman Jeff
Frye, who is in the last year of a three-year deal paying him $7.2
million. Unless the Sox elect to move Offerman, it's unlikely
they'll have a place for Frye, who has little marketability after
missing most of the last two years because of an injured left knee.
</P>
<P>
   How much, Williams was asked, have the Sox closed the gap with
the Yankees, who are going to the World Series for the third time
in four years?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``They beat us four out of five. Next
year, we all start 0-0. We closed the gap this year, but does it
mean we'll close the gap next year? And you can't eliminate the
other teams in our division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team north of the border (Toronto) has good young
players. Baltimore on paper has an outstanding club.''
</P>
<P>
   Close to the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't matter,'' he said. ``We lost. They beat us four games
to one. The empty feeling I have is because we're still not
playing, regardless of who we're playing.''

BANK MERGER CREATES RIVAL TO SPAIN'S LARGEST BANKING COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy)  (js) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Spain's No. 2 and No. 3 banks announced a $11.5
billion merger Tuesday that will create a strong rival to the
nation's biggest banking company, Banco Santander.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between Banco Bilbao Vizcaya and smaller partner
Argentaria is part of a wave of banking mergers that have been
sweeping through Europe with the advent this year of the single
currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Santander itself is the product of a merger in January,
and a combination of its two closest rivals had been rumored for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Banco Bilbao and Argentaria said their deal was a
merger of equals, but Banco Bilbao shareholders will control about
70 percent of the combined bank and Argentaria's shareholders will
have the rest. The merger is expected to be complete by next
January.
</P>
<P>
   The combined bank will have assets of 226 billion euros or about
$244 billion, behind Banco Santander's assets of about 256 billion
euros or $276 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But ranked by stock value, the Banco Bilbao-Argentaria
combination would be worth about 37 billion euros or $40 billion,
ahead of Banco Santander's value of about 34 billion euros or $37
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger partners intend an aggressive expansion to become the
leading financial group in Spain, Italy and Portugal, said Pedro
Luis Uriarte, chief executive officer at Banco Bilbao, who will
have the same post at the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   Banco Bilbao owns 10 percent of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SpA,
Italy's sixth largest bank, and has been in talks about a possible
alliance with UniCredito Italiano SpA, Italy's third largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Ybarra, 63, the Banco Bilbao chairman, and Francisco
Gonzalez, 55, the Argentaria chairman, will be the co-chairmen of
the new bank until Ybarra retires in 2002, leaving Gonzalez in
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The combined bank will have operations in 10 Latin American
countries and would be the second largest financial group in the
region behind Banco Santander.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government, which maintains a so-called ``golden
share'' in Argentaria after selling its 29.2 percent stake last
year, is not expected to oppose the merger, bank executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank will have 7,317 offices, mainly in Spain, and
91,000 employees, more than half of them outside of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the General Workers Union in Spain, Juan Sanchez,
said the banks' management had promised what he called a
``civilized'' reduction of the labor force through early
retirements. &QL;

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, CHINESE COMPANY INDICTED IN '94 EQUIPMENT SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Will be led.)  
(nk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and a powerful state-owned aerospace company in China
on charges of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale
of American machining equipment, some of which was diverted to a
Chinese military site.
</P>
<P>
   The case could complicate relations between Beijing and
Washington just as China and the United States are trying to
complete one of the biggest trade agreements in history _ China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, American and Chinese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonni Tischler, the assistant commissioner for investigations
for the U.S. Customs Service, said at a news briefing Tuesday that
the indictment was the ``first time a Chinese government entity has
been indicted for violations of U.S. export laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges McDonnell Douglas, a unit of the Boeing
Co., and the Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnel Douglas,
with 13 counts, including conspiracy, false statements and
misrepresentations in connection with a 1994 export license to sell
13 pieces of machining equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains 12 charges against the buyer of the equipment,
the China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corp., or
Catic, and Catic affiliates in Beijing and California.
</P>
<P>
   Two Chinese nationals employed by Catic were also indicted, as
was a mid-level McDonnell Douglas employee, Robert J. Hitt, the
director of the China program office at Douglas Aircraft in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boeing and Catic representatives denied any wrongdoing and
vowed to contest the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonnell Douglas Corporation did not commit any criminal
violations in regard to the sale of the machine tools to the
People's Republic of China and intends to vigorously defend against
the charges brought by the United States Attorney's Office,''
Boeing said in a statement. ``It is unfortunate that the
prosecutors have apparently not taken the time to learn the facts
and gain a full understanding of a rather complicated matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred F. Fielding, a partner in the Washington law firm of Wiley,
Rein &AMP; Fielding who represents Catic and its affiliates, said:
``Catic has cooperated fully with the government investigation and
has strongly maintained throughout that it has never intentionally
violated any U.S. laws. This is a commercial transaction involving
the sale of used machinery and the government's position that this
is a criminal or national security case is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tischler said the diversion of civilian technology for
military uses by China was a top priority for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also released a lengthy background paper that suggested
that one of the company's defenses is that top Clinton
administration officials knew important details about the deal, so
they could not have been misled.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation of the deal began in 1996. Lengthy
plea-bargain negotiations between defense lawyers, and Lisa Prager,
the assistant U.S. attorney who handled the inquiry, broke down
Tuesday night, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Catic bought the machining equipment, which is used to bend
steel in manufacturing aircraft, for only $5 million. But the sale
was part of a billion-dollar deal in which McDonnell Douglas was to
build trunkliner, or middle-size commuter, aircraft in China. The
indictment cites an October 1993 meeting in which Douglas
executives agreed they were negotiating the sale of the machining
equipment ``due to the pending $1 billion trunkliner program.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the sale of the machining equipment,
McDonnell Douglas discovered that some of it had not gone to the
intended destination, a civilian site in Beijing, but instead wound
up 800 miles away, at a military site in Nanchang that makes
surface-to-surface missiles and fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas reported the diversion in 1995, before the
equipment had been put to use. The giant machines were later moved
to a civilian location. The airliner deal, which President Clinton
hailed on the eve of the 1994 election as a job-rich program for 20
planes, has produced only one plane, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The airliner deal was promoted by Clinton and then Commerce
Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who died in a plane crash in Croatia in
1996, as a centerpiece of the administration's commercial
diplomacy, the policy of using economic engagement to broaden ties
with Beijing and promote exports. On the eve of a trip to China in
1994, Brown wrote a letter to China's vice premier about the
airliner deal based on a draft letter from Douglas, according to
Boeing's release. The machining equipment license was issued soon
after Brown returned from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   State Department cables obtained by defense lawyers in the case
show that administration officials delayed seeking timely
assurances from Catic on how it planned to use the machining
equipment so as not to disrupt Brown's announcement about the deal
in China, according to lawyers and officials who have read the
cables.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Catic officials caused six of the
machines to be diverted to Nanchang. It also charges that McDonnell
Douglas officials concealed or failed to disclose important
information from Commerce Department licensing officials, including
that the airliner deal was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says that McDonnell Douglas, which was
bought by Boeing in 1997, concealed its hiring of a ``high ranking
former government official and his consulting firm'' that was paid
$4 million ``to intercede with Catic'' and China ``because the
trunkliner negotiations were stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case said the former official referred
to in the indictment was Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former
secretary of state. Woody Goldberg, a spokesman for Haig's firm,
confirmed their representation of McDonnell Douglas on the China
airliner deal.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the corporate defendants face an aggregate maximum
criminal fine of about $10 million. The corporate defendants could
also be restricted in their future trade dealings if convicted. The
individual defendants face a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.

 &HT;    Environmental groups charge Bush, political pals responsible for
bad airBy Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and his political allies are
largely responsible for an ``air quality crisis'' in Texas, a
44-member coalition of state environmental groups charged on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism comes weeks after reports that Houston has
surpassed Los Angeles as the nation's smoggiest city, according to
some measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to statistics on ozone _ commonly known as smog _ and
other forms of air pollution, the Texas Air Crisis Campaign argues
that Texas air has gotten significantly dirtier since Bush took
office in 1995. They say Bush has weakened anti-pollution standards
and safeguards and squandered opportunities to make the air
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   But federal environmental officials cautioned that the
statistics cited Tuesday don't prove that Texas' air quality has
deteriorated under Bush. They also noted that any changes in
quality over the past five years might have been caused by weather
or growth rather than public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the Republican presidential front-runner, meanwhile,
argue that as governor he has done more than his predecessors to
address some of the state's decades-old environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone, a respiratory irritant that causes breathing and lung
difficulties as well as other problems, is produced when pollutants
released by vehicles, industries and other sources undergo chemical
reactions in the presence of sunlight. Vehicles are responsible for
most of the smog in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The national media has been scrutinizing Bush's Texas
environmental record in recent days, and the Democratic National
Committee on Tuesday also blasted Bush for the state's air
pollution problems. Democrats believe that Bush is vulnerable on
environmental issues, particularly if he faces off against Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the organizers of Tuesday's Capitol press conference
insisted that their timing had more to do with the Legislature's
upcoming review of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission than with presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Air Crisis Campaign _ composed of the Texas chapters
of major environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense
Fund as well as local groups such as Lakeway Parents Concerned
About Sewage Spray _ sees the review as an opportunity to make
substantive changes in the state's environmental policies.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the group wants the state to eliminate the
pollution exemptions for older industrial plants, boost public
participation in environmental decisions, stiffen penalties for
polluters and ``stop the revolving door between the top levels of
polluting companies and the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that Bush has said that he'd like to be judged
on his air pollution record. They maintain that it isn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air quality crisis is a result of actions and conscious
omissions of the governor, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation
Commission, and the Legislature during the last five years and is
not simply a result of the weather or growth,'' said Meg Haenn,
regional director of Clean Water Action and a spokeswoman for the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air situation in Texas in January of 1995 was fair to
poor. But our state government has made it worse in the last five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition criticized Bush, his appointees, and state
lawmakers for dozens of environmental decisions in the past five
years, including the 1995 elimination of a tough auto emissions
inspection program for Houston and Dallas. The cancellation of the
program sparked a lawsuit, which the state settled with $130
million from an environmental protection fund.
</P>
<P>
   The group also criticized Bush for his 1999 approval of a
voluntary compliance plan for industrial plants ``grandfathered''
from the state's 1971 clean-air law. The voluntary plan was
supported, and perhaps put together, according to memoranda, by
industry. Environmentalists supported a mandatory approach.
</P>
<P>
   Bush suggested the voluntary plan after it was revealed that the
grandfathered plants _ those in existence or under construction in
1971 _ were producing about 36 percent of all the industrial
emissions in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ought to get some credit for recognizing the problem, but I
think the response with regard to the problem was pretty weak,''
said Jim Marston of the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush aides noted that he was the first governor to seek any
emission reductions from the grandfathered plants, and that 100 of
the 800 grandfathered plants have already volunteered to comply.
They also point to a provision in the electric utility
restructuring bill, approved by lawmakers last session and signed
by Bush, which will crack down on emissions from power plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Campaign year tactics like this only poison the spirit of
cooperation that is resulting in significant progress toward
cleaner air and water in Texas,'' said Bush campaign spokeswoman
Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   A definitive answer to the question of whether Texas' air is
cleaner or dirtier than it was in 1995 is elusive. Citing TNRCC
statistics, Tucker points to a 10 percent reduction in industrial
air pollution since Bush has been in office. But the Texas Air
Crisis Campaign, relying heavily on data from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, argues that most indicators on
smog and other pollutants point to an increase in air pollution in
most areas of the state.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials cautioned Tuesday that there are many different
types of air pollution, and many different causes, and that Texas'
record over the past five years is a mixed bag of improvements and
setbacks. As far as Houston's unofficial designation as the
nation's smoggiest city, they noted that the city's air quality has
improved, but has done so more slowly than Los Angeles. California
has tougher federal auto emissions standards and unlike Texas, has
had weather this year that isn't conducive to smog.

U.S. STORED NUCLEAR WEAPONS ABROAD, DECLASSIFIED DOCUMENT SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:20 p.m. ET) 
(js) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States stored 12,000 nuclear weapons and components
in Morocco, Japan, Iceland, Puerto Rico, Cuba and at least 23 other
countries and five territories during the Cold War, according to a
new article based on a recently declassified document.
</P>
<P>
   The document, a secret study written by the Defense Department
and entitled ``History of the Custody and Deployment of Nuclear
Weapons,'' is described in the cover story of the November/December
issue of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. Altogether, the article
says, between 1945 and 1977 the United States stored 38 types of
nuclear weapons systems abroad _ including in Germany, Guam and the
Japanese island of Okinawa, which was then under U.S. occupation.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been known that the United States has deployed
nuclear weapons and materials overseas, but the document provides
confirmation of this and sheds new light on how widespread the
practice was. The magazine article emphasizes the extent to which
the Pentagon manufactured special nuclear weapons to mask the
presence of nuclear materials in countries where anti-nuclear
fervor was strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon document fundamentally revises some aspects of
postwar nuclear history,'' said William M. Arkin, a nuclear weapons
analyst and one of the article's three co-authors. It reveals, for
example, that the first U.S. nuclear weapons placed overseas were
sent not to Britain, as many historians had believed, but to
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arkin and his co-authors caution that the declassified
study and an annex listing the countries where nuclear weapons were
placed or stored contain some errors. For instance, the annex fails
to list Portugal's Azores Islands or Libya, places where Arkin says
other declassified documents show that the Strategic Air Command
stored nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The study does confirm that U.S. nuclear weapons or materials
were sent to such sensitive areas as Japan, Greenland, Iceland and
Taiwan, which have all forsworn nuclear weapons and publicly vowed
not to store them on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Most diplomats from these countries declined to comment on the
article and the document, or on whether their governments were
aware of the presence of nuclear weapons. But Fridrik Jonsson,
first secretary of the Icelandic Embassy in Washington, said that
his government ``has not been aware of the presence of any nuclear
weapons on our soil.''
</P>
<P>
   How the Pentagon document was declassified is a saga in itself.
``It has been a 16-year ordeal,'' said Arkin, who requested the
document under the Freedom of Information Act in 1983. The study
was partially declassified two years later, but most of its
annotated charts and country listings were blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin, assisted by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Washington-based nonprofit group of scientists, lawyers, and
environmentalists, appealed the deletions. In 1992, the Pentagon
released a little more information.
</P>
<P>
   Then earlier this year, it declassified much of the censored
material, including the names of nine places where bombs had been
stored. But it continued to suppress the names of 18 countries on
the list, many of them sensitive to the presence of nuclear
materials on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Because the list of countries was alphabetical, however, Arkin
and his coauthors, Robert S. Norris, of the Natural resources
Defense Council, and William Burr, a senior analyst at the National
Security Archives, a Washington-based non-profit group that serves
as an archive for declassified information, were able to identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of nuclear weapons domestically and overseas
remains among the most sensitive of military secrets. Arkin said
that the United States, the only country known to have placed
nuclear weapons abroad, still keeps such weapons in at least seven
nations: Belgium, Greenland, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany,
Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth H. Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, said that
the Clinton administration, following a policy long embraced by its
Republican and Democratic predecessors, would neither confirm nor
deny the existence of nuclear weapons on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that at least one of the authors' deductions about
the countries in which nuclear weapons were stored was not correct.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie H. Gelb, the president of the New York-based Council on
Foreign Relations and the State Department's director of political
military affairs between 1977 and 1979, defended the policy of what
he called ``don't ask, don't tell'' with respect to nuclear weapons
deployments. ``You make a country a target by admitting that you've
put nuclear weapons there,'' said Gelb, who wrote about strategic
and foreign affairs for The New York Times after he left the Carter
administration.

 &HT;    SOCIAL SECURITY AT THE HEART OF BUDGET IMPASSE
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and congressional leaders huddled
Tuesday evening in the Oval Office, trying to craft the outline of
a budget compromise.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of their struggle lies an issue that refuses to
die: how to assure the long-term health of Social Security, the
federal retirement and disability program that provides income to
44.4 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties having given up hope for comprehensive Social
Security reform this year. Now, the battle is over two competing
plans for locking up the $2 trillion surplus the program is
projected to generate over the coming decade and using that money
to pay down the $5.7 trillion federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., emerged from
Tuesday's 71-minute budget meeting saying that Clinton had asked
Democrats and Republicans alike to take up the ``lock box'' issue
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked all of us to look at that,'' Gephardt told reporters,
``and see if we couldn't have action on this now.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gephardt, ``We've got to get Social Security behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement on how to do that, the budget process is
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It spills over into everything, really,'' said Trent Duffy,
spokesman for House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any budget deal has to find some way to at least rhetorically
address the issue of Social Security,'' said a specialist on the
issue, Edward Lorenzen, legislative director for Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas. ``The question is whether what we do is
meaningful, or whether it is just for show.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's meeting with the GOP's congressional leadership,
both agreed not to tap into next year's Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   They remain at odds over how to produce a budget without it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have proposed slashing certain types of spending _
though not defense, which they've proposed to increase by about
$4.6 billion above what the Pentagon requested _ but they've ruled
out tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to pay for his proposed spending hikes for foreign
aid, education and the hiring of additional police officers by
raising cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack, a measure the White
House figures would bring in some $8 billion a year, and increasing
certain fees for businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Where the budget negotiations appear to be headed, analysts say,
is toward some sort of face-saving way for each side to admit that
they can't keep their hands off the Social Security surplus, which
totaled $125 billion for the year that ended Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is all comes down to,'' said Lorenzen, ``is either we
agree to a whole bunch of gimmicks or we find an honorable way for
both sides to say 'Oh, we couldn't balance the budget without
getting into the Social Security surplus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The key, for both sides, is an idea both parties call a Social
Security ``lock box,'' a legislative plan that, on paper at least,
would earmark all Social Security surplus money for paying down the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under current budget law, all money paid into the Social
Security system goes into the U.S. Treasury. There, the money is
converted into promises _ notes that say the Treasury will pay a
specified amount of money to two Social Security trust funds, out
of which comes the money to pay benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury then borrows the trust fund cash and may use it for
one of three purposes: to pay for government operations, to offset
tax cuts, or to pay down debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Republican lock box plan, the first two options would
be outlawed. The roughly $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses
over the coming decade would be used strictly to pay down debt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed his own version, a sort of ``lock box
plus.'' His plan also calls for earmarking the Social Security
surplus for debt reduction. But Clinton says that retiring the
entire $3.2 trillion portion of the debt owed to private banks and
investors by the year 2015 would eliminate interest payments that
cost taxpayers $235 billion this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan calls for taking $543 billion worth of interest
rate savings and pumping it into the Social Security trust funds
between 2011 and 2015. After that, under his plan, another $189
billion a year in interest savings would go into the funds.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to the White House, would keep the Social
Security program financially solvent until around the year 2050.
It's projected to go bankrupt by 2034 under its current funding
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes we have a historic opportunity this
year to reform Social Security. At a minimum, he would like to
agree on a down payment on reform by passing a Social Security lock
box that extends the life of Social Security until 2050 and pays
down debt,'' said Patrick Dorton, spokesman for the White House's
National Economic Council. ``The Republicans' lock box doesn't add
a single day to the life of Social Security.''

A SUBURBIASCAPE GROWS IN INNER-CITY CHICAGO

 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It is the familiar mallscape of suburbia, a big
supermarket and a strip of gleaming shops behind a parking lot the
size of a football field. But it is a stone's throw from a public
housing tower.
</P>
<P>
   This is 47th Street in the pockmarked North Kenwood section of
Chicago, where the population has dwindled by two-thirds in the
last 30 years, with whole blocks sitting vacant, rejected as
untouchable by investors who saw more danger than hope.
</P>
<P>
   Now investors see an urban Lazarus, a long-moribund neighborhood
coming back to life, a striking example of how economic prosperity
is changing the face of America. It is also a vivid illustration of
how a City Hall, which in Chicago is the landlord for much of the
cleared land, can transform a neighborhood by knocking down
eyesores, readying parcels and recruiting developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You walk inside this place, and you forget you're on the South
Side of Chicago,'' said Marty Murray, 43, as he marveled at the
selection at the Lake Park Pointe Shopping Center, which opened
this month. ``People out in the suburbs have had this forever. It's
just wonderful. You can get everything you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchored by the big Co-Op Markets supermarket, the $9.1 million
shopping center includes a bank, a real-estate office, a drugstore,
a dry cleaner and an eyesight clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A supermarket is the single most important ingredient to
betterment of life in poor, urban neighborhoods,'' said Joe
Schwieterman, an urban planner who is director of the Chaddick
Institute for Metropolitan Development at DePaul University.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets provide a savings of 15 percent to 20 percent
compared with little neighborhood stores, Schwieterman said. Money
spent in supermarkets is turned over in the community perhaps three
times, largely because such big grocery stores hire so many local
workers. Co-Op Markets, for example, employs more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also creates a perception of prosperity or commercial
vibrancy,'' he said. ``There's a place to go in the neighborhood
where there is the constant movement of people. It also helps give
a community a sense of identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing here,'' he added, ``is gentrification
gradually extending its reach into neighborhoods that had been
desolate.''
</P>
<P>
   North Kenwood was long been regarded as the poor, sometimes
frightening area near Hyde Park, an upscale neighborhood known for
its stately stone buildings and its Nobel laureates at the
University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd go through Kenwood on the way to a White Sox game and
that was about it,'' said Nancy Kiernan, a city planner. ``But its
time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last six months, residential property costs in the
neighborhood have soared to $10 a square foot from $4 a square
foot, with a flurry of new construction and remodeling driven
largely by demand from affluent young black professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Alderwoman Toni Preckwinkle, whose ward includes the shopping
center, said several people had told her, with evident pride,
``It's as nice as anything on the North Side.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Preckwinkle said that for many years developers had seen the
neighborhood as ``too dicey'' for investment, especially with a
high crime rate stoked by the illicit drug trade. But the new
development, residential and commercial, has chased away many of
the outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminals want peace and quiet and isolation in which to
do their business,'' she said. ``Now they've got neighbors who will
call the police on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fisk, the general manager of the Co-Op Markets, said he
was convinced a few years ago that the neighborhood was a market to
be tapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all seem to eat,'' Fisk said. ``And there were not too many
choices for people to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwieterman, the urban planner at DePaul, said many people in
poor urban neighborhoods traveled to inner-ring suburbs to shop for
groceries, a hardship for the consumers and a huge loss of
potential business for cities.
</P>
<P>
   Officers with the Chicago Police Department have been highly
visible around the new shopping center, as City Hall lends its
weight to make sure the new venture goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, the general manager, said his store had also hired a big
complement of security guards, inside and outside the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't feel safe,'' he said, ``they won't come to
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the hundreds of new jobs spawned by the shopping center
belongs to Jeffrey Billips, 17, who now earns $6.31 an hour bagging
groceries at Co-Op Markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys my age have gotten into stealing, selling drugs;
some of them have even been shot at,'' said Billips, the youngest
of five children, whose mother died last year of an asthma attack.
``This job is going to help me pay for college.''

SUBWAY SERIES OR AMTRAK SERIES, YANKEES ARE HAPPY AND RELIEVED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ His Yankee-blue shirt glistening wet from champagne,
Ramiro Mendoza rushed over to a corner of the visitors' clubhouse,
threw his right arm around the neck of Orlando Hernandez and pulled
his teammate close, in a headlock. ``Poppy!'' Mendoza squealed.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is often grumpy and security-guard serious, but he
beamed in the aftermath of Game 5 of the American League
Championship Series at Fenway Park, when the Yankees clinched their
36th pennant by defeating the Boston Red Sox, 6-1, in a game that
ended at 12:27 a.m. Tuesday. After Hernandez had pitched into the
eighth inning, Mendoza escaped a bases-loaded jam and found himself
an inning later in the center of the celebration on the infield, in
the embraces of teammates, and together they rushed into the
clubhouse to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was named the most valuable player of the series and
appeared to be fighting back tears as he received the trophy; his
brother Livan had been the most valuable player of the World Series
in 1997 with the Florida Marlins. Derek Jeter, Chuck Knoblauch and
Tino Martinez, close friends, posed together for a picture to
remember the moment. Roger Clemens, knowing now that he will
realize his dream of pitching in the World Series again, talked
about how excited he is.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, stood in the
middle of the room, amid a crowd of reporters, and talked about how
much heart his team had. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general
manager, mostly stood alone in a corner, sipping a beer, after a
long summer of battling with Steinbrenner; there were doubters,
Cashman was saying, even within the organization. Knoblauch poured
champagne over the head of Darryl Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   They were happy, but quite relieved _ a common emotion for this
team over the last two seasons, when the Yankees have coped with
enormous expectations and pressure, and personal trials. It has
been a hard year, David Cone was saying, and in the other corner,
Manager Joe Torre smiled and held a bottle of Dom Perignon in the
crook of his arm, like a football, and stiff-armed a question about
whether he hoped for a Subway Series against the Mets. ``What I
wanted, I got,'' Torre said. ``To get to the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees returned home and will have only a voluntary workout
at Yankee Stadium on Wednesday before holding full-fledged
practices Thursday and Friday. The Yankees beat Baltimore in five
games in the ALCS in 1996, and Torre believes the team suffered
from the extra time off. The Yankees lost the first two games of
the World Series that year to the Atlanta Braves before going on to
win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   But they could use the extra rest this year. Paul O'Neill, their
right fielder, is playing with a broken rib and needs as much down
time as possible, and Mariano Rivera, their closer, was so taxed by
his workload in Game 4 _ he pitched one and two-thirds innings _
that he was not available when the Yankees' lead was in jeopardy in
the eighth inning of Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   Torre can now set his pitching rotation any way he pleases and
customize it according to whomever the Yankees play. Hernandez
could start Saturday with his usual complement of four days' rest,
but he threw 138 pitches Monday and Torre wondered aloud if there
would have to be an adjustment made or that.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, Cone and Andy Pettitte all threw effectively against
the Red Sox; last year, Torre aligned his World Series rotation, in
large part, according to how the pitchers threw in the league
championship series. Then, Pettitte was the least effective and was
given the No. 4 slot.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre follows the same formula, then Clemens would pitch Game
4 this year, based on his brutal outing in Game 3 against the Red
Sox. He is the only Yankees starter to have lasted less than seven
innings in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Clemens such limited responsibility might have seemed
unthinkable, in view of his stature. But Torre has tackled similar
post-season issues in the past, benching Martinez in the World
Series in 1996, taking Jim Leyritz off the roster before the Boston
series this year, and then replacing Knoblauch in the eighth inning
Monday because of the fielding jitters that have plagued the former
Gold Glove winner.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees might tweak their roster for the World Series.
Leyritz indicated that he had been assured of rejoining the team if
it advanced to the World Series. To do so, the Yankees would have
to remove Shane Spencer, who went 1 for 9 against Boston, and play
with only four outfielders _ something of a risk, given O'Neill's
condition. Leyritz masked his frustration after being left off the
roster for the second round, but he might be more outspoken if he
is not activated for the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the Yankees remained neutral on whether
they preferred to play the Braves, in a rematch of the 1996 World
Series, or if they wished for the craziness that a Subway Series
would promise. Cone expressed only a hope for a further competitive
edge. ``I'd like to see them play two more 15-inning games,'' he
said, grinning. ``I'd like Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux come in to
pitch in relief; John Smoltz, too. I'd like to see Al Leiter and
Rick Reed throw about 190 pitches.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Knoblauch sounded intrigued _ and somewhat concerned _ by
the possibility of an all-New York World Series. ``If we're talking
about life and death, it would be kind of scary to play the Mets,''
he said. ``The city of New York would be pretty crazy, with riots,
and _ I'm being serious _ I'm worried about that stuff. But the
Mets have had an amazing run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting if it turns out to be the Mets. What a
way to end the millennium. It would be something that's never
happened in the modern era. You guys would have to work hard to
come up with ways to describe what the atmosphere would be and what
the city would be like, and the division of the city.''

SENATE HEADS OFF ANOTHER EFFORT TO PASS CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Hkuston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate derailed another attempt to pass
campaign finance legislation Tuesday as opponents of the measure
won enough backing to head off a final vote on the bill aimed at
curbing the influence of big money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the proposal that would ban unlimited and
unregulated ``soft-money'' contributions to the political parties
fell seven votes shy of the 60 they needed to break a
Republican-led filibustEr against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Republicans ended up voting with all 45 Democrats in favor
of the measure sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russell
Feingold, D-Wis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas
voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also derailed a second, broader bill passed 252-177
by the House last month that would have imposed severe restrictions
on campaign attack ads in addition to banning soft-money donations
from special interests, corporations, unions and rich individuals.
That vote of 52-48 fell eight votes short of the 60 needed to cut
off debate and hold a final vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The original McCain-Feingold bill resembled the House measure,
but the senators removed language dealing with attack ads in hopes
of picking up more support from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has made campaign finance reform the centerpiece of
his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, found it
difficult to hide his bitterness over the tactics used by his own
GOP leadership in its effort to kill his legislation. He took
particular aim at Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who
had promised to allow McCain five days of debate on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Lott, an opponent of the bill, gave only three
full days for the debate and even turned down a plea from McCain to
convene the Senate on Tuesday morning to allow a few more hours of
consideration before the vote on ending the filibuster was held in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not treated fairly. We were promised five full days of
debate. That promise was not honored,'' a miffed McCain said after
Lott moved to have the campaign finance bill removed from the
Senate calendar of business for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead for the year,'' Lott later told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain threatened to use whatever parliamentary tactics he can
to bring it up again, even it means going against his own
leadership and tying up other Senate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to exercise every option that we can conceive of. We
will not give up in the Senate and we will take our case to the
American people. And eventually, we will prevail,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But later he backed away from the threat, telling reporters,
``We clearly don't have enough traction'' to move the bill this
year.
</P>
<P>
   While not shying away from his criticism of Lott and his fellow
Republicans, McCain also blamed the Democrats for using tactics
like blocking amendments to his legislation that could have helped
win more support. ``Responsibility for what happened lies on both
sides of the aisle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win additional support, the McCain-Feingold bill
was trimmed down from its previous version, which would have
imposed tough guidelines on the use of negative ``issue ads''
funded by outside groups that are used primarily to attack
candidates. Sponsors of the ads, who often use front names to run
them in order to remain anonymous, are not subject to federal
regulations as long as they do not specifically urge people to vote
for or against a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the final bill contained only one objective _ to
ban the unlimited and unregulated money that flows by the millions
each year into both Republican and Democratic Party coffers. Known
as ``soft money,'' its sources _ corporations, wealthy individuals,
unions and other special interest groups _ can be hard to track and
often go undisclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, these unregulated contributions often went to help
the parties finance get-out-the-vote drives. But in recent years
they have increasingly been used to fund negative advertising
campaigns against candidates on behalf of the parties. The parties
have come to rely on them as a means of circumventing federal
limitations on donations by individuals and groups to specific
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the clear use of soft money to get around
limitations, opponents of the bill led by Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., argued that prohibiting the unregulated contributions would
violate the First Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate, McCain sought to paint the Senate and
House as pawns in a campaign finance system that allows the rich
and powerful to buy influence in Washington, while taxpayers ``get
shafted,'' as he put it, by federal budgets filled with ``pork
barrel spending'' designed to reward special interest campaign
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not accusing any member of violating federal bribery
statutes, but we are all tainted by a system that the public
believes, rightly, results in greater representation to moneyed
interests than to average citizens,'' McCain said in a speech
following the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it that these interests expect for their generosity?
Good government. No, they expect a financial return ... and they
get it _ often at the expense of average Americans. Would they keep
giving us millions of dollars if they weren't getting that in
return? Of course not,'' McCain added.
</P>
<P>
   To make his point, McCain noted the dramatic increase in the
amount of soft money being raised since the 1996 election cycle.
During the first six months of this year, the parties took in a
combined $53 million, a 75 percent increase in just three years.

REPUBLICANS AND CLINTON START TALKS ON POSSIBLE BUDGET DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (See related story, BUDGET-POLITICS) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Republican congressional
leaders took the first step on Tuesday night toward striking a deal
on the federal budget, meeting at the White House for more than 90
minutes and promising to work diligently toward a final agreement
over the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side made any concessions on Tuesday night and no
specific differences were bridged. But both sides agreed that the
mere fact that the president and the Republicans could meet
cordially and discuss common goals, despite their mutual mistrust
and distaste, was a sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did today was start the clock on the week when things
will get done,'' Jacob J. Lew, the president's budget director,
said in an interview after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said he would be on Capitol Hill Wednesday to begin working
on the differences with congressional budget writers.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert called the session ``a very
positive meeting.'' Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Senate
Republican leader, said, ``Now we've got to roll up our sleeves.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and the Republicans agreed, officials said, that
no money raised from Social Security taxes would be used for
purposes other than paying Social Security benefits or retiring
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been insisting for months that as a matter of
principle they would not dip into the surplus in Social Security
money to pay for other programs. The Congressional Budget Office
calculates that spending bills still working their way through
Congress would dip into the surplus. Republican leaders maintain
that if that is the case, the bills will be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget does not rely on Social Security money to pay
for other programs, and he has said all along that if Republicans
do not want to tap that money, it is fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional leaders agreed on Tuesday night to send the
chairmen of the various Appropriations subcommittees to meet with
the president if he thought that would help resolve specific points
of disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said the president noted that government's interest costs in
the years ahead would be lower as the national debt was paid down
and recommended that these savings in debt service be dedicated to
bolstering the Social Security trust fund. Lew said Republicans did
not reject this proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk of progress on Tuesday night masked the wide
differences between the two sides. And in some instances, the
congressional leaders and White House officials had different
versions of what was said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Republicans said the president had agreed that
no tax increases would be part of any budget deal. John Podesta,
the White House chief of staff, said that the president had
conceded that the 55-cent-per-pack rise he has proposed on
cigarettes might not be possible but that Clinton still thought a
smaller tobacco tax increase should be on the table.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was no hint as to how some of the fundamental
divisions on policy could be resolved. Among the main differences
are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress has rejected the president's proposal for spending
federal education money to reduce class sizes and hire more
teachers. The Republicans want the money to go to the states in
block grants to be spent as the states wish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lawmakers have insisted on dozens of provisions in the
Interior Department spending bill that are favored by oil, cattle
and mining interests and that the administration believes would
damage the environment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress has rejected an appropriation the president sought
for more community police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there is a big difference between the two sides in
how the budget questions should be addressed in the remainder of
the year. Hastert said, for instance, that he favored the ``regular
order'' of considering each spending bill separately. The president
and Democrats in Congress prefer combining most or all of the
remaining matters in one big bill that the president could then
either sign or veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't deal with one piece without knowing what the last
piece is going to be,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 spending bills to fund the various departments and
agencies of the government in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1,
five have become law, and the president plans to sign a sixth _ for
veterans and housing _ on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two bills, one for foreign operations and the other for the
District of Columbia, have been vetoed.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has completed action on bills to fund the Defense and
Agriculture Departments. White House officials said the president
will not decide whether to sign or reject these measures until he
sees how other bills are worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The final three bills _ one for the Departments of Labor,
Education and Health and Human Services, one for the Interior
Department and one for the Departments of Commerce, State and
Justice _ have created considerable controversy in Congress, and
the White House has said the president will veto them unless they
are significantly changed from where they now stand.

BRINGING AMERICA UP TO SPEED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New art has rarely had as many reluctant champions as
``Sensation,'' the exhibition of work by young English artists from
the collection of Charles Saatchi, the English advertising
executive, at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   People both inside and outside the art world have been defending
to the death the exhibition's right to be seen in a public museum,
while turning up their noses at the art it contains or dismissing
it wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   The surrounding furor has made it possible, for the art world
conveniently and perhaps self-protectively, to play up the show's
shortcomings, ignore its merits and diversity and avoid considering
what its arrival on these shores might mean.
</P>
<P>
   As the prevailing litany goes, ``Sensation'' is two years old,
much of the work in it was made before 1995, some of it has already
been shown in galleries here, it has been superseded by new, more
interesting developments in English art, and it was never the whole
story, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   All of this may be true, but in a strange way it doesn't matter.
Seeing so much of the notorious British art of the '90s together in
the grand 19th-century galleries of a big New York museum _ a
tellingly rare sight _ is quite different from watching it trickle
out one artist at a time in the city's commercial art galleries.
</P>
<P>
   However mixed ``Sensation'' is, the show brings Americans up to
speed on the genesis of the large and noisy London scene. It
captures a particular moment and makes what these artists have done
more undeniable and real to us, and maybe even to them. And for
better or worse, ``real'' may be what it is all about.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the work in ``Sensation'' is disturbing because it
brings together the real and the esthetic with a crash that is
audible to many different kinds of people. It builds on ideas and
strategies present in contemporary art since the early 1960s, but
it tends to give them a vividness that their predecessors in
provocation _ the Fluxus artists of the early 1960s, the
Conceptualists of the 1970s and even the appropriation artists of
the 1980s _ seldom imagined.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, political correctness and art theory have nothing
to do with it; this work is about mirroring, not moralizing. For
another, the best of it revels in the physical, using material,
craft, displacement and juxtaposition to sometimes breathtaking
effect.
</P>
<P>
   It largely disdains the theatrical embrace and high-tech
gadgetry of installation art, preferring instead to compress
theatricality into discrete portable art objects, objects that
demand a traditionally buffered one-on-one relationship to the
viewer, a zone of separation in which there's a possibility of awe.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Damien Hirst's shark, the idea and the reality of
what has been done hang in perfect balance. This is idea art that
you can't simply ``get'' from a second-hand description _ the old
cliche about Conceptualism. You have to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Rachel Whiteread's ``Ghost,'' a work in
plaster that looks mammoth until you realize that it is a cast of
the interior of an English sitting room, and of Ron Mueck's
gigantic ``Mask'' a self-portrait that resembles a terrifyingly
angry parent with wonderfully intimate blown-up details _ a two-day
beard made of little blades of steel, for example.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it is also true of more hermetic artists whose work has
raised no hackles, like the painter Glenn Brown. Building on the
appropriation work of artists like Richard Prince and Sherrie
Levine, Brown has copied an existing work of art _ Salvador Dali's
``Premonition of Civil War,'' 1936 _ but he has done it by hand,
with paint on canvas, so that his meticulous labor conveys a sense
of quiet bravura.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists in ``Sensation'' take for granted that art
has a role in society; they cannot avoid making manifest something
that is latent _ and not just in themselves. Peter Saul, an
American painter whose subjects have included the execution of John
Wayne Gacy, may have put it most succinctly when he said, ``I'm not
making this stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   The world consumes tons of meat and kills millions of animals to
do so. Why not take a close look at some of the animals from which
it comes? This is what you do when looking at Hirst's cows,
sectioned and suspended solemnly, without further ado in vitrines
of formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ofili did not invent pornography; it is all around us. He
simply uses it in a way that is beautiful and double-edged. Why
shouldn't a contemporary Madonna, even a loopy, exotic one, be
surrounded by starkly contemporary images of sin?
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Lucas' evocation of the sexual points up society's
obsession with bodies, especially female ones, in an appropriately
leering, Rabelaisian manner, giving back as good as women have
often gotten. Similarly, society, not the Chapman brothers, created
the fetishization of children that their mutated and deformed
mannequins evoke; they only make us look at it.
</P>
<P>
   A better piece by the Chapmans is their ``Great Deeds Against
the Dead,'' a three-dimensional, life-size, vividly colored
translation of a particularly gruesome image from Goya's
``Disasters of War.'' Not only does this enlargement return to this
well-known image some of the power that it must have had in Goya's
time; it also takes into account the fact that war's disasters have
gotten much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw ``Sensation'' in London, it seemed too specifically
English in its subjects and effects to travel. But it has survived
and, as in London, broken through the ``fourth wall'' that usually
separates the art world from the rest of society. To see it in New
York is to understand that England's is more than an island art.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides a glimpse of the simple, immediate and healthy
reaction that Europeans must have had when the first survey of
Abstract Expressionism arrived in the late 1950s: this has happened
elsewhere and should be known and understood here.

 &HT;    Suspicion, fear among the feelings migrant workers face
 &HT;    (EDS: With sidebars, MIGRANT-SIDE and MIGRANT-TRACKING.)

<P>
   NEW CARLISLE, Ohio _ Missi Roddy says people look at her
differently when she's behind the wheel of the short school bus
that says ``Migrant'' on the side.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that anybody shouts anything or makes an obscene
gesture, but Roddy can tell by the looks on their faces or by how
long they stare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heads don't turn as often when you're driving the normal
school bus,'' she said recently as she drove the Texas Migrant
Council Head Start bus down state Route 571 from Tipp City to New
Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   This reaction arises because people don't understand the migrant
way of life, Roddy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly couldn't pack up my family and move for six to
nine months of the year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   An arson fire this spring at the Texas Migrant Council Head
Start center brought to the surface feelings in the community. Not
all New Carlisle residents welcome Latino migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the migrant school burnt down, a lot of people talked
about it, and a lot of people talked about it being racial,'' Roddy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Head Start center in New Carlisle, which first opened a year
ago, was preparing to reopen for the spring when it was damaged by
fire in April. The reopening had to be delayed a month.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators called the fire arson, but stopped short of
labeling it a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Still there is grumbling in New Carlisle about the migrant
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more ignorance than anything,'' Mayor Gene Collier said.
``We need to educate people about what's going on and why these
people are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have asked Collier why the police don't break up
groups of Latino men standing in the downtown at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, (people say) the downtown areas of New
Carlisle are going to hell because they are standing there,'' he
said. ``The presence of them standing there makes some people
uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   North Hampton resident Amy Brandyberry said she doesn't like the
fact that migrant workers are eligible for federal child and health
care benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband has to work six days a week to support my family,''
she said. ``I can't get free health care.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of stories about the lives of migrant workers in the
Springfield News-Sun prompted her to call the News-Sun to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to read the paper every day because they're on
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brandyberry said migrants should learn English if they are going
to live in Ohio. She believes nurseries shouldn't be allowed to
bring in migrant workers and pay them minimum wage because they are
taking away jobs from locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get everything handed to them and it's ridiculous,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Don Lucas of the Clark County Sheriff's Department recently
spoke to a group of parents at the Texas Migrant Council Head Start
center to help explain what role law enforcement plays in the
community. Lucas said officers are hoping to bridge the gap between
the white community and the Latino community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say in general they (Latinos) get along fairly well,''
Lucas said. But, he added, ``A lot of people in the city don't care
to interact with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said deputies have Spanish handbooks in their cruisers and
a list of bilingual people to call if they need to do a more
in-depth investigation. He said there have been no serious
allegations of crime involving the Latino community recently.
</P>
<P>
   Loud music complaints are about as serious as it gets, Lucas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Paul Conrad, a retired minister, helps organize Spanish
services for migrant workers at the Huber Mennonite Church. He said
many in the community don't understand migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unaware, not so much of their presence, but unaware of
who they are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy, who's been driving a bus for the Tecumseh School District
for five years and the migrant bus for four, said she takes the
time to ask a lot of questions. When she first took the job, her
family worried about her safety, she said. They didn't like the
idea of her driving a school bus down a dirt road to a migrant camp
before sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy said people don't share their prejudices with her much
anymore because she works closely with the migrant families.
</P>
<P>
   The ignorance about what migrant workers do causes hard
feelings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few white people will go out in the fields and work as
hard as these people do,'' she said. ``I think people look down on
them because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Roddy, a petite woman with long blond hair, comforted a girl
with a fever on a cool September day while waiting for other
migrant children to board the bus. She greeted some with hugs and
handed out suckers to each child as they arrived home to waiting
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Roddy invites the children to her home to let them ride her
horses, feed the goats and play with her cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so much pleasure for those kids to get on that horse with
me and ride,'' she said. ``They don't take anything for granted and
everything is just wonderful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The migrant families have been generous, too. Roddy broke her
left arm in the summer and had to have surgery. She was out of work
for a few weeks, so the families took up a collection, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents donated two big grocery baskets overflowing with
food to help me out,'' she said. ``That meant a lot to me.''

   With the element of surprise working to her advantage, Lupita _
more than a few inches smaller than almost everyone else _ tore
around the circle and made it safely back to her seat without
getting tagged.
</P>
<P>
   The children, all sons and daughters of local migrant workers,
counted, read, colored, sang and jumped at Medway Elementary School
during summer remedial classes. Ranging from kindergartners to
fifth-graders, the 44 children continued learning so they would be
better prepared to start school in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers from the Tecumseh School District and bilingual aides
spent 30 days this summer helping the children strengthen language,
reading and math skills. It's the second year the district has
participated in the state and federally funded program, said
program coordinator Dena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are excellent,'' she said. ``They are so
well-behaved. They work hard in class. Parents are supportive with
everything, you can see it in the kids. They are excited about
being here every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the school year, parents took the time to fill out
surveys about the program. Four parents indicated they wanted to
join a parent support group organized by the Ohio Migrant Education
Center, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The children are held to the same standards in the summer as all
other students are throughout the school year. Those who stay in
the area take the same proficiency tests as children of non-migrant
workers, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tecumseh district receives federal money through the Title I
grant program to pay for all aspects of the program, including
busing, breakfast, lunch, custodians, teachers and aides, she said.
The program pays rent to the district for use of the school
building.
</P>
<P>
   During the school year, the federal grant pays for bilingual
translators in schools where migrant children are taught, said
Tecumseh Assistant Superintendent Tim Hopkins. Last year, 132
migrant students were eligible to attend public schools. This fall,
about 85 are enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The school district couldn't afford to place bilingual aides in
the high school this fall, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what resources we have, we manned the elementary and ran
out of funds to be able to put an aide at the high school,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 17 children of migrant workers at the high school this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students attend school here until Thanksgiving,
spend four months in Texas and return to finish the year here. But
many are staying in the area, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The kindergartners and first-graders in Beth Moore's summer
class started the day by counting how many days they'd been at
summer school. They stopped when they hit 19, prompting one of the
students to ask a question: ``Are we going all the way to 100?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not this summer,'' Moore replied.
</P>
<P>
   After that it was on to a flashcard game pitting the King Cobras
against the Bunnies. The children recognized words such as ``go,''
``run'', ``play'' and ``I'' before running into a word they didn't
immediately recognize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are,'' said Yvonne Tafolla, 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yvonne, that's wonderful!'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   As they lined up to go to the auditorium to practice for an open
house for parents, Moises Martinez, 6, fidgeted with his pants and
said he needed a belt. He still had a little way to go before he
would fit into his long jean shorts.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Moises danced on stage with his classmates
_ one hand holding up his pants, the other performing the motions
of the Ricky Martin song ``Cup of Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the children were told that the cup of life in the
song represents their chance to use education to find a better
life. And it doesn't hurt that Latin teen idol Martin is one of the
hottest new artists this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to kiss him,'' said 6-year-old Maria Cano, sending her
table of lunch pals into a fit of giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the children went on a field trip to wrap up a
learning unit _ the Cincinnati Zoo, Glen Helen Nature Preserve in
Yellow Springs and the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus.
For many, the trips were a chance to take in area sights they may
not otherwise see, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The trips, the math drills, learning to speak out in a play and
tossing a football at recess are all components that make up the
summer school experience. But most of all, the school aims to make
sure the children are proficient in English, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not offering bilingual education,'' he said. ``We need
to bring them up to speed in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Students come in at all levels, with some children who are
fluent in English and others who can't read it or speak it, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How difficult it must be to be a second- or third-grader
sitting in a room with 25 other kids and not understanding any of
the lessons and being expected to do the work,'' Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He said public schools have an obligation to teach all kids.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of the children are bilingual, Lupita
Martinez knew no English when she started summer school. Other
children translated for her when necessary, and she took the role
of Spanish narrator in the school play.
</P>
<P>
   The language barrier also is a problem for adults. Williams
speaks no Spanish yet is expected to communicate with parents who
may speak no English. Williams said she wants to learn Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're at such a disadvantage when you try to talk to a
parent,'' she said. ``I want to be able to talk to them myself, and
I want them to be able to talk to me and express their feelings.''

 &HT;    State officials hope new tracking system will aid children

<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ The state is hoping a new way of keeping
track of children of migrant workers will make for a smoother
transition for kids attending school in two states.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is one of eight states that soon will be able to track
grades, classes and immunization records as the children move
around with their parents. The state is in the process of getting
connected to a database, ``the New Generation System'', said John
Kreis, director of the Ohio Migrant Education Center in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   As it is now, some children are immunized repeatedly because
they don't have the records to prove they've already had their
shots, he said. Teachers and administrators fax records and make
phone calls to find out about their progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of Ohio's migrant labor comes from Texas, the new
system will provide a valuable link between the states, he said.
Only certain people are issued passwords to ensure the security of
the site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be more able to quickly start them in the appropriate
class,'' Kreis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis said about 5,000 children of migrant workers spend at
least part of the year in Ohio. Of those, nearly half come from
Texas. About 20 percent come from Florida, which has a different
database, he said. Children served by the program are between 3 and
21 years old and their parents must establish residency in the
state and work in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   The database should help eliminate some of the confusion the
children feel when changing schools, Kreis said. Schools around the
state _ including those in the Tecumseh School District _ will
provide information to the Migrant Education Center, which will put
it in the database, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kreis said the database will create a ``seamless education
system as (children travel from state to state, place to place.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is working with Mexico to set up a system to provide
records, he said. The federal government is working to build a
system that will link different databases so teachers can have
access to information in many different states, Kreis said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long-term, Kreis believes migrant students will benefit
from what he called ``virtual school,'' which would allow the
children to work on the same curriculum regardless of the state
they're in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be the wave of the future,'' he said. ``It makes
sense in the long run.''

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, CHINESE COMPANY INDICTED IN '94 EQUIPMENT SALE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Resending to correct slug; sent earlier as CHINA-MISSILES)   (Eds: Will be led.)  
(nk) 
 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and a powerful state-owned aerospace company in China
on charges of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale
of American machining equipment, some of which was diverted to a
Chinese military site.
</P>
<P>
   The case could complicate relations between Beijing and
Washington just as China and the United States are trying to
complete one of the biggest trade agreements in history _ China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, American and Chinese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonni Tischler, the assistant commissioner for investigations
for the U.S. Customs Service, said at a news briefing Tuesday that
the indictment was the ``first time a Chinese government entity has
been indicted for violations of U.S. export laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges McDonnell Douglas, a unit of the Boeing
Co., and the Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnel Douglas,
with 13 counts, including conspiracy, false statements and
misrepresentations in connection with a 1994 export license to sell
13 pieces of machining equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains 12 charges against the buyer of the equipment,
the China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corp., or
Catic, and Catic affiliates in Beijing and California.
</P>
<P>
   Two Chinese nationals employed by Catic were also indicted, as
was a mid-level McDonnell Douglas employee, Robert J. Hitt, the
director of the China program office at Douglas Aircraft in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boeing and Catic representatives denied any wrongdoing and
vowed to contest the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonnell Douglas Corporation did not commit any criminal
violations in regard to the sale of the machine tools to the
People's Republic of China and intends to vigorously defend against
the charges brought by the United States Attorney's Office,''
Boeing said in a statement. ``It is unfortunate that the
prosecutors have apparently not taken the time to learn the facts
and gain a full understanding of a rather complicated matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred F. Fielding, a partner in the Washington law firm of Wiley,
Rein &AMP; Fielding who represents Catic and its affiliates, said:
``Catic has cooperated fully with the government investigation and
has strongly maintained throughout that it has never intentionally
violated any U.S. laws. This is a commercial transaction involving
the sale of used machinery and the government's position that this
is a criminal or national security case is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tischler said the diversion of civilian technology for
military uses by China was a top priority for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also released a lengthy background paper that suggested
that one of the company's defenses is that top Clinton
administration officials knew important details about the deal, so
they could not have been misled.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation of the deal began in 1996. Lengthy
plea-bargain negotiations between defense lawyers, and Lisa Prager,
the assistant U.S. attorney who handled the inquiry, broke down
Tuesday night, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Catic bought the machining equipment, which is used to bend
steel in manufacturing aircraft, for only $5 million. But the sale
was part of a billion-dollar deal in which McDonnell Douglas was to
build trunkliner, or middle-size commuter, aircraft in China. The
indictment cites an October 1993 meeting in which Douglas
executives agreed they were negotiating the sale of the machining
equipment ``due to the pending $1 billion trunkliner program.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the sale of the machining equipment,
McDonnell Douglas discovered that some of it had not gone to the
intended destination, a civilian site in Beijing, but instead wound
up 800 miles away, at a military site in Nanchang that makes
surface-to-surface missiles and fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas reported the diversion in 1995, before the
equipment had been put to use. The giant machines were later moved
to a civilian location. The airliner deal, which President Clinton
hailed on the eve of the 1994 election as a job-rich program for 20
planes, has produced only one plane, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The airliner deal was promoted by Clinton and then Commerce
Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who died in a plane crash in Croatia in
1996, as a centerpiece of the administration's commercial
diplomacy, the policy of using economic engagement to broaden ties
with Beijing and promote exports. On the eve of a trip to China in
1994, Brown wrote a letter to China's vice premier about the
airliner deal based on a draft letter from Douglas, according to
Boeing's release. The machining equipment license was issued soon
after Brown returned from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   State Department cables obtained by defense lawyers in the case
show that administration officials delayed seeking timely
assurances from Catic on how it planned to use the machining
equipment so as not to disrupt Brown's announcement about the deal
in China, according to lawyers and officials who have read the
cables.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Catic officials caused six of the
machines to be diverted to Nanchang. It also charges that McDonnell
Douglas officials concealed or failed to disclose important
information from Commerce Department licensing officials, including
that the airliner deal was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says that McDonnell Douglas, which was
bought by Boeing in 1997, concealed its hiring of a ``high ranking
former government official and his consulting firm'' that was paid
$4 million ``to intercede with Catic'' and China ``because the
trunkliner negotiations were stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case said the former official referred
to in the indictment was Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former
secretary of state. Woody Goldberg, a spokesman for Haig's firm,
confirmed their representation of McDonnell Douglas on the China
airliner deal.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the corporate defendants face an aggregate maximum
criminal fine of about $10 million. The corporate defendants could
also be restricted in their future trade dealings if convicted. The
individual defendants face a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.

CLINTON, GOP LEADERS TO ADDRESS SPENDING FIGHT WITHOUT USING SOCIAL
SECURITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a day of political posturing on Capitol Hill,
President Clinton and congressional leaders agreed to place the
entire Social Security surplus off-limits and set about resolving a
spending impasse that has left many government agencies without
budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans left the Tuesday evening White House session hailing
the ``good progress'' made during an hourlong meeting. Democrats
predicted the budget logjam would be broken within a week.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders gathered for the first time to outline
their various positions on the budget. Three of the government's 13
spending bills remain in Congress. Clinton has signed five, vetoed
two and three are on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   An optimistic Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said,
``We've given ourselves seven days within which to deal with the
remaining obstacles that are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made good progress today,'' House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., said. ``It was a very positive meeting, and we
look forward to working through this process.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was how to meet Clinton's spending priorities _ more
teachers, more police officers, more forest land, money for the
Middle East peace process _ when Republicans have put off limits
the Social Security surplus and any tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he had
three budget points for the president: ``First, I think it's good
we're getting together. Secondly, whatever we do, we should not
touch Social Security (surplus). And three, we should do it without
raising taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also said Clinton's plan to raise the cigarette
tax by 55 cents, an issue defeated earlier in the day by the House,
remained in play. ``There's a long way from 1 cent to 55 cents. And
that is still on the table and very much alive,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said the only item taken off the table was the use of
the Social Security surplus to finance any of the spending bills,
although he again questioned whether Republicans weren't already
spending $19 billion of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   And, they said, Clinton also urged Republicans to consider a
plan to extend the solvency of Social Security rather than just set
aside the surplus for the Social Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the president's chief of staff, said the White
House shares the Republicans' goal of not spending the Social
Security surplus ``not withstanding the fact that we question
whether their gimmicks and numbers add up.''
</P>
<P>
   He said White House advisers will begin today meeting with
congressional appropriation members to ``see if we can make all
these pieces come together.''
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative tenure following the White House session seemed
far more conciliatory than the partisan wrangling that occurred
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the White House session, House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Lewisville, and Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, held a
news conference to proclaim budgetary victory and to replay
portions of Clinton's 1999 State of the Union address in which he
called for setting aside 60 percent of the projected surplus for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They claim Clinton now has agreed with Republicans to save 100
percent of the surplus for Social Security and debt reduction.
``We're all here right now to proclaim victory,'' DeLay said.
``This is a victory for the Republican agenda for America.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Joe Lockhart disputed Republican
contentions, again accusing Republicans of already spending some of
the Social Security surplus that they claim is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are trying to use the `night is day' argument;
that `we'll do something, but we're going to say we're not doing
it.' But I'll tell you something, everybody knows what they're
doing,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have seized on a Congressional Budget Office report
projecting Republicans would spend a portion of the Social Security
surplus. However, Republicans gave CBO different budget numbers and
received a CBO letter stating the Social Security surplus was
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a brief bipartisan respite, Congress passed
another stopgap spending measure that will keep the government
operating past a Thursday deadline. The resolution, which extends
government spending through Oct. 29, awaits Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton would sign the resolution extending
spending for another eight days past the Thursday deadline. The
measure passed the Senate on a voice vote and the House on a 421-2
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House spent much of its day in a tit-for-tat spat over
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also made a symbolic show of dismissing Clinton's
$19 billion in tax increase provisions, including the 55-cent
cigarette tax, that he proposed as a way to pay for the spending
increases he outlined in his 2000 budget proposal in January. It
failed unanimously as Democrats refused, they said, to play the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's stop the stunts. Let's stop the gimmicks. Let's go to
the White House today and sit down and see if we can work this out
and make sense of it,'' said Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans used the occasion to hammer Clinton for proposing a
federal tax increase when taxes already are too high and a surplus
is growing. ``That the president would propose adding to this
record high tax burden is outrageous,'' said Rep. David Price,
R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, mocked Republicans for criticizing
Clinton without having a substitute plan. ``Where is the
Republicans' secret plan? I can't find it,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, in turn, tried to drag the Republicans' 10-year, $792
billion tax cut bill, which Clinton had vetoed last month, to the
floor to embarrass the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., who led the effort, said the
Republicans' tax cut plan was the biggest threat to the Social
Security surplus and amounted to the real raid on the Social
Security fund. ``It simply backed the truck up to the treasury and
emptied it,'' Cardin said. Republicans, largely along a party line
vote, set aside Cardin's effort on a 215-203 tally.

   Walking across the UC Berkeley campus on Friday,  &UR; Steve &LR; 
 &UR; Finacom &LR;  spied filmmakers at work on ``Boys &AMP; Girls,'' which will
star  &UR; Freddie Prinze Jr. &LR;  At Sproul Plaza and Sather Gate, the
movie crew had set up tables of fake student organizations for an
outdoor scene. Finacom jotted down some of them, to be seen someday
soon in a theater near you:
</P>

   Association of Students for a Better Society,; &LR;  the Wickens
Circle (a misspelling of Wiccans or Dickens or a union of wicker
workers?), Ecological Modernization Organization, Leftist Student
Union, Association of Students for Politician (Politician?)

   &UR; FEDS SPIED ON ROCK 'N' ROLLERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the wild and crazy rock 'n' roll days of the '60s and
'70s, FBI agents regularly filed reports on performances of the
Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, according to FBI and CIA
documents obtained by APBnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   A 1984 memo in the group's FBI file said ``the Grateful Dead is
well known to DEA.'' The file shows that the Drug Enforcement
Administration had contacted the FBI and sought help ``for
technical and surveillance coverage'' on a drug investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful Dead spokesman  &UR; Dennis McNally &LR;  said that it was no
surprise, &LR;  and that the Dead knew it was being spied on. ``The
single largest group consuming LSD were Deadheads, and the DEA knew
that. You assumed anybody you met in the Grateful Dead scene could
be a plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassist  &UR; Jack Casady &LR;  of the Jefferson Airplane said his group,
too, was aware ``of some sort of police presence.'' The group's
file mentions its connection with an anti-Nixon demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   But the woolly Dead and the wild Airplane weren't the only
groups under scrutiny. FBI agents spent hours playing ``Louie
Louie'' backward and forward, unsuccessfully looking for hidden
meanings in the Kingsmen's hit. ``Like the government didn't have
something better to do than follow the Kingsmen around,'' said
Kingsman  &UR; Dick Peterson &LR; . ``We were a bunch of clean-cut guys from
the Northwest. We didn't know anything about subverting the moral
standards of America.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WAY WE ARE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ Asking Americans whether they define themselves as
meat-and-potato eaters is moot. According to a Gallup survey
reported in Bon Appetit, the current breakdown of people, as they
describe themselves, is: meat and potatoes, 35 percent; chicken and
broccoli, 34 percent; brown rice and vegetables, 12 percent; pasta
and salad, 10 percent.

   &UR; FEDS SPIED ON ROCK 'N' ROLLERS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   During the wild and crazy rock 'n' roll days of the '60s and
'70s, FBI agents regularly filed reports on performances of the
Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, according to FBI and CIA
documents obtained by APBnews.com.
</P>
<P>
   A 1984 memo in the group's FBI file said ``the Grateful Dead is
well known to DEA.'' The file shows that the Drug Enforcement
Administration had contacted the FBI and sought help ``for
technical and surveillance coverage'' on a drug investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful Dead spokesman  &UR; Dennis McNally &LR;  said that it was no
surprise, &LR;  and that the Dead knew it was being spied on. ``The
single largest group consuming LSD were Deadheads, and the DEA knew
that. You assumed anybody you met in the Grateful Dead scene could
be a plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassist  &UR; Jack Casady &LR;  of the Jefferson Airplane said his group,
too, was aware ``of some sort of police presence.'' The group's
file mentions its connection with an anti-Nixon demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   But the woolly Dead and the wild Airplane weren't the only
groups under scrutiny. FBI agents spent hours playing ``Louie
Louie'' backward and forward, unsuccessfully looking for hidden
meanings in the Kingsmen's hit. ``Like the government didn't have
something better to do than follow the Kingsmen around,'' said
Kingsman  &UR; Dick Peterson &LR; . ``We were a bunch of clean-cut guys from
the Northwest. We didn't know anything about subverting the moral
standards of America.''

CONFIDENTIALITY BREACHED IN NBA DRUG-TESTING PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association briefly suspended its new
drug-testing program last week, after union leaders complained that
confidentiality had been breached during the first three weeks of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the players association said that a core provision of
the drug-testing effort had been violated, and the entire program
called into question, because a reporter had learned that about a
half-dozen players tested positive for marijuana early this month,
during the first week of tests.
</P>
<P>
   NBA officials said that they, too, were concerned about the
disclosure, and they agreed late last week to halt the drug
testing. League officials met Tuesday with Billy Hunter, the
executive director of the players association, and other union
leaders. They decided to resume testing, but participants in the
meeting declined to say why or when.
</P>
<P>
   Two people with knowledge of the tests told The New York Times
last week that about a half-dozen players had tested positive for
marijuana among more than 120 players on the first teams to be
tested. Both the union and the league have separately discussed
with their employees their displeasure over the disclosure and
their desire to find out who leaked the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most tense it's been between both sides since we
almost lost the season last January,'' said a basketball official,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``There is a feeling that
this whole matter could end up blowing up the drug agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug-testing program is one of the cornerstones of the new
collective bargaining agreement, over which the NBA and the union
fought last year, causing the temporary shutdown of the league. The
new program expanded the number of substances for which players
would be tested. In the past, the league tested players only for
cocaine and heroin. The new program also permits the testing of
players for marijuana, amphetamines, LSD and steroids.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the new agreement enables the league to
routinely test all players at least once each year. Only rookies
were tested routinely under the old drug program.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for banning players who test positive for
cocaine, heroin, amphetamines and LSD, but it has a sliding scale
of progressively more serious punishments for marijuana and
steroids. The idea is to encourage players to get treatment and
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   A first-time offender for marijuana can continue to play
basketball, but must enroll in a league-administered treatment
program. A second offense would include a $15,000 fine, along with
mandatory treatment, and a third offense would result in five-game
suspension as well as treatment. Players cannot be dismissed from
the league for marijuana use, but they can serve consecutive
five-game suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality is an essential part of the program. Not even
the teams are supposed to be told when a player tests positive for
marijuana the first or second time. When asked about the results
from the first round of tests, the players association said
initially that it had not been notified of the results, nor had the
players who tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   When two players were interviewed, both of whom had been
identified by people familiar with the test results as having
tested positive, each said he had not been told by either the
league or the players association that he had failed the test. One
player insisted he had not used marijuana, and the other declined
to discuss whether he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidentiality issue is important,'' Hunter said last
week. ``The whole idea is, you want to encourage people to come
forward, rather than being afraid of being caught. The idea is to
provide assistance and help them rehab themselves. If they're
fronted, they're subject to ridicule. This kind of exposure just
ruins the whole process.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, players on 25 of the 29 teams have now been tested.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement between the NBA and the players union,
neither the league nor the union can comment on the test results.
Players who tested positive were to be told about the result when
all the tests were completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither we nor the players association will be releasing the
results of any tests,'' said Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal
counsel and one of the authors of the league's drug agreement.
``They are confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   The union sent a letter to the more than 400 NBA players last
month, warning them that they would be tested in October during
training camp and the pre-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at any time this past summer, you or a player you know has
smoked marijuana, used cocaine, heroin or other hard drugs, or
taken steroids, you must read this,'' the letter began. The letter
encouraged members who might have problems with drug or steroid
abuse to come forward, so they could get help and avoid penalties.
</P>
<P>
   With about a half-dozen positive tests among the first 120 or so
players, it appears that the proportion of players testing positive
is far less than some current and former players would have
expected. Richard Dumas was the last player suspended by the league
for using cocaine. Dumas, suspended in 1993, once said, ``If they
tested for marijuana, there probably wouldn't be no NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston of the Knicks has a different view. ``There were
some people out there saying nearly all ballplayers smoke weed,''
he said. ``It got ridiculous, and I think we got a bad rap about
it. At the same time, it is an illegal substance. Why should a
professional athlete be allowed to use it? That's what it comes
down to. Honestly, I think the testing is going to help some guys.
Am I glad they put it in the agreement? In the long run, I am.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The drug policy has another new and disputed element: For the
first time coaches, assistant coaches and trainers were tested with
the players. Some say angrily that their rights were bargained by
the players association and the league without their consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how we got lumped in there,'' Knicks Coach Jeff
Van Gundy said. ``I don't think it's necessary. I think it is an
infringement on people's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``It's not about hiding things. It's about
civil liberties slowly disappearing.''

FOR RAMIRO MENDOZA GETTING TO THE BALLPARK WAS THE REAL BATTLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Panama)   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza never knew if he would have the coins to pay for
the buses necessary to get him to Las Tablas, Panama, to pitch the
next day. That depended on whether his family could sell enough
tomatoes from a small farm that would be considered a garden
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Selling tomatoes was how they survived, meaning bus fare was
never a priority and barely a consideration.
</P>
<P>
   So Mendoza had the daily problem of figuring out a way to play
baseball. His family did not own a car and he lived several miles
from the ball park, an almost hopeless situation for a 16-year-old
who was much quieter 11 years ago than he is today. The Yankees
expect about a sentence an hour from him.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza maneuvered around the problems because he was used to
sacrificing. Sometimes he slept at the park with other players who
were poor. Sometimes he missed a bus and slept near the bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the kids I've ever signed, he had the hardest time
because he had trouble just getting to play,'' Herb Raybourn, the
scout who signed Mendoza for $3,500 eight years ago, said. ``I'm
sure kids in the States wouldn't have done what he did. They get
driven to and from practice. He had to do it on his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999 and Mendoza is still doing it on his own,
but doing it for the Yankees, too. Joe Torre was so tense in the
eighth inning of Game 5 against the Red Sox on Monday night that he
said he was ``squeaking'' walking to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had a 4-1 lead, but the Red Sox crammed the bases
with one out so Torre called his fifth pitcher of the inning,
Mendoza, to save the night and finish the American League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   All arms, legs and sinkers, Mendoza had been in these intense
situations before. Exactly four days earlier. This time, Mendoza
coolly got Scott Hatteberg to flail at a 3-2 sinker and induced
Trot Nixon to pop out. Torre stopped squeaking, the Red Sox stopped
talking about reversing an eight-decade-old curse and Mendoza
returned to anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy Joe put me in,'' Mendoza said. ``When I get the
chance to pitch, I don't get nervous. If I did, I might lose my
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   To truly understand why the Yankees are a great team, look
beyond Bernie Williams, Derek Jeter, Orlando Hernandez and Mariano
Rivera for the few minutes it took Mendoza to have an impact on
this series and then focus on him.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams do not have a weapon like Mendoza, who could be a
stellar No. 3 starter elsewhere, but who was Torre's pit bull of a
setup man in the decisive game and in the eighth inning of Game 2
when he also dodged a bases-loaded jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the type of pitches where you can tell them what's
coming and they still can't hit it,'' Torre said. ``He can come out
of the bullpen and just bury you.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like Rivera, the closer and fellow Panamanian who
has taught Mendoza about attacking hitters. Mendoza's quiet
personality will never change, but Rivera has lectured him on being
aggressive and seizing the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mariano was always the killer type, always out there to beat
you,'' said Raybourn, who also signed Rivera for $3,500. ``Now
Ramiro has more of that, too. He's out there to beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera sounded more like a father than a friend when he gushed:
``I'm so proud of him, like I was pitching. I was so nervous. I've
seen him do the job before. He did it in Game 2. Why not this time,
too?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Derek Jeter said, ``He was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rickey Ledee added, ``That was just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also incredible that General Manager Brian Cashman staved
off the endless rantings of George Steinbrenner to trade Mendoza,
who went 9-9 with a 4.29 earned run average this season and has
long been coveted by opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong on Mendoza,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He really
showed me. He was tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   As Raybourn watched Mendoza tame the Red Sox, he thought about a
skinny, long-armed pitcher who would awaken inside the park after a
fitful night, never utter anything and start playing catch.
Raybourn and Karl Heron, his assistant, liked Mendoza's loose arm
and fluid delivery, but they loved his intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every coach talked about how hard he worked,'' Raybourn said.
``He had to work like crazy just to get to a game. That tells you a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera is beloved in Panama, where the finest closer in the
major leagues still plays with children in the fishing village of
Puerto Caimito during the off season. But when Rivera was asked if
Mendoza would have been even more popular than him in Panama on
Monday night, he said, ``Not just tonight, every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza shook his head at this theory and said ``No, no'' before
rummaging through his locker in search of nothing, hoping that the
three-minute interview would end and his much more comfortable
journey to the next game could continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most humble kid I've ever met,'' Raybourn said. ``I
hope that he continues to do well, builds himself a large house and
lives well for the rest of his life. If anyone deserves that, it's
him.''

 UNDATED: Carter administration.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither the deployment policy nor the issue of what to say
publicly about it was reviewed during his years in government,
added Gelb.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin said that the U.S. government did not always inform other
governments that it was placing nuclear weapons on their territory
or at their naval bases. ``The no-comment policy allowed foreign
government officials to say that they did not know,'' Arkin
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But Gelb said he doubted that senior foreign officials had not
been informed about such nuclear movements. ``I suspect that most
of them knew,'' he said. ``Did it go to their parliaments? No, I
doubt it. But responsible officials knew that nuclear weapons were
being stored.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians, nuclear weapons analysts, and former government
officials are divided about the likely impact of the document's
declassification. Arkin predicted that the disclosures could ignite
intense political controversy in countries that are ``allergic'' to
the presence of nuclear weapons on their soil and whose governments
have forsworn their storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can also fill in many gaps in the history of the arms
race and the Cold War,'' said Norris. ``Until now, there has never
been official information on where, when and what kinds of nuclear
weapons were deployed overseas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The document and its annex, coupled with other declassified
information obtained by the article's authors, show, for example,
that during the height of the Cold War in the 1970s, the United
States had more than 7,000 nuclear weapons in NATO countries and
more than 2,000 on land in the Pacific. Aircraft carriers,
cruisers, destroyers, frigates and attack submarines carried
another 3,000 nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Graham T. Allison, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy
School and a co-author of ``Essence of Decision: Explaining the
Cuban Missile Crisis,'' said he had not known until he read the
version of the declassified document's annex that the Natural
Resources Defense Council posted Tuesday on its web site that the
United States had stored non-nuclear depth charges at its base in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Donald P. Gregg, the president and chairman of the Asia Society,
who was the U.S. ambassador to South Korea between 1989 and 1993,
confirmed the article's assertion that the United States had once
sent nuclear weapons there. He had raised the issue of their
removal with South Korean leaders more than a year before President
Bush announced in 1991 that he was withdrawing all tactical nuclear
weapons deployed overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said he had concluded, and the U.S. military had agreed,
that the weapons did not enhance U.S. national security and could
have become a provocation to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My residence had just been broken into by six students angry
about beef quotas, '' he recalled. ``They tried to burn my house
down. And I thought God Almighty, if they get this mad about beef,
what will they do when they learn we have nuclear weapons here?''

NYC ILLEGALLY TRIES TO BAR BENEFITS TO AIDS VICTIMS, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state's highest court ruled Tuesday that the
administration of New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had created
illegal obstacles for people with HIV or AIDS to obtain public
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-0 ruling, the Court of Appeals said the city must stop
requiring people with HIV or AIDS to submit to the rigorous
screening process that it imposed on other people applying for
welfare, food stamps and Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   While the city maintained that its requirements for eligibility
were procedural and not onerous, the court decided that the city's
policies for determining benefits violated a city law intended to
make it simpler for poor people with AIDS or HIV to receive
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the latest in a series of rebukes by the courts
and the federal government to Giuliani's attempts to make it more
difficult for the poor to obtain government benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also represents a setback for the Giuliani
administration's campaign to overhaul the city's welfare program,
which among other things has required all applicants to undergo
stringent background checks that include interviews with city
investigators charged with verifying applicants' income, assets and
residency.
</P>
<P>
   The city instituted the verification policy, known as the
Eligibility Verification Review, in 1995 as a way to insure that
only qualified people receive all types of public assistance
benefits. The administration contended that the policy weeded out
thousands of recipients who were receiving public assistance
fraudulently had discouraged others from trying to bilk the system.
</P>
<P>
   But critics, including Democratic lawmakers and advocates for
the poor, have argued that the city policy unfairly denied public
assistance benefits to thousands of New Yorkers, and discouraged
thousands more from going through the process, even when they had
legitimate claims. In particular, advocates for people with HIV
contended that the administration had made it unreasonably
difficult for those people to obtain benefits, sometimes delaying
the start of assistance by three months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to instituting the background checks, Giuliani tried
to do away with the Division of AIDS Services, which provides some
form of public assistance to 25,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the City Council passed a bill in 1997 that made
the agency permanent, and required it to provide a variety of
benefits, including food stamps, welfare grants and Medicaid
coverage, to low-income New York City residents with AIDS or HIV
who request assistance. Giuliani signed the measure into law.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling issued Tuesday involved a lawsuit brought by Daniel
Hernandez, an HIV-positive man who applied for public assistance
from the Division of AIDS Services in July 1997. As part of his
application, he was interviewed, and he submitted all the
documents, including medical records, required by the city,
according to court records. Later, he was told by the city that he
would have to undergo another screening in the Human Resources
Administration's Brooklyn office. The city told him that if he did
not attend the second screening, he would not be eligible for
public assistance. He sued instead.
</P>
<P>
   Under city procedures, low-income residents with HIV apply to
the Division of AIDS Services for public assistance, and that
agency determines their eligibility. But the administration has
required that the applicants go through the second screening, the
verification review, as other welfare applicants do.
</P>
<P>
   It is this second screening that the Court of Appeals said
violated the 1997 city law. In their decision, the judges ruled
that the law was intended to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles like
this review for people with AIDS, because they were among the most
vulnerable low-income New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Judge George Bundy Smith said the 1997
law ``was enacted to facilitate access to necessary public benefits
and services for individuals suffering from clinical/symptomatic
HIV illness and AIDS in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``nothing in this decision should be taken as
prohibiting efforts or procedures to prevent or eliminate fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   HRA spokeswoman Deborah Sproles said the city would accommodate
the ruling by having the Division of AIDS Services conduct a more
in-depth initial eligibility review. She said the city would not be
dissuaded from doing thorough background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Works, a group that assists people with AIDS and aided
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, called the ruling an important
victory. ``I think this is a big defeat for the Giuliani
administration,'' said Michael Kink, legislative coordinator for
the group. ``The unanimous decision shows the court will not
tolerate mistreatment of people with disabilities in the name of
welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the administration's screening program, all HIV-positive
applicants for public assistance had been required to report to the
eligibility review center at 330 Jay St. in Brooklyn. They were
interviewed by investigators wearing badges, and were asked
questions about income, assets and residency. (Once the suit was
filed, however, the city stopped requiring applicants to go to
Brooklyn and instead sent investigators to their homes.) If the
applicant was not home, investigators questioned neighbors or
landlords to verify information.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's policy drew protests from Democratic
lawmakers and advocates for the poor, who said that the Division of
AIDS Services already subjected clients applying for public
assistance to a rigorous review process before granting them
benefits. That process requires the applicant to provide the city
with his or medical records, proof of income and identity and other
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, critics of the policy said it was
especially hard on people with AIDS, because it required them to
make several trips to different city offices to establish
eligibility. The critics noted that the 1997 law explicitly
required the city to provide benefits to people with AIDS or HIV at
a single location.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Works, which provided legal representation to the
plaintiffs in the case, said it could not give specific figures on
how many people were denied benefits or discouraged from applying
for them as a result of the city's policy.

   A Platinum Era of Giving Is Foreseen by Researchers
</P>
<P>
   Far more wealth will be transferred to younger generations over
a half-century than the $10.4 trillion previously thought, Boston
College researchers say. They put the amount at $41 trillion to
$136 trillion. The new figures suggest that charities stand to
benefit from a platinum era of giving with bequests of $16 trillion
to $53 trillion between now and 2055.
</P>
<P>
   Drug Makers' Profits and Shares Up
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the drug industry's strong quarter, Pfizer, maker of
the impotency pill Viagra, surprised analysts by announcing a 36
percent earnings increase, while Johnson &AMP; Johnson reported a 14.4
percent gain and Bristol-Myers Squibb posted a 14 percent advance.
Shares of all three climbed, with Johnson &AMP; Johnson's stock up 5.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dow and S&AMP;P Rise; Nasdaq Slips
</P>
<P>
   Drug makers' earnings and expected inflation numbers helped send
the Dow Jones industrial average up 88.65 points, to 10,204.93, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index up 7.19 points, to 1,261.32.
But the Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.97 point, to 2,688.18.

   IBM to Stress Internet Sales
</P>
<P>
   IBM, which lost $1 billion on personal computers last year, said

ESTIMATE OF WEALTH TRANSFER TO NEXT GENERATIONS IS SHARPLY
EXPANDED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston College researchers say that the widely cited estimate
that $10.4 trillion of wealth will be transferred to younger
generations over a half-century is far short of the likely amount.
They estimate the wealth transfer will be $41 trillion to $136
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can now be safely said that the forthcoming wealth transfer
will be many times larger than anyone has previously estimated,''
said Paul Schervish, director of the Boston College Social Welfare
Research Institute, who has spent the last 15 years studying wealth
and who created a computer model to study wealth transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures suggest that charities, in particular, stand to
benefit from a platinum era of giving. Schervish and John Havens,
his deputy at the institute, estimated that between now and 2055
charities would receive bequests of $16 trillion to $53 trillion,
measured in 1998 dollars, assuming that the estate tax remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The widely cited estimate of $10.4 trillion in wealth transfer
was made in 1993 by two Cornell University professors, Robert Avery
and Michael Rendall, using data from the Census Bureau and other
sources. Their estimate was restricted to households in which the
chief wage earner was 50 or older and who had living children; it
covered 1990 to 2044.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College analysis, using a computer simulation model
created to estimate wealth transfers, covers all Americans who were
at least age 18 in 1998. It estimates wealth transfers from 1998 to
2052, when the youngest of those in the study will turn 73.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College study is based on modest assumptions about
growth in wealth compared with historical experience. The study's
low estimate that $41 trillion will be transferred between
generations by 2055 assumes that the value of all assets, adjusted
for inflation, increases at 2 percent annually, while the high
estimate assumes 4 percent annl growth. Another profile
assumes 3 percent annual real growth in the value of assets and
projects $73 trillion in wealth transfers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Actual growth in wealth, adjusted for inflation, averaged 5.3
percent annually from 1950 to this year, according to Professor
Edward Wolff, a New York University wealth expert.
</P>
<P>
   Total wealth in 1998 was $32 trillion, the Boston College
researchers estimated. Wolff, who had not seen the new study, said,
``That figure is in the right neighborhood,'' noting that his own
research indicated total wealth of $29.1 trillion today.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of wealth transferred can be greater than current
wealth for two reasons. One is economic growth. The other is that,
over 55 years, some fortunes will pass through two _ even three _
generations. Avery, now an economist with the Federal Reserve, said
that while he had some qualms about the techniques used by the
Boston College researchers, as described to him in a telephone
interview, their estimates sounded reasonable over all.
</P>
<P>
   Avery warned, however, that while economists could make fairly
accurate predictions about death rates far into the future,
assumptions about how much wealth people would accumulate were
risky, especially looking out a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important message is that there is a lot of wealth in this
country,'' Avery said.
</P>
<P>
   Havens, a co-author of the Boston College study, said that while
he was confident of the economic model he wanted to focus on the
low end of the estimate, $41 trillion, because ``it helps protect
against potential charges of irrational exuberance arising from''
the computer model's assuming steady economic growth without a
depression or a sustained recession in the first half of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago Havens developed one of the first computer
programs to model economic behavior. The model estimates that for
estates of $20 million or more, 39 percent of the money will go to
charity, 23 percent to heirs, 34 percent to taxes and 3 percent for
fees and burial expenses. IRS data show the same ratios in 1995 for
large estates.
</P>
<P>
   For estates of $1 million to just under $5 million, the study
assumes that charity will get 8 percent; heirs, 66 percent; taxes,
22 percent; and fees and burial expenses, 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For estates of less than $1 million, Schervish and Havens
estimated, nearly 90 cents of each dollar would be passed to heirs
and little would go to charity or taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One recent analysis found that among estates valued at $600,000
to $1 million in 1997, estate taxes averaged 6 percent, even though
the estate tax rate began at 37 percent on amounts above the
$600,000 exemption then in effect.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston College study covers what are known as final estates,
meaning the death of a single person or the second spouse in a
married couple, since bequests to a spouse are tax-free. The
estimates of how much will be bequeathed to charity may be low,
based on IRS data in recent years, which show that growing numbers
of people are engaging in estate planning so that more of their
money will go to charity after their deaths and less to the
government. The IRS data show that the share of money in estates
going to charity is slowly rising, a trend that if continued
through 2055 would mean far more for charities than the $16
trillion to $53 trillion cited in the study.
</P>
<P>
   If the estate tax is repealed or significantly reduced, however,
as Congress voted to do earlier this year in a bill that President
Clinton vetoed, bequests to charities might be smaller than the
Boston College model predicted.

   (NYT30) WASHINGTON -- Oct. 19, 1999 -- CAMPAIGN-POCKETS, 10-19
-- Sen. Minority Leader Tom Daschle heads for the Senate floor last
week as the Senate was preparing to debate the Nuclear Test Ban

unrestricted contributions that fall outside the purview of federal

leadership PAC, which immediately began raising ``soft money.''

 &HT;    Warrick, prosecutors reach deal
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Prosecutors and the attorney for Florida
State University star receiver Peter Warrick have reached a deal
that could allow the Heisman Trophy candidate to return to the
field as early as Saturday for a historic game against Clemson
University, Warrick's attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the season, the deal also calls for Warrick to
trade his garnet and gold uniform for a plainer outfit, the drab
ones worn by inmates in the Leon County Jail, where he would serve
a 30-day sentence, said his attorney, John Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would reduce a felony theft charge lodged this month
against the athlete to a misdemeanor, overcoming an FSU rule that
prohibits anyone charged with a felony from playing.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by a judge _ possibly today _ that would leave
Warrick's immediate football future in the hands of FSU coach Bobby
Bowden and Athletic Director Dave Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he has learned his lesson, at a terrific price,''
Bowden said after practice Tuesday in which Warrick participated.
Bowden didn't comment further, but suggested he would welcome
Warrick's return this weekend, when Bowden will go for his 300th
victory and face his son Tommy Bowden in the first NCAA football
coaching matchup between father and son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I want him to play Saturday? I wanted him to play last
Saturday,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick has missed two games since he and teammate Laveranues
Coles were arrested Oct. 7 on grand theft felony charges for paying
just over $20 for $413 worth of clothes at a Dillard's department
store in Tallahassee. Coles was immediately dismissed from the team
because of prior incidents, including a misdemeanor battery charge.
</P>
<P>
   After talks Monday with prosecutors, Kenny said Warrick agreed
to plead guilty to a misdemeanor petty theft charge and to serve
the 30-day jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something he wanted to do, but he had to in order to
get the misdemeanor,'' Kenny said of his discussions with Warrick
Monday night. ``He's extremely down about it and feels extremely
foolish, but he's very focused on doing what he can to put himself
back in the position to help his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (prosecution) wanted the 30 days to offer a
misdemeanor,'' Kenny said Tuesday. ``That's pretty standard when
looking at felony cases. They worked very hard to look at Mr.
Warrick not as a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant State Attorney Warren Goodwin wouldn't comment
on the plea, but said, ``I know (Kenny) is eager to get it
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, 22, would probably begin his jail sentence in January.
Other terms of the deal would place him on probation for one year
and require him to pay $295 in court costs and more than $500 in
restitution to Dillard's.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny said he rejected a separate offer of a felony probation,
which carries no jail time, because it wouldn't erase the felony
charge, possibly keeping Warrick out of uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick also had a prior misdemeanor, received last year in
Tampa for resisting arrest without violence, but it did not
significantly affect negotiations, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For where Peter's going in life, the NFL doesn't disqualify
you because of a petty theft,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the defense attorneys for both players, as well as
the lawyer for the store clerk who is charged with providing
Warrick and Coles the illegal discount, for the first time received
police copies of a surveillance camera tape of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``After seeing the video, we believe Mr. Coles is not the
principal participant,'' said Henry Hunter, Coles' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Coles has pleaded not guilty. ``If there's no chance (for Coles)
of getting on the football team, there's no reason to compromise
what rights he has,'' said Hunter, who said he intended to meet
again today with university officials.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney for the store clerk, Rachel Myrtil, couldn't be
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Leon County State Attorney Willie Meggs said there has been no
agreement yet in the cases against Coles and Myrtil.
</P>
<P>
   Meggs added that said Warrick's case did not receive special
treatment by his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resolve probably about 40 percent of our cases within 30
days of the arrest,'' he said. ``So this is right in the middle of
the pack.''

 &HT;    Chimp's flight spun into media circus
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Add ``chimp'' to the list of classes of
passengers who will ``pre-board'' your next flight before you do,
along with ``parents with small children, people in wheelchairs,
children traveling alone and others needing special assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The chimp is Zoe, a 10-week-old chimpanzee abandoned by her
mother, that took a transcontinental trip Tuesday from Fort
Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport to her new home at the
Los Angeles Zoo by way of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe took the window seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I'd be traveling with two babies. I've got one
of my own,'' said passenger Todd Mitchell, holding his 2-year-old
daughter, Torrie, dressed all in pink.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe was abandoned by her mother, Doll, one of 36 chimpanzees
that live on islands at the Lion Country Safari in Loxahatchee.
Although she could have been human-raised at the animal park, the
Los Angeles Zoo agreed to raise her with Jake and Jean, 5- and
3-month-old chimps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chimps are very social animals. They have a close bond not
only with their mother but with others in a sort of family unit,''
said Jennie McNary, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any animal hand-raised is missing the social interaction it
would get from others of its kind. It may grow up and exhibit
inappropriate behavior we introduced to its species,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Zoe is too young to fly in the cargo compartment, Spirit
Airlines jumped in to offer to fly Zoe, her caretaker, Brenda
Irvine, and a Lion Country publicist to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alternative would be chartering a plane, which would have
cost thousands of dollars,'' said Spirit Airlines owner Ned
Homfeld. Not one to miss a chance for a bit of publicity, Spirit
also is picking up the tab for two television crews to make the
trip that would normally cost $306 one way.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing T-shirts saying ``Spirit Airlines Goes Bananas,''
airline employees handed out chocolate-covered bananas and animal
crackers to passengers, and four people dressed in jungle garb met
Zoe at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wright dressed herself in a monkey suit to try to win a
free trip offered by Spirit to anyone who came to Zoe's going-away
party dressed like a chimp. ``I am very embarrassed,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Television stations and newspapers from West Palm Beach to Miami
chronicled the event. Already media-savvy, Zoe clutched her Beanie
Baby, Chocolate Moose, and made a little chimp-smile to show her
two brand new bottom teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 8 pounds, the chimp wears Pampers Newborns diapers,
drinks 5-ounces of Enfamil mixed with rice Pablum every four hours,
then burps like any other infant. ``Then she almost always gets the
hiccups,'' Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her age, the chimp isn't capable of climbing and
swinging yet. She went home at night with Irvine and her Doberman
pinscher. She watched TV with Irvine and slept in a small animal
carrier, similar to the one she rode in to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had children of my own. This is close to a child as
I've had,'' Irvine said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoe is a happy baby, rarely crying, sucking her thumb when she's
hungry and sleeping through the night, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 18 months or so, Zoe and the two older chimps will be
introduced to the troupe of chimps at the Los Angeles Zoo. Chances
are she won't return to Lion Country, but that decision won't be
made until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll miss her, but I'm trying to be professional about it.
She's not my baby,'' said Irvine, who said she has tried to avoid
thinking of Zoe's departure. ``This is what's best for Zoe. She
needs to become a chimp.''

KLAN GROUP SUES CITY OVER REJECTION OF RALLY
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Pa., Ind.)  (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Ku Klux Klan group made good on its threat to sue
New York City Tuesday, saying it should not have been barred from
holding a rally in Manhattan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is part of a broader effort by the group to overturn
state laws prohibiting the wearing of masks in public
demonstrations. Leaders of the group, the Church of the American
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said in an interview that they chose
New York as the rally site in part because of its anti-mask law.
They said they had overturned similar laws elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate lawsuit Tuesday, a group of Klan opponents also
sued the city, contending that the Police Department violated their
First Amendment rights by denying them a sound permit for an
anti-Klan demonstration nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Both suits are to be heard late Thursday afternoon before a
two-judge panel in federal District Court in Manhattan. The judges
are expected to rule immediately on whether the demonstrations may
be held, leaving time for an appeal before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   One of the judges, Alvin K. Hellerstein, indicated Tuesday that
he believed the Klan must eventually be allowed to hold its rally,
although he made it clear he also believed the police could insist
on tight controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there are intense feelings,'' Hellerstein said,
``about the issues about which these groups speak and indeed about
what these groups stand for. So without proper regulation, the
opportunity for violence can be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us want to avoid violence,'' he went on, ``and
at the same time want to provide a forum to allow the freest
expression for ideas, no matter how hateful those ideas might be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan group said in its lawsuit that it expected 50 to 80
members to attend the demonstration in front of state Supreme Court
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which Klan opponents say is the largest and most
aggressive of the various Klan organizations around the country,
said in the lawsuit that members planned to wear their traditional
robes and hoods, with masks that obscure their faces. The group
said members feared harassment in their jobs or communities if
their Klan membership becomes known.
</P>
<P>
   The group's leader, or grand dragon, in New York and New Jersey,
James W. Sheeley, of Walden, N.Y., said late Tuesday that he was
pleased by the thrust of the judge's remarks ``because myself and
our organization believe in the right to free speech and peaceful
and lawful assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheeley, who says he is a minister in the Church of the American
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the group had chosen New York for
its demonstration to ``promote white pride'' and ``overturn the
mask laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Klan group has previously won court orders overturning mask
laws in towns in Indiana and Pennsylvania, Sheeley and lawyers for
the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking earlier in the day to
reporters, defended the Police Department's decision to refuse to
issue a permit for the rally. ``I think the police are taking a
very, very wise step here for lots of reasons,'' Giuliani said,
contending that the rally would arouse counterdemonstrations and
drain police resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have the right to make these statements and we have
the right to disagree with the ones that we think are wrong,''
Giuliani said, ``but I also understand how many cops that's going
to cost us, and how there may be a robbery someplace that we don't
interrupt or a person dying of a heart attack that we don't get to,
or a shooting that goes on that we have one less cop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all appropriate, it's all correct, but at the same
time,'' he said, ``we have got to run a city.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which is representing the Klan, said in court that
his clients were ``committed to a peaceful and lawful
demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, a senior lawyer for the city, Daniel S.
Connolly, said the city believed the state anti-mask law was
``constitutionally valid, and we intend to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to the law is for entertainment, like a
masquerade party, and only then with the consent of the police.
</P>
<P>
   The suit filed by the Klan opposition group, the Partisan
Defense Committee, said the city's refusal to grant a
sound-amplification permit for its counter-rally had violated its
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Denying the ability to communicate in a manner that can be
heard by those addressed is a denial of the right of free speech,''
the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Hellerstein said he hoped that lawyers for the two groups of
demonstrators and the city would try to resolve the dispute out of
court.

week as the Senate was preparing to debate the Nuclear Test Ban
treaty. Senate minority leader Thomas A. Daschle was one of the
staunchest backers of the McCain-Feingold bill that died in the
Senate today. That bill would have banned ``soft money,'' the
unrestricted contributions that fall outside the purview of federal
election law. But in February, Daschle created his own so-called
leadership PAC, which immediately began raising ``soft money.''

SCOTT TUROW LOOKS AT JUSTICE SERVED IN `PERSONAL INJURIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Personal Injuries'' &QL; 
By Scott Turow &QL; 
(Farrar Straus &AMP; Giroux, $27) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are many lawyers publishing novels these days, but there's
no one better than Scott Turow. He doesn't just churn out
bestsellers. He WRITES them, with intelligence and depth and a feel
for our fascination with the nether regions of the law _ those back
rooms and muted conversations in which the truth comes out, deals
are struck and destinies, however illustrious or tawdry they might
be, are made.
</P>
<P>
   Turow finishes a book like clockwork, every three years:
``Presumed Innocent (1987),'' ``The Burden of Proof
(1990),''``Pleading Guilty (1993)''and ``The Laws of Our Fathers
(1996).'' Now, we have ``Personal Injuries,'' a novel meant not so
much to entertain as to make us think about ambition and
compromise, and their affect on how justice is served.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most layered and introspective book Turow has written.
That doesn't mean it's his best _ there are whole chapters that
will try a reader's patience _ but it's certainly his most
ambitious. And in Scott Turow, ambition can be a mighty impressive
thing.
</P>
<P>
   The character at the center of ``Personal Injuries'' is Robbie
Feaver (pronounced ``favor''), a personal-injury lawyer who with
his partner has been caught shortchanging the IRS. In this
instance, tax evasion is less a crime than convenient leverage _ on
the heels of the IRS agents comes U.S. Attorney Stan Sennett, who
offers to keep Feaver out of jail if he will provide evidence
against judges suspected of taking payoffs from lawyers (Feaver
among them) in exchange for favorable decisions.
</P>
<P>
   There are several judges in question, but the one Sennett really
wants is the powerful Brendan Tuohey, the man most likely to become
chief judge of Kindle County, the fictional setting of Turow's
novels. In his effort to get Tuohey, Sennett sets up an elaborate
ruse that includes fake lawyers, fake clients and fake
personal-injury cases. Project Petros, as the sting is called, will
go on for months, with Robbie Feaver attempting to record judges as
they sniff at, then swallow, his bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Turow uses these circumstances to create some memorable
characters, all laden with contradictions. Stan Sennett is an
ambitious man whose righteous convictions are served by devious and
often cutthroat tactics. Evon Miller, the FBI agent brought in to
pose as Feaver's associate and latest lover, grapples with her own
secrets (she is a poor imitation of Thomas Harris' Clarice Starling
in ``The Silence of the Lambs'') while she tries to fend off
Feaver's amorous attentions.
</P>
<P>
   The crooked judges are colorful even as they flirt with disaster
on Robbie Feaver's surveillance tapes. Barnett Skolnick is a
rambling but likeable dimwit (``There are dead men,'' Feaver says,
``who are not as dumb as Barney Skolnick'') who owes his place on
the bench to the tactics of his brother, a thug named Knuckles.
Sherman Crowthers is a huge and powerfully spoken Black man, once
one of the best defense attorneys in the county, now a judge who
rules his courtroom with rough eloquence and intimidation. And
Brendan Tuohey, the biggest prize, hides his avarice under a veneer
of serenity, protected by the loyalty of the lackeys around him.
</P>
<P>
   But the real enigma is Feaver himself, a pretty boy who appears
to have slept with every woman he has ever met (he would have sex
with a spoon if it seemed willing), yet remains devoted to his
wife, who is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease. Feaver starts the book
as a sleazy yukster, a used-car salesman in an Italian suit and a
perpetual tan, but grows in substance and stature until we almost _
ALMOST _ understand what women see in him. By the end, he is the
novel's symbolic Good Man, and he deserves the emphasis. Caught
among the criminals, the cops and the lawyers, he is the key to all
of their ambitions, but is left with nothing to call his own.
</P>
<P>
   Having created such a dense abundance of character, Turow tells
his story with a surprisingly heavy hand. This is his most
descriptive book, and that's not such a good thing. He gives us the
details of everything _ rugs, desks, buildings, courtrooms,
clothing, people and, most annoyingly, the minutiae of surveillance
(it seems as if we receive an inventory of Robbie's cameras and
microphones every time he approaches a judge over the long months
of Project Petros). Once, when Robbie walks through an innocuous
patch of woods on his way to a golf-course meeting with Brendan
Tuohey, Turow describes not only the trees and the land around him,
but the settlers who had walked that way a century before.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for some slow going, and that, unfortunately, is one of
the lingering impressions of this book: ``Personal Injuries,''
which is 400 pages long, could have lost 50 and been better for it.
There's also the matter of its narrator. George Mason, who is
Robbie Feaver's attorney, begins the novel in the first person,
establishing himself as the teller of the story. His voice fades in
and out, however, giving way without warning to an omniscient
narration in the many scenes during which George is not present
(private conversations between Evon and Robbie, for example, or
between Evon and Robbie's dying wife).
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your mood, you'll think this reappearing ``I'' is
arty or distracting. Or maybe, if you're feeling very generous,
you'll choose to look at it as a lawyer's tactic. After all, as
George tells us from the start, ``This is a lawyer's story, the
kind attorneys like to hear and tell.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want action, look elsewhere. But if you want a glimpse of
the legal profession through one of its own (Scott Turow still
practices in Chicago), this is not a bad place to be. His mistakes
are a writer's mistakes, something most lawyer-novelists don't have
the talent to make. If you want proof, just wait three years. &QL;

 &HT;    Lower airline commissions bump up travel agent fees
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Travel agencies, seeing their commissions cut
yet again by airlines, are responding with higher fees on tickets
and seeking more cruise and package business.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, most of the nation's major air carriers
have cut commission rates from an average of 8 percent per ticket
to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the average, round-trip domestic flight out of Austin, at
$238.50, that means a commission of $11.93 instead of $19.08.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cutting our pay virtually 40 percent,'' said Kathy Buley,
one of three owners in Above and Beyond Travel in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines, United Airlines and American Airlines
declined to comment, aside from issuing brief written statements.
Once the bread-and-butter of the travel business, the airline
commission structure has been crumbling for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1995, airlines led by Delta began limiting travel
agents' commissions. The first limit was 10 percent. It dropped in
1997 to 8 percent before the most recent cut to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's cut travel agents' share of a booming industry. While
total airline ticket sales climbed 44 percent to $67.3 billion in
1998 from $46.7 billion in 1990, commissions climbed just 27
percent to $6.2 billion from $4.9 billion, according to Airlines
Reporting Corp., a nationwide company that processes tickets issued
by travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Total commissions for domestic flights, which make up two-thirds
of all fares, have fallen 11.5 percent to $3.1 billion in 1998 from
$3.5 billion in 1990, ARC data shows. At the same time, domestic
ticket sales have jumped 28 percent to $45.5 billion from $35.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   United, which led the latest round of commission cuts Oct. 7,
said in a statement that they will save the airline $150 million a
year. Analysts say the savings industrywide will be $500 million to
$700 million. As a result, some travel agencies say they'll have to
begin charging service fees or increasing those already in place.
</P>
<P>
   At Oak Hill Travel in Austin, owner Ronnie Lee said he's upping
his fee from $10 to $15. ``There's just no profit left in airline
tickets,'' he said. ``In our business we operate on a very small
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to pass on a service charge to our customer or we
can't do airline tickets any more.''
</P>
<P>
   International Tours &AMP; Cruises recently adopted a $10 fee per
booking, said travel agent Chris Soncran. The commission cuts have
helped put some agencies out of business, said James Ashurst,
spokesman for the American Society of Travel Agents in Alexandria,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   The number of travel agencies peaked at 33,593 in 1995 before
dropping slightly to 32,694 last year, according to Airlines
Reporting Corp. Ashurst believes the number today is closer to
30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first bought this business in 1992, we could make money
off airline tickets,'' Lee said. ``But we haven't been making money
off them since '97.''
</P>
<P>
   To survive, Lee and others have turned to the ripening cruise
and tour industry, where the profit margins are double or triple
that of air fares.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the number of North American passengers taking
cruises has jumped to 5.4 million from 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only thing left, plus hotels, that haven't gone in
and completely capped us,'' said Buley, who estimates just half of
Above and Beyond's business today is in airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said airline bookings have fallen to just 10 percent of his
agency's business, down from 60 percent just three years ago.
``There's still a plane ticket on either side of the cruise or
trip, but I do them as a convenience for the customer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines, meanwhile, are encouraging travelers to book
their flights through individual carriers by Internet or phone,
Ashurst said. ``They've offered incentives to the public to book
direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers like Russ Krengel, a 31-year-old commercial banker in
Austin, are responding. Krengel, who booked a flight to New York
last weekend on the Internet, hasn't used a travel agent for any of
the three trips he's taken since spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually know the route I'm flying, so I just call the
airline or go on the Web,'' he said. ``The only reason I'd use a
travel agent is for booking a cruise or trip to a place I wasn't
familiar with.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a demand for travel agents, whom Ashurst said
handle 80 percent of all airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Elroy McDaniel from Cameron, who flies out of
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport about once a month on group
tours, said he always uses an agent. ``They just take care of
everything. I wouldn't try to do it myself.''

HOUSE BILL WOULD REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO GIVE MORE DATA TO PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of parents of public-school students stand to receive
reams of new information about the performance of the children and
their schools, and about the qualifications of their teachers,
under a bill making its way through the House of Representatives
with unusual bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the parents would not receive, however, is
taxpayer-financed vouchers to private schools, a defeat for
conservatives if the legislation is enacted in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, to be debated in the House beginning Wednesday, is the
reauthorization of Title I, the federal education program that has
spent more than $100 billion since the days of the Great Society,
some 35 years ago, on the struggle to lift the achievement of poor
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the public schools around the country receive money
through Title I, and those recipient schools would have to comply
with the new reporting requirements, in the form of detailed report
cards and regular letters sent home. Much of the information that
would be in those reports is now rarely disclosed publicly _ for
instance, whether teachers are licensed or trained to teach the
class to which they have been assigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would put the federal government on the side of parents
in a way it never has been before,'' said Amy Wilkins, a principal
partner in the Education Trust, a private organization that lobbies
on behalf of the poor. ``Parents haven't had the tools they needed
to be active. We've been expecting them to rise up, without giving
them the information.''
</P>
<P>
   When the House Committee on Education and the Workforce began
work on revising the Title I law earlier this month, in
anticipation of its expiration next year, the members were under
pressure from conservatives to go beyond merely holding schools
accountable for their performance. The committee was lobbied to
include an escape hatch, in the form of a voucher, for students in
failing schools that accept Title I money.
</P>
<P>
   But the moderate Republicans who control the committee, most
notably the chairman, Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., joined with the
Democratic minority to tinker only modestly with the law. As a
result, voucher amendments were voted down.
</P>
<P>
   The display of bipartisanship was notable in a year when the two
parties have fought to a deadlock in Congress on almost every major
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In setting aside their differences on the law, both sides seemed
intent on creating legislation that would enhance their education
credentials as an election year approaches. For all of Title I's
checkered record in meeting its mission, extending it is an
enormously popular idea in Congress, in part because of the
potential for political dividend: the program provides $300 to
$1,500 per student to schools in almost every congressional
district, enabling principals to hire remedial teachers and buy
textbooks, among other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though several committee members denounced Title I as
``a dismal failure,'' the bill would increase annual spending on
the program by $700 million, to $8.4 billion from $7.7 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bill that the committee agreed to send to the full House, by
a vote of 42-6 last Wednesday, provides that parents in failing
public schools be permitted to transfer their children to other
schools within their districts _ but only those that are public.
</P>
<P>
   While it stops short of providing a voucher, the bill would give
parents new tools to hold their schools accountable, including a
detailed report card that compares a student's performance on
standardized tests with the scores of others in the school, the
district and the state. The legislation would require a variety of
remedial steps at schools that failed to meet a number of standards
that it sets.
</P>
<P>
   In forging consensus between Democrats and moderate Republicans,
Goodling risked alienating conservatives. But they will have a
chance to be heard _ prominently _ on the lingering issue of
vouchers when the bill is debated on the House floor beginning
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey intends to introduce an
amendment that would set aside $500 million over five years to give
annual vouchers of $3,500 each, redeemable at private schools, to
27,000 students in failing public schools. Armey's aides said some
of this money _ they would not specify how much _ would come from
the $8.4 billion in annual spending that the bill already
envisions.

week as the Senate was preparing to debate the Nuclear Test Ban
treaty. Senate minority leader Thomas A. Daschle was one of the
staunchest backers of the McCain-Feingold bill that died in the
Senate today. That bill would have banned ``soft money,'' the
unrestricted contributions that fall outside the purview of federal
election law. But in February, Daschle created his own so-called
leadership PAC, which immediately began raising ``soft money.''

HOSPITALIZED CARDINAL O'CONNOR RECOVERING FROM RADIATION THERAPY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doctors say Cardinal John O'Connor is recovering
normally from radiation therapy for a brain tumor but is suffering
from slight dehydration and a small blood clot in his left leg, his
spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 79, may be discharged as early as Wednesday from
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said Joseph
Zwilling, spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York and the
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   When the cardinal was readmitted to the hospital on Monday,
doctors discovered a blood clot in his left leg during a 20-minute
examination in which the cardinal was awake and alert. A special
filter is being used to immobilize the clot while it is being
treated, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the cardinal was found to be slightly dehydrated
and was being given additional fluids by intravenous tube, Zwilling
said.
</P>
<P>
   The blood clot ``is not a direct result of the radiation
therapy, but a result of everything he's been through, including
the fatigue and dehydration,'' Zwilling said. He said he knew of no
other reported symptoms. ``The doctors feel he's recuperating
normally,'' Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had a small tumor removed from his brain on Aug. 31 and
was hospitalized for 10 days. No other organs appeared to be
affected, the archdiocese announced then. He received several
radiation treatments, which consisted of 90-second exposures of
radiation to a small area in the back of his head. The therapy was
completed on Oct. 11.

 &HT;    Rocker involved in car wreck
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker gave himself and the Braves a giant scare
on Monday. He totalled his 1998 white Corvette while driving south
on Georgia 400 on his way to Turner Field to get treatment from
team trainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves closer was not injured, nor was the driver of the
flatbed truck he hit. No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who was available to pitch in Tuesday night's game, said
he was driving about 70 mph when another car cut him off. In his
efforts to avoid hitting that car, the back end of his Corvette
fishtailed and the front right tire of his car rammed into a
flatbed truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A car cut me off, I went to avoid it,'' said Rocker, who was
wearing his seatbelt during the accident. ``Yeah, I'd say it did
(scare me). But it wasn't that big of a deal. It didn't mess his
car up at all. I'm all right. No bruises, no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The airbag did not release because the impact was not head-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things that happens,'' said John's
father Jake Rocker, whom John called from the scene of the
accident. ``Luckily, nobody was hurt.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the fourth year in a row, Senate Republicans
have blocked a final vote on legislation to overhaul the campaign
finance system. The Senate majority leader on Tuesday declared the
issue ``dead for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, indicated
that he planned to pull the bill off the Senate floor after
supporters of changing campaign finance law mustered a majority in
two test votes but fell short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a
Republican filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   All 45 Senate Democrats supported both efforts to break the
filibuster, joined by a shifting group of up to eight Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance measure, sponsored by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., would ban so-called
soft money, the unlimited and unregulated donations to political
parties, as opposed to specific candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate keeps the battle against special-interest money
alive as an issue for the presidential campaign season and also
virtually assures that unlimited and unregulated donations to
political parties will continue to flow into the 2000 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that at least $525 million in such donations
will be contributed to the six major political party committees by
November 2000. That is more than double the $262 million
contributed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who has put his crusade to change the campaign finance
law at the center of his bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, blamed both parties for this year's impasse. He vowed
that he and his co-sponsor on the bill, Feingold, would fight on.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what parliamentary tactics are used to prevent
reform,'' McCain said, ``no matter how fierce the opposition, no
matter how personal, no matter how cynical this debate remains, the
senator from Wisconsin and I will persevere.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the pair might try to add their bill as an amendment
to other legislation in the next few weeks as Congress tries to
wrap up its business for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the opportunity exists for an up or down vote for taking
the $100,000 check out of politics, we will do so,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   But only 53 senators voted to cut off a filibuster against the
soft money ban, almost the same vote as last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call it no progress whatsoever,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., who led the opposition. ``I'd call it pretty,
pretty dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott flatly told reporters, ``It's dead for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, President Clinton said in a written statement,
``Once again, a minority in the Senate has blocked bipartisan
campaign finance reform.'' He called the Senate impasse ``a victory
for the politics of cynicism.'' He released the statement shortly
before he was scheduled to appear at fund-raising events for
congressional Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the debate over the campaign finance law began
last week, McCain and Feingold admitted that their effort was a
long shot. In the Senate, it is often not enough for a bill to
garner a majority vote. If an opponent mounts a filibuster to block
legislation, it takes 60 votes to cut off the debate and bring the
bill to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans led by McConnell have used filibusters to block more
comprehensive versions of the McCain-Feingold legislation every
year since 1996, arguing that the bill amounts to an
unconstitutional infringement on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Even the controversy surrounding the 1996 election failed to
propel the measure forward. Campaign finance was put front and
center as an issue after the Democrats returned several million
dollars in donations in that election because of questions about
whether they were legal, and when it was revealed that President
Clinton rewarded fund-raisers with stays in the Lincoln Bedroom of
the White House and rewarded big donors with coffee gatherings at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, traditionally raise more soft money than
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   This year, in an effort to change the dynamics of the issue,
McCain and Feingold scaled back their legislation so that it was
essentially just a soft-money ban. They eliminated provisions that
would have regulated issue advocacy advertisements, which are often
thinly disguised campaign commercials attacking or promoting
congressional and presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The more comprehensive version of their bill passed the House
last month, 252-177.
</P>
<P>
   The two men said they hoped to pick up more votes by focusing
only on soft money and then allowing senators to amend the bill on
the floor. But Democrats, who provide the majority of votes for
campaign finance overhaul, still favored the more comprehensive
bill.
</P>
<P>
   And in a byzantine parliamentary maneuver, the Democrats assured
that a pair of test votes would come today on two amendments. One,
like the underlying bill, would have banned soft-money donations.
The other would have replaced the McCain-Feingold bill with the
original, more comprehensive legislation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But by a vote of 53-47, the Senate fell short of the 60 votes
needed to break a filibuster against the soft-money ban. And it
also fell short, 52 to 48, against the filibuster on the more
comprehensive measure.
</P>
<P>
   Three new Republican senators supported the soft-money ban _ Sam
Brownback of Kansas, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and William V. Roth
Jr. of Delaware. Roth faces a tough re-election bid next year. But
two previous Republican supporters voted against the overhaul
proposal: John Chafee of Rhode Island and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania. Their aides said they thought the measure had become
too narrow. In all, eight Republicans voted with the Democrats
against the filibuster on soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had committed to five days of debate on the issue,
Lott then announced he was ending the campaign finance debate and
moving the Senate on to legislation to ban a particular form of
abortion. His move drew protests from Democrats and from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question about whether or not we're going to keep
our word,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader,
``whether or not we will have the opportunity to finish the debate
on campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the afternoon Democrats took to the floor to demand that
the campaign finance debate continue. But both parties said they
expected Lott to prevail on Wednesday morning in shifting the
Senate to the abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   The four days of debate over campaign finance put McCain on
stage in the Senate, and his campaign advisers said he could not
lose politically from showcasing his centerpiece presidential
issue.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Feingold could do little to control the floor. Last
week, Republicans went on the offensive against McCain, repeatedly
asking him to defend charges he has made that the campaign finance
system had led to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Democrats broke with the strategy of McCain and
Feingold and made an effort to get a test vote not just on the
soft-money ban but on their original legislation. In order to do
so, they had to use a parliamentary process that largely choked off
many of the expected amendments for several days. That stopped
McCain and Feingold from picking up support through amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``America deserves more than a vacuous sleepwalk through this
debate,'' complained Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.,, late on Monday. He
had been expected to offer several amendments to spur a compromise
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Feingold on Tuesday night tried to put the best face on the
outcome, saying  &QL; 
that he and McCain had picked up additional support for some form
of overhaul. ``Three senators who in the past have stuck with the
chief opponent of reform have finally had it with this corrupting
soft-money system,'' Feingold said. &QL;

GATES FOUNDATION PLEDGES $10 MILLION TO SEATTLE ART MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By REGINA HACKETT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Seattle Art Museum once again finds itself on the
receiving end of largesse from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, which Tuesday pledged $10 million to the museum's
endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   That's by far the largest arts grant in the foundation's
history. The Gates Foundation makes grants nationally and
internationally in the fields of education and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Pacific Northwest are arts and cultural groups
considered for grants by the Seattle-based foundation. The Seattle
Symphony and Seattle's Museum of History and Industry each have
received $2 million, the Oregon Museum of History and Industry $1.5
million, and the Bellevue Art Museum and the Tacoma Art Museum $1
million each, along with a score of lesser grants to other groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle Art Museum is the big winner, having previously
received $4 million for a sculpture garden and $1 million for
educational projects. That's $15 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the museum such a favorite at the Gates Foundation?
Could it be that Mimi Gates, the museum's director, is married to
retired lawyer William H. Gates Jr., who runs the foundation with
Patty Stonesifer and is the father of William Gates III, founder
and chairman of Microsoft and the world's richest man?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sure, it's a factor,'' said Trevor Neilson,
communications manager for the Gates Foundation. ``It means Bill
and Melinda are in touch with what's happening at the museum. They
know the organization is in good hands, is run effectively and is
serving the public well.''
</P>
<P>
   Most major art museums use income generated from endowment funds
to cover at least 25 percent of their operating expenses. Before
the SAM launched a campaign in 1996 to add $40 million to its $25.4
million endowment fund, the fund was covering only 18 percent of
operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the Gates Foundation grant, the museum had raised
$21.5 million of that $40 million, plus earned close to $11 million
in investment gains, bringing the fund to $57.9 million. To secure
the Gates grant, the museum must raise an additional $5 million in
matching funds by Dec. 31, 2000, which will give the museum a
comfortable $74.9 million endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Gates' grant alone will generate roughly $500,000 annually,
15 percent of which will go for acquisitions and the rest to staff,
exhibitions, development, security, maintenance and education. The
museum's annual budget is roughly $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Gates was out of town and unavailable for comment, as was
her husband.

ECHOES OF '68 ON COLUMBIA'S CAMPUS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 24) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Lerner Hall, the new student center at
Columbia University, will plunge some baby boomer alumni into a
cool nostalgic bath. The architect, Bernard Tschumi, has long made
a touchstone of ``the events of '68'': the student uprisings that
for many epitomize the turmoil of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University's architecture school was one of the
epicenters. It was here that faculty members joined students in
protesting a gymnasium scheduled to rise in Morningside Park. From
there the protest spread outward until it had engulfed much of the
campus in a generalized rebellion against authority, war and
civilized restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school is run by Tschumi, 55, whose sensibility was
formed by the Paris edition of those demonstrations. No practicing
architect of his generation has identified himself more closely
with the anarchic energies of that era. Quite apart from its own
merits as a piece of architecture, Lerner Hall, which officially
opened last month, is an opportunity to weigh the impact of those
years on the profession.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the most convincing building put forth by a '60s
survivor. But no building more graphically represents this
generation's complex relationship to architectural theory, practice
and education.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner Hall replaces Ferris Booth Hall, a student center that
occupied the site at Broadway and 115th Street. A key location on
the southwest corner of Charles McKim's master plan of 1894, the
site is a place of transition between Columbia's public frontage
along Broadway and the courtyards enclosed within.
</P>
<P>
   The Tschumi design, with Gruzen/Samton Associates, reflects the
site's transitional nature. Physically and metaphorically, it is a
bridge _ a link between exterior and interior, opacity and
transparency, Beaux Arts classicism and modernist structural
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Programmatically, the $85 million building brings together a
range of student activities and organizations previously scattered
across campus. These range from student clubs for chess and
fly-fishing to the studios of WKCR, the student radio station.
There is a handsome basement space for student parties; two
restaurants; a large theater, a cinema, rehearsal halls and more.
</P>
<P>
   The building is roughly square, with a strip cut out of the
north side to frame the Glass Court, a large rectangular atrium
equipped with long ramps of shallow incline. The atrium is visible
from without through a sheer glass wall. This arrangement creates
the effect of a classical, C-shaped composition, with a central
block flanked by two perpendicular wings.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is rationally organized. Offices for student clubs
are stacked on the upper floors of the Broadway wing. The opposite
wing contains an entrance lobby, a two-story dining hall, and
conference rooms. Student lounges and performance spaces, visible
through windows in the atrium, are concentrated in the central
block. The campus book store and a party space, featuring a
glamorous, cantilevered staircase, are on the basement level.
</P>
<P>
   The Glass Court is the heart of the building: a performance
space where architecture and the student body compete for the lead
role. The glass facade is made of large glass panels, fitted
together without mullions. It rises four stories and projects above
the top floor, a feature that increases the material's
transparency. The wall is supported by an elaborate steel structure
of trusses, braces, gravity and wind arms, turnbuckles and spider
brackets. This system also supports the ramp just inside the glass.
</P>
<P>
   The ramps perform a function similar to the balconies in the
promenade of Philip Johnson's New York State Theater. Turning
circulation into spectacle, they animate the atrium by silhouetting
people in motion. The slant of the ramps heightens the kinesthetic
display.
</P>
<P>
   The slant is not arbitrarily imposed. It reflects the change in
ground level from the Broadway to the campus sides of the building.
The slope is echoed by door and window frames and by huge banks of
student mailboxes arrayed along the atrium's southern wall.
</P>
<P>
   As the hub of the building, the atrium is a showcase for
Tschumi's concept of architecture as a generator of events. The
concept holds personal as well as general meanings. It is, above
all, a mantra for invoking 1968 and the uprisings the French still
call ``les evenements du mai.''
</P>
<P>
   There may also be a private reference here to the Architecture
Association School in London, where Tschumi studied in the early
1970s, an experience that has helped to shape his tenure at
Columbia. At the AA, as the school is known, an Events List of
lectures, discussions and other activities was posted each week
around the school.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, two particulars strongly impressed many AA
students. The first was that the life of the school occurred almost
independently of its physical surroundings, a pair of converted
Bloomsbury town houses. Second, the heart of the school's
architecture life occurred not in the studios, classrooms, lecture
hall or library, but in the lounge, a decorous second-floor salon,
outfitted with bar and bartender, where students gathered
periodically throughout the day for refreshments, gossip,
hand-holding and even the exchange of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Tschumi has translated the events concept into two large-scale
works. The best known of these is the Parc de la Villette in Paris,
noted for its rows of of cube-shaped, red enamel follies. The
architect has described the park as a large, discontinuous
building. The follies were designed for refreshments, exhibitions
and other functions. But the life of the park was meant to unfold
in between these physical structures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Architecture In/Between'' is the subtitle of Tschumi's book
about a design for Le Fresnoy, the National Studio for Contemporary
Arts in Tourcoing, France. Here, Tschumi dramatizes the in-between
idea with a large, open-air attic space, created by suspending an
immense roof over a row of renovated older buildings in which the
school is mainly housed. The space is supposed to give rise to
spontaneous student activities, like lighting up between classes.
</P>
<P>
   At Columbia, the term in-between describes the transitional
quality of the building's site. It might also denote the atrium as
a public space to be occupied by students in the political as well
as in the social sense: a fluid volume for unprogrammed events. The
atrium should be seen, in other words, as a conflation of two
memories: the student occupations of architecture schools in Paris
and the gathering of architecture students in a lounge on Bedford
Square.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest feature of the atrium _ in fact, of the entire
hall _ is the view of the campus from inside. Courtyards, greenery,
other buildings and students compose a panorama that changes as you
move through the interior.
</P>
<P>
   From the student lounges along the southern edge of the atrium,
the campus views are partly framed by the ramps. The motif of
visual connection recurs throughout the building. For instance, in
the double-height theater, a moveable screen converts the balcony
into a 300-seat cinema. Large windows in the student lounges allow
views into the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not these visual connections actually create events,
they do heighten the sensation that things are happening. This is
not something you can say, for example, about the student center
Gwathmey &AMP; Siegel designed a few years ago for Hostos College in
the Bronx. The Hostos student center, another building that
connects the interior of a campus to its perimeter, also contains
an atrium, a theater and a similar array of student functions. But
they are cut off from one another by opaque walls. It is
frustrating to walk through the atrium at Hostos.
</P>
<P>
   All this stuff is going on _ music, theater, art, dance _ and
you might as well be a guard in a cellblock. Lerner Hall, by
contrast, sets loose an interplay of exhibitionist and voyeurist
impulses that animate the space.
</P>
<P>
   The interplay is best appreciated from the ``sky lounge,'' a
small platform with seats and tables suspended over the well of the
atrium at the third-floor level. It's a dream place as well as an
in-between place, a spot for letting thoughts wander in drama queen
directions.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a place where visitors of a certain age and
temperament might feel an irresistible urge to give into the
building's vestigial '60s spirit. Why resist? Let's have a little
riot. We'll start by protesting the willfulness of that great metal
and glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   The wall has the elegance of platinum jewelry. Still, all that
intricately articulated metal and glass raises expectations that
the design does not fulfill. The structure looks like a machine. It
should be operable. You should be able to crank a handle and make a
row or two of the glass panels swivel into open position.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the glass should slide on tracks. Air would flow in.
The skin would become porous. The building would breathe. The
connection between inside and outside could be physical as well as
visual, tangible as well as symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   The rigidity of the skin reflects more than a discrepancy
between image and fact. It also represents the gulf that separates
architectural form makers from advocates of ``sustainable design.''
In this Year of the Mosquito, some people are looking for
terrorists to blame for the outbreak of exotic viruses. What about
sealed buildings? They may keep out bugs and pesticides. But they
also contribute to climate changes and the migration of viruses
that may attend them.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, architects will have to deal with the
environmental consequences of their designs. Why not now and here?
As dean, Tschumi has fostered an admirable solidarity among
survivors of the '60s. Making common cause with the
environmentalists among them should be higher on his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The rigid glass and metal wall also contradicts the progressive
social goals implied by Tschumi's '60s pedigree. The unblinking eye
of a surveillance camera keeps conspicuous watch on the atrium from
a look-out post above the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, the camera assumes a symbolic as well as a
practical function. Taken together with the high-tech wall, the
overlooking ramps and windows, and Lerner Hall's security desk, the
camera insinuates a sinister presence into the entire composition.
It seems to be gazing into a space designed less to generate than
to contain spontaneous social events.
</P>
<P>
   Lerner Hall's biggest weakness, however, lies with the notion
that the use of architectural forms to generate events represents
an original contribution to the making of social space. If you
subtracted program-driven design from the history of architecture,
there would be little left.
</P>
<P>
   The plans of palaces, places of worship, baths, parks, train
stations and hotels, to name only a few building types, begin with
the program: the inventory of functions and spaces in which
processions, rituals, etiquettes, protocols and informal gatherings
occur.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that compared with places like the student center at
Hostos, Lerner Hall offers a much richer experience. But, compared
with the Virgin Megastore in Times Square or the Mondrian Hotel in
Miami Beach, the place is a dud. And for this ``in-between
building,'' comparisons with commercial architecture _ hotels,
malls, airports _ are the essential ones to make.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, an opportunity was lost here to establish a less
oppositional relationship between the academy (the campus) and the
marketplace (Broadway). This could have been accomplished by
visually integrating the campus bookstore with the atrium instead
of burying the store in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   And the relationship between academy and marketplace is
fundamental to understanding what the 1960s were about. The
counterculture was not just a protest against the consumer culture
of the postwar decades. It was also consumerism's logical
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesia, ignorance, short attention spans, sensation and
distraction, the thirst for novelty _ all corollaries of the
mythology of progress _ became indispensable to the proper
functioning of a society that was retooling wartime production to
peacetime consumption. This ethos was not easily reconciled with
the patience required to pursue a classical education. Remember
relevance? What was that but a demand that learning be more like
shopping? New. Improved. Stackable. Packable. Your needs met.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in this season of political savagery against art,
New York should welcome any building that tries to introduce new
forms of social space. But to gloss over Lerner Hall's shortcomings
would be to overlook the building's pedagogical role _ and the role
played by the academy in the history of Tschumi's generation.
</P>
<P>
   It is odd but true that this generation, which established its
initial identity by rebelling against the academy, has developed an
attachment to it unprecedented in the history of professional
training.
</P>
<P>
   It would be excellent if this attachment had produced an
increased sense of historical awareness. But this has not been the
case. The adoption of new computer design technologies, the
importation of post-structuralist cultural theories and the
promotion of forms supposedly derived from those theories have
tended to flatten rather than enrich the awareness of history.
</P>
<P>
   Good architecture doesn't depend on historical awareness. But
claims to originality can't be verified without it. Instead of
challenging such claims, architecture schools today have become
factories for manufacturing them. I can't imagine anything more
detrimental to genuinely innovative work.
</P>
<P>
   schumi is an in-between kind of architect. His work is not quite
art and not quite fashion. I think the work wants to go in a more
fashionable direction but is held back by the conventional idea
that fashion is superficial. This is another unfortunate
consequence of the academic condition.
</P>
<P>
   Those who lived through the '60s know that many of the era's
strongest social statements were made in the field of style.
Ephemeral forms, like advertising and fashion, can have a powerful
impact on consciousness. That surveillance camera wouldn't look so
sinister if it fed live cable coverage of stylish students
sashaying up and down Lerner Hall's ramps.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that architecture lacks a specific role to
play in advancing a progressive cultural agenda. But Lerner Hall
doesn't reflect an architectural way of thinking. Form, structure,
space, image, context, function, symbolism and social intention
have not been synthesized into an esthetically persuasive whole.
</P>
<P>
   Tschumi has described his approach as cinegraphic. But good
movies tend to have a sounder sense of structure _ a better
architecture _ than we see here.
</P>
<P>
   Quite possibly, Tschumi will one day design a building that
reveals original thinking about the relationship between buildings
and events. At Lerner Hall, however, that glass atrium could
symbolize the plight of an architect trapped in an elaborately
staged conceit that the day is already here.

COMMENTARY: PRESIDENT LONELY GUY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a disturbing image, with elements of Nixon,
Lear and ``Caddyshack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press headline said it all: ``Clinton Golfs Alone
Under Rain and Darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the United States, who could have been cozy and
dry back at the White House on Sunday evening, watching the Mets'
thriller against Atlanta, was hitting balls in a gray drizzle at a
suburban country club, his white sports hat dripping wet. The most
gregarious of presidents was playing solo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The White House press office,'' the AP story concluded,
``refused to release his score.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the president getting wiggy in the final days? Will he start
talking to the portraits in the White House?
</P>
<P>
   The scene on Sunday was such a poignant contrast to those heady
days when Bill Clinton and Vernon Jordan used to race around in the
sun in their golf cart, talking bawdily about women, cigars in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The president can't do the stuff he likes or is good at anymore.
All he's really allowed to do now are fund-raisers and golf. That
ebbing-autumnal-twilight-mortality thing is no fun. His nuclear
treaty is killed. His agenda is bottled up.
</P>
<P>
   Some who work with the president say that he seems, at times,
angry and melancholy and distracted and even a little lonely. His
daughter is back at college, and he has to watch his co-president
and his vice president go off without him to his favorite place in
the world _ the rope line. He sees Hillary and Al trying to win
their races by slamming him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president in recent weeks has reflected at least twice on
the foul moods he says sometimes overtake him,'' wrote John Harris
in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Renshon, a City University of New York professor who
wrote a book about the Clinton presidency, says Clinton must be
torn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's a very smart man, so he must now be thinking of what
he could have done and didn't,'' Renshon says. But because Clinton
prefers to blame others and see himself as a victim, the professor
observes, ``it's a horse race in his mind between `I screwed up'
and `They made me do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But even he must know it was silly to say he regarded the
impeachment muck as a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   And he has had some weird moments lately. He called the Irish
drunks. He said a Filipino federal worker who was murdered counted
as ``a two-fer'' hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   He flipped out when a reporter rudely asked him at a New Orleans
theme press party at the White House if he would have a press
conference to answer questions about Chinese influence peddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' the president snapped, ``the FBI wants you to write
about that rather than write about Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   One sure sign that the president is losing it: He waxes
philosophical about darkness and light. ``Every one of us has this
little scale inside, you know,'' he told a gay rights group in New
York. ``On one side there's the light forces, and the other side
there's the dark forces in our psyche and our makeup and the way we
look at the world ... ``You don't want to have so much light that
you're just a fool for whatever comes along. But if the scale tips
dark even a little bit, things turn badly for people and those with
whom they come in contact.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Hollywood fund-raiser, the president joked that he
might become an actor. His love of the spotlight reminds me of that
consummate ham Maggie Smith. In one play, in a scene where she was
supposed to be sitting quietly off to the side at a writing table
while another actor gave a monologue, the actor noticed that the
audience was glued to Ms. Smith. He turned around to find her
swigging from the inkwell.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot seem to stop himself from swigging from the
inkwell as the less skilled performers in his long-running play,
Hillary and Al, take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard, even for presidents who want to go gently. When
Dwight Eisenhower saw the Kennedy inaugural platform go up, he said
it looked like a gallows.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton friend told The New Yorker in 1996 that the president
fretted that the Washington establishment looked down at him, as
though he were the golf pro.
</P>
<P>
   When you mess up your presidency, you don't get a mulligan. So
now, at his 18th hole, Bill Clinton must plot how to spend the
future polishing the past.

HOW THE DE NIRO-WEINSTEIN GROUP LOST A DEAL FOR THE BROOKLYN NAVY
YARD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.J.)   By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert De Niro, a star in two of Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani's all-time favorite films _ ``The Godfather Part II'' and
``Analyze This'' _ came to Gracie Mansion last spring to flesh out
his proposal to build film studios at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The
meeting went well enough for the mayor to perform his Godfather
routine for the accomplished actor.
</P>
<P>
   When De Niro, his partner, Harvey Weinstein of Miramax Films,
and several city officials left the mansion that day in late April,
they thought they had a deal in progress, even without something in
writing. A week later they stood alongside Giuliani at a giddy news
conference at which Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, teased
the mayor about a future in film.
</P>
<P>
   But their laughs and tolerance for amateur imitations ended last
week when the city and the Navy Yard chose another set of
developers to build the studios. De Niro and his partners quickly
charged that the Giuliani administration had lured them into
considering the Navy Yard as a site for their studios, only to
suddenly double-cross them.
</P>
<P>
   The city's official response is: Tough luck; the other
development team had offered the city a better deal. Unofficially,
though, city officials say Giuliani did not know of the final deal
until after it was signed, irking the mayor and revealing a kink in
the administration's well-honed ability to maintain a united front.
</P>
<P>
   A primary reason appears to be a disagreement between two deputy
mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Randy L. Levine, the deputy mayor responsible for economic
development, had cast his lot with the De Niro group, figuring that
it had the wherewithal to build film studios. But Rudy Washington,
the deputy mayor for business services, had sided with the other
group: two entrepreneurs who originally proposed the idea for film
studios at the Navy Yard and their financial backer, a New Jersey
firm called Steiner Equities.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the confusion that ensued from having two deputy
mayors _ both of whom declined to comment _ working at cross
purposes resulted in a miffed mayor, an embarrassed administration,
an angry couple of Hollywood power brokers and lingering questions
within the administration about the successful bidder's ability to
bring the project to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking member of the administration said the case
signaled that the mayor's ``early-warning system'' _ vital to a
candidate poised to begin a campaign for the Senate in the next few
months _ had broken down. ``We're not happy,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the internal intrigue, city officials say _ on paper at
least _ that the deal struck with Steiner Equities would reap
millions of dollars more for the city. The city's corporation
counsel, Michael D. Hess, said that members of the Steiner group
had signed an agreement with the city in 1998 that could have led
to a lawsuit if the city had chosen the De Niro group.
</P>
<P>
   De Niro and Miramax ``never had anything in writing,'' Hess
said. ``They had nothing. They had a press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Miramax and De Niro's company, TriBeCa
Productions, declined to comment. But an associate of the partners
with knowledge of the negotiations said the news conference on May
3 _ in which Giuliani took part and which was held at the
city-controlled Navy Yard _ had come after an agreement to do a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly thought this deal was going to happen,'' the
associate said. ``And we clearly had a different impression of what
a deal is.''
</P>
<P>
   That would explain the dual personality of the press release
that the mayor's office issued to trumpet the news conference with
De Niro. It repeatedly said the city would ``explore'' a deal. But
its headline also implied a done deal:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor Giuliani Announces Major Film and Television Production
Facility to Be Built At The Brooklyn Navy Yard _ Facility to Serve
as Pre-eminent East Coast Film and Television Production Studio and
Create Thousands of Film, Television and Construction Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans to build a production complex on a part of the Navy Yard
were first raised by Cary Dean Hart, a movie-set designer, and
Louis Madigan, a computer consultant. In the summer of 1998, the
two entrepreneurs signed an agreement with the city's Brooklyn Navy
Yard Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency that manages
the former shipbuilding site, to construct a $160 million complex.
</P>
<P>
   But as Hart and Madigan struggled to secure financing for their
ambitious plan, people close to the negotiations say, the Giuliani
administration invited TriBeCa Productions, owned by De Niro and
Jane Rosenthal, to consider building a production site at the Navy
Yard. That raised the poignant possibility that the originators of
a plan for redevelopment of the yard might be cut out of their own
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The site appealed to the movie producers, and before long they
had enlisted Weinstein and Steven Roth, the chairman of Vornado
Realty Trust, to invest in a $150 million plan to convert 15 acres
into a production center that would include 12 sound stages and
create thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But there remained the matter of Madigan and Hart, who
eventually were included in the new calculations, but in a much
smaller capacity. ``Nobody wanted to cut anybody out,'' one city
official explained.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it appeared that Levine had won his subtle battle
with Washington. There was the Gracie Mansion meeting between the
mayor and De Niro, followed a week later by the press conference
charged with Hollywood glamour. Madigan and Hart stood glumly at
the back of the dais as Giuliani and Weinstein joked before the
cameras. The best that Washington could do was suggest that Madigan
and Hart represented ``the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the two entrepreneurs notified the city that
they wanted no part of the De Niro deal. Instead they would be
resurrecting their own proposal with the backing of Steiner
Equities. They also reminded city officials that a lawsuit was
possible.
</P>
<P>
   That split led to a long summer for Washington and Levine and
particularly for Hess, who was assigned by the mayor to choose the
best offer. ``There were phone calls back and forth, tit for tat,''
Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, an associate of the De Niro group said, De Niro and
his partners thought that negotiations were well past mere
exploration. With Levine as their City Hall advocate, they believed
they could wait out the Steiner group until its agreement with the
Navy Yard lapsed or until it simply backed out. There was even talk
of buying out the other set of developers. (MORE)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When they kept hearing rumors earlier this month that the city
was closing the deal with the Steiner group, they received
assurances from city officials that no agreement could be reached
without the knowledge of the administration's top people, according
to people involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, last week, Hess concluded that the Steiner group's
offer was superior _ ``on paper,'' a distinction that he and other
city officials repeatedly cite. The De Niro group insisted that its
project had to be supported by a $25 million loan from the city,
and said that it could not begin construction for at least six
months. The Steiner group needed no public assistance, offered
millions of dollars more in rent and promised to break ground in 30
days, Hess said in explanation for his decision. The threat of a
lawsuit also figured in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon of Oct. 12, Hess notified the De Niro group of his
decision _ a call that flabbergasted its members. Hess then
forwarded a written legal opinion to Washington, the mayor's
representative on the board of the Navy Yard corporation.
</P>
<P>
   According to one side in the dispute, Washington interpreted the
letter to mean that the deal had the mayor's approval. He
immediately alerted the other members of the board, and within an
hour or two an agreement was signed with the Steiner group.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani and Levine learned that night that a deal had been
struck without their knowledge, they fumed. According to one City
Hall official, Giuliani kept asking, ``Why? Why? Why?''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, two city officials said, a meeting should
have been held first to apprise the mayor and discuss the
implications of the legal opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, Giuliani put the situation in the
most favorable possible light, saying it was the better deal for
the city _ despite the doubts of some of his advisers _ and that
the now-famous news conference with De Niro and Weinstein had been
held only to tout the exploration of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   When told that De Niro, a star of his favorite films, had felt
double-crossed, Giuliani answered: ``Well, that's some other world.
That's some other world, other than the world of equity,
fairness.''

MICROSOFT BEATS EXPECTATIONS IN QUARTERLY EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Buoyed by strong PC sales, Microsoft Corp. Tuesday
reported sharply rising profits as it released a first fiscal
quarter earnings report that beat expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are excellent results,'' said Greg Maffei, Microsoft's
chief financial officer, at a teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported a net income of $2.19 billion and diluted
earnings per share of 40 cents on revenue of $5.38 billion for the
quarter that ended Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   On average, analysts had estimated earnings of 34 cents, ranging
between 33 and 37 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the same quarter last year, adjusted net income rose
37 percent, earnings per share grew 36 percent and revenue
increased 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Carla Lewis, Microsoft's senior director of investor relations,
said the quarter was driven strongly by two factors.
</P>
<P>
   The primary driver was PC sales that were ``considerably''
stronger than anticipated, especially in Asia, where many recent
quarters have seen zero growth.
</P>
<P>
   The other factor driving sales was corporate willingness to
spend on software despite the looming of Y2K _ January 1, 2000 _
when it has been widely speculated that many computers will crash.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate confidence that Y2K problems have been anticipated and
avoided drove sales of Windows NT Server and of server-based
software including SQL Server 7 and Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue also was boosted by $156 million from the sale of the
entertainment cityguide portion of the MSN Sidewalk online guide.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the Sidewalk sale, and the sale last year of the
company's Softimage subsidiary, net income rose 37 percent and
earnings per share grew 36 percent compared to the same quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed at 86 5/16, down 1 9/16. The stock
has slumped over the past 10 days, losing roughly six points. The
earnings report was released after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Microsoft announced Windows Distributed
interNet Applications 2000, an Internet-based development
environment for creating Web sites. An initiative called Everyday
Web _ which president Steve Ballmer pledged will reflect
Microsoft's unshakeable determination to cut a large swath on the
Internet _ adds a shopping-oriented search engine, product
comparisons, reviews, information and online buying features to the
MSN.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A new portal, bCentral, was announced, offering diverse services
to new businesses. And the second release candidate for Windows
2000 was made available to nearly 750,000 beta testers.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter generated $2 billion in free cash flow, an amount
that is becoming typical. Using part of its already huge cash
cache, Microsoft made six investments and five acquisitions during
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, five pertained primarily to creating or accelerating
broadband Internet access, three were intended to enhance existing
Microsoft software products, two furthered the development of
cellular phone technology and wireless Internet access, and one
speeds Internet page-loading.
</P>
<P>
   Chronic doomsayer Maffei actually sounded upbeat during the
teleconference, saying he anticipates continued growth at or near
the same levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done very well in the past few quarters and you have to
feel good and optimistic about the periods ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned against anticipating a revenue spike from the
shipment of Windows 2000, which he reiterated is due to be released
to manufacturing before year's end. Sales of that product may take
time to ramp up, he said.

HOUSE BACKS MEDICARE EXPANSION TO HELP DISABLED RETURN TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mo., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the House
of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill expanding Medicaid and
Medicare so that hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities
could return to work and keep their health insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, when disabled people return to work, they
often lose Medicaid and Medicare, and without such coverage they
cannot obtain the health care or medical equipment they need to
hold onto their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sailed through the House on a vote of 412-9. All the
negative votes were cast by Republicans. The Senate passed a
similar bill by a vote of 99-0 in June.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the legislation is the most important step to
help the disabled since passage of the Americans With Disabilities
Act in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Tuesday that he was ``extremely pleased''
with the House vote. But he asserted that the House bill ``has
flaws,'' including limits on the health insurance options for
disabled workers. Clinton also said he disliked some proposed
financing for the new benefits, including a provision that affects
student loans.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he hoped that negotiators from the House and Senate
would address these issues when they meet to work out their
differences. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a co-author of the
Senate bill, said he hoped Congress would send ``this landmark
legislation'' to the president before adjourning this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who was chief sponsor of the House
bill, said, ``Our economy needs Americans with disabilities in the
work force.'' But, he said, they are discouraged from working
because under current federal rules, ``people with disabilities
must get poor and stay poor if they're going to retain their health
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been been carried on a bipartisan tide,
extremely unusual in this Congress. Liberal Democrats have long
championed the rights of the disabled and want to expand federal
health programs to cover more people. Republicans are eager to
minimize the use of many federal benefit programs and want to
encourage work effort by people who now rely on the government for
most of their income.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of both parties said they had heard many appeals from
disabled people who want to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rarely do we have a group of people who come to us saying, 'We
want to be taxpayers, we want to be productive,''' said Rep. Kenny
Hulshof, R-Mo., co-author of the House bill. ``Our message to the
disabled is that we hear you, and we want to provide more
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the Senate and House bills is roughly $750 million
in the first five years and slightly more than $1 billion in the
next five years, for a total of $1.8 billion from 2000 to 2009. The
Senate did not specify how to pay or offset these costs. And House
Republicans said the Clinton administration had provided little
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said that the Senate did not propose ``one dime of
offsets'' to the cost of the legislation. Moreover, he said, ``we
got zero help from the White House'' in finding ways to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said these assertions were
``patently false.'' Other Democrats said House Republicans had
rejected various methods of financing proposed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills would help disabled people in these
ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ People who lose eligibility for Social Security disability
benefits because they return to work could keep their Medicare
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   _ People with disabilities could buy Medicaid coverage even if
they took jobs and earned income that would otherwise disqualify
them.
</P>
<P>
   _ States could provide Medicaid to workers who are not actually
disabled, but have physical or mental impairments that are
``reasonably expected'' to become severe disabilities in the
absence of medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   This provision could help people who have been infected with
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, but have not developed symptoms of
the disease. With Medicaid coverage, they could obtain the
expensive prescription drugs they need to fight off the disease and
continue working.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said this provision would also help people with
cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease.

GORE SAYS CLINTON WILL BE INVOLVED IN HIS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore met with liberal Democrats
on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to declare that President Clinton would
be involved in his campaign and that any impressions to the
contrary were mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told the Congressional Progressive Caucus about Clinton's
involvement in the campaign, the vice president's spokesman, Chris
Lehane, told reporters. Gore also emphasized that he must keep his
own identity to win, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., who was at the meeting, said Gore
``explained the difference between being vice president and being a
candidate for president.'' Conyers added, ``He was explaining that
he is more and more becoming his own man without contradicting or
repudiating the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore said that he viewed his campaign as a ``very
personal quest'' and that he had not yet decided what role Clinton
should play. Some listeners interpreted his remarks as an effort by
Gore to distance himself from the president as the 2000 campaign
intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton said on Monday that ``no one can help anyone else
in a campaign beyond a certain point,'' there was further
speculation that Gore would rather Clinton watched from the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Not at all, Gore seemed to be saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't try to distance himself from the president,'' said
Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., who was at the caucus meeting. ``He
said what he needs to do is make a direct connection with the
American people, that people will vote for him on whether they
think he will be a good president.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his relationship with Clinton, Gore discussed several
issues, including a possible minimum wage increase and health care,
with the caucus, people who were there told reporters.

WILL WALLACE RETURN TO L.A.?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Dave Wallace, who spent three seasons as the
Dodgers pitching coach before joining the Mets front office two
years ago, could be lured back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone has been mum on the
team's coaching situation, several sources said the Dodgers will
ask for permission to speak to Wallace once the Mets' season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Regarded as one of the best pitching coaches in baseball,
Wallace left his front-office position with the Mets to become the
team's pitching coach when Bob Apodaca was fired during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Malone wanted to have a decision on the coaching
staff by now, but the Mets' playoff run, which took them into Game
6 of the National League Championship Series at Atlanta on Tuesday,
has delayed the plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have yet to announce anything about their coaching
staff, which underwent a change during the season when pitching
coach Charlie Hough was fired. Claude Osteen, who was the pitching
coach at Triple-A Albuquerque, was promoted May 26. ``I'm sure
something is going on because we haven't heard anything yet,''
Osteen said. ``I try not to worry about it because it's something I
can't control. With the way it happened, I did the best job I could
and that's what I look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Osteen said he would like the opportunity to come back and have
a full year with a staff that, at this moment, features Kevin
Brown, Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort and Ismael Valdes as starters.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, like Osteen, has experience in dealing with the younger
Dodgers starters. Not only was he the Dodgers' pitching coach from
1995 through 1997, he spent nine seasons as the Dodgers' roving
minor-league pitching instructor and knows Park, Dreifort and
Valdes well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Dodgers' staff ERA of 3.46 was the second-best in
baseball. Two years earlier, the Dodgers' team ERA was 3.66,
second-best in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace does have an affinity for New England. He grew up
and went to school in Connecticut and lives in Massachusetts in the
offseason. However, there's been a running public feud with Mets
manager Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was quoted as saying Wallace, who was senior executive
of player personnel for the Mets, should not have had a hand in the
firing of Apodaca, particularly since Wallace took over the
pitching coach duties.

LIFTING SPIRITS ON WALL STREET, MICROSOFT PROFIT BEATS FORECASTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. reported quarterly earnings Tuesday that
convincingly surpassed Wall Street's expectations and reflected
strong demand for personal computers and their software.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the encouraging report from Microsoft, the world's
leading software maker, is likely to lift investors' confidence in
the shares of high-technology companies, which have recently fallen
sharply. ``This will probably be a bullish signal for the
beaten-down technology stocks,'' said Rick Sherlund of Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading Tuesday, Microsoft shares jumped more
than $3 on news of the strong earnings report. They had declined
$1.5625, to $86.3125, in the regular session.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dell Computer and Intel have recently issued warnings of
slimmer profits. Both companies attributed the expected slippage to
temporary circumstances like higher memory-chip prices and supply
disruptions caused by the earthquake in Taiwan. But the
announcements raised fears of a fundamental weakness in the
technology sector, which has fueled the U.S. economy's growth and
the stock market's ascent for years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives sought to quash those wider concerns
Tuesday. Their tone was more forcefully optimistic than in previous
earnings announcements, a practiced quarterly ritual in which
Microsoft reports extraordinary profit figures accompanied by
guarded commentary about the many challenges the company faces in
the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, however, a press release announcing the earnings
carried the headline, ``Awesome PC Demand Drives Outstanding
Microsoft Quarterly Results.'' In an interview, Gregory B. Maffei,
the chief financial officer, described the financial performance as
``a really big quarter'' and later ``a great quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's earnings per share, after excluding the gain from
the sale of one business, rose 36 percent, to 38 cents a share. The
consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts had been for profit of
34 cents a share for the quarter, which ended on Sept. 30. The
result was ahead, as well, of the so-called whisper number of 35
cents a share, the estimate analysts mention to favored clients,
which may differ from their published earnings projections.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's revenue increased 28 percent, to $5.38 billion, up
from $4.19 billion in the quarter a year earlier. Including a $156
million gain from the sale of the entertainment city-guide portion
of its MSN Sidewalk online service, Microsoft's net income rose
more than 30 percent, to $2.19 billion, up from $1.68 billion a
year earlier. The 1998 results had included a $160 million gain
from the sale of a software subsidiary, Softimage.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives were sharply questioned about one
balance-sheet item: a decline of $110 million from the June quarter
in deferred revenue, to just under $4.13 billion. The reason
analysts focus on this item is that they regard it as a financial
cushion: The time when Microsoft recognizes revenue on its software
licenses to corporations can sharply affect the quarterly earnings.
Recognizing more revenue in a particular quarter can give a
one-time lift to that quarter's earnings. Maffei said the drop from
the June quarter reflected seasonality in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's quarterly statements, and the follow-up conference
call with securities analysts and reporters, are scrutinized as
much for nuance as for numbers. The performance this time was
intended to emphasize that the company is successfully making the
transition to becoming an Internet software company.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, Microsoft points out, remains the main
conduit people use to get onto the Internet. And its Windows NT
server software, which runs on hub computers that send Web pages to
users, is becoming increasingly popular among Internet service
providers and ``dot.com'' Internet start-ups, according to
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting an enormous kick from the Internet,'' Maffei
said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is unquestionably a beneficiary of the Internet,
analysts agree. But they say a question remains as to how
successful Microsoft will be in competing against Sun Microsystems,
IBM and others in supplying the industrial-strength software
required to run big central data centers, which are proliferating
because of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The long-delayed new upgrade of Windows NT, called Windows 2000,
is the operating system that Microsoft is betting on to move into
the markets for heavyweight corporate computing and data centers.
In its conference call, the company reiterated that it expects to
release Windows 2000 later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also said that there was little evidence yet that
concerns about the Year 2000 software problem, or Y2K, were causing
a halt in computer buying. The fear had been that corporate
customers would spend all their information technology budgets on
fixing Y2K problems in existing computers instead of buying new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   By region, the biggest rise in sales was in Asia, where revenue
increased 82 percent compared with the 1998 quarter. Japan accounts
for about 80 percent of sales in the Asian region. A stronger
Japanese economy and a rising yen helped lift the result, Maffei
noted, but the global spread of the Internet phenomenon was also a
big factor. ``Japan is getting very focused on the Internet,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Sewage spill under control in Florida
 &HT;    By Molly Hennessy-Fiske and Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A raw sewage spill environment officials
deemed among the largest in Florida history was brought under
control Tuesday afternoon at the Fort Pierce Utilities Authority
plant on the Indian River Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   A plume from the spill, which began Monday afternoon and
exceeded 8 million gallons, spread for miles up and down the
fragile lagoon ecosystem and out into the ocean. Beaches from
Indian River County through Martin County were closed, and health
officials fearing contamination said they will not reopen until
tests indicate safe bacteria levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good part is there's been a lot of storm water released
because of the hurricane. That might have diluted (the sewage). But
you could also see a lot of unexpected stuff (besides sewage)
because it is storm water,'' St. Lucie Health Department
Administrator Diane Walgren said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucie County officials were critical of the utilities
authority's failure to notify other agencies immediately after the
spill occurred.
</P>
<P>
   County Administrator Doug Anderson said county officials learned
of the spill three hours after it occurred from someone who called
911.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said the health department, state Department of
Environmental Protection and state warning system weren't notified
either.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners Cliff Barnes and Doug Coward said the county
should work to get the authority to move the sewage plant off
Hutchinson Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hired a consultant to pick the worst place for a sewage
treatment plant, that's the one they would name,'' Coward said.
</P>
<P>
   During a flyover Tuesday afternoon, sheriff's deputies observed
a plume of sewage 10 miles north, 6 miles south and about 6 miles
east and west of the south bridge that spans Indian River Lagoon in
Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and a representative from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency also flew over the county in a helicopter Tuesday
to inspect damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could smell the sewage spill from the air,'' Anderson
said, displaying aerial photos of dark brown water in the Fort
Pierce Inlet.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Russell, Florida Department of Environmental Protection
program manager for domestic waterways, described the leak as
``unpredictable'' and the spill that resulted as the largest he has
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen similar circumstances, but never of this
magnitude,'' said Russell, who has worked in waste-water management
for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Walgren said the department took about 20 samples of ocean and
river water Tuesday and will have results of water quality tests
later today. Martin County Health Department spokesman Bob Washam
said he took water samples Tuesday at seven sites, and expects
results after two days. The county will continue testing water for
the next two weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria in sewage can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and other
digestive problems.
</P>
<P>
   FPUA Director of Utilities Elie ``Bud'' Boudreaux said the
36-inch pipe responsible for causing the spill had been leaking for
36 hours before it finally broke from the stress caused by the
torrents from Hurricane Irene's rains. It released a stream of
waste water into the lagoon Monday at a rate of 625,000 gallons an
hour. Boudreaux said the storm stressed the slightly corroded 15
year-old pipe as 15 million gallons of storm water a day, more than
twice the normal flow, coursed through this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm only exacerbated the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreaux expects emergency spill control equipment and staff
costs to reach $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said they closed the beaches, ``because we
don't know what the concentration is,'' Walgren said. ``We're
erring on the side of caution.''
</P>
<P>
   But while most Martin County beach entrances were barricaded and
had signs hand-lettered on scraps of cardboard warning ``Beach
Closed. Health Hazard,'' Jensen Beach was wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they ran out of barricades,'' lifeguard Capt. Bruce
Shaw said. ``We had quite a few people try to get into the water. I
don't know why we're open. We've had guards chasing people out of
the water all day. I've been telling them, 'You can lie out there,
but if you want to get wet, take a shower.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beachgoer Gail Sicchio, who works as a nurse at Club Med in Port
St. Lucie, was disappointed she and her father, Egil Aasen of
Tarpon Springs, couldn't go in the water. Aasen, 75, was critical
of the way officials dealt with Hurricane Irene and said the sewage
plant should be equipped to handle storm-related problems
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything should be hurricane-proof here,'' he said. ``I was
here a month ago and told my wife I never had seen such clean,
clear water. I thought about moving here. Now I think I'll stay
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not swimming today,'' said Matt Schneider of Fort
Pierce, baiting his hook in hopes of catching bluefish in the ocean
with friend DeeDee Zimmerman of Jensen Beach. ``If the waves were
outstanding, though, I'd be surfing. I think the ocean will take
care of this. ``
</P>
<P>
   A heavy stench was apparent on Hutchinson Island from just south
of the St. Lucie nuclear plant to the Bear Point area, but health
officials said it was due to hydrogen sulfide from rotting
vegetation in the island's swamps. Hurricane Irene's winds stirred
up the decaying matter, which depleted oxygen in the water and
contributed to a fish kill near the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Hasbrouck and her daughter Carol Liciaga spent their last
day at the beach before returning to their homes in New York's
Catskill Mountains enjoying the sun but not the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the spill as it happened,'' Hasbrouck said. ``I saw
something going into the Indian River as I crossed the bridge. It
didn't look too kosher to me.''
</P>
<P>
   DEP spokesman Gary Roderick said an estimated 8 million gallons
of effluent went into the river before plant officials finally
stemmed the flow by installing a hydraulic water pump at about 1:30
p.m. Tuesday. DEP officials took water samples north and south of
the facility for a mile and at nearby ocean beaches, and should
have test results today Roderick said. Penalties and fines for the
accident will take months to compute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to wait until we know all the impacts to the
environment _ such as sedimentation in the lagoon _ which could
take two months or more. We have to see if the failure was
avoidable, check the plant's maintenance records,'' Roderick said.
</P>
<P>
   A spill five years ago at the Fort Pierce plant left 700 gallons
of raw sewage in the lagoon after a sewage pump failed at a plant
lift station across the river. The year before, 130,000 gallons
spilled into the lagoon through a faulty valve. The plant was not
fined a potential $10,000 by the DEP for either spill.
</P>
<P>
   The latest spill at the plant follows sewage leaks in Palm Beach
County that led officials there to close beaches Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ``complicated ecological system'' within the
lagoon, Russell said it is too soon to say how long it will be
before the spill washes away.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday he was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking days, not months,'' Russell said.

   No one asked Emmanuel A. Kampouris whether he could surf the Web
when he was named chief executive of the American Standard Co.s in
1989. Nor did anyone at the LTV Corp. question Peter E. Kelly about
the marketing potential of the Internet when he was named president
of the company in 1991 and became a front-runner for the top job.
For that matter, the World Wide Web did not even exist when John F.
Welch Jr. took over the General Electric Co. in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone eager to succeed those chiefs had better be as
familiar with the Internet as their predecessors were with
mainframes and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that E-commerce has joined quality, globalization and
services as a companywide initiative, it's a good bet that the next
CEO will be savvy about the Internet,'' said Bruce Bunch, a
spokesman for GE, which is bracing for Welch's retirement in
December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a wager at American Standard, a maker of
bathroom fixtures and air-conditioning equipment. Just this month
it tapped Frederic Poses, president of the Allied Signal Corp., to
succeed Kampouris, who also will retire next year. American
Standard recently began selling to distributors on the Web, and
Kampouris had told recruiters to put ``conversant with the
Internet'' up there with integrity and leadership as major
qualifications for his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be sure that all candidates understand that you
have to invest in the Internet, even if it detracts from next
quarter's earnings,'' Kampouris said. ``Allied Signal has been
moving heavily toward the Internet, so it seems clear that Fred
Poses is committed.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, even old-line industries are realizing that
cyberspace is crucial to their future. Few expect their chiefs to
design Web pages or be power Web surfers. But they want leaders who
recognize that a workable Internet strategy goes straight to the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they don't specify Internet savvy by name, they are
asking for it,'' said Gerard R. Roche, chairman of Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles, a search firm. ``They say: `The world is moving at warp
speed; get me someone who's comfortable with that.' Since the
Internet is the major revolution of today, I wouldn't dream of
providing a candidate who doesn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, lack of demonstrable Internet skills is rarely a deal
breaker. ``The Internet is such a new phenomenon that it would be
too limiting to mandate hands-on experience,'' said Thomas J. Neff,
chairman of U.S. operations for the search firm Spencer Stuart.
``Sure, it's a plus, but industry experience and ability to lead
teams rank a lot higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neff expects that within two years he will routinely ask
candidates about their Internet experience. Similarly, Jeffrey E.
Christian, chairman of the executive-recruiting firm Christian &AMP;
Timbers, expects the proportion of non-Internet companies demanding
Internet expertise to grow from 30 percent today to 60 percent in
just six months and to 100 percent three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the CEO who must understand how Internet strategies
blend with overall strategies, and who must line up strategic
alliances and joint venture deals,'' Christian said. ``And it is
the CEO who has to keep a sales force motivated even as you build
E-commerce vehicles that will eliminate their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years from now, such people will be plentiful. The
candidates of that era are probably in their 20s or 30s today, and
the Internet is as seamless a part of their lives as a microwave
oven or CD player.
</P>
<P>
   But few will be seasoned enough to head a Fortune 500 company
anytime soon. That worries Kelly, 57, who became chairman of LTV in
February. LTV, which buys and sells steel on line, has incorporated
Internet awareness into every aspect of management development.
``Our 25- and 35-year-old up-and-comers find all this stuff
natural,'' he said. ``It is the 45-to-55-year-olds we worry about.
Those that argued against selling on the Net certainly hurt their
chances in the succession plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters say that the lack of home-grown Web knowledge is a
key reason that companies go outside for top-level talent.
Christian said he had a mandate to fill in that gap when the
Hewlett-Packard Co. hired his firm to find a chief executive to
replace Lewis E. Platt. He noted that Carly Fiorina, who got the
job in July, had racked up a lot of Net-based experience at Lucent
Technologies, her former employer.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives, many in their 50s or 60s, often must be
content with recognizing, not generating, good ideas. It never
occurred to Michael R. Bonsignore, the 58-year-old chief executive
of Honeywell Inc., to give customers access, for a fee, to the
company's equipment-testing software on a Honeywell Web page. But
when younger people suggested it, he jumped on it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Honeywell, which recently agreed to merge with the much
larger Allied Signal Corp., has invited customers to use another
Honeywell Web site, dubbed myplant.com, as a chat room to exchange
ideas. The hit rate is high enough, Bonsignore says, that more than
100 companies have paid Honeywell a fee to advertise on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore, who will head the merged company, expects
significant hands-on Internet ability from his own potential heirs.
``My successor will have had to demonstrate that he or she had used
the Internet to create value,'' he said. ``And it's not too early
to identify the people who should be on the radar screen.''

 &HT;    Braves try different approach against Leiter
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves entered Tuesday night's game with a
specific game plan against Mets starter Al Leiter: be patient.
</P>
<P>
   They probably didn't expect it to work so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter failed to retire a batter as the Braves scored five runs
in the first inning. He allowed two hits, a walk and two hit
batsmen, and another batter reached on a fielder's choice when the
Mets failed to get a forceout at second.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Mahomes replaced Leiter and retired the Braves on a
sacrifice fly and a double-play grounder. All five runs were
charged to Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter was pitching on three days' rest, so the Braves had hoped
to benefit from forcing him throwing a lot of pitches. They never
had a chance to find out if that strategy would work _ the Mets'
starter was gone after 25 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   McGlinchy rebounds
</P>
<P>
   Two days after his disastrous outing in the Game 5 loss to the
Mets, Kevin McGlinchy had pulled himself together. After a game
that could potentially break the spirit a young pitcher, McGlinchy
had the sounds of a someone on the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the toughest things in sports I've ever
faced,'' said McGlinchy, who walked in the tying run in 15th
inning, then gave up the go-ahead hit to Robin Ventura. ``It's the
toughest thing I've faced, and I've already dealt with it. I'm
ready to get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves make the World Series, there's a chance McGlinchy
will be left off the roster. With a Yankees lineup dominated by
left-handed hitters, the Braves might use left-hander Bruce Chen
instead. That would leave Russ Springer as the only right-handed
reliever, but John Smoltz, who would start Game 4, would be
available out of the bullpen for Games 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Chen recently returned from workouts at the Braves instructional
league team in Lake Buena Vista. ``Facing some hitters was good,''
Chen said. ``I got to work on some things.''
</P>
<P>
   More Baylor interest
</P>
<P>
   Braves general manager John Schuerholz was contacted Tuesday by
both the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians seeking
permission to interview hitting coach Don Baylor for their managing
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   At Schuerholz's request, Baylor will not to interview with
either club until the Braves' season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect for what we're trying to do, I'm going to wait
until we're through,'' said Baylor, who's already interviewed with
the Cubs, Angels and Brewers. Those talks came earlier in the
postseason when the Braves were not playing.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser interested, too
</P>
<P>
   The Indians have also talked to Mets pitcher Orel Hershiser
about being their new manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of brief conversations,'' said Hershiser, a
41-year-old right-hander who was 13-12 this year. His career record
is 203-145.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser pitched for the Indians from 1995-97. He has a good
relationship with Cleveland general manager John Hart, who fired
Mike Hargrove last week
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when this part is over, that is something I would be
interested in, interested in talking to John about,'' Hershiser
said. ``We agreed it's not fair to me to talk about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Time-Warner chairman of the board Gerald Levin was on hand, and
this time dressed for the occasion. He wore a Braves uniform shirt
over his dress shirt, with his name spelled out across the back. He
sat not far from former president Jimmy Carter and Rosalyn, making
one of their numerous postseason appearances in Ted Turner's box.
... Scouting the game for the Yankees was a name and face familiar
to Braves historians, Bob Didier. Didier was the catcher on the
Braves' Western Division championship team in 1969. ... There won't
be much time between seasons for Bruce Benedict, the Mets coach who
returned to the dugout with Cookie Rojas' five-game suspension
served. He opens his Southeastern Conference officiating season at
Auburn Nov. 2, two days after scheduled end of the World Series.

TOP DRUG COMPANIES POST VIBRANT 3RD-QUARTER RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the world's largest pharmaceutical companies were to choose a
theme to accompany this week's third-quarter earnings
announcements, it might be ``Let the Good Times Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, maker of the impotence pill Viagra, surprised analysts
Tuesday by announcing a 36 percent increase in third-quarter
operating income, to $906 million. The company said it earned 23
cents a diluted share, excluding charges, which is 2 cents above
the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb, once dismissed by
some of their competitors as lumbering conglomerates, also reported
sterling results. Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which makes the antipsychotic
drug Risperdal and the pain killer Tylenol, had a 14.4 percent
increase in third-quarter earnings, to $1.1 billion. The company
said it earned 80 cents a diluted share, 2 cents above the estimate
from First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's largest maker of cancer drugs,
posted a 14 percent gain in third-quarter earnings, to $1.09
billion. The company earned 54 cents a diluted share, which met
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this year, drug stocks had been ignored by
investors, despite strong earnings gains in the first two quarters.
Yet, the sizzling performances posted by drug makers this week
appear to have sparked strong investor interest.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb jumped 6.5 percent Tuesday, or
$4.625, to close at $76.125. Johnson &AMP; Johnson's stock increased
5.5 percent, or $5.25, to $99.75. Pfizer's shares rose 6.1 percent,
or $2.3125, to $39.9375.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The robust earnings gains also helped lift the shares of other
drug makers. Shares of Warner-Lambert jumped 5.5 percent, or
$3.875, to close at $74.4375. American Home Products stock
increased 5 percent, or $2.3125, to $48.50.
</P>
<P>
   One key to the drug companies' strong performances has been the
demand for prescription drugs in the United States. Bristol-Myers,
which posted record third-quarter sales of $5 billion, increased
its United States drug sales by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though worldwide sales of Pravachol, Bristol-Myers
cholesterol-reducing drug, dropped 1 percent in the third quarter
to $386 million _ thanks largely to competition from
Warner-Lambert's Lipitor _ the company's other brands made up for
the difference. Sales of Glucophage, the leading branded oral
medication for Type-2 diabetes, jumped 57 percent, to $349 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bristol-Myers Squibb is this monster-sized company,'' said
David Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``But they have
turned in some really solid numbers, especially in their
pharmaceutical division.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson, which reported third-quarter revenue of $6.7
billion, raised its U.S. drug sales 35.7 percent, to $1.56 billion.
While many manufacturers of consumer products have stumbled in
recent months, Johnson &AMP; Johnson consumer sales increased 14
percent in the quarter, to $921 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company just beat our expectations everywhere,'' Saks
said. ``Johnson &AMP; Johnson had strong drug sales but they also had a
rebirth in the consumer division. It is no longer a drag on
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, which reported $3.99 billion in sales during the third
quarter, managed to prosper despite a mild misfortune. The company
took an after-tax charge of $205 million in the third quarter to
write off inventories of the antibiotic Trovan, after concerns
arose about possible serious side effects with the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported strong sales in several brands. Worldwide
sales of Viagra jumped 77 percent, to $249 million. Revenue that
Pfizer earned from alliances with other companies to co-promote
several drugs _ including Lipitor and the arthritis drug Celebrex _
more than doubled to $569 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were confident that the drug companies' good
fortunes would continue, at least through the end of this year.
Schering-Plough and Eli Lilly are expected to report earnings gains
Wednesday of 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively. But other
analysts are not overly confident that the enthusiasm will last.
Most drug stocks have declined this year, with the notable
exception of Bristol-Myers, which has climbed 13.7 percent, and
Johnson &AMP; Johnson's, up 18.9 percent. &QL;

JUSTICE DEPT. OPPOSED CLEMENCY FOR PUERTO RICAN MILITANTS IN '96  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Puerto Rico)   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department formally urged President
Clinton to deny clemency to imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists in
December 1996, a recommendation that the White House never
acknowledged in the furor over the presidential decision to commute
the sentences of the members of a militant group.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation, dated Dec. 19, 1996, was cited in a 1997
letter to Charles F.C. Ruff, the former White House counsel, from
Margaret C. Love, then the U.S. pardon attorney at the Justice
Department. The letter, obtained Tuesday night from government
officials, is significant because it shows for the first time that
the White House had been officially advised against releasing the
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has never discussed its deliberations or the
details of advice it received from the Justice Department, citing
executive privilege. Justice Department officials have acknowledged
that there was a recommendation on the clemency question in 1996,
but have not said that it urged denial.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a White House official would not discuss the specifics
of the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said all along that the president made a careful,
balanced decision based on the merits of this case and he fully
considered the facts, the law and different points of view,'' a
White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said. ``The president stands by
his decision. He recognizes that people feel strongly on all sides
of this issue, and we certainly respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision earlier this year to offer clemency to 16
members of the nationalist group, known in Spanish as FALN, has
been bitterly attacked by Republicans in Congress as an effort to
aid the expected campaign by Hillary Rodham Clinton to run in New
York for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to
question senior Justice Department officials about the clemency
decision, among them Eric H. Holder Jr., the deputy attorney
general, and Roger Adams, the pardon attorney who succeeded Ms.
Love.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate panel is likely to delve into the department's 1996
recommendation from the pardon attorney, said Jeanne Lopatto, a
spokeswoman for Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is
chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

 State Ruling Pares PG&AMP;E Rate Hikes  &HT;     By Kenneth Howe 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A preliminary decision by state regulators yesterday sharply cut
utility rate increases proposed by Pacific Gas and Electric Co.,
potentially saving utility customers hundreds of millions of
dollars a year.
<P>
   A California Public Utility Commission judge recommended that
PG&AMP;E, the state's largest utility, be allowed to raise rates $243
million a year _ far less than the $822 million it had requested.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the whittled-down rate increase would amount to
about $2.90 a month, but only about $1 a month actually would show
up on their gas bills.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers wouldn't see the remaining $1.90 increase in their
electricity bills. Instead, PG&AMP;E is likely to collect that money by
keeping current rates, which were scheduled to go down, at the same
level for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mark Wetzell said in his ruling that the increase PG&AMP;E
requested ``exceeded the levels needed by PG&AMP;E to provide safe,
reliable and responsive public utility service.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetzell's ruling is significant because it becomes the
foundation for any further action by the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tons better than what PG&AMP;E initially asked for, but
it's difficult to call this a victory for the consumer,'' said
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network, a
San Francisco consumer group that tracks utilities. ``But it's
still a quarter of a billion-dollar increase.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that TURN had asked for a decrease in rates and that
the PUC's Office of Ratepayer Advocate had recommended a much
smaller rise in rates.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed increase still must go through PUC hearings and
receive a majority of votes by the five commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it needed the money to maintain and upgrade its
huge network of natural gas pipelines and electrical transmission
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely frustrated by the judge's analysis,'' said
Dede Hapner, PG&AMP;E's vice president for regulatory relations. She
said Wetzell had slashed money for tree-trimming operations as well
as for a major gas-pipeline-replacement project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the five commissioners take a better look at our
proposal,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   When PG&AMP;E first broached the topic of a rate increase two years
ago, it asked for $1 billion a year, which would have been the
largest rate jump in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   That request prompted TURN to accuse the utility of attempting
to ``set a new standard for chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the PUC's announcement yesterday, PG&AMP;E's shares closed at
$23.13, down $1.63, a two-year low, amid concern that the utility
would not get the rate increase it desired.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in another dose of bad news for investors, PG&AMP;E Corp.
reported that its third-quarter earnings fell 13 percent because
regulators reduced the amount that the utility can earn and because
a fire cut its power production.
</P>
<P>
   In its request to the PUC for a rate hike, PG&AMP;E had asked for a
$445 million increase for electric rates and $377 million for
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   But in his ruling issued late yesterday afternoon, the
administrative law judge suggested authorizing PG&AMP;E to collect an
additional $180 million for electricity and $63 million for gas.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision on the size of the rate increase won't occur
until the five PUC commissioners vote on the matter later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Commission President Richard A. Bilas issued an alternative
proposal yesterday that would give PG&AMP;E a rate increase of $265
million.

HALL A HEAVYWEIGHT BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ It is a rare occurrence that Kansas State
running back Joe Hall has the opportunity to look a defender in the
eyes. After all, Hall doesn't have eyes in his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Hall, a graduate of Artesia High, who is a currently
junior at Kansas State, stands 6-foot-2, is listed on the Wildat
roster as being 6-foot-2 and 300 pounds and has been timed at 4.6
seconds in the 40-yard dash. Attacking a player head on with that
size and speed is generally not the smartest thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them go for my ankles,'' said Hall, who proclaims to
be 15 pounds lighter than his listed weight.
</P>
<P>
   Hall did get a chance to see a defender's eyes as he barrelled
toward Iowa State's end zone in a game earlier this season. Or he
would have seen the player's eyes if they had happened to be open
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny,'' Hall recalled. ``He was trying to hit me high
but closed his eyes even before I got to him. Once (that happened)
I
</P>
<P>
   just sidestepped him and went into the end zone. Everybody
thought I ran right through him, but all I did was avoid him.''
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding contact has been Hall's method of running from the
moment he first cradled a football. He is probably college
football's biggest runner easily surpassing Texas A&AMP;M's Ja'Mar
Toombs (6-1, 260) and Wisconsin's Ron Dayne (5-10, 253) but, in a
way, Hall is a 170-pound scatback wrapped in a 300-pound body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather make somebody miss than run them over,'' said Hall,
who rushed for 195 yards and two touchdowns last week against Utah
State and will get his first start for the Wildcats on Saturday at
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, that attitude make-them-miss approach was born
because Hall, who was 265 pounds as a senior at Artesia, was bigger
than his prep opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't take any pride running people over,'' said Hall, who
attended Pius X as a freshman and sophomore, Serra as a junior and
Artesia as a senior. ``There's wasn't any doubt I could have run
(more) people over. I was bigger and faster than most of them. But
what would that have proved?''
</P>
<P>
   Hall proved himself to be a well-rounded athlete no pun intended
in high school. He started in basketball for four years and helped
Artesia advance to the CIF Southern Section Division II-AA title
game in that sport as a senior. That spring, he started in right
field for the CIF finalist Artesia baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents (Joe and Evon Hall) always stressed that I learn
how to play every position at each sport I played.'' said Hall, who
could dunk a basketball as a prep player and was an All-CIF
football player. ``That helped me become a better overall
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Good grades, however, didn't come as easily and playing in
junior college was his only option. He shunned the local community
colleges, opting instead to play at Palomar College, where he
rushed for 1,760 yards and 24 touchdowns last season as a
sophomore. He was selected as the California Offensive Player of
the Year last year after leading the Comets to the junior college
national title.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State won the recruiting battle over Utah, USC and Hawaii
because the Wildcats were the only finalist who envisioned Hall as
a tailback. However, when he reached Manhattan, Kan. in the summer,
Hall had too much weight 323 pounds and not enough units to be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``School is not hard for me,'' said Hall, who had to take 17
units at Kansas State in the summer to become eligible. ``I've just
always had other things going on. But now, school is important.
There's no way I'll be as far behind as I was this summer. With
more attention on school work, I gained the extra weight.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, Hall was situated behind returning
starter Frank Murphy and David Allen at tailback. He played in four
of the first games, some of the time at a fullback, rushing for 73
yards on 14 carries and scoring on a 28-yard run against Iowa
State.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy had ankle surgery after hurting himself in the fourth
week against Texas and Hall rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown on
11 carries as a backup to Allen against Kansas. It became Hall's
job when Allen left with a sprained knee early in last week's 40-0
victory over Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   Hall carried the ball 25 times for 195 yards against Utah State.
It was the most yards rushing by a Kansas State player since
Michael Bishop gained 196 against Missouri on Oct. 11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hall is a big boy and a very hard runner,'' Utah State
linebacker Josh Manning said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State coach Bill Snyder, who is a hard man to please,
sounded afterwards like, well, a hard man to please.
</P>
<P>
   ``By in large, it appears that he played pretty well,'' Snyder
said, ``and he is coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall vowed that a new found work ethic will help him retain the
job when Murphy and Allen return.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Murphy) is a hard worker,'' Hall said. ``He'll kill himself
before he lets anybody do more than him. I'm the total opposite. I
don't really do any of the extra stuff. I do what I'm supposed to
do and that's about it. That's going to change. The coaches are
asking me to do more and I don't have a problem with that. It's my
time.''

 &HT;    Hurricane forecasters weather flak
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane forecasters, stung by
criticism that people were caught off guard when Irene veered from
its most likely path and moved through coastal South Florida,
stressed again Tuesday the storm's track was within a probable
strike zone and would have dumped torrential rains on Palm Beach
County and the Treasure Coast regardless of the change in
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center near Miami said a tropical storm
warning for the region was appropriate because no hurricane-force
winds were recorded anywhere in the three counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why things are confusing to people,'' center
director Jerry Jarrell said. ``We had a hurricane. There's no
question about it. But you and I didn't get hurricane conditions.
We got tropical storm conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County's emergency management director, Bill O'Brien,
was more critical of himself than the hurricane center on Tuesday,
saying his office opened shelters for people who didn't feel
comfortable in their homes but in hindsight, should have encouraged
mobile home evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those guys do the very best they can,'' O'Brien said of
the hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said the storm's path shifted in those crucial hours on
Friday because its eye reformed several times over land, each time
moving to the east _ a phenomenon forecasters can't explain. He
said such events occurred last year in several storms in the Gulf
of Mexico, with the eye jumping as much as 75 miles over to the
east. Jarrell said that's why tracking charts showed a steady track
to the northeast even as the center continued to forecast a
northern path.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're connecting the dots, it was'' heading north, Jarrell
said. ``But if you're watching the eye, you're seeing it reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said that the strongest rains were farther east of
center, and had the storm stayed on a path west of Lake Okeechobee,
coastal Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast would have
received even more rain.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell also said a fire last month inside a weather computer in
Maryland may have contributed to the less-than-exact forecast. The
center made only two models a day instead of four, while other
agencies' computers were available to do the other two models.
Jarrell said that may have hampered the forecasting but it was
early too say.
</P>
<P>
   The center also suggested on Tuesday that employers consider
sending employees home in a tropical storm warning instead of a
hurricane warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a meteorological distinction between 73 mph as a
tropical storm and 74 mph as a hurricane,'' National Hurricane
Center spokesman Frank Lepore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's natural,'' O'Brien said. ``People hear
`hurricane' and they think anything from what we saw to Andrew. We
have some strong storms on a routine basis in the summer that have
tropical storm force winds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hines, senior vice president of the Business Development
Board of Palm Beach County, said the idea of companies sending
workers home in tropical storm warnings is ``worth the weather
service presenting it to employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrell said the center doesn't want to get into the business of
deciding when to open shelters, evacuate or order employees home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emergency management folks feel that is not our business,''
Jarrell said. ``We agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents who suffered storm damage will base their insurance
claims, and deductibles, on a hurricane strike, said Don Pride,
spokesman for the Florida Department of Insurance.

 Micron Uses Shock Ads To Generate Customers  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Micron Electronics unveils its new identity as a computer-services
provider in an arresting advertising campaign that launches today.
<P>
   Micron, the country's third-largest direct seller of PCs, is
targeting small and medium-size businesses as potential clients of
``subscription computing'' _ a package of computer hardware and
services sold at a flat monthly rate. The company will usher in a
new name, Micronpc.com, during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the tone will be a lengthy, 60-second spot by British
director Terry Gilliam that recreates the spooky feel of
``Brazil,'' one of Gilliam's feature films.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, created by Goldberg Moser O'Neill of San
Francisco, is directed at owners of small and medium-size
businesses and their information technology decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ad, ``Labyrinth,'' a chief executive is working
late and can't reach his tech staff for help with a computer
problem. He walks nervously through a cavernous office as banks of
PCs flash ominous messages at him such as ``Fix me,'' ``Serve me,''
``Don't ignore me.''
</P>
<P>
   The CEO finds an IT guy slumped over his desk unconscious. A
close-up of the techie's face reveals a computer monitor reading
``Help Me'' that has replaced his eyes. A floppy disk slowly slides
out of his disk-drive mouth like a lolling tongue. It's a gruesome
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The ad ``is intended to really set up the concept that you have
been a slave to these PCs and they really wind up controlling you
instead of you controlling them,'' said Mike Massaro, an executive
vice president at Goldberg Moser O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Micron has been losing money as it battles larger rivals such as
Dell and Gateway, as well as other companies offering very low-cost
and even free PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Micron, based in Nampa, Idaho, is spending $50 million on the
six-month campaign, said one knowledgeable source. Micron did not
return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group, thinks the
ad is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you want to change somebody's mind about something,
coming in and shocking them is one of the most effective ways to do
that,'' he said. But that's just the beginning. ``Getting them to
consider you as the provider is the difficult part.''
</P>
<P>
   Micron is one of a handful of companies that has begun offering
subscription PC services to small and medium-size companies,
Enderle said.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional outsourcing, in which companies such as IBM and
Unisys function as the IT departments for their big hardware
clients, was not cost-effective for smaller clients until recently,
Enderle said. Now, technological innovations have made remote
servicing possible, opening the field.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big IT service providers are still focused on big
clients, Enderle said. ``Micron is trying to get ahead of the
curve'' with the subscription service for smaller companies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Enderle estimates Micron will offer a basic package of services
for $130 to $170 per PC per month.
</P>
<P>
   Labyrinth will be broadcast today on ``CBS This Morning,'' the
``Today'' show and the evening news on KRON.Channel 4. &LR;  Next week a
series of 30-second spots focusing on specific services will be
added to the lineup, with most ads running during news and sports
programs.

A TOP EDITOR IS LEAVING 2 PUBLICATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Evans, the editorial director of the Daily
News and U.S. News &AMP; World Report, said Tuesday that he would leave
both publications at the end of the year to work on two book
projects likely to become television documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, who said in a statement that he would be writing ``two
major American historical works,'' one on business innovators and
one on the first 100 years of America as a nation, has worked with
the editors of the Daily News and U.S. News since January 1997
after leaving as president of Random House. In that time, Evans,
71, also produced a book, ``The American Century,'' which was
published by Alfred Knopf and excerpted at length in U.S. News.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the chairman and editor in chief of the
two publications, said Tuesday that Evans' ``contract is up at the
end of the year and he'll be leaving.'' Asked whether Evans would
be replaced, Zuckerman said: ``I don't know. We are certainly
appreciative of what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of editorial director made Evans a minister with, at
best, a vague portfolio, and some people at the Daily News said he
had little effect on the operation. But Zuckerman said that Evans,
who spent 14 years as editor of The Sunday Times of London, helped
``the staff of the Daily News to get a better angle on pictures,
get a better understanding of headlines, get a better sense of how
to compress stories.''
</P>
<P>
   At U.S. News, Evans' most public action was taking credit for
the dismissal of its former editor, James Fallows, who had fallen
out of favor with Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's current editor, Stephen G. Smith, said: ``Harry,
because of his long relationship with Mort, has real credibility
with him. When Harry says that U.S. News or the Daily News ought to
do this story or make this change, Mort really listens.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Tuesday evening that he would continue as a
contributing editor and consultant with Zuckerman's two
publications.

 New Wells Fargo Delivers 27% Rise In Third Quarter  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co., the nation's seventh-largest bank, said
yesterday that its third-quarter profit jumped 27 percent, thanks
to broad-based growth throughout its consumer and commercial
businesses.
<P>
   The San Francisco bank reported $962 million (57 cents a diluted
share) in net income for the three months ended in September, up
from $742 million (45 cents) for the comparable period a year ago.
So far this year, Wells has earned $2.78 billion ($1.65) compared
to $2.14 billion ($1.29) for the first nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Wells rose $2.13, to $41.63, in trading of 5.2 million
shares yesterday after the bank reported earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wells' solid profit, which matched Wall Street
expectations, signaled that the bank is successfully combining the
old Wells Fargo and Minnesota's Norwest, which joined last year to
form the new Wells. The new bank has branches in 21 Western and
Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the merger is going well,'' said Scott Edgar,
research director of Sife Trust Fund, a Walnut Creek mutual fund
specializing in banks which owns about 830,000 Wells shares.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest bought the old Wells, took its name, moved its
headquarters to San Francisco and has taken pains to manage the
combination as a merger of equals. Specifically, the bank is trying
to meld Norwest's strong sales culture with the efficiency and
technological sophistication of the old Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted that Wells still hasn't crossed the toughest
hurdle yet _ combining the computer systems of the two banks. The
bank has switched to a common system only in New Mexico and won't
face its toughest test, California, until next year.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Wells' profit gain reflected higher income
from both interest and fees, and it extended across its four
business segments: consumer and small business banking, commercial
banking, mortgage and consumer finance.
</P>
<P>
   Net interest income rose 5 percent from the 1998 third quarter,
to $2.38 billion, even though the gap narrowed between the interest
rate the bank paid on deposits and the rate it collected on loans.
The rise was due to a 7 percent increase in loan balances during
the year, a sign of the new bank's aggressive salesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank is pushing the Norwest sales culture into the West
and that's translating into higher revenues,'' said Campbell
Chaney, a San Francisco analyst with Sutro &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, sales of basic banking products to
consumers and small business, such as checking accounts and credit
cards, rose 4.5 percent from the second to the third quarter.
Meanwhile, the bank has hired dozens of mortgage salespeople in the
state this year in a bid to boost its share of the California home
loan market.
</P>
<P>
   The bank added more than 100,000 Internet banking customers each
month during the third quarter, passing the 1 million mark. About
20 percent of those account holders had not previously banked with
Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' noninterest income rose 12 percent from a year ago, to
$1.81 billion, due mainly to higher service charges on deposits,
and increased trust and investment fees.
</P>
<P>
   The bank got a windfall during the quarter as its venture
capital investment in Cerent Corp., a Petaluma telecommunications
equipment-maker, soared to an estimated value of $600 million when
computer networking giant Cisco Systems agreed to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expect expected  &LR; Wells to sell its Cisco
stake in the fourth quarter, using the gain to rebuild its
securities portfolio.  &QL;

 _ SF CHRON   Microsoft Defies Earnings Predictions 
 &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Microsoft Corp. trounced analyst estimates in its first fiscal
quarter of 2000, posting a profit increase of 30 percent from the
year-earlier period.
<P>
   The software titan said it benefited from strong sales of
personal computers, 90 percent of which come preinstalled with the
Windows operating system, as well as increased demand among
corporate customers for its Windows NT Server and database
applications.
</P>
<P>
   The strong results caused Microsoft shares to jump more than 5
percent in after-hours trading to $90.44. Earlier, the stock price
had dropped $1.56, to $86.31, in regular trading.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is undoubtedly hoping the run of good news will
continue. That's because the judge in the government's antitrust
trial against Microsoft has indicated he will rule on an
unspecified Friday evening whether the company engaged in
monopolistic business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft reported net earnings of $2.19 billion, (40 cents a
share) for the quarter ended September 30, compared with $1.68
billion (31 cents) a year ago. Analysts had expected earnings of
about 34 cents a share, and the ever-dangerous ``whisper''
estimates _ unofficial predictions offered to major clients and
often leaked on the Internet _ ranged as high as 38 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter reached $5.38 billion, up from $4.19
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Moving forward, however, Microsoft faces serious challenges,
including changes in its software licensing model, an imminent
decision in the government's landmark antitrust case against it and
the delayed launch of its much-anticipated Windows 2000 operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to selling its software directly to customers,
Microsoft said it will soon begin renting out some of its business
applications over the Internet on a subscription basis _ a model
that over time could become the predominant method of selling
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the potential for Microsoft to have a major shift in
the way we take in software revenue,'' said Greg Maffei,
Microsoft's chief financial officer, in a conference call. ``But
that will have virtually no impact on our revenue stream in the
short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Microsoft faces a period of uncertainty as
customers start to pay for software the same way they do for
telephone service or electricity. ``Microsoft really hasn't nailed
down how the model works or what specific revenues would be,'' said
Jonathan Geurkink, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   No ship date has been announced for Windows 2000, Microsoft's
next-generation operating system that will replace both its
consumer Windows 98 and its corporate Windows NT systems. Industry
observers say that the product was supposed to be rolled out
earlier this year, but that it might not hit the shelves until the
new year. ``Don't expect any upside from Windows 2000 in fiscal
'00,'' warned Maffei.
</P>
<P>
   As for the antitrust case, analysts said it is a dark shadow
hanging over Microsoft's stock, though most observers do not expect
the government to do anything drastic, such as break up the
company, should the Justice Department win the case.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, Microsoft said its business is booming
overseas, especially in Asia, where revenue for the quarter jumped
82 percent, to $593 million. The company credited the rise to new
sales of localized versions of its Office productivity suite as
well as a decline in pirated software.
</P>
<P>
   The company also seems to have weathered the Y2K storm. Analysts
had feared revenue would take a hit as corporate customers postpone
software purchases until they solved their Year 2000 issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not appear that Y2K has significantly retarded our
rate of growth in last quarter,'' said Maffei, adding that the
company expects increased spending in the next quarter by corporate
customers who have completed all their Year 2000 work.

 New eBay Site Auctions High-Ticket Items  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
EBay Inc., which became an online auction powerhouse with
garage-sale items like Beanie Babies and old lunch boxes, stepped
into the upper-crust world of fine art, rare collectibles and
pricey antiques with the launch of a new premium Web site this
week.
<P>
   EBay's new Great Collections went online with items that
included a 100-carat, emerald-cut diamond valued as high as $5
million. The site also had mementos from the late New York Yankees
superstar Joe DiMaggio, including an autographed bat used during
his record-breaking 1941 season and valued as high as $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at www.ebaygreatcollections.com, is the first
collaboration of eBay and Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield Inc., the
venerable San Francisco auction house that eBay purchased for $260
million in May.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield President John Gallo said the Internet site may
account for as much as 50 percent of the business for
brick-and-mortar auction houses in just 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took the top 10 auction sites (houses) in the world and
added up their clients, that's 500,000 people,'' Gallo said. ``EBay
alone has 5.6 million buyers, and they're just getting started.''
</P>
<P>
   EBay is hoping that Great Collections lures buyers who want
collectibles that used to be only available through auction houses
and fine arts dealers. Amazon.com, which earlier this year bought a
minority stake in Sotheby's, the world's biggest auction house,
plans to launch a similar premium auction site by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills mogul Georges Marciano, who founded Guess jeans,
last month opened his own online auction site, www.gmbid.com,
selling rare Lamborghinis, Andy Warhol paintings and wines.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said competitors will be hard-pressed to catch
eBay, which already has a commanding lead over auction sites run by
Amazon.com and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see many companies enter the
marketplace'' for art and collectibles, said analyst Derek Brown of
Volpe Brown Whelan. ``But buyers and sellers are going to aggregate
in only a handful of locations.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's eBay hosted a launch party for the new site last
night in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The first high-priced item to sell was a painting, ``Breisach on
the Rhine'' by 19th century artist Beatrice Frederikson, that went
for $1,890.
</P>
<P>
   The painting was offered by Doretheum of Austria, one of a dozen
auction houses, art dealers and jewelers around the world that has
partnered with eBay to sell their wares online. Unlike eBay, which
links buyers and sellers directly and provides no guarantees,
sellers on the Great Collections site will be represented by
auction houses or dealers that will offer certificates of
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 1,000 items offered on the Great Collections
site, generally ranging in estimated value from $250 to $10,000,
said Steve Westly, the site's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Great Collections will charge $7.50 to list each item, plus a
7.5 percent commission on the sales price. Typically,
brick-and-mortar auction houses charge commissions of 10 to 25
percent to the seller and an additional 10 to 15 percent to the
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo said he expects that the same type of buyer who makes
purchases from an auction house will do the same online. About 40
percent of auction-house clients now buy items through catalogs
without examining them in person, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallo said the Internet opens up the market to a greater
number of people, which should increase auction prices without
adding to marketing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Schmidt, an Internet analyst with Josephthal &AMP; Co. of New
York, said the premium site may take a little longer to catch on
than the regular eBay service ``because people still have concerns
about Internet security and potential fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying Beanie Babies is a little different than buying Tiffany
silver,'' Schmidt said. Still, the site eventually should become a
draw for eBay because ``serious collectors are going to go where
they think they're going to find artwork or collectibles or
jewelry.''

 Bay Area Gas Drops 7 Cents in Past 4 Weeks  &HT;     By Bernadette Tansey 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Bay Area gas prices fell for the second month in a row with the end
of the peak summer driving season and a drop in oil prices.
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of self-service regular unleaded
gas fell 7 cents in Northern California during the past four weeks,
to $1.49, according to the California State Automobile Association.
The decrease follows an average 9-cent drop reported in the
September survey.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in the nine-county Bay Area matched the 7-cent drop, with
an average price per gallon of $1.53.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers in Monterey enjoyed the only double-digit decrease, with
gas prices plummeting 12 cents, to $1.48 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, motorists are paying $1.62, only 2 cents less
than reported in September. Only Eureka residents paid more, at
$1.64, though they saw a 4-cent drop over the previous four weeks.
In Oakland, drivers saved a nickel, paying $1.54 at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   Gas, though, was 9 cents cheaper than mid-September's rate in
San Mateo, San Rafael, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if prices will continue to fall or flatten
out,'' said CSAA spokesman Paul Moreno. He said the price drops can
be traced to decreased demand with the end of the summer driving
season and the return of sidelined refinery units to full
production.
</P>
<P>
   Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California
Energy Institute in Berkeley, also attributed the gas-price drop to
a recent decrease in oil prices after OPEC member nations exceeded
production limits they set in March.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices have fallen a few dollars from a peak of $25 a barrel
for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude oil,
according to the automobile association.
</P>
<P>
   Although gas prices are falling in Northern California, drivers
still are paying an average of 30 cents more than they did at this
time last year, according to the automobile association survey.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, gas prices are rising but remain well below price
levels in California. The nationwide price per gallon rose a penny
during the past four weeks, to $1.29, the highest national price
since the Gulf War peak of $1.37, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price gap between West Coast and U.S. gas prices is
narrowing but remains wide,'' Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   Borenstein said Californians have been paying higher pump prices
since 1996, when the state imposed strict environmental standards
for fuel manufacturing. Disruptions in the supply of state-approved
``clean fuel'' are not easily remedied by importing gas that does
not meet state standards.
</P>
<P>
   Prices started to rise sharply last spring after a fatal fire
hobbled a crude oil unit at Tosco Corp.'s Avon refinery in
February. Another fire in March slashed production at Chevron's
refinery in Richmond, followed by a fire at a Mobil Corp. plant in
Southern California in late July. Other refineries were hampered by
maintenance problems.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last month, the problems at most refineries were
taken care of and production returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
   California prices also remain higher due to limited competition
among service stations, Borenstein said.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Old Navy's Model Plan  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Back in the early 1990s, when budget-conscious families still
relied on the likes of Sears and Target for their wearables, Gap
Inc. chief executive Mickey Drexler read a single quote in a trade
publication that changed the face of American retailing.
<P>
   The quote was from a would-be rival who boasted that he could
create a cheap Gap knockoff that one day would be bigger than Gap
itself. Drexler jumped at the idea and _ taking a lesson from the
hapless garmento who blabbed to the press _ adopted a close-mouthed
policy regarding company strategy that is enforced rigorously to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after opening its first Old Navy Clothing Co. store,
Gap Inc.'s budget chain is almost as big as the U.S. stores in the
adult Gap division, founded in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Old Navy, known for its silly ads, lively stores and
inexpensive fashions, likely will surpass sales at the domestic Gap
chain. By 2004, it will exceed the combined Gap, babyGap and
GapKids chains, estimates Richard Baum, director of equity research
at Credit Suisse First Boston. (Gap Inc. also owns the upscale
Banana Republic stores.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, Old Navy opens its largest store to date, a mammoth,
four-level ``flagship'' location on Market and Fourth streets in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although Old Navy's dramatic growth has taken the industry by
surprise, it's not hard to understand why middle-income families
prefer to shop where bouncy pop music thumps over the loudspeaker;
``Items of the Week'' are marked by flashing, marquee-style signs;
and a toy version of Magic the dog, the chain's mascot, rides in a
1950s pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Like Apple's colorful iMac or the new Volkswagen Beetle, Gap's
Old Navy illustrates how a little creativity can revive a tired
industry _ and send old-line competitors scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of acoustic-tile ceilings and gray carpet, Old Navy
stores sport the au courant ``industrial chic'' design of exposed
pipes, cement floors and chrome fixtures. Flagships such as the new
San Francisco store feature a DJ booth, mechanized mannequins and a
giant television playing Old Navy ads.
</P>
<P>
   When Gap executives began brainstorming the new concept years
ago, they came to a quick consensus about middle-market shopping:
The clothes were predictable and utilitarian; the stores were
predictable and utilitarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was taking themselves too seriously,'' says Jenny
Ming, Old Navy's president, who participated in early planning as
the chain's first head of merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Because the value segment was dominated by department and
big-box stores, Gap planners saw an opportunity for a specialty
retailer that could sell bargain-priced clothing to men, women and
children. Their simple yet revolutionary goal was to make shopping
fun for middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1993, the company converted 48 of its Gap outlets into
what it called ``Gap Warehouses.'' But despite the name, the stores
didn't sell Gap leftovers _ they sold lower-priced items designed
specifically for the experimental concept.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the first week were so impressive that executives
decided to spin off the chain with its own name and identity.
Drexler christened the new stores ``Old Navy'' after a sign he had
seen in Paris during a business trip. (One rejected option:
``Forklift.'')
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when the division had grown to more than 200 stores
across the United States, Old Navy launched the first in a series
of quirky television ads starring Magic the mutt and fashion maven
Carrie Donovan, who peers through heavy spectacles and pronounces
cargo pants ``fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   The campy spots, which feature a parade of retro-celebrities
such as actress Morgan Fairchild, push clothing with light-hearted
jingles that have become favorites among American schoolchildren.
The ads are widely credited with helping make Old Navy ``one of the
most powerful brands in retailing,'' as Marcia Aaron, an analyst
with Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout its short life, Old Navy consistently has exceeded
financial projections. Baum forecasts 1999 sales of $3.3 billion, a
42.3 percent increase against 1998, and a jump to $4.3 billion in
2000, when Old Navy pulls even with Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy's contribution to total Gap Inc. sales is expected to
jump from 3.1 percent in 1994 to 30.4 percent in 2000, when
companywide sales reach $14.2 billion, Baum projects.
</P>
<P>
   Profitwise, Old Navy lags Gap, but by less than might be
expected, said Baum. That's because Old Navy stores sell such a
high volume of goods that they get a lot of bang for their real
estate buck.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Old Navy leases tend to be lower on a per-square-foot
basis because most Old Navy stores are larger than Gap stores and
because they are located on the periphery of malls, rather than in
the malls themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy _ which now operates 486 stores _ has succeeded, in
part, because its audience is broader and far more upscale than its
planners ever dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Research by NPD Group shows that 72.2 percent of Old Navy sales
are to households earning at least $50,000 per year. That dwarfs
the 52.2 percent of sales to such consumers at Mervyn's, 48.4
percent at J.C. Penney and 39.8 percent at Sears, according to the
study, which Baum commissioned when he was an analyst at Goldman,
Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Although that's good news for Old Navy, it might not be great
for Gap, which relies on many of the same shoppers. Some industry
experts blame Old Navy, in part, for serious sales shortfalls at
both GapKids and Gap this year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast with Old Navy, plain-vanilla Gap ``is not a fun
place to shop,'' said one analyst. ``Gap is a very functional store
_ easy in, easy out _ but people don't like hanging out at Gap.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gap Inc. officials blame Gap's recent problems on fashion
missteps and deny that Old Navy is taking a bite out of its
sibling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we really felt it is cannibalizing, why would we be opening
stores down the street from Gap and in the same mall?'' said Ming.
``Everyone is looking for great value today. But what Old Navy
attracts the most is the value segment because they're starved for
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is difficult to track shifting market share, Aaron
believes Old Navy is hurting Gap to some degree but that
moderate-priced competitors are really taking it on the chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at who's really struggling right now, (it appears)
they're really taking the biggest share from Sears and J.C.
Penney,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   How much more growth opportunity does Gap Inc.'s fastest-growing
chain have?
</P>
<P>
   Ming said there are no plans to branch into other product lines,
such as home furnishings. ``We still have room to grow in
clothing,'' said Ming, noting that toddler clothes were just added
this year and infant garb last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Old Navy debuted its Web site
(www.oldnavy.com), though for now, the site only sells gift
certificates. As for physical store growth, Aaron believes that
this country can support more than 1,000 locations, meaning it is
less than halfway to the saturation point.
</P>
<P>
   In another three to five years, Gap Inc. is expected to start
rolling out Old Navy stores in European and Asian markets where it
operates Gaps. ``There is tremendous potential for Old Navy outside
the United States,'' Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, there is no guarantee that Old Navy's current run
will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer sentiment against Gap's policy of sourcing apparel in
Saipan, a U.S. commonwealth where working conditions are
notoriously poor, could hurt the company. Demonstrators plan to
picket the San Francisco Old Navy when it opens today.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shoppers tend to be fickle when it comes to which brands
are considered cool. And just like Gap and may other retailers, Old
Navy could make fashion or marketing mistakes that send its
customers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Old Navy may have sparked other retailers' interest
in the middle-income market, a trend that could create more
competition down the road for $7.50 T-shirts and $22.50 khakis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are really recognizing that that consumer can be a
profitable venue for them,'' said Aaron, noting that TJX Cos. has
introduced a lower-end version of its off-price stores, a chain
called A.J. Wright, on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Old Navy has ``definitely changed the perception of buying less
expensive apparel in the mind of the consumer,'' Aaron said. ``They
really opened up that value channel.''

 &HT;    NATO, Serbs fought in cyberspace
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ While NATO jets attacked Yugoslavia earlier this
year, Serbian computer experts attacked NATO systems in what a top
Air Force general Tuesday called the world's first ``cyber war.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We detected several attempts to take down our (information)
networks. Fortunately, the Serbs were no more effective at
offensive information operations than they were at air defense,''
Gen. Lester L. Lyles, Air Force vice chief of staff, told a Dayton
audience of information professionals.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials have said U.S. forces made some attacks
on Serbian computer systems, but few details have come out.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Allied Force, the 78-day, U.S.-led air offensive that
ended in June, ``combat-tested our vision for the future of
information in warfare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied forces successully stymied the Serbian computer attacks,
Lyles said, but added, ``We must consider Kosovo as the precursor
to more sophisticated and relentless attacks against our
information systems.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes civilian systems, because the military relied
heavily on commercial networks to move rivers of ``non-critical''
military information during the Kosovo conflict, the general said.
</P>
<P>
   Warfare is becoming increasingly an information war. Lyles said
military operations in the Kosovo conflict required five times more
``bandwith,'' or communications capacity, than Gulf war operations.
</P>
<P>
   He said information technology is especially vital to the Air
Force as it reshapes itself into an ``Expeditionary Aerospace
Force'' with compact, self-contained combat units that don't depend
on prepared overseas bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lyles said the key element is ``reachback,'' the ability of a
few small communications units close to the battle to tap massive
information networks.
</P>
<P>
   For reachback to work, he said, the military must treat
information systems like weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
   That means properly training and equipping personnel, testing
and inspecting systems, and even defining ``rules of engagement''
for information attacks _ in other words, deciding when and how to
</P>
<P>
   strike back when an enemy attacks with bytes instead of bullets.

 _ SF CHRON   Venture Cash Poses Few Liabilities for Startups 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: I am starting an Internet business and am curious to know what
is the liability placed on the individual and the company when
receiving capital from ``angels'' or venture capital investors? If
the company goes under or doesn't meet financial projections, what
could happen? Also, how is it determined how much equity a company
gives up for how much capital?
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: Starting an Internet business is certainly a risky adventure,
but getting sued by your investors is not one of the main dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question that keeps us up at night,'' said David
Cowan, managing partner of Bessemer Venture Partners in Menlo Park.
``Unless there is malicious fraud, officers are not responsible for
the death of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Suits against failed startups are rare. ``It practically never
happens,'' Cowan said. ``If a company fails to perform, it won't
have any cash left or the means to restore investors' capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Legalities aside, Cowan and other VCs bank on trust and full
disclosure. One of the worst things an entrepreneur can do is to
underestimate the risks and delay telling investment partners about
everything that could go wrong or has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There is no simple rule on how much money buys what percent of a
company. It depends on many variables, including where the company
is in its stage of development. Is it a raw idea or a company with
a prototype product or one with actual customers, sales and
profits?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the same amount of money will buy a greater stake in
the company at the ``seed'' stage than a later round just before
the company launches a public offering. It also makes a huge
difference if the company starts with a proven idea and a proven
CEO and technical team.
</P>
<P>
   About the only common practice for startups building ``a
world-class organization,'' says Cowan, is to set aside about 25
percent of the stock for management and employees. The other 75
percent is split among those who commit the capital, and the
founders.
</P>
<P>
   If the founder also is an established CEO with a strong track
record and deep pockets, he or she might put off tapping outside
investors and retain 20 percent or more of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   By the time an emerging growth company goes public or is
acquired, Cowan figures that the founders typically own from 2 to
20 percent of the stock. If the founders need to bring in an
experienced CEO, they might have to give that individual 5 to 7
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Successful investors and entrepreneurs advise against getting
fixated on the percentages. More important, they say, is the
comfort level. Remember, it isn't easy to divorce an investor, and
in Silicon Valley, you might be spending more time with your
business partners than your family.

Last week's column mentioned some of the benefits of hiring
graduates of welfare-to-work programs. For more information on the
tax-credit benefits, check the Private Industry Council, a local
nonprofit that finances job training for San Francisco residents.
</P>
<P>
   Tax credits are available at the federal, state and local level
for employers who hire from certain targeted groups. Information
about those tax credits is available at the Private Industry
council's Web site (www.sftaxcredits.com).
</P>
<P>
   The organization also has a business hotline, (415) 861-4002,
for San Francisco employers that provides answers to questions
about local payroll, state enterprise zone and federal hiring tax
credits.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bonnie Carroll, the council's business services
manager, those credits include:
</P>
<P>
   _The California State Enterprise Zone Hiring Tax Credit (for
employers located in San Francisco's Enterprise Zone), which can be
up to half the employee's salary during their first year of
employment. The credit can be up to $27,000 over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   _The Federal Welfare-to-Work credit, which can be up to $8,500
over a two-year period (up to $3,500 in the first year worked and
up to $5,000 in the second).
</P>
<P>
   _The Federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which can be up to
$2,400 per qualified employee.
</P>
<P>
   The Private Industry Council also will help San Francisco
employers get the right forms and find employees who will qualify
them for tax credits.

 ELetter Uses the Net to Put Its Stamp on Mass-Mailing Business  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A San Jose startup has found a way to help small businesses take
advantage of the Internet to lighten the load of bulk mailings.
<P>
   ELetter Inc. makes it easy to send out direct mailings quickly
and cheaply without making employees fold flyers and stuff
envelopes or cart the whole mess to an outside mailing service.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, the company (www.eletter.com) has simplified the
process dramatically. In a matter of minutes, customers can use
their PCs to send their address lists and documents (from postcard
size to 64-page brochure), select production options and enter a
charge card. ELetter's software and hardware take care of
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   The customer's request is quickly passed on to ELetter's San
Jose production facility, where each order is automatically filled.
The appropriate paper is selected, then the message (complete with
photos or illustrations) is printed and the flyer mechanically
folded and inserted into an envelope, which is addressed and
stamped. Just four employees monitor the machinery, make sure paper
and ink are loaded, and carry trays of processed mail to vans for
delivery to the post office.
</P>
<P>
   ELetter is not targeting big companies and catalogers, but the
millions of small businesses that send from a few dozen to 20,000
pieces of mail at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of small business prepare their own mailings _
30 billion pieces a year,'' said Manish Mehta, ELetter's chief
executive. ``With ELetter, they never have to touch paper or go to
the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   The printing and postal needs of small businesses have not
exactly been ignored. There are thousands of print shops, even some
online providers like Redwood City's iPrint.com.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, companies such as Hewlett-Packard are making
relatively inexpensive printers that businesses can use to produce
professional quality letters and brochures. E-Stamp.com and
Stamps.com and others provide online postage services. But
businesses are still stuck with the folding and stuffing chores or
paying someone else to do them.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies are giving ELetter their stamp of
approval. One of them is OnSite Dental, a Redwood City company that
which  &LR; delivers dental services to the doorsteps of employees at 35
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to print letters in-house and have everyone from the
president to the secretary fold the letters by hand, stuff them in
envelopes and put on addresses and stamps,'' said OnSite Dental
human resources director Amy Wagner. ``It was incredibly
inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   The company was going to hire temporary workers for its most
recent mailing when it heard about ELetter. Three weeks ago, Wagner
used ELetter to send notices to 3,000 employees, advising them that
their dental benefits would expire if they didn't use them by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the coolest thing I've ever seen,'' said Wagner. Aside
from the time it took to compose the letter, she figures that it
took less than 20 minutes to send the document electronically to
ELetter.
</P>
<P>
   Within two business days, before Wagner had even alerted
colleagues about the existence of the letter, many of OnSite's
customers already had received it and were calling to make
appointments. The total cost was $1,500, about 50 cents per letter.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said using ELetter took hardly any of her time and cost
much less than hiring other workers to do the task manually.
``We'll never go back to doing it by hand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Frost &AMP; Sullivan, the Mountain View consulting and research
firm, also is sold on ELetter. The company, which produces up to
eight lengthy studies a week on various technologies, sends
four-page advertising brochures on each of its studies to persuade
about 150 industry participants to spend about $4,000 each for the
full report.
</P>
<P>
   About six weeks ago, Frost &AMP; Sullivan used ELetter for a mailing
instead of having the brochure produced by a local printer and then
stuffed and sent by Hope Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awesome,'' said F&AMP;S marketing coordinator Todd Evjenth.
``In addition to saving money and up to 50 percent of my time,
ELetter does address verification and promises delivery within four
days.''
</P>
<P>
   ELetter founder and Chief Operations Officer Kurt Brown, 39,
wasn't contemplating commerce when he came up with the idea for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   It was February 1998, and he was in Australia, taking a long
vacation after selling his previous startup, 64k Inc., for $5
million. It occurred to Brown that the fruit bats he was watching
at the Melbourne botanical garden would make an interesting item in
his next Christmas letter. (Like many entrepreneurs, Brown likes to
plan ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   But then he thought about how much he dreaded stuffing envelopes
and wondered if there were services on the Internet that might save
him the time and trouble. Brown rushed to the nearest cybercafe to
check it out but came up blank. Then he e-mailed Mehta, his partner
at 64k Inc., to get his thoughts and have him do some further
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction was, you're talking about using paper in
1998; there must be something wrong,'' said Mehta, who met Brown
while both were earning Ph.D.s in computer science in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   But soon he was sold on the concept. ``People may think with
e-mail and the Internet, paper is going away,'' said Mehta, 32, who
became CEO of the company. ``But the direct-mail market is a $40
billion business in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Brown and Mehta started their Internet-based printing and
postal mailing service with their own money in June 1998, they have
raised $3.5 million from Trident Capital and Artemis Ventures and
are about to raise more than $10 million more in another venture
capital round.
</P>
<P>
   ELetter also has lined up important links to other Internet
sites, including Office Depot and Mysoftware.com. Today, it is
expected to announce a partnership with Intuit, maker of Quicken
and other financial software and online products.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of its growing popularity, ELetter was voted
most likely to succeed from among 83 technology companies featured
last month at Technology Partners' Internet outlook conference.

 Queen of Nice Puts Wrestling Flat On IPO Ice  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Martha Stewart kicked Stone Cold Steve Austin's butt yesterday.
<P>
   In its first trading day, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, the
umbrella company for Stewart's oh-so-tasteful print, broadcast and
Web properties, almost doubled, to $35.56, after beginning with 7.2
million shares priced at $18 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In another initial public offering, World Wrestling Federation
Entertainment brought its own special brand of graceful living to
Wall Street. Its stock jumped 49 percent, to $25.25, after arriving
with 10 million shares originally priced at $17 each.
</P>
<P>
   By just about any reckoning of the day's death-match showdown,
Stewart emerged the clear victor.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, the former model and stockbroker who has turned
impeccably good taste into a multimillion-dollar business empire,
is now personally worth considerably more than $1 billion _ a good
thing, as she might say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of institutional interest in Martha Stewart,''
said Eugene Peroni, director of equity research at John Nuveen and
Co. in Radner, Pa. ``The wrestlers had more niche-type appeal.
Martha Stewart is more widely known and more broadly accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The two stocks managed to stage their entrances on a day when
inflation fears gave way to enthusiasm about corporate earnings,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 88.65 points to 10,204.93.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offerings were the first in many months to
capture center stage without dot-coms in their names.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is tempting to view the opening-day performance of
Martha Stewart and the WWF as a triumph of gentility and decency
over the grunting, sweating forces of darkness, investors were
focusing on more fundamental factors.
</P>
<P>
   In an age where brands reign supreme, Stewart has positioned
herself as an icon of easy living, and her name and face are
instantly associated by consumers with flawlessly designed
interiors and perfectly pruned gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Her company's net income rose to $23.8 million last year, from
$13.9 million a year earlier. Revenue surged to $180 million in
1998 from $132.8 million in 1997 and only $3.9 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her popular TV show, 70 percent of Stewart's revenue
comes from publishing.
</P>
<P>
   By driving shares of Martha Stewart through the roof, investors
seem to be saying that the company's namesake is a real-life
version of Betty Crocker, the fictional homemaker who represented
for earlier generations the gold seal of household know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be cooking and growing plants a lot longer than
we're going to be wrestling,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer of First Albany in New York. ``At least I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, vampirelike, professional wrestling just refuses to
die. This staying power helped give the World Wrestling Federation
a more than respectable showing on its first day.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; High Interest in Evil
</P>
<P>
   The WWF, based in Stamford, Conn., produces some of the most
popular shows on cable TV, in which evil and not-quite-so-evil
compete for bogus supremacy in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   (``Good'' wrestlers, who used to triumph over the ``bad'' ones,
have largely vanished from the scene. It turns out that the public
has greater interest in villains these days than in heroes.)
</P>
<P>
   The WWF's centerpiece is a weekly program called ``Raw Is War,''
which was the top-rated regularly scheduled cable show for 19
straight weeks through June 30, according to Nielsen Media
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each week we advance our story lines, develop our characters
and create the drama and excitement that drive our business and
attract customers,'' the WWF said in its filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it is all fake. But to the millions of fans who
follow the ``sport,'' that is hardly a factor.
</P>
<P>
   The WWF saw profit of $56 million in its latest fiscal year
ended April 30, compared with just $8.5 million a year before.
Revenue soared to $251.5 million in the most recent year, from
$126.2 million last year and $81.9 million the year before that.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the company's revenue in the latest year
came from live and televised events, and the rest came from branded
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in
New York, the predictable world of professional wrestling
constitutes a savvier investment than the more unpredictable world
of style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the sources of revenue are from wrestling,'' he
said. ``I'm not sure how Martha Stewart is leveraging her brand, or
even if she'll be around in a few years. Wrestling will be around,
appalling as that may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have greater faith in the lowest common denominator of the
United States,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   While Martha Stewart scored the more spectacular showing out of
the gate, analysts worried that her company's fortunes rest too
squarely atop a single person's shoulders and that this represents
an enormous risk for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something would be lost in real and financial terms if she
were no longer part of the company's day-to-day operation,'' said
Nuveen's Peroni.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, First Albany's Johnson said the WWF's advance
in the market was nothing more than a fad, ``and fads come and
go.''
</P>
<P>
   He said both stocks were likely of greater interest to
speculators than to honest-to-goodness investors, and predicted
that shares of Martha Stewart and the WWF will decline in coming
days.
</P>
<P>
   For Brian Eisenbarth, an analyst at Marin County's Collins &AMP;
Co., this was good enough reason to steer clear of the two stocks
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a professional money manager, I couldn't buy these stocks
in good conscience for my clients,'' he said.

STUNG BY DEBATE, INDONESIAN PRESIDENT ENDS ELECTION BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Rewritten to update with Habibie's withdrawal)  (bl) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Humiliated by a midnight ballot in the
national assembly that condemned his record, President B.J. Habibie
withdrew as a candidate for president Wednesday, and the assembly
prepared to vote hours later for Indonesia's next leader.
</P>
<P>
   His party, Golkar, replaced him with its chairman, Akbar
Tanjung, who is also the parliamentary speaker. The party selected
the armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, as its candidate for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's withdrawal heightened the rivalry between the other
two declared presidential candidates. They are the opposition
leader who won the most votes in a parliamentary election in June,
Megawati Sukarnoputri, and a Muslim leader, Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   A Golkar party official said Habibie had ``conceded gracefully
not to run'' after the newly independent assembly, in a largely
symbolic vote, rejected his recent state of the nation address by a
margin of just 33 ballots of 690 cast.
</P>
<P>
   The election of a new president will complete a tumultuous
transition from Indonesia's autocratic former president, Suharto,
who was forced to resign in May 1998. The vote against Habibie, a
close associate of Suharto who took his place as president, was a
sign of the momentum of democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the members of the assembly that will choose the
president were elected last June in Indonesia's first free
nationwide ballot in a generation. There are fears of unrest in
Indonesia if Ms. Megawati fails to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the vote on Habibie, the chairman of the assembly,
Amien Rais, announced that the group had decided by consensus to
end a quarter century of Indonesian rule in East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   That decision formally accepted the results of an Aug. 30
referendum in which 87.5 percent of the people of East Timor voted
for independence. The referendum was followed by a wave of violence
that caused the deployment of an international peacekeeping force
that is still struggling to pacify the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said Indonesia would hand over
formal control of East Timor to the United Nations before year's
end. The United Nations plans to administer the territory for two
to three years as a transition to independent rule.
</P>
<P>
   In a session that took several significant steps toward remaking
Indonesia's political structure, the assembly also agreed by
consensus to limit the president to two five-year terms and to
shift lawmaking power from the president to the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps toward establishing a more democratic and
accountable government were mirrored by the free-wheeling demeanor
of the assembly, flexing and admiring its new muscles after three
decades of subservience to Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Not once but twice in recent days, representatives of each of 11
parliamentary factions presented lengthy _ and mostly damning _
critiques of Habibie's state of the nation address, which he
presented last Thursday. The speeches were interrupted repeatedly
from the floor by legislators who, under Suharto, would have been
ejected for their effrontery.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Habibie sat to one side of the speaker's podium,
like a reprimanded schoolboy, grimacing and scribbling notes.
</P>
<P>
   No Indonesian president had ever been subjected to such
humiliation _ or such democracy. There was a certain dignity and
even bravery in this. Habibie is the first Indonesian president to
maintain a measure of humility about his role.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was suffering not only for his own perceived sins but
also for those of his mentor and friend, Suharto, who was the real
foil for the changes taking place here.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations leveled at Habibie during the last few days in
the assembly had their roots in the abuses of Suharto's 32 years in
power: corruption, violations of human rights, the debacle of
Indonesian rule in East Timor and Habibie's refusal to pursue his
predecessor in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Indonesia's Supreme Court _ apparently no longer
feeling the need to support Habibie _ ruled that an auditor's
report must be released to the Parliament in a high-profile bank
scandal that has badly damaged his political standing.
</P>
<P>
   Secrecy over the allegations that $80 million intended to help
banks restructure their debts had been channeled to Habibie's
supporters had led to a suspension of $4.7 billion in international
loans.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the vote Monday night, his candidacy had been
further wounded when the armed forces chief, Wiranto, went on
television to announce that he would not accept Habibie's
invitation to stand as his Vice Presidential running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement suggested to some analysts that the military
had made a political judgment that Habibie was not likely to win
the election and that it would be politically damaging to be allied
with him. The general's withdrawal also freed military officers in
the legislature to vote against Habibie. The military controls a
bloc of more than 40 votes in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many poignant moments for Habibie, a marginal
figure under Suharto who tried in vain to fill his shoes as
president. Wiranto had played a key role in May 1998 in telling
Suharto that the time had come for him to step down. He had then
become Habibie's first and most crucial ally.
</P>
<P>
   With his damning announcement Sunday, Wiranto earned the
distinction of having signaled to two successive presidents that
they had lost power.
</P>
<P>
   In the theater of Indonesian public life, where all Suharto had
to do was smile enigmatically to demonstrate his power, the last
few days of unabashed criticism appeared to have drained Habibie of
his public standing.
</P>
<P>
   The reading of the vote that sealed his future late Monday
night, with each tally marked on a large white board at the front
of the chamber, was accompanied by hoots and cheers and catcalls
that one local reporter compared to the irreverence of schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   When the final count was announced, many of the parliamentarians
raised their palms in Muslim prayer and shouted, ``God is great!''
Some hugged each other.
</P>
<P>
   In the press gallery above, Indonesian reporters began to dance
and clap and wave their arms, and led the hall in the singing of
the national anthem: ``Free, Free Indonesia.''

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ When Randy McCown arrived at Texas A&AMP;M in 1995,
the idea that he would pass for 362 yards in a game was right up
there with the possibility of a nonstop flight from College Station
to London. In a word _ McCown's word _ ludicrous.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though McCown averages 254.7 yards per game and has gone over
300 yards twice in six games this season, he has a hard time coming
to grips with it. His 362-yard game Saturday in a 34-17 win over
Kansas was the third-best in Texas A&AMP;M history, topped only by
Branndon Stewart's 385 in 1996 and Edd Hargett's 376 in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, it would have been ludicrous to even think
that could happen,'' said McCown, a fifth-year senior from
Jacksonville. ``I never would have thought that. I remember when I
came here, Corey (Pullig) was throwing the ball 25 or 30 times a
game, but it never was for 350 yards, it was always a few yards
here and there. I never would have imagined throwing for 362 yards
and going over 300 yards twice in six games.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of college football, the Texas A&AMP;M offense is
changing with the times. As a prime example, the Aggies (5-1, 2-1
in the Big 12) enter their game at Oklahoma (3-2, 1-1) on Saturday
as the No. 21 team in the nation in passing offense. The Sooners,
who lived by the run for decades, are No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying the other day that if somebody hadn't seen Texas
A&AMP;M play Oklahoma in five or 10 years and they went to this game,
they probably would think they were at the wrong place,'' McCown
said. ``But it's just an example of how the game's changed. The
highly successful teams now can throw the ball and run the ball.
You have to throw it.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies came to that determination after last season, when
defenses crowded them up front and held them to an average of 152.7
rushing yards per game, the lowest total since 1983. McCown and
Stewart split time at quarterback and averaged 159.3 yards passing
per game, a six-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Aggies went 11-3 and won the Big 12 title, coach R.C.
Slocum and offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe knew they were
going to have to open up the passing game to remain at the top of
the conference. McCown got the word after the Aggies lost to Ohio
State 24-14 in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Kragthorpe said that once we started in spring, our goal
was to become more effective in the passing game,'' McCown said.
``That's when the receivers and I decided we had to get together
and start working harder on it. We made a commitment to get better
in the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, McCown was known more for being a fiery
leader, a scrambling quarterback best suited for a run-first
offense. Now, though, he has become something of a mad bomber.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he has connected on eight passes of 40 or more
yards, including a school-record 96-yard bomb to Chris Taylor
against Tulsa and one of 78 yards to Taylor against Kansas. Teams
have dared the Aggies to throw, and they have answered with the
long ball.
</P>
<P>
   With Taylor, Bethel Johnson, Chris Cole, Leroy Hodge and Matt
Bumgardner capable of breaking a long play, McCown has his choice
of targets. Taylor (21.6), Johnson (20.6) and Bumgardner (20.1)
average more than 20 yards per catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the nature of defenses being as aggressive as they are,
they're daring you to do it,'' Kragthorpe said. ``It's a dare
situation now. With the coverage structures, they're saying they
think you can't throw on them. So you have to do it. If you're not
willing to do it, it's going to be hard to slam the ball up there
all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the emphasis on passing, the Aggies' running attack _
for years their bread and butter _ has not been as effective as
usual. Fullback Ja'Mar Toombs leads the team with 258 yards, and
the 3.9-yard-per-carry average ranks tied for eighth in the Big 12.
No Aggie has gone over the 100-yard mark in six games this year.
</P>
<P>
   McCown believes the Aggies remain capable of running the ball.
It's a matter of taking what opposing defenses are willing to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a team that really made us run the ball yet,''
McCown said. ``When we see eight, nine guys up front, what else are
you going to do except throw the ball? If teams are going to make
us do that, we'll do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they start thinking we can't run the ball and try to take
away the pass, we'll be able to run it.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, McCown seems to miss being the kind of quarterback who
can run the option, turn upfield and plow into a tackler for the
extra yard. In the win over Kansas, McCown scrambled 15 yards for a
touchdown late in the first half and nearly jumped out of his shoes
in jubilation. It was like old times.
</P>
<P>
   So what would he rather be, a quarterback who runs or a
quarterback who passes?
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterback who wins the most games,'' McCown said.
``There are times when you have to pass and times when you have to
run. I like the passing part; don't get me wrong. There was a lot
of hard work by the receivers and me, and now it's paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was my legs and my attitude and things like that.
Over the spring and summer, I really worked hard on improving the
passing. It's not like I'm some guy who's 6-5 and 240 and can zip
it all over the place but can't move. I can move a little, and I
can throw it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's throwing it a lot.

 &HT;    Carrier delivers a life-saving message
 &HT;    By Lisa Perry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIQUA, Ohio _ It wasn't the kind of belated birthday gift she
expected, but it was certainly one she will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   She received the gift of life from her newspaper carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia Chappie, who turned 79 on Oct. 11, spent her birthday in
and out of consciousness on the cold floor of her modest bungalow.
She said she had fallen sometime Oct. 5 and hit her head, and was
unable to get up or call for help. She doesn't remember much about
her ordeal, she said, except when help finally came.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest thing was those big hands coming to help me,''
Chappie, a diabetic, said Tuesday from her hospital bed. ``I didn't
expect to get out of it. I couldn't get up. I'd hit my head. It was
kind of bad _ I expected all kinds of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me that she just kept laying there, thinking someone
would find her,'' said Debbie Sproat, a Dayton Daily News
independent contract newspaper carrier.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sproat who noticed that Chappie's papers were piling up
on the woman's front porch, mail was filling the mailbox and a
light in the woman's kitchen remained on for several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that was unusual were the lights,'' said Sproat, who
has been delivering papers in the dead of night between 3 and 4
a.m. in Piqua for 3 1/2 years. Last Friday morning, Sproat felt she
had to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how you just get a gut feeling that something's
wrong. Her mailbox was full of mail. I tried to call, but couldn't
get an answer,'' Sproat said.
</P>
<P>
   So Sproat called police, who after getting no response from the
house, spent eight hours trying to contact Chappie's relatives.
Failing that, police ordered a locksmith to open the front door.
According to the police report, they found the woman lying on the
floor of the downstairs bathroom. After nine days on the floor,
Chappie was taken to the Upper Valley Medical Center, where she
remains in satisfactory condition.
</P>
<P>
   Sproat said police told her the outcome might have been
different had Chappie spent another day on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Daily News Troy branch service manager Ernie Spegele said
Sproat's persistence and compassion doesn't surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very reliable, attentive to a lot of things. She is
johnny on the spot, and this is fitting right into her character,''
Spegele said.
</P>
<P>
   And if there were one thing Chappie would say to her rescuers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' she said.

 &HT;    Huffy posts $25.6 million loss
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMISBURG, Ohio _ As expected, Huffy Corp. lost money in the
third quarter, but an analyst said the real picture won't become
clear until the company completes closure of its American bike
manufacturing plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in the short run the earnings report is of
secondary consequence compared to the major changes that the
company is undergoing with the restructuring and the overseas
sourcing of the product,'' said David Leibowitz, managing director
of Burnham Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, investors will have a much better idea of where
the company is headed, he said. The company plans to close its
remaining two bike manufacturing plants by the end of the year and
begin importing all its bikes from outside sources.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Huffy announced a net earnings loss of $25.6
million, or $2.49 per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30. That
compares with a third-quarter 1998 loss of $719,000, or 6 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy reported a net loss of $8.6 million, or 84 cents a share,
prior to charges for plant closure and manufacturing
reconfiguration and prior to after-tax charges in the bike
operation. Net sales were down 6.1 percent to $112.8 million from
$120.1 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed its poor performance on competition from
Chinese bicycle manufacturers and a soft sporting goods market.
</P>
<P>
   The company's service segment reported a 5.3 percent sales
increase due to continued solid demand for inventory, assembly and
merchandizing services. However, net earnings in the service
segment remained flat due to higher labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy stock (NYSE:HUF) stock crept upward by 1/16 Tuesday,
closing at 10. The 52-week range was 8 1/8 to 16 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The company has struggled to compete with low cost bikes
overseas and to negate shareholder concerns over the plunging stock
price. PaineWebber Inc. is exploring strategic alternatives at
Huffy's behest and company officials said those alternatives could
include merger or sale of part or all of Huffy.

THWARTED BY LIGHT BREEZES, TEAM CONNER LOSES TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ ``Have a good day,'' Dennis Conner
called cheerily to American tourists here Tuesday _ although his
own day in the America's Cup challengers trials could have been
much better.
</P>
<P>
   The American visitors, here to see the start of four months of
America's Cup ocean racing, waved from the Viaduct Basin wharf and
called ``Go USA'' as Conner's blue-hulled Stars &AMP; Stripes was towed
back into harbor in late afternoon after going 0-2 to Italian and
American rivals.
</P>
<P>
   When you have sailed in seven America's Cup campaigns, skippered
six and won four, you expect to attract attention _ even, or
particularly when, you slip astern.
</P>
<P>
   Conner, who is starting his eighth bid for the cup, was
philosophical about Tuesday's double defeat. ``It's never fun to
lose two races, but nothing happened today to dampen our
enthusiasm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several positive things came out of the experience. It was
great to have a chance to look at the mainsails of two rivals in
very similar conditions, something that doesn't happen down here
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailing all day in breezes that veered but kept between three
and eight knots was rare on the Hauraki Gulf race course, Conner
said, where the prevailing seasonal breeze _ it is early summer
here _ is a far more lively nor'easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stars &AMP; Stripes was not designed for the light air encountered
today,'' Conner said. But he conceded that neither were any of the
other 15 yachts being sailed by 11 cup aspirants from seven nations
who are seeking to qualify for the right to meet the host nation,
New Zealand, in the cup final next February.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the other boats are optimized for light conditions
either,'' Conner said. ``Today the other guy just sailed better
than we did. Good on them. That's what yacht racing is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Team Dennis Conner's general manger, Bill Trenkle, said that on
a day in which many skippers reported falling into ``wind holes,''
as the breezes fell and swung, ``It was hard to come back once you
got out of phase with the wind shifts,'' Trenkle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winds were so patchy, we had a man at the top of our mast
at the start of the race against the Italians on the lookout for
better pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, the Conner crew lost to Aloha Racing's yacht
Abracadabra 2000 of Hawaii by 3 minutes 50 seconds; in the
afternoon, Stars &AMP; Stripes' losing margin to Prada's Luna Rossa was
5 minutes 4 seconds as it fell to 1-3 in the early competition.
</P>
<P>
   Young America, America One and Prada each have had four
victories in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   The four-leg, 12-mile course took boats an average of 2 hours 15
minutes to cover in Tuesday's weak winds.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 such races are scheduled by the organizers of the
Louis Vuitton Cup to serve as the elimination stage from which the
winner goes on to sail the final against New Zealand, the holder
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Conner team is scheduled to take on the fast
Japanese boat, Asura, and to have an easier afternoon adversary in
the Swiss entry, Be Happy, which is 0-4 after two days.
</P>
<P>
   But with 20-knot winds forecast Wednesday on the course, which
lies 15 miles from Auckland harbor, all crews, hulls and equipment
face the regatta's toughest test so far. &QL;

 &HT;    Donations flowing to reservations
 &HT;    By Cathy Mong
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In the language of the Lakota Indians, chante
waste (chan-tay was-tay) means ``with a good heart.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a phrase Guy Jones has repeated often lately, in thanks to
Miami Valley residents who have given so much to help destitute
Indians in desolate places.
</P>
<P>
   In early September, Jones, a Lakota and founder of the Miami
Valley Council for Native Americans, and a group of volunteers
delivered clothing and school supplies to reservations in South
Dakota. In response to newspaper accounts of their journey and life
on the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock reservations, people here
began donating more goods.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jones' group returned to Dayton in mid-September,
the council's garage was stuffed with donations and the answering
machine was jammed with messages asking how to help.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the largesse has barely slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still getting between 30 to 60 calls a day,'' said
Arlene Mendenhall, an office volunteer. ``We had 460 calls in one
week.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 sixth-graders collected toys, school supplies and
clothing after reading the stories, teacher Bob Ryan said. ``They
were really concerned,'' he said. ``It was all their idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hicks, 11, gave up a special book of fairy tales he'd had
since he was 3, and Travis Kennard, 12, said he offered one of his
coats he'd outgrown.
</P>
<P>
   In response to all the goods collected the past six weeks, Jones
is preparing for an unprecedented second road trip this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably leave the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and
return Sunday, Nov. 28,'' said Jones, 43.
</P>
<P>
   He will distribute in Bridger, McLaughlin and Eagle Butte, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is appealing specifically for any winter outerwear,
thermal underwear, new socks, boots, school supplies and book bags.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit organization could use cash donations to help
defray costs of the 2,600-mile round trip, which is about $1,800,
including truck rental and gasoline, Mendenhall said.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, CHINESE COMPANY INDICTED IN '94 EQUIPMENT SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 12th graf, The criminal ..., to CORRECT, negotiations
broke down Monday night, sted Tuesday; SUBS 15th graf, McDonnell

purpose.)

 By JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and a powerful state-owned aerospace company in China
on charges of conspiring to hide important details of a 1994 sale
of American machining equipment, some of which was diverted to a
Chinese military site.
</P>
<P>
   The case could complicate relations between Beijing and
Washington just as China and the United States are trying to
complete one of the biggest trade agreements in history _ China's
entry into the World Trade Organization, American and Chinese
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonni Tischler, the assistant commissioner for investigations
for the U.S. Customs Service, said at a news briefing Tuesday that
the indictment was the ``first time a Chinese government entity has
been indicted for violations of U.S. export laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges McDonnell Douglas, a unit of the Boeing
Co., and the Douglas Aircraft Co., a division of McDonnel Douglas,
with 13 counts, including conspiracy, false statements and
misrepresentations in connection with a 1994 export license to sell
13 pieces of machining equipment to China.
</P>
<P>
   It also contains 12 charges against the buyer of the equipment,
the China National Aero Technology Import and Export Corp., or
Catic, and Catic affiliates in Beijing and California.
</P>
<P>
   Two Chinese nationals employed by Catic were also indicted, as
was a mid-level McDonnell Douglas employee, Robert J. Hitt, the
director of the China program office at Douglas Aircraft in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Boeing and Catic representatives denied any wrongdoing and
vowed to contest the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``McDonnell Douglas Corporation did not commit any criminal
violations in regard to the sale of the machine tools to the
People's Republic of China and intends to vigorously defend against
the charges brought by the United States Attorney's Office,''
Boeing said in a statement. ``It is unfortunate that the
prosecutors have apparently not taken the time to learn the facts
and gain a full understanding of a rather complicated matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred F. Fielding, a partner in the Washington law firm of Wiley,
Rein &AMP; Fielding who represents Catic and its affiliates, said:
``Catic has cooperated fully with the government investigation and
has strongly maintained throughout that it has never intentionally
violated any U.S. laws. This is a commercial transaction involving
the sale of used machinery and the government's position that this
is a criminal or national security case is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Tischler said the diversion of civilian technology for
military uses by China was a top priority for investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also released a lengthy background paper that suggested
that one of the company's defenses is that top Clinton
administration officials knew important details about the deal, so
they could not have been misled.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation of the deal began in 1996. Lengthy
plea-bargain negotiations between defense lawyers, and Lisa Prager,
the assistant U.S. attorney who handled the inquiry, broke down
Monday night, lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Catic bought the machining equipment, which is used to bend
steel in manufacturing aircraft, for only $5 million. But the sale
was part of a billion-dollar deal in which McDonnell Douglas was to
build trunkliner, or middle-size commuter, aircraft in China. The
indictment cites an October 1993 meeting in which Douglas
executives agreed they were negotiating the sale of the machining
equipment ``due to the pending $1 billion trunkliner program.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the sale of the machining equipment,
McDonnell Douglas discovered that some of it had not gone to the
intended destination, a civilian site in Beijing, but instead wound
up 800 miles away, at a military site in Nanchang that makes
surface-to-surface missiles and fighter aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas reported the diversion in 1995, before the
equipment had been put to use. The giant machines were later moved
to a civilian location, and the equipment was never used for any
military purpose. The airliner deal, which President Clinton hailed
on the eve of the 1994 election as a job-rich program for 20
planes, has produced only one plane, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The airliner deal was promoted by Clinton and then Commerce
Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who died in a plane crash in Croatia in
1996, as a centerpiece of the administration's commercial
diplomacy, the policy of using economic engagement to broaden ties
with Beijing and promote exports. On the eve of a trip to China in
1994, Brown wrote a letter to China's vice premier about the
airliner deal based on a draft letter from Douglas, according to
Boeing's release. The machining equipment license was issued soon
after Brown returned from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   State Department cables obtained by defense lawyers in the case
show that administration officials delayed seeking timely
assurances from Catic on how it planned to use the machining
equipment so as not to disrupt Brown's announcement about the deal
in China, according to lawyers and officials who have read the
cables.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that Catic officials caused six of the
machines to be diverted to Nanchang. It also charges that McDonnell
Douglas officials concealed or failed to disclose important
information from Commerce Department licensing officials, including
that the airliner deal was in jeopardy. If the deal was in
jeopardy, it could be less likely that the equipment would be used
for its intended commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says that McDonnell Douglas, which was
bought by Boeing in 1997, concealed its hiring of a ``high ranking
former government official and his consulting firm'' that was paid
$4 million ``to intercede with Catic'' and China ``because the
trunkliner negotiations were stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case said the former official referred
to in the indictment was Alexander M. Haig Jr., the former
secretary of state. Woody Goldberg, a spokesman for Haig's firm,
confirmed their representation of McDonnell Douglas on the China
airliner deal.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, the corporate defendants face an aggregate maximum
criminal fine of about $10 million. The corporate defendants could
also be restricted in their future trade dealings if convicted. The
individual defendants face a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: HORROR STORIES ABOUT LIFE ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Round 6 a.m., Rich Borden got that sinking feeling at the
airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where he had just flown in on the
red-eye from Paris. Nine hours in coach across the Atlantic and all
he wanted was to grab his luggage, hurry to his hotel, shower,
change and hit the deck for a 10 a.m. meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That was not to be. ``I watched the luggage conveyor go round
and round until it stopped,'' said Borden, a public relations
executive with FORE Systems &UR;  &LR; Inc., a computer networking company in
the Pittsburgh suburbs. His suitcase, containing clothes he would
need for a four-day telecommunications exhibition in Sao Paulo, was
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Borden's trip had originated on an Air France  &UR;  &LR; flight from
Hanover, Germany, to Paris, where his luggage was supposed to have
been checked through by Air France on the connecting Varig
Airlines &UR;  &LR; flight to Brazil. There was no discernable Air France
presence at the Sao Paulo airport, Borden said. After a few anxious
hours waiting in vain for the bag, he headed into town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in a nice suit,'' he
recalled. He needed to find something to wear quickly. As it
happened, ``there was a discount men's clothing place right across
the street from the exhibition hall,'' he said. As soon as it
opened, he went in and bought a sports jacket, two pairs of pants
and two shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he would be seeking reimbursement from Air France,
Borden said he deliberately ``low-balled'' the duds. ``I wasn't
going for Gucci,'' he said. The bill came to $176.08. ``A little
old man came out from the back and tailored the pants right on the
spot,'' said Borden, who has logged more than 3 million miles
traveling on business since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He pronounced himself delighted with the shop's excellent
service. The airline's service was another matter. Three days
later, a resourceful hotel concierge finally tracked down the
wandering bag, which had evidently arrived, without notice, a day
before. As soon as he got home, Borden filed a claim for the
$176.08.
</P>
<P>
   That was seven months ago. Since then, both Borden and his
travel agency have written and called the Air France customer
service number dozens of times, without result. ``I have yet to
speak to a human being,'' said Borden, who added that he was
frustrated by not having his complaint taken seriously. ``The 800
number has this vast menu, which basically just gets you lost in
voice mail.''
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with Borden Tuesday, I called the Air France
customer-service toll-free number. He wasn't exaggerating. The
recording opened with a hearty ``Bonjour!'' But it then
deteriorated into a series of instructions to press numbers for a
perplexing list of variables, and started to sound like an
especially Francophobic Monty Python sketch. The call ended with
dead air and a disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, nothing particularly extraordinary about
Borden's anecdote. And this is not meant to single out Air France
for the special opprobrium Borden understandably feels (though Air
France really ought to do something about that phone menu). In
fact, business travel horror stories are so common these days that
they form a new narrative genre, one that is spun out largely by
word of mouth or in scattered Internet chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing clamor has caught the attention of the National
Business Travel Association, a trade group that represents about
1,400 corporate travel managers. On Nov. 1, the group, which
already provides industry information at its main Web site
(www.nbta.org), plans to start an auxiliary Web site
(www.biztraveler.org) that will provide time sensitive travel
information and also include a link where business travelers will
be encouraged to share their tales of woe in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an outlet for business travelers to tell us what
they are experiencing on the road,'' said Marianne McInerney, a
spokeswoman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be some glorified cyber gripe-line. She said that
the group planned to catalog the information and ``share it with
the service providers'' _ airlines, hotel companies, car rental
agencies and others, including government agencies like the
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Business travel is increasingly arduous for the traveler, and
expensive for the corporations that pay the bills. Now the trade
group hopes to use its clout to make service providers pay more
attention to the complaints rising from the business travel market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business travel has become a contact sport,'' Ms. McInerney
said. &QL;

PAUS HAS MET THE ENEMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget Cal. The toughest opponent UCLA quarterback
Cory Paus has faced this season wears No. 10 in blue and gold.
Until he eliminates self-loathing, every Saturday will be a
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be not so hard on myself,'' Paus said two days after
the worst game of his life _ a 9-of-28 performance against Cal. ``I
can't think (quarterbacking) should be such an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to look at it in a different light. It's a hard thing
to do and I'm only a freshman. I've got to realize I can't play
like a senior every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus berates himself after bad passes and takes full
responsibility for UCLA's defeats _ qualities the coaches believe
will make him a better player. But Paus is easily haunted. He
carries mistakes for play upon play, and that's when trouble
surfaces: He'll lose concentration or try to right the wrong by
forcing a play when none exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this playing bad is new to me,'' he said quietly. ``I
don't know how to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Searching for a remedy: Someone suggested Paus watch
videotape of Cade McNown's freshman season. Perhaps seeing McNown
struggle (seven touchdowns, eight interceptions) would alleviate
Paus' stress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to stay away from that,'' Paus said. ``He didn't
redshirt and I did. The coaches tell me I'm further along (than
McNown as a freshman). If I watch his freshman tapes, then I'm
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   __ When bad is good: Paus completed 21 of 34 passes for 332
yards against Oregon, then hit 9 of 28 for 81 yards against Cal _ a
swing typical of freshman quarterbacks. He believes bad games are a
better gauge of his progress than good games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I start getting better, my poor games will be half what
they are now,'' he said. ``When I have a poor game, it's rock
bottom. I need to put together a series of average games and have
those become my poor games.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Receiver Danny Farmer has been downgraded from
probable to questionable for Saturday's game at Oregon State
because of a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve linebackers Ali Abdul Azziz (sprained shoulder) and Ed
Stansbury (sprained knee) are doubtful. Fullback Durell Price
(abdominal strain) is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end is the trouble spot. Mike Seidman (sprained shoulder)
is out and Bryan Fletcher (strained groin) is questionable. If
Fletcher can't play, the Bruins will have two tight ends available:
starter Gabe Crecion and reserve Randy Hakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to do different things offensively,'' coach Bob
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Top of the tailbacks: Oregon State's Ken Simonton has
flourished in the Beavers' four-receiver, one-back attack that's
designed to spread the defense. A 5-7 sophomore, Simonton leads the
Pac-10 in rushing (150 yards per game) and scoring (12 touchdowns).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, UCLA is eighth in the conference in run defense,
allowing 177 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's relatively strong for his size,'' Beavers coach Dennis
Erickson said. ``But the biggest thing is his feet and vision.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
When the Rockets spent the summer making trades and signing free
agents, they promised they would have a team that would keep fans
on the edge of their seats.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, they've succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Fans have been on the edge of their seats, all right _ that's
the quickest way they can get out of the way of all those errant
passes and booted balls the Rockets have coughed up lately.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, around the Rockets these days, turnover has referred to
more than just the roster changes. Suffice it to say about the only
thing the Rockets have exhibited during the exhibition season is a
startling tendency to handle the basketball like a wet bar of soap.
</P>
<P>
   Witness Monday night's 104-91 loss to the Charlotte Hornets, in
which the Rockets turned the ball over an alarming 35 times,
leading to 40 points for the grateful Hornets and the Rockets'
third loss in four preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's output raised the Rockets' turnover average to a
staggering 27.8 per game, leading to 129 points for the opposition,
which means almost one-third of the opponents' points (416 in four
games) have come courtesy of Rockets turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than take Tuesday off, coach Rudy Tomjanovich called
his team together, and everyone went back to the basics.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite: ``This is a basketball. Don't turn it over,''
but it was close.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' said Tomjanovich of the Rockets' 35
turnovers against the Hornets. ``Today we got down to basics, just
ball-handling drills that you see at the (summer) camps _ fingertip
control and all that. We have to get more of a conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a line that you have to draw. I don't want my players
to play scared and restricted and all that, but I want to have a
little bit of a conscience, like if you make a couple of turnovers
it's like, `Hey, maybe I ought to play it a little bit closer to
the vest until I get in the groove.'
</P>
<P>
   ``(The contributing) factors (are) a back-to-back (playing the
Hornets after Sunday's game at Orlando), which is something that we
have to go through, (or) when you're trying to learn a new system
when you're a little irritated or a little tired. Things like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just showed that we have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey all involved think the Rockets will navigate
easily.
</P>
<P>
   The causes are many:
</P>
<P>
   A team full of new players, all unfamiliar with the others. And
the Rockets have been experimenting with different lineups and
moving players around the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics speak for themselves,'' Hakeem Olajuwon said.
``But it's something that can be improved on easily. Getting to
know each other, and I feel that after getting more and more
comfortable, that you'll see the turnovers go down tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the preseason we have new guys getting to play against
each other, and we're also trying to do too much at one time. This
is part of preseason, it is a learning experience, and the more
games you play, you will get much more comfortable and start making
better decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A new fast-break offense is being led by a rookie. Steve Francis
has been sensational in many aspects of the game, averaging 21.5
points and 4.8 assists per game, but he also has forked over the
ball 29 times, an average of just over seven per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done some real good things,'' Tomjanovich said of
Francis. ``He's exciting. He's still young and has a lot to learn,
and I think he is learning with every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our guys, they have picked up in some areas, but the
biggest area now, and the most important area, is turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a better job. We're shooting a better percentage
than our opponents, we're getting more rebounds, we're blocking
more shots, we're getting more free throws, but the thing that's
killing us is turnovers. We've got to get those possessions and get
those opportunities to shoot the ball. Good things will start
happening then.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials who are bending over backward to call things such as
carrying and palming the basketball, part of the NBA's new plan to
tighten enforcement of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``My moves are too fast,'' Francis said. ``Every time I get a
turnover, it's basically off a carry. It's not really throwing the
ball away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it happens when I have the ball and (commit) an
offensive foul, but I've been looking at a lot of tape with
(Tomjanovich), and a lot of the things that I've been doing, I've
been doing all my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to stay aggressive and hopefully someday they'll
change their mind on the way I dribble the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Cuttino Mobley, too, wishes the referees would ease up and
let the players play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're just taking the art out of the game,'' Mobley
said. ``There are guys who invent a lot of things. Pistol Pete
(Maravich) invented a whole bunch of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many guys invented spin moves, but now they (the referees)
want to take that away, and now they want to take the crossovers
and the hesitations away. How do you want us to dribble? It's
crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it. But hopefully that won't carry on. If
you want to call it, then you can call it every single time. Off a
pick-and-roll, guys hesitate (with the dribble) to see if a big guy
is jumping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things they could watch. It's just
ridiculous. Now they're being so military-like about the whole
situation. They're making a mockery out of this.''

 &HT;    Tutu to have exploratory surgery
 &HT;    By Karen Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, 68, plans to
enter Emory University Hospital on Thursday for surgery to
determine if cancer initially found in his prostate gland has
spread elsewhere in his body.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu received the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in
transforming South Africa from a strictly segregated society into a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The prostate cancer was found and treated in 1997, but doctors
have discovered it has returned.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday by Emory officials, Tutu said he
understood it was not unusual for cancer to recur two years after
radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   If the cancer has not spread, Tutu said he plans to undergo
cryosurgery, which will freeze the affected tissue with liquid
nitrogen. ``If it has spread, I am likely to undergo renewed
hormone treatment, which ran concurrently with my radiation therapy
in 1997, but I am feeling fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu is a visiting theology professor at Emory, as well as chair
of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in his home country. In
an interview last week with The London Daily Telegraph, he said
having cancer had, in some ways, been a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has sharpened my focus and made me concentrate on things
that matter: my wife, my three daughters and son, the smiles on my
grandchildren's faces, the smell of flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   He has kept a busy schedule, speaking in recent weeks to
audiences as diverse as the National Press Club in Washington and a
gymnasium full of schoolchildren in Atlanta.

By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You probably didn't know there is a honeymoon
suite among the luxury boxes at the new Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It belongs to the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the polished brass and marble of the city's new
state-of-the-art arena comes great expectations that this season
will not be another one of those numbing, six-month rides to
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is in place,'' team owner Ed Roski said Tuesday,
looking out on the Staples Center ice on the eve of the tonight's
sold-out home opener against Boston. ``This is a very exciting time
for everyone, but we know the only thing that will bring people
back is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Roski and fellow owner Phillip Anschutz will be part of the
sellout crowd of 18,500 on hand to see a Kings team that opened the
season with an solid 4-2-1 trip that took them as far as Miami and
Edmonton and gave the team some well-deserved optimism.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor added seven new players and a new
coach to a team that finished out of the playoffs last year and
often drew fewer than 5,000 fans to games at the Great Western
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   He brought in high-scoring winger Ziggy Palffy, a three-time
40-goal scorer with the New York Islanders, and spent a hefty $6.6
million over four years to ensure veteran defenseman Mattias
Norstrom was back from a lengthy holdout in time to open the
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that showed this team isn't just going to sit back and
ride the wave of a new building,'' Norstrom said. ``We know that
the crowds will be good because the place is opening and people
want to see it. But we know that will be brief because this town
demands a winner. We think we've got one here.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important than Palffy or Luc Robitaille, who
revived his career last year with 39 goals and was named this
season's first NHL Player of the Week, is rookie coach Andy Murray.
</P>
<P>
   A long-time assistant who was hired last summer after coaching a
high school team in Minnesota, Murray replaced Hall of Famer Larry
Robinson behind the Kings bench. In such a critical season, the
Kings could have played it safe by hiring a more established name.
But Murray, with great attention to detail and impressive
motivational skills, appears to have clicked with this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has opened the lines of communication,'' said captain Rob
Blake, who played for Murray on the Canadian national team. ``When
players think somebody cares about them, they respond. I think fans
will see that in this team.''
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as the Staples Center is structurally, fitting the
Kings into a schedule that includes the Lakers and Clippers makes
it the busiest facility in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the quick turnarounds between sports (the Lakers and
Clippers will actually play on different floors), the Kings will
not hold practices at the Staples Center. The club will continue to
work out at the Iceoplex in the San Fernando Valley until
mid-December, when it moves with the Kings to a multisport facility
in El Segundo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite a place,'' Robitaille said. ``It will be great for
us and the fans. When you're proud of something, there is a
definite home-ice advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Kings failed to make the playoffs for the
fifth time in six years, the team's home record was 18-20-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Murray has not overlooked the possibility of the Kings
pressing due to the hype of tonight's Staples Center debut.
</P>
<P>
   Murray addressed a Kings luncheon of nearly 200 on Tuesday with
a convincing speech about getting hard work and accountability from
his players. It is the same talk he has fed the Kings since he took
the job and a quick start was the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is easy to get caught up in everything that surrounds
the new building,'' said Murray, 48, an intense man with a dry
Canadian wit. ``Boston knows that and they will be gunning for us.
We've talked a lot the past week about what that first night will
be like. We'll do what we've been doing, working hard for 60
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kings were one of the league's surprise teams in
the first two weeks, they showed several lapses during the final
game in Edmonton, a 5-4 loss. Their first line of Robitaille,
Palffy and Stumpel disappeared for long stretches and the defense
had trouble keeping up with the quicker Oiler forwards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings refused to use fatigue as an excuse even though
they were at the end of a seven-game trip and had played the night
before in Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not keep the intensity up in the last game, but I think
that (intensity) is one of our strong points,'' Palffy said. ``That
is something that makes being here fun. The building is terrific,
but so is this team.''

EDITORIAL: `PARTIAL BIRTH' DECEPTIONS  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Once again a woman's right to choose abortion is under direct
attack in Congress. The Senate is poised to vote Wednesday on the
latest congressional attempt to impose a national ban on so-called
partial birth abortions. Billed by its proponents as a narrow
targeting of a single late-term procedure, the measure is actually
a backdoor attempt to severely constrict abortion rights throughout
all stages of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   This reality has not been lost on the courts. Since the Senate's
last partial birth vote, there have been 11 court decisions on the
legal merits of partial birth bans passed by different states. In
all but one instance, the ban was blocked because of constitutional
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit
struck down partial birth statutes in Nebraska, Arkansas and Iowa.
Two of the statutes included language nearly identical to the
language of the Senate bill. Finding that the term ``partial birth
abortion'' has no fixed medical or legal meaning, the court said
that the vague laws placed an undue burden on abortion rights by
outlawing even the safest and most common procedures used before
fetal viability.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Republican leaders are well aware of what the courts
have been saying. But that has not prevented them from forging
ahead without holding a single hearing on the serious
constitutional issues. The real goal here is to gain an edge in
next year's election by forcing President Clinton to lift his veto
pen for the third time. The nation's lawmakers should have more
respect for the Constitution, women's rights and their own
institution than to go along with such a dangerous and deceptive
game.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Although politics has not been a profession for the fainthearted
in Belarus and Yugoslavia, until now opposition figures could
generally count on staying alive. But in both places activists have
recently disappeared or suffered potentially fatal attacks in murky
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The most widely known incident was the car crash on Oct. 3 that
killed the brother-in-law and three bodyguards of Vuk Draskovic in
Yugoslavia. Draskovic is an opportunistic nationalist who has
served in Slobodan Milosevic's government and still controls the
city of Belgrade and its television station. At the moment he is
nominally part of the opposition. He was only slightly injured in
the crash, in which a truck swerved directly into his car.
</P>
<P>
   If the government did try to rid itself of Draskovic, as he has
charged, the goal may have been to prevent the formation of a
unified opposition. Serbs are fed up with not only Milosevic but
also with the petty divisions among his critics. But those
divisions may be lessening. A genuine opposition group called the
Alliance for Change has recently staged nightly street rallies,
though the police have beaten demonstrators several times.
</P>
<P>
   The protests are small, but they are a positive step that has
made the alliance more popular. It and Draskovic now also agree to
press for early elections if certain conditions of fairness are
met. Draskovic is rightly distrusted by Yugoslavia's democrats _
the last time Milosevic assaulted him and his family, he reacted by
embracing the regime. But other members of his party are less
authoritarian and belong in a genuine opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Belarus, ruled by the Stalinist dictator Alexander
Lukashenko, four prominent opposition leaders have mysteriously
disappeared since April. In each case the government says it has no
information, even though one of the missing, the former national
bank chief Tamara Vinnikova, was under house arrest when she
disappeared, and the others were constantly tailed by security
police.
</P>
<P>
   If Lukashenko is now kidnapping opposition leaders, he may be
trying to push the opposition into withdrawing from
European-sponsored talks about the possibility of free elections
next year. Or, as his ties have warmed slightly with Europe and
Washington, he may simply be thinking he can get away with it. The
Western group with the most influence in Belarus is the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been
inexplicably muted in its defense of Belarus' opposition. It, and
foreign governments, must prove Lukashenko wrong by strengthening
their support for Belarus' dissidents.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS INDICTED IN CHINA EQUIPMENT DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted the former
McDonnell Douglas Corp., which is now part of The Boeing Co., for
its part in an alleged conspiracy in which machine tools intended
for a commercial aircraft venture ended up at a Chinese military
factory.
</P>
<P>
   The violations of U.S. export laws spelled out in the
government's indictment took place more than two years before
Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based aerospace giant strongly disputed the charges
and issued a 43-page memorandum that spelled out in great detail
the equipment that was sold to the state-owned China National
Aero-Technology Import Export Co., or Catic, which also was
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Catic was a partner with McDonnell Douglas in what was known as
the Trunkliner program to build McDonnell Douglas commercial jets
in China. The equipment was to be used only for those commercial
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the prosecutors have apparently not
taken the time to learn the facts and gain a full understanding of
a rather complicated matter,'' Boeing said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to ``vigorously'' defend itself, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment comes at a sensitive time in U.S. relations with
China, which is seeking U.S. backing for its entry into the World
Trade Organization. Against that stage, the FBI is investigating
how U.S. nuclear secrets were obtained by China and Congress
recently investigated the illegal export of sensitive U.S. rocket
technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and Catic face fines of up up to $10 million if
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the State Department could deny Boeing a license to
sell certain military equipment overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't consider that to be a reasonable possibility,'' said
a Boeing official familiar with the matter.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the federal courthouse in
Washington, D.C., where the indictment was handed down, a
government official said it should send a strong message to U.S.
companies that violations of the country's export laws will not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, firms that sacrifice American security for profit
must pay a price,'' Bonnie Tischler, assistant commissioner for
investigations at the U.S. Customs Service, told reporters. ``Even
before the equipment left American soil, both firms knew it was
military bound.''
</P>
<P>
   The equipment in question was discovered before it could be used
for military purposes in China.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Wilma Lewis told reporters ``this criminal
conspiracy was a serious attempt to circumvent the export control
laws designed to protect the national security of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation began in 1996. Attorneys for
McDonnell Douglas and later Boeing have been talking with the
government for some time in an effort to resolve the matter short
of criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   No plea agreement could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to agree to any crime when we did not commit
any criminal violations,'' said Boeing spokesman Larry McCracken,
who was a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas before the merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an example of the export control system working,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Named in the 16-count indictment with McDonnell Douglas were two
Chinese nationals employed by Catic, and Robert Hitt, who was
director of the Trunkliner program for McDonnell Douglas. He is
still with Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals could be sent to prison for up to five years if
convicted. U.S. officials said this is the first time a Chinese
government entity has been indicted for violating U.S. export laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to conspiracy, the defendants were charged with
making false statements to the U.S. government about the intended
use for the machine tools.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from the sale of 13 surplus machine tools to
the Chinese company for about $5 million. The U.S government
licensed the export of the tools for use in the Trunkliner program
to build 40 McDonnell Douglas civilian airliners in China.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, McDonnell Douglas already was working with China as
part of a 1985 agreement to co-produce 35 McDonnell Douglas planes
in China. McDonnell Douglas supplied aircraft kits to the Chinese
to build the planes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Trunkliner program, however, the Chinese would for the
first time actually fabricate a large portion of the aircraft
components.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus tooling equipment came from a facility in Columbus,
Ohio, where McDonnell Douglas manufactured parts for its MD-11
jetliner and its C-17 military transport for the U.S. Air Force.
The tools were used to bend and shape steel for aerospace products.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas obtained the necessary export licenses in the
fall of 1994 and Catic exported the tools to China later that year
and in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was supposed to go to a civilian factory in
Beijing. But six of the tools were discovered some 800 miles away
at the Nanchang Aircraft Corp., where China makes Silkworm missiles
and attack aircraft, according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell Douglas reported the diversion in 1995, before the
equipment had been put to use. The machines were later moved to a
civilian location. The indictment said McDonnell Douglas acted with
``willful blindness'' in not making sure all the equipment ended up
in the proper place.
</P>
<P>
   Tischler, the U.S. Customs Service official, said at the news
conference, ``Even before the equipment left American soil, both
firms knew it was military bound.''
</P>
<P>
   This was apparently is reference to the fact that McDonnell
Douglas apparently knew a delegation from the Chinese defense
factory in Nanchang inspected the tools during a tour of the
Columbus plant with Catic officials in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In its 43-page background paper provided to the media, Boeing
said the visit did not raise any red flags.
</P>
<P>
   The only McDonnell Douglas employee who recalled being aware
that representatives from Nanchang were on the tour had no reason
to be concerned, the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He assumed that engineers from Nanchang were simply assisting
Catic in assessing the equipment,'' the memorandum said, adding:
``Hitt explained that if he had seen the reference to Nanchang it
would not have raised any concerns because he did not know that a
factory existed in Nanchang.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said McDonnell Douglas was the first to alert the U.S.
government that the six tools were at the Nanchang factory.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, an inspection of the tooling equipment in
Tianjin, a port near Beijing, found six of the machine tools
missing, the Boeing paper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once McDonnell Douglas learned of the presence of machine
tools in Nanchang, it reported that to the Department of
Commerce,'' the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing said government prosecutors in the case are relying on
circumstantial evidence and a theory of ``conscious avoidance,''
holding that McDonnell Douglas collectively should have known the
machine tools would be used for military purposes rather than in
connection with a commercial aircraft program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible that the government is charging us with
criminal conduct when they can't prove that a single individual had
the knowledge they allege,'' Boeing's McCracken said. ``They are
trying to manufacturer a corporate consciousness that no one had.''

 IBM PLANS TO STOP SELLING ITS PCs IN RETAIL OUTLETS  
(js) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM, which helped touch off a boom in computer retailing when it
introduced its personal computer nearly two decades ago, said
Tuesday that consumers soon would not find its PCs in stores; they
will have to buy them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After Christmas, International Business Machines Corp. will sell
its Aptiva line of consumer desktop computers only on the World
Wide Web. Its popular Thinkpad laptops will still be available in
stores, and it will continue to sell corporate computers _ a much
larger business for IBM _ through dealers, as well as directly from
the company.
</P>
<P>
   It is abandoning retail stores for its PCs because, like other
computer manufacturers who sell through brick-and-mortar outlets,
IBM has been losing ground to companies that sell directly to
customers, like Dell Computer Corp. and Gateway Inc. IBM's PC
division lost $1 billion last year and $240 million in the first
half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   To stem the losses, IBM is paring the business, cutting costs
and focusing on its more profitable divisions. Two weeks ago, it
said it would lay off as many as 1,000 of the 10,000 employees in
the personal-computer division, many of them involved in selling
computers to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, IBM said it would emphasize sales of
Aptivas on its own Shopibm.com site in addition to selling through
some Internet dealers, like Valueamerica.Com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't figure out how to go through retail and have us make
money and have the retailer make money on a consistent basis,''
said David M. Thomas, the executive in charge of IBM's personal
systems group. He said that consumers represented about $2 billion
of the company's $17 billion in PC sales but that the consumer line
``consistently loses more money than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, IBM's share of the consumer market is far smaller than
industry averages. Ziff-Davis Infobeads estimates that in 1999, 41
percent of desktop computers and 19 percent of portable computers
were sold to home users.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said that the consumer market had been tough for IBM
because it has been dominated by very low-cost machines, where
profit margins are much thinner than IBM needs to support its
expensive infrastructure. Moreover, retailers demand expensive
support, like subsidizing the cost of unsold models, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said these problems were mainly limited to the United
States and that IBM continued to do well selling through retail
outlets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also say that IBM has been inconsistent in its approach
to the consumer market and has often been late to spot industry
trends, especially new lower price levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM reminds me of a 747 that takes off, climbs to 40,000 feet
then does a nose dive and pulls out just before it crashes,'' said
Mathew Sargent, an analyst with Ziff Davis. He said that IBM had
recently fallen to fourth place in the retail market, with an 11
percent share, after Hewlett-Packard, Compaq &UR;  &LR; and an upstart,
E-Machines.
</P>
<P>
   IBM hopes that Internet sales will prove more lucrative. Selling
directly to consumers delivers higher profit margins, but even when
it sells a PC on another retailer's Web site, it is often shipped
directly from IBM to the consumer, reducing the cost of
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, IBM said that Internet buyers typically spend more on
computers and need less technical help than those who buy in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent said that, based on its track record, IBM would find its
Web-only strategy difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, it's the right thing to do, but in practice it won't
work,'' he said. ``IBM's Web site is horrible. Customers find it
very difficult to order, and that just won't hold up when they are
competing with Dell and Gateway.''
</P>
<P>
   Trink Guarino, a spokeswoman for IBM's PC unit, said the company
understood that its Web site needs work.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the first quarter, it will be greatly improved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that IBM would promote Aptiva sales on its Web site
with a $20 million advertising campaign in the first three months
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Hewlett-Packard and Compaq said Tuesday that they
had no intentions of pulling their computers out of retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last four hears, the consumer business has been very
healthy for Compaq,'' said Michael Larson, the head of Compaq's
consumer unit.

MINIMED POISED FOR RISE IN PROFITS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the prognosticators are right, MiniMed will
report a 50 percent increase in its third-quarter earnings
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Lisa Doh of New York-based Brean Murray &AMP; Co. said she
expects the company will meet the 18 cents per share consensus
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock ended trading Tuesday at $75.88 per share,
up $4.13 or 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed's products under development position it for growth,
analysts believe. Doh predicts MiniMed will bring in earnings of
$1.05 per share for the year 2000 on revenues of $280 million.
</P>
<P>
   Doh predicts the recent approval by Medicare's financing
division of coverage for MiniMed's insulin pump probably won't have
a significant effect on future revenues. There simply are not
enough Type I diabetes patients who live long enough to be covered
by Medicare, Doh said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant news in that it establishes pump therapy as a
technology,'' Doh said. ``It's a well-established technology now
and a better alternative to multiple daily injections.''
</P>
<P>
   Doh said she believes the greater impact to MiniMed's sales will
occur if a consumer version of its glucose sensor is approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge market: $3billion,'' she said. ``When and if
they launch this product, I think the stock is going to really take
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MiniMed were trading in the $30 range a year ago but
Wall Street's enthusiasm over the potential of its new products
pushed shares all the way past $108 last month before investors
took profits on the run-up.

CHIEF AT COKE BOTTLER IS RETIRING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprising some analysts, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest
bottler for Coca-Cola Co., announced Tuesday that its chief
executive, Henry A. Schimberg, would retire at the end of the year,
three months earlier than expected. His replacement, for the
moment, is the company's 67-year-old chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like Paul Harvey _ we're still waiting for the rest of
the story,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a consumer products analyst for
Merrill Lynch, who called the announcement ``a major surprise.'' He
added, ``I'm not sure everyone is a happy camper about this one.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Coca-Cola Enterprises said two senior executives, John
R. Alm and Norman P. Findley, would jointly serve as principal
operating officers. Both were seen then as contenders for
Schimberg's job. Tuesday, Alm was named chief operating officer and
president, and Findley was named to a newly created position,
executive vice president for new business development. His
responsibilities had included Western Europe, where 17 million
cases of Coca-Cola products were recalled in June, costing the
bottler $103 million in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Schimberg said he was leaving early because he
felt the company was in good hands. It has ``an exceptionally deep
and strong management team who will capitalize on the vast
opportunities I see ahead of them,'' he said, adding that ``the
stock price does not currently reflect the value I see in our
business.'' The shares closed Tuesday at $22.875, up 18.75 cents
but still well off a 52-week high of $41.1975.
</P>
<P>
   Just who will lead the team eventually is unclear, although
Summerfield K. Johnston Jr., the company's chairman and its largest
individual shareholder, has the task for now.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced its third-quarter earnings Tuesday: a
17 percent rise, to 24 cents a share. Revenue rose 9 percent, to
$3.8 billion, in the quarter, reflecting higher retail prices.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT PRESENTS HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
   (With GORE-BRADLEY-DEBATES, GORE-CLINTON)

<P>
   This new 60-second television commercial, being broadcast in
Iowa and New Hampshire for the next three weeks, is a sweeping, if
quick, biography to introduce Vice President Al Gore to voters.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Century Media Group.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The commercial opens with black-and-white
photographs of a youthful Gore. He is first pictured in his Army
uniform with his late father, a former senator who was defeated in
1970 in part because of his opposition to the Vietnam War. The
sound of helicopters is heard. Next come pictures of newspaper
stories written by Gore as a reporter for The Tennesseean in
Nashville. After that is the famous photograph of the killings at
Kent State University, then the camera shows a newspaper headline
about Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial changes to live color pictures of Gore, many with
children. He is seen standing behind a lectern on the South Lawn of
the White House and is shown with his wife, Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: A male announcer says: ``He saw his father defeated
for the Senate because of his support of civil rights and gun
control. And he came home from Vietnam doubting politics could make
a difference. He studied religion at Vanderbilt. Started a family.
And worked as a reporter exposing corruption. Al Gore was only 28,
but he'd seen a lot about what could go wrong in America _ and
decided to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won a seat in Congress and became a national leader on the
environment. Stood against the tide opposing the Reagan budget
cuts. In health, education and help for the poor. As vice
president, he defied the gun lobby and cast the tie-breaking vote
to keep guns away from criminals. His cause is working families.
Improved health care for every American. Affordable prescription
drugs. Revolutionary improvements in education so our test scores
will be the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young man who decided to fight for principle is still
leading the way. Al Gore. Change that works for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The commercial attributes Gore's father's 1970 Senate
defeat to his support for civil rights and gun control. While those
were unpopular positions, the elder Gore was also criticized as
losing touch with his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Although Gore has been vice president for seven years
and ran for president in 1988, the public knows little about him
except that he has served as President Clinton's loyal lieutenant.
The campaign wants to convey a more thoughtful, multidimensional
person who is his own man. The commercial does not mention that
Gore grew up in Washington. Not to place a candidate in a
geographical context is unusual for a biography, but the Washington
boyhood would send the wrong message. So would the biggest moment
of his life: being picked as Bill Clinton's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also seeks to counter a public perception that Gore
is too cautious. It tries to supplant popular images of Gore as
understudy to Clinton with images of him as understudy to his more
principled father. It also casts the vice president as ``against
the tide'' of Reagan budget cuts and one who ``decided to fight for
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is also to reinforce a theme that Gore is making about
his rival for the Democratic nomination, former Sen. Bill Bradley,
who voted for the Reagan budget cuts and quit the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial seeks to show that Gore has served at the White
House and is ready to be president. Putting him in that context
seems a bit risky, since the image could remind viewers of Clinton,
whom the commercial never mentions.

THE CEO AS SOLO DRUMMER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Okl., Colo., Gambia)   By GERALD KEARBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerald Kearby, 52, is co-founder and chief executive of Liquid
Audio Inc., a Redwood City, Calif., provider of Internet software
for the digital delivery of music.
</P>
<P>
   I was in West Africa recently, in Gambia, taking drum lessons
from master drummers in a remote village. It was supposed to be a
fairly relaxed vacation and educational endeavor. But there I was
playing the djembe drum so intently for 12 hours a day that one
master said to me, ``I can tell you want to be the soloist.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought to myself, ``I'm the soloist at Liquid Audio, and I
want to be the soloist in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an apt metaphor. I'm type A, no matter what I do; I'm
disciplined and focused and ask my employees to be the same. On
another level, the trip is symbolic of my willingness _ desire _
not to necessarily live a typical executive life style. I'm not a
Harvard MBA, and I don't carry myself like one. I try to live by a
philosophy that we need to take our work seriously but also that we
need to be able to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: we have opportunities but also a battle on our
hands. We are in the midst of a booming digital music market _ a
potentially $50 billion market in five years _ but that size also
means the industry has attracted the big guys, like AT&AMP;T, IBM and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   I have faith we can capitalize on my experience building
previous businesses, but also my practical music experience
building sound systems and working as sound engineer for the
Grateful Dead, Jefferson Starship, Diana Ross and others in the
'70s. Even though it seems everyone in Silicon Valley is half my
age, experience has its benefits. I bring a certain calm to the
table; my employees know that we're not going to panic, and we'll
keep things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   We'll even keep the Internet in perspective. Yes, it's
revolutionizing some things, but I know basic business rules just
aren't changing, and above all that means you have to run a company
with smart, talented people.
</P>
<P>
   This is my third company, and I've learned a lot from my
mistakes. Ann Winblad at the venture capital firm Hummer Winblad
calls me a ``serial entrepreneur.'' This time I plan to get it
dead-solid perfect.
</P>
<P>
   My willingness to pursue what interests me has often served me
well. Other times, it has nearly cost me dearly. In 1966, in my
first year in college at Colorado University at Boulder, I was
focusing on my drumming, not on school. As a result, I lost my
student deferment, which I didn't even know because I was
neglecting to check my mail. I got a call from my mother. ``You've
been drafted,'' she said. Only my drum skills kept me out of the
Vietnam war; the Marine Corps let me play in their band (and, among
other things, perform at the White House).
</P>
<P>
   I suppose this dichotomous part of my personality _ the desire
to excel at the highest levels and the blue-collar sensibilities _
can be traced back to the turn of the century and to my
great-grandfathers. One of my great-grandfathers was the chief
justice of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The other worked in the same
building but as a janitor.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like the coming together of the families _ with me as
one product of that _ well, that's the American way right there.

AMGEN ON ROLL TO POST ANOTHER EARNINGS JUMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For four quarters in a row, biotechnology giant
Amgen Inc. has beaten the estimates of Wall Street analysts, and at
least one of those analysts thinks it will happen again today.
</P>
<P>
   A First Call survey of analysts puts the third-quarter earnings
estimate at 49 cents per share, but Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown
analyst Dennis Harp predicts Amgen will surpass that mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've consistently been a strong performer this year,'' said
Harp, who has set a 12-month price target of $110 per share. ``I'm
certainly optimistic that they will reach my target within the
12-month time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen stock closed up 37.5 cents Tuesday at a price of $83.94
per share, an increase of 4.19 percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
   If Amgen matches the Wall Street consensus estimate, its
earnings will have increased 16.7 percent over third quarter 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company's strong performance so far this year has been
driven by sales of its two flagship products: Epogen and Neupogen,
Harp said.
</P>
<P>
   Harp said the company has a solid pipeline of products in
development, including NESP, a successor to the anemia drug Epogen
that requires fewer doses.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the works are a rheumatoid arthritis drug, a prostate
cancer medication and a second generation version of Neupogen, all
of which show promise, Harp said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Amgen recently won a court decision allowing it to
retain all rights to marketing NESP, if it is approved. Amgen
licensed Epogen to competitor Johnson &AMP; Johnson for most medical
indications in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Johnson &AMP; Johnson reported a 54 percent sales
increase for its product, Procrit, Harp said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking like a very important market for Amgen to
enter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harp set a 2000 revenue target of $3.8 billion and an earnings
target of $2.31 per share. The following year, his target is $2.74
per share on total revenues of $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen spokesman David Kaye said sales of the company's flagship
products are the key to its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really poised to become a multiproduct company, probably
in the year 2001 or later,'' Kaye said. ``Continued growth of the
existing products is critical to be able to fuel the final clinical
development, regulatory submissions and ultimately the launch of
those products.''

ARNOLD LOOKS FOR EARLY RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One route.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Aaron Arnold will know if he can beat the odds and
return to action for the Cal State Northridge football team this
week against Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold dressed for practice Tuesday, 10 days after separating
his right shoulder. But he barely had warmed up when he was forced
to the sideline after stretching his arms for a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a shocking pain,'' Arnold said. ``My body let me
know I hadn't done that in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold, a senior who is the Big Sky Conference leader in
receptions per game (7.6), missed last weekend's game against
Sacramento State after hurting his shoulder near the end of the
Matadors' loss at Montana the week before.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was figured to be out for almost a month,
Arnold's shoulder got better and he targeted this Saturday for his
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a setback, I would be sore right now,'' said Arnold
about leaving practice early. ``I wanted to get out here as soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, said he's doubtful
anyone will know if Arnold can play this week until Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him reach for a ball and grimace in pain,'' Kearin said.
``It will be a game-day decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said he'll know he can play if he can make the catch he
couldn't make on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that out (pattern) that gave me problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rare injury: Arnold is not used to missing games. Before
watching CSUN's 36-14 win over Sacramento State from the sideline,
he had missed just one game because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold sat out the Matadors' 1997 game against Weber State with
knee and ankle problems.
</P>
<P>
   His resiliency gives Kearin hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a glimmer of optimism because it is Aaron Arnold,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Delivering: After a slow start, senior linebacker Brennen
Swanson is once again thriving in CSUN's ``rush'' position.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson has lined up almost as a fourth defensive end over the
last month, and he has 4{ sacks in his last three games.
</P>
<P>
   He is tied for fourth in the Big Sky with five sacks. He led
Division I-AA and broke a school record with 15{ sacks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get in on a lot more tackles, but that's kind of
hard at defensive end,'' said Swanson, who is fifth on the team in
tackles, with 30.
</P>
<P>
   He is on pace for nine sacks. He holds the school's
career-record with 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little more experienced,'' he said. ``I'd like to
at least get close (to last year's total).''
</P>
<P>
   __ Moving up: CSUN no longer has the conference's worst rushing
defense, and the Matadors rose out of last place against the best
rushing team in I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   After holding Sacramento State to 147 yards on the ground, the
Matadors moved past Weber State and into eighth. They're giving up
an average of 218.2 yards per game.

EDITORIAL: INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   Two recent price reports appear to signal that the hated scourge
of inflation may be on the rise. Consumer prices, the government
reported Tuesday, rose at about a 5 percent annual rate last month,
and at a 4 percent rate over the last three months _ about 50
percent faster than in the recent past. Wholesale prices did even
worse, rising at about a 10 percent rate in September and at a 7.5
percent rate for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Will rising inflation force the Federal Reserve to slam on the
monetary brakes and bring the bountiful economy to a threateningly
slow gait? Almost certainly not. Recent price spikes remain well
within the range that the Federal Reserve can handle without
punishing the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer prices have picked up because of temporary factors
limited to isolated markets. Most prominently, oil prices, after
falling steeply last year, are playing catch-up, rising at an
annual rate of about 30 percent over the past three months.
Excluding oil and food prices, consumer prices have risen by a rate
of only about 2.5 percent during the last quarter, slightly faster
than last year. Wholesale prices spiked in September after a year
of near-stability. If temporary factors keep emerging, it would be
unwise to ignore them, but for now it is unwise to hyperventilate
about such short-term aberrations.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Benjamin Friedman of Harvard, like many economists,
worries more about recent wage trends. He points to the generous
contract with the auto workers that will push up wages by 3 percent
more than inflation. Wages generally have been rising at an annual
rate of 4 percent. If productivity _ the output workers turn out in
an hour _ rises fast, employers can pay the higher wages without
raising prices. But fast-rising productivity is far from
guaranteed. Even if inflation does pick up slightly, the economy is
not doomed. The Federal Reserve has all the tools it needs to bring
modest price spikes under control.
</P>
<P>
   So if recent prices are cause for concern but not alarm, is
something worse lurking? Judging from his cryptic comments last
week, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, appears to think so. For
three years he has worried that an inflated stock market might
crash, driving investors to take cover and producing billions of
dollars of losses that could force consumers to pull back spending.
That could be a prescription for recession.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan does not worry about falling stock prices if they move
gradually. Three years ago he tried to nudge them lower by openly
wondering about ``irrational exuberance'' among investors. Then the
Dow was around 7,000. Now it is 3,000 points higher. Greenspan is
still wondering.
</P>
<P>
   There is a debate among economists whether Greenspan is correct.
A best-selling book predicts, on the basis of robust corporate
earnings and increased awareness among investors that stocks are as
safe as bonds over the long haul, that investors will drive stock
prices mightily higher, perhaps to 36,000 or beyond. Most other
economists do not agree. One recent analysis says they could drop
by a third, after inflation, over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the case, falling or rising stock prices pose no
threat to the economy as long as they move gradually. Professor
Friedman points out that the Dow has already fallen by 10 percent
or more with little impact on spending and could fall another 10
percent or 15 percent without major incident. Stock prices would
remain well above levels of several years ago. Most investors would
still feel wealthy and feel no pressure to cut purchases.

GM AND CANADIAN UNION REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Dodging a threatened strike, the General Motors Corp.
reached a tentative contract agreement Tuesday night with the
Canadian Auto Workers union that will provide generous raises to
the company's 21,000 Canadian factory workers even as it allows the
company to continue to downsize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an excellent agreement,'' said Basil E. (Buzz) Hargrove,
the union's president. ``It recognizes the contribution our workers
have made to General Motors' profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the three-year agreement, GM's Canadian workers will
receive annual raises of 3 percent above inflation. In addition,
they will receive a $1,000 (Canadian) signing bonus and an annual
holiday bonus of $1,200 (Canadian). And each year, they will
receive an additional week of paid time off each year, improved
pension benefits, a $2,000 (Canadian) child care subsidy for
children younger than 5 and an $800 (Canadian) tuition refund for
workers with children in college.
</P>
<P>
   With the agreement, the auto industry breathed a collective sigh
of relief. The Canadian labor deal with GM wrapped up this fall's
rush of negotiations between GM, the Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler AG and their American and Canadian unions. Both
unions negotiated hefty raises for the more than 450,000 auto
factory workers, sending some of the record profits the auto
industry has been earning to the pockets of its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union had threatened a strike after GM proposed
eliminating 1,300 jobs. After the strike threat, GM reversed course
and promised to invest $1.1 billion (Canadian) in various Canadian
factories to prepare them to produce new products soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the agreement will allow GM to downsize through
attrition. ``The overall employment levels will drop over the life
of the agreement, but we have added over 700 new jobs to offset the
losses,'' Hargrove said. ``We're saving lots of jobs here.''
</P>
<P>
   GM may close a Canadian factory in the fall of 2002. Workers in
St. Therese, Quebec, now build Pontiac Firebirds and Chevrolet
Camaros, but that production is scheduled to end in September 2002.
In negotiations with the union, GM agreed only to study the
feasibility of building a niche vehicle in the factory after work
on the Firebirds and Camaros ends.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hargrove said, the union decided not to strike over
the matter but to play politics. ``We're better to keep up
lobbying, to keep up the political work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian union took a different approach to a challenge
faced by the United Automobile Workers. The Canadian union agreed
to allow GM to use ``modular'' factories, in which suppliers
assemble large pieces of the vehicle, which are then shipped to
unionized assembly factories and pieced together into cars and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The American union vehemently opposed the approach, arguing that
work done by its well-paid members would be lost to lower-paying
suppliers. The Canadian union simply stipulated that if GM plans
such moves, the parts factory workers must be covered under the
labor agreement reached with the union. That would effectively
force GM to favor sending work to Delphi Automotive Systems, Inc.,
the auto parts subsidiary GM spun off in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States stored 12,000 nuclear weapons and components
in a total of at least 23 countries and five U.S. territories
during the Cold War _ including Morocco, Japan, Iceland, Puerto
Rico and Cuba _ during the Cold War, according to a new article
based on a recently declassified document.
</P>
<P>
   The document, a secret study written by the Defense Department
and entitled ``History of the Custody and Deployment of Nuclear
Weapons,'' is described in the cover story of the November/December
issue of The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. Altogether the
United States stored 38 types of nuclear weapons systems at U.S. or
allied bases abroad.
</P>
<P>
   While other declassified documents have made it clear that the
United States deployed nuclear weapons and materials overseas, the
document confirms how widespread the deployments were, and
highlights America's overriding dependence at the time on a
worldwide network of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine article emphasizes the extent to which the Pentagon
manufactured special nuclear weapons in which the plutonium or
uranium could be removed and stored elsewhere in order to evade the
issue of whether nuclear weapons or materials were stored in
countries where there was intense antinuclear fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon document fundamentally revises some aspects of
postwar nuclear history,'' said William M. Arkin, a nuclear weapons
analyst and one of the article's three co-authors. It reveals, for
example, that the first U.S. nuclear weapons placed overseas were
sent not to Britain, as many historians had believed, but to
Morocco, the site of several strategic American bases.
</P>
<P>
   However, Arkin and his co-authors caution that the declassified
study and an annex listing the countries where nuclear weapons were
placed or stored contain some errors. For instance, the annex fails
to list Portugal's Azores Islands or Libya, places where Arkin says
other declassified documents show that the Strategic Air Command
stored nuclear weapons in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The study does confirm that U.S. nuclear weapons or materials
were sent to such sensitive areas as Japan, Greenland, Iceland and
Taiwan, which have all forsworn nuclear weapons and publicly vowed
not to store them on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear items were to be kept under tight control of U.S.
forces, but the article notes that the initial controls were lax.
</P>
<P>
   Most diplomats from the countries on the list that are
considered sensitive on the subject declined to comment on the
article and the document, or on whether their governments were
aware of the presence of nuclear weapons. But Fridrik Jonsson,
first secretary of the Icelandic Embassy in Washington, said
``There is no reason to suspect that any nuclear weapons had ever
been stored in Iceland.'' Some U.S. officials also questioned
whether the United States had deployed nuclear weapons on Icelandic
territory.
</P>
<P>
   How the Pentagon document was declassified is a saga in itself.
``It has been a 16-year ordeal,'' said Arkin, who requested the
document under the Freedom of Information Act in 1983. The study
was partially declassified two years later, but most of its
annotated charts and country listings were blacked out.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin, assisted by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Washington-based nonprofit group of scientists, lawyers, and
environmentalists, appealed the deletions to the Pentagon. In 1992
and earlier this year, it declassified much of the censored
material, including the names of nine places where bombs had been
stored. But it continued to suppress the names of 18 countries on
the list, many of them sensitive to the presence of nuclear
materials on their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Because the list of countries was alphabetical, however, Arkin
and his coauthors, Robert S. Norris, of the Natural resources
Defense Council, and William Burr, a senior analyst at the National
Security Archives, a Washington-based non-profit group that serves
as an archive for declassified information, say they were able to
deduce their identities.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of nuclear weapons domestically and overseas
remains among the most sensitive of military secrets. Arkin said
his research indicated that the United States, the only country
known to have placed nuclear weapons abroad, still keeps such
weapons in at least seven places: Belgium, Greenland, Italy, the
Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth H. Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman, said that
the Clinton administration, following a policy long embraced by its
Republican and Democratic predecessors, would neither confirm nor
deny the existence of nuclear weapons on foreign soil.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that at least one of the authors' deductions about
the countries in which nuclear weapons were stored was not correct.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie H. Gelb, the president of the New York-based Council on
Foreign Relations and the State Department's director of political
military affairs between 1977 and 1979, defended the policy of what
he called ``don't ask, don't tell'' with respect to nuclear weapons
deployments. ``You make a country a target by admitting that you've
put nuclear weapons there,'' said Gelb, who wrote about strategic
and foreign affairs for The New York Times after he left the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither the deployment policy nor the issue of what to say
publicly about it was reviewed during his years in government,
added Gelb.
</P>
<P>
   Arkin said that the U.S. government did not always inform other
governments that it was placing nuclear weapons on their territory
or at their naval bases. ``The no-comment policy allowed foreign
government officials to say that they did not know,'' Arkin
asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But Gelb said he doubted that senior foreign officials had not
been informed about such nuclear movements. ``I suspect that most
of them knew,'' he said. ``Did it go to their parliaments? No, I
doubt it. But responsible officials knew that nuclear weapons were
being stored.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians, nuclear weapons analysts, and former government
officials are divided about the likely impact of the document's
declassification. Arkin predicted that the disclosures could ignite
intense political controversy in countries that are ``allergic'' to
the presence of nuclear weapons on their soil and whose governments
have forsworn their storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can also fill in many gaps in the history of the arms
race and the Cold War,'' said Norris. ``Until now, there has never
been official information on where, when and what kinds of nuclear
weapons were deployed overseas.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The document and its annex, coupled with other declassified
information obtained by the article's authors, show, for example,
that during the height of the Cold War in the 1970s, the United
States had more than 7,000 nuclear weapons in NATO countries and
more than 2,000 on land in the Pacific. Aircraft carriers,
cruisers, destroyers, frigates and attack submarines carried
another 3,000 nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Graham T. Allison, a professor at Harvard University's Kennedy
School and a co-author of ``Essence of Decision: Explaining the
Cuban Missile Crisis,'' said he had not known until he read the
version of the declassified document's annex posted Tuesday on the
web that the United States had stored non-nuclear depth charges at
its base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Donald P. Gregg, the president and chairman of the Asia Society,
who was the U.S. ambassador to South Korea between 1989 and 1993,
confirmed the article's assertion that the United States had once
sent nuclear weapons there. He had raised the issue of their
removal with South Korean leaders more than a year before President
Bush announced in 1991 that he was withdrawing all tactical nuclear
weapons deployed overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said he had concluded, and the U.S. military had agreed,
that the weapons did not enhance U.S. national security and could
have become a provocation to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My residence had just been broken into by six students angry
about beef quotas, '' he recalled. ``They tried to burn my house
down. And I thought God Almighty, if they get this mad about beef,
what will they do when they learn we have nuclear weapons here?''

EDITORIAL: THE IMPLACABLE YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said idn an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 20:
</P>
<P>
   While nearly everybody else in New York City seemed riveted by
the heart-stopping heroics at Shea Stadium, that other local ball
club, the Yankees, rolled without serious impediment to its second
straight American League pennant, its third in four years and its
36th of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why people were not jumping up and down the way
they did with the Mets. They have come to expect success of the
Yankees, a team that goes about its business in a methodical,
almost grown-up way that inspires admiration but not madness.
</P>
<P>
   In the playoffs, the Yankees began by obliterating Texas in the
first round in three straight games, then dispatched Boston in the
championship round, 4-1. But how could anyone have thought
otherwise? As the Boston faithful are the first to admit, the Red
Sox have been making life easy for the Yankees for about 80 years,
beginning with the deal that sent Babe Ruth to New York in the
winter before the 1920 season, for $100,000 in cash and a $300,000
loan. The Red Sox have not won a World Series since that fateful
transaction. The Yankees have won 24.
</P>
<P>
   The present Yankee team should be the favorite to win number 25
this year. It is essentially the same club _ minus David Wells, but
plus Roger Clemens _ that tore through the 1998 season with an
astounding 125-50 record and swept San Diego in the World Series.
This year the Yankees were not quite so dominant, but even so,
their starting pitching is solid, their hitters can kill you up and
down the lineup, and, most important of all, they have been there
before. In fact, the Yankees always seem to have been there.

MAN GOES UNDETECTED, TRAPPED IN AN ELEVATOR FOR 40 HOURS IN
ROCKEFELLER CENTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nicholas White endured a very, very long workweek.
</P>
<P>
   It began, quite typically, on a Monday and it was supposed to
end Friday at 11:24 p.m., when White, a production manager for
Business Week magazine, prepared to leave the corporate tower in
midtown Manhattan where he works.
</P>
<P>
   But fate designed for him a different sort of weekend. White,
32, spent it trapped in an office elevator for 40 hours. He was not
freed until Sunday afternoon when a building employee saw his weary
image on a security camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time that this individual was taken out of the
elevator, he repeatedly refused medical assistance and said that he
just wanted to go home,'' said Sandra Manley, a spokeswoman for the
Rockefeller Center Management Corp., which manages the building at
1221 Avenue of the Americas, between 48th and 49th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   White, who was still at home resting Tuesday, spoke about his
experience only briefly through a crack in the door of his
second-floor apartment in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little shaky,'' he said. ``Of course, I'm relieved to be
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting early news reports, he added: ``It was 40 hours,
not 34. Those last 6 count.''
</P>
<P>
   There were sharp questions and some finger-pointing Tuesday over
how White _who apparently screamed and pushed every single button
in his ample time _ went unnoticed for so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the Rockefeller Center Management Corporation to
inform us why our employee remained undetected for such an extended
period of time,'' said Steven Weiss, a spokesman for the
McGraw-Hill Companies, which owns Business Week. ``The safety of
our employees is of primary concern to us, and this was clearly an
unacceptable situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the Rockefeller Center Management Corp. said that Con
Edison was to blame and that a dip in power that night caused the
elevator to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Though the recalcitrant elevator, which starts at the lobby and
serves floors 37 through 50, has been temporarily taken out of
service, the management corporation released a statement Tuesday
that said, ``After thorough testing, we have determined that all of
the mechanical and electrical systems in the elevator are
functioning normally.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison confirmed that there was a ``voltage dip lasting
one-tenth of one second'' at 11:21 p.m. Friday. It occurred in
Millwood, in Westchester County, on three 340,000-volt power lines,
said Robert Leonard, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   However, an electrical malfunction does not explain why White _
who was stuck just above the 13th floor, no less, in a blind
elevator shaft _ was not seen on the security camera earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Manley acknowledged that the cameras may be symbolic only _
``to prevent the possibility of liability,'' she said _ and that
management was still investigating who actually monitors them.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious questions about how White coped for 40 hours without
food, water or a restroom also went unanswered. A friend of his at
Business Week, who asked not to be named, described White as a
``mild-mannered, low-key guy'' who had been disturbed by the
experience. ``He did without what they give most people in
solitary,'' the friend said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Three years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Stuart Hendley heard those words at the tender age of 17,
he thought for sure it meant the time required for him to become
the No. 1 golfer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a brash senior at Westchester High School, he was the No.
1-ranked junior player in the world. When people mentioned
then-teen-agers Jose Maria Olazabal and Scott Verplank, they
mentioned them after Hendley.
</P>
<P>
   So three years was a fair, perhaps even conservative, projection
of how long Hendley would need to groom his game at the college
level before taking the PGA Tour by storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was January 1983, and I was telling everybody I would be a
big star on the tour,'' Hendley said Tuesday. ``And they were
telling me the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years.
</P>
<P>
   He never dreamed it was how long he would be given to live after
being diagnosed with bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's 1999, and while cancer may have robbed Hendley of a
chance to predate Tiger Woods, it didn't rob him of his life. Now
34, he has laugh lines around his eyes and the sort of perspective
through those eyes that few can match.
</P>
<P>
   He is back in Houston for the first time in years to take part
in the first stage of the PGA Tour's qualifying school at the
Tradition Course at Cypresswood.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long, long 16 years since Hendley was the hottest
name in junior golf. He now lives in Lacombe, Alberta, between
Calgary and Edmonton. His wife grew up near there, and Hendley now
considers himself an adopted Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   The journey between then and now has been a wild one for
Hendley. He has, by his informal count, played 450 professional
tournaments in the past dozen years. He has visited 30 countries
trying to prove his game is worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Could he have made it on the PGA Tour in the past? Possibly,
although it was a long shot compared to the can't-miss status he
enjoyed in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Hendley looks back at the hand he was dealt not with anger or
sympathy for himself but with an appreciation for simply being
where he is now _ alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like if I hadn't had cancer, I would have been playing
all this time on the U.S. tour,'' he said. ``But then I think about
it. I wouldn't have had all these experiences and been to all the
places I've been. I wouldn't have met my wife and my best friend
(his caddie, Jay Anderson). Things have a way of working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it looked like it was going to work out for Hendley. He
was given less than a 50-50 chance of surviving for three years
after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the doctors telling me that I was going to have to
learn how to throw up,'' he said. ``They want to tell you how
serious it is. And believe me, I realize how fortunate I was to get
out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendley went to the University of Houston for three years,
constantly battling the cancer in his left leg just above the knee.
He had 16 months of chemotherapy, an operation and another year of
therapy and rehabilitation, much of which was spent on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 32-month ordeal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That limited his amateur golf career to 10 months of playing
when he was a junior at UH.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, Hendley had a clean bill of health but virtually no
golfing experience to take to the professional level. He was a
nomad in spikes until he finally won a tournament, the 1989
Manitoba Open, in a playoff over Dave Barr, who was Canada's No. 1
player at the time. The paycheck was $18,000 Canadian, which
equaled about $14,000 in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a junior, I was winning everything,'' he said. ``I was used
to winning, and that made pro golf a lot tougher. I got kicked
around pretty good until that third year when some good things
finally happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hendley has bounced around near and far to play
whatever tour happened to be operating during the brutal Canadian
winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last 13 years, I've been playing pretty much every tour
there is to play except the PGA Tour,'' he said. ``My passport got
so huge, they had to add pages to it.''
</P>
<P>
   One trip more than any other stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, I went to Calcutta, India, to play a tournament,''
Hendley said. ``I'd already been to South America and Africa and
Asia, but this was by far the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we got off the plane, there were armed guards keeping the
beggars away from us. And there were hundreds of them trying to get
to us. I was in shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took this one road to the golf course, and when we went
over a bridge there was a body stretched out on the side of the
road. It was five days before anybody moved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we got to the golf course, which was nice, there
were hundreds of people outside begging.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendley also mentioned the unforgettable aroma that comes with a
country where cows are sacred and are allowed to do what cows do
anywhere they want.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of makes a spike mark in your putting line seem
inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of things with all the traveling I did,'' he
said. ``I know I appreciate the life we have in North America a lot
more now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendley's play Tuesday in the first round of the qualifying
tournament was tepid, at best. He shot 75 on a difficult, windy day
at Cypresswood's Tradition Course. It was a middle-of-the-pack
score. He didn't shoot himself out of contention in the first
stage, which is the goal on the first day of any tournament but
particularly so in a tour qualifying event.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question he has a different attitude this week than
most of the other 70 players at this sectional stage. He wants to
advance. He wouldn't be here if that weren't the case. But he
understands all things are relative better than most of the other
players fighting the long odds on the road to the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a couple of tour schools a few years ago and got all
stressed out like it was a life-or-death thing,'' he said. ``But
I'm not going to live my life angry. I'd like to qualify. And I
won't be happy if I don't. But it's not the most important thing in
the world like I thought it was when I was young.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven years in Canada, Hendley has put together a
nice career. He does a lot of corporate outings, similar to what
PGA Tour players do in the U.S. to supplement their income. It is
admittedly a smaller amount Hendley is reimbursed than top American
pros. But in Canada, he's one of the marquee names.
</P>
<P>
   The Hendleys recently adopted a baby girl, which is one of the
reasons Hendley is trying to qualify for the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to start playing in North America more so that I
won't have to be gone from home as much,'' he said. ``In the past
seven or eight years, my wife has traveled with me pretty much
everywhere. We'd leave in October and come back for a week or so at
Christmas, then leave again until March. Now, she won't be able to
travel as much and I don't want to be gone for those long
stretches.''
</P>
<P>
   His experience with a serious illness, not to mention some
maturity that comes naturally with age, has allowed Hendley to look
back at his past with some detachment. He freely admits he was too
cocky for his own good when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   He still doesn't like to lose. No pro athlete does. But he also
never forgets the realities that come with life and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors told me that, if you can get past five years _ and
very few people do _ then you don't normally get this sort of
cancer again,'' he said. ``The people who have made it haven't had
recurrences, which I was thrilled to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendley said his own battle with cancer gave him a new
perspective on life, but it didn't have near the effect on him that
another recent brush with the disease did.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, my mother died from ovarian cancer,'' he
said. ``I was young and got better from mine. But watching my mom
go through it was the biggest impact anything has ever had on me,
by far.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Hendley has gotten deeply involved in the Children's
Cancer Research Fund, which is based in Minneapolis. But he doesn't
limit himself to that cause. He has found he can use golf as a tool
to help people who are in the same situation he was in when he was
17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro golf really is kind of a selfish sport,'' he said.
``Everybody plays for themselves most of the time. I've gotten a
lot of attention because I had cancer. But I really didn't do
anything. All I wanted to do was stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I've found that I can use golf to help some of the other
people who are having problems. That's something I take very
seriously. I want to be involved in as many of those things as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   It's something Hendley could have never envisioned himself doing
when he was on top of the world at age 17. Now, he knows, it's
something he absolutely must do.

 &HT;    Hernandez will start Series Game 1
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By putting the Boston Red Sox to sleep for a long New
England winter's nap in Game 5 of the American League Championship
Series on Monday, the New York Yankees are poised to start their
36th World Series on Saturday just the way manager Joe Torre wants
it.
</P>
<P>
   The ball goes directly into the palm and fingers of Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez, the Cuban expatriate who silenced Boston in Game
5, who is 4-0 for his career in postseason assignments, who gets
his full complement of rest, who is the Yankees' best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like 100 years ago when I saw him in spring training
of '98 and watched him throw on the side,'' Torre said. ``And I saw
that big leg kick of his and said, 'Wow, I don't know if we can do
it like that.' Then, all of a sudden to watch him grow, then see
him pitch that Game 4 he pitched against Cleveland last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then, he has dared people to beat him,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the postseason, nobody has.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is because he speaks little English, needs an
interpreter, but there remains an air of mystery surrounding El
Duque. He says he is 31. A Cuban divorce document says he is 35. He
says he fled Cuba on a small home-made raft, fighting off sharks. A
friend who fled with him said they made the trip in a luxury boat
that was air-conditioned and contained a well-stocked refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care how old he is or what kind of boat he got here
in,'' Torre said. ``We do know he had to flee his country and hide
and got to the ballpark a lot differently than other people.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Yankees signed him, they stuck him into the
starting rotation, displacing Ramiro Mendoza, who went to the
bullpen. Twice during the ALCS, including Game 4, Mendoza arrived
in the eighth innings of close games with the bases loaded and one
out and pitched the Yankees out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some kind of justice in the way that happened with
Mendoza,'' Torre said. ``Because Mendoza has taken to the bullpen
so well, and it has done us a favor because he was doing a good job
as a starter.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, El Duque, the ALCS MVP after holding the Bosox to
one run and five hits with nine strikeouts over seven innings in
Game 5, knows his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thank God and the United States of America for returning
happiness to me and my family,'' he said, to say nothing of his
$1.85 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, El Duque's half-brother, Livan Hernandez, set an
NLCS record for the Florida Marlins by striking out 15 Atlanta
Braves, then was World Series MVP against the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque was in Cuba with no way to watch because American
baseball is blacked out by Fidel Castro. While his half-brother
pitched, El Duque watched soap operas. He was banned from playing
baseball in Cuba for two years after an agent was nabbed carrying
false papers for him to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he fled on Christmas 1997, and the Yankees won an
auction for his talent.
</P>
<P>
   There is another heart-warming story involving the Yankees that
was barely mentioned recently. Torre was diagnosed with prostate
cancer during spring training and missed the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is back trying to win his third World Series in four
years.
</P>

   ``When you're going through recovery, you're not sure if you're
going to care when you get back,'' Torre said. ``And then once you
get back, well, during that time I was watching the games like a
fan. Then, I had to study myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden my stomach started hurting and I realized the
passion for the game was still there,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Torre's problems distracted the Yankees, who won 114
regular season games last year, 125 through the postseason,
including a four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres in the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   This season, they won 98 and finished only four games ahead of
the Boston in the American League East, a team they beat by 22
games in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said how bad a season we had because we didn't win
114 games again,'' said shortstop Derek Jeter, who ripped a two-run
first-inning home run in Game 5 on Monday to put the Yankees in
front for good. It also muzzled the clever Fenway Park bleacher
inhabitants who kept chanting, ``No-mar's better, No-mar's
better,'' referring to Boston's multi-talented shortstop, Nomar
Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we still had the best record in the American League and
now we've won the American League championship and now we get
another shot at the World Series,'' Jeter said.

 &HT;    Smoltz turns a sure bet into Braves' worst nightmare
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen

<P>
   ATLANTA _ After his brilliant debut in relief a week ago, John
Smoltz saw the underbelly of bullpen work Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   To say this wasn't Smoltz's night doesn't begin to describe the
horrible outing he had in relief for the Braves in his 27th
postseason appearance. He almost made you forget Mets pitcher Al
Leiter, who was chased after hitting two batters and giving up five
runs in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who hadn't pitched since his no-decision in 7 1/3
innings in Game 4 Friday, faced five batters. Brought in at the top
of the seventh inning, the winningest pitcher in postseason history
allowed four baserunners; all scored. Those four runs tied the
score at 7. The Mets moved ahead in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who uses a three-quarter delivery to relieve his elbow
pain, seemed to telegraph his moves to the Mets. Pinch-hitter Matt
Franco hit a double past Andruw Jones in center field, and scored
when Rickey Henderson doubled to left. Edgardo Alfonzo hit a long
ball to the warning track that Brian Jordan caught with his back to
the scoreboard, but Henderson had enough time to tag and go to
third. John Olerud hit a ground ball to right to drive in
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   As if that wasn't bad enough, Mike Piazza, who had been batting
.150 (3-for-20) with no extra-base hits, hit a two-run homer. And
Smoltz was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets barrage in the seventh made the Braves sorry for all
the missed scoring opportunities. They had runners on third base in
the third and fourth innings. They also left two runners on base in
the sixth, although Jose Hernandez's two-run single counteracted
the three Mets runs earlier in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also had big first innings in the 1996 NLCS, when the
Braves defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 14-0 in Game 5 and 15-0 in
Game 7. But unlike those games, when the Braves scored five and six
runs, respectively, in the first inning, the opponent never
rallied.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, 12-3 in the postseason and 6-3 in the NLCS, was the
third pitcher of the night for the Braves. Kevin Millwood went 5
1/3 innings, but was removed after giving up four hits and three
runs in the sixth. He was followed by Terry Mulholland, the
left-hander who had pitched two innings Sunday night. He walked
Roger Cedeno, but Walt Weiss got the Braves out of trouble with a
big double play. He caught a line drive by Rey Ordonez and stepped
on second base to force Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who'd been in the on-deck circle to bat in the 12th
inning of Game 5, had been sitting in the bullpen with Greg Maddux,
who also was available. In his 8 1/3 innings in the series, Smoltz
had an ERA of 2.16 and had allowed four hits and two runs, one of
those a home run to Olerud, and eight strikeouts.
