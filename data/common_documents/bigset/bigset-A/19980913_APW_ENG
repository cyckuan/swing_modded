Canada's Bessette wins cycling gold, Klim struggles in butterfly

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lyne Bessette pounced on a blunder
by Australian cyclist Anna Wilson with the finish line in sight
Sunday to burst through and win Canada's second gold medal of the
Commonwealth Games.
	   A half length ahead of Besette and New Zealand's Susy Pryde with
400 meters to go, Wilson had the lead in the 92-kilometer road race
around rainy Kuala Lumpur when her left foot slipped out of the
pedal as she prepared to charge to the line.
	   The Australian lost speed and momentum and Bessette saw her
chance. The Canadian hit the front, closely followed by the Kiwi
and Bessette crossed the line a cycle length ahead of Pryde for the
gold medal with the Australian two lengths back third.
	   All three riders were given 2 hours 24 minutes 59 seconds with
Louise Jones of Wales a distant fourth, more than 1 1/2 minutes
behind.
	   The event took place in persistent rain with thousands of local
fans, buoyed by Saturday's unexpected silver medal by Malaysian
cyclist Effandy Rosli, watching from the roadside. The medals were
presented by Prince Edward, youngest son of Queen Elizabeth II.
	   Australians, Canadians and English again dominated on the second
day of swimming with Aussie Geoff Huegill setting a Games record in
the 100-meter butterfly minutes after England's James Hickman had
done the same in an earlier heat.
	   Hickman swam 53.55 seconds to eclipse the eight-year-old mark of
53.98 by Australia's Andrew Baildon. The new record lasted barely
five minutes as Huegill swam 53.34 to beat it in the next heat.
Then another Australian, Adam Pine, became second fastest qualifier
with a 53.51 by winning the final heat.
	   But Michael Klim, second to Ian Thorpe at his world championship
distance 200 meters, produced a mediocre display behind Pine in his
heat and was only fifth fastest overall.
	   Star of the World Championship in Perth in January when he won
four golds, two silvers and a bronze, Klim has failed to reach the
same heights since.
	   Canada's Jessica Deglau led qualifying in the 200-meter
freestyle and Australia's former world champion Sam Riley was
fastest in the 200-meter breaststroke as she attempts to wipe out a
poor world championship.
	   Australia's Trent Steed qualified fastest in the men's 400-meter
individual medley while Hickman returned to win the other heat and
qualify second.
	   The finals were later Sunday when Thorpe, who went within .01 of
Giorgio Lamberti's 9-year-old world mark in the 200 freestyle final
Saturday, had another chance to break it in the first leg of the
4x200 relay.
	   Australian competitors also appeared to dominate on the shooting
range at Langkawi Island, off Malaysia's east coast.
	   Christine Trefry and Annette Woodward won the women's pairs
sport pistol and Carolyn Quigley and Kim Frazer triumphed in the
women's pairs prone sport rifle.

Asia, Europe worry that Clinton scandal may affect their countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With US-Clinton
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Across Asia and Europe people are wondering why the
U.S. president's extramarital sex life should be made so public,
and whether the crisis in Washington might affect their own
countries.
	   ``A president naked in front of the world,'' read the frontpage
headline in South Korea's Hankook Ilbo newspaper on Sunday.
	   The paper devoted five pages to U.S. President Bill Clinton's
problems, including many of the lurid descriptions of his sexual
encounters with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on his investigation.
	   Tokyo's English-language papers for a second day kept the
scandal on the front page, while Japanese language papers moved
latest developments to inside pages.
	   An editorial in the major Japanese newspaper Asahi called
Starr's report ``vivid and disgusting.'' The paper bemoaned the
damage done to the U.S. president at a time his leadership is
needed to deal with the Asian economic crisis, worldwide threats of
terrorism and economic and political strife in Russia.
	   ``President Clinton's sex scandal has none of the political
aspects of Watergate,'' the paper said, but concluded that ``if
this damages the credibility of American politics as well as the
leadership of President Clinton, it can no longer be treated as a
personal problem.''
	   In Hong Kong, the English-language daily South China Morning
Post gave the affair four pages, including commentary and excerpts
from Starr's report.
	   ``The time has come for Bill Clinton to stop apologizing and
resign himself to the fact that his fight for survival has reached
its end,'' a Post commentary said.
	   Front pages of the Chinese-language Oriental Daily News and
Apple Daily showed altered images of the president and Monica
Lewinsky in compromising poses.
	   Interest remained high in Europe too, with newspapers carrying
lengthy excerpts from the Starr reports and many stories.
	   The U.S. president ``must retain his ability to govern,'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was quoted as telling the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper. ``It is of utmost importance that the only world power
can fully take on its tasks. Asia, Africa, India _ everywhere there
are problems.''
	   In an editorial titled ``Hell is American,'' the French
center-left daily Le Monde, which ran a 16-page supplement, called
the Starr investigation a ``new McCarthyism,'' referring to the
1950's senator John McCarthy who led a campaign to expose public
figures suspected of having communist sympathies

	   In Minneapolis, Oakland's Jay Witasick, recalled from Triple-A
Edmonton on Tuesday, limited Minnesota to one run in 5 2-3 innings
of relief.
	   Witasick (1-1) took over after Tom Candiotti left following the
first inning because of a calf injury. The right-hander allowed
four hits and struck out six. Billy Taylor pitched 1 1-3 innings
for his 30th save.

Steinbach connected for Minnesota. Eric Milton (7-12) took the
loss.

Canada's Bessette wins women's 92-kilometer cycling

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Lyne Bessette, a convert
from track and field to cycling, edged New Zealand's Susy Pryde by
one bicycle length Sunday for the Commonwealth Games 92-kilometer
road race gold medal.
	   Australia's Anna Wilson had the race under control but finished
third after her left foot appeared to slip off the pedal in the
final sprint.
	   All three were timed in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 59 seconds over
roads left slippery by a light rain.
	   ``It was a great race,'' said Bessette. ``I feel wonderful. It's
a great start for the Olympics.''
	   The 23-year-old Bessette, in her first year on Canada's national
team, had been a middle distance runner for 11 years before taking
up cycling two years ago. She now is taking leave from university
to train for the 2000 Olympics.
	   Pryde just missed winning New Zealand's 100th gold medal in
Commonwealth Games history.
	   After three laps of the six-lap race, the three medalists and
Louise Jones of Wales had established a lead of three minutes over
their nearest rivals.
	   Soon after the last lap started, the top three left Jones
behind. They traded the lead back and forth until the final sprint.
	   Wilson's blunder echoed a similar disastrous Australian slip up.
Track cycling team member Shane Kelly was the favorite for the kilo
gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but his foot slipped from
the pedal at the start.
	   ``I'm not happy to have a bronze, but I'm happy to have a
medal,'' Wilson said as she fought back tears.
	   Former Olympic champion Kathy Watt failed oin her bid to win a
third consecutive Commonwealth Games gold medal. The Australian was
unable to stick with the leaders at the final bell and placed
fifth.

Moderate earthquake jolts far southern Japanese islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 5.4 struck near islands in the far south of Japan on Sunday, but
there were no reports of injuries or damage.
	   The quake was centered at a depth of 50 kilometers (31 miles)
under the ocean floor near Yonaguni island in Okinawa Prefecture
(state), the Meteorological Agency said.
	   Yonaguni is about 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) southwest of
Tokyo.
	   There was no fear of tsunami, the agency said. Tsunami are large
waves caused by undersea disturbances such as earthquakes or
volcanic activity
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Olympic champion suffers stomach illness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Olympic 1,500-meter swimming
champion Kieren Perkins has been troubled by a stomach bug ahead of
his Commonwealth Games gold medal defense.
	   Australian team doctor Brian Sando said Perkins missed training
on Friday and was suffering a viral infection.
	   Perkins, who set two of his three still-current world records at
the 1994 Games, carried Australia's flag at the opening ceremony
here.
	   ``He had a couple of days where he wasn't so good,'' Sando said.
``One of those was the flag day, but he went ahead and carried out
his duties with grace. The next day he was a bit flat but he did
some training and today he's starting to feel good again.''
	   Perkins suffered an illness just before the Australian team left
for KL.
	   ``The biggest problem we've got at the moment is that if I get
back into it too hard, too fast, I could have a relapse,'' Perkins
said after the initial illness. ``We don't want that. We're going
to try to do everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen.''
	   Perkins swam a fast 800-meter earlier this month after failing
to make Australia's team for the world titles in January. His
biggest rivals in the 1,500-meter event will be fellow Australians
Grant Hackett, the world champion, and Olympic and world silver
medalist Daniel Kowalski.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Computer glitches that
hindered Bosnia's second post-war national elections appeared
resolved Sunday, with polling stations opening after a few dozen
were closed on the first day of voting.
	   The problem was minor, affecting only 30 to 40 of the more than
2,600 polling stations when the two-day election began Saturday.
Election organizers blamed computer glitches for the lack of
voters' lists or proper ballots at the affected stations.
	   ``We have no reports of problems,'' said Nicole Szulc,
spokeswoman for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is running the vote. ``We know all the materials have
been delivered.''
	   While Szulc was unable to confirm that all polling stations
opened on time Sunday, she said any delays would be caused by
setting up, rather than missing paperwork.
	   Angry crowds gathered at some of the closed polling stations
Saturday, with one group blocking a road in northern Bosnia to
protest the delay. All dispersed when the problem was explained,
officials said.
	   Otherwise, the first day of voting was calm in the election
considered crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord,
which halted the 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic.

Canada's Bessette wins women's 92-kilometer cycling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Canadian quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Lyne Bessette, a convert
from track and field to cycling, edged New Zealand's Susy Pryde by
one bicycle length Sunday for the Commonwealth Games 92-kilometer
road race gold medal.
	   Australia's Anna Wilson had the race under control but finished
third after her left foot appeared to slip off the pedal in the
final sprint.
	   All three were timed in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 59 seconds over
roads left slippery by a light rain.
	   ``I knew I was in a good position, and I knew what to do,'' said
Bessette.
	   The 23-year-old Bessette, in her first year on Canada's national
team, had been a middle distance runner for 11 years before taking
up cycling two years ago. She now is taking leave from university
to train for the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``I still have the Olympics. My biggest dream is the Olympics,''
she said.
	   Pryde just missed winning New Zealand's 100th gold medal in
Commonwealth Games history.
	   After three laps of the six-lap race, the three medalists and
Louise Jones of Wales had established a lead of three minutes over
their nearest rivals.
	   Soon after the last lap started, the top three left Jones
behind. They traded the lead back and forth until the final sprint.
	   Wilson's blunder echoed a similar disastrous Australian slip up.
Track cycling team member Shane Kelly was the favorite for the kilo
gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but his foot slipped from
the pedal at the start.
	   ``I'm not happy to have a bronze, but I'm happy to have a
medal,'' Wilson said as she fought back tears.
	   Former Olympic champion Kathy Watt failed in her bid to win a
third consecutive Commonwealth Games gold medal. The Australian was
unable to stick with the leaders at the final bell and placed
fifth.
	   Canada's Linda Jackson took on the job of shadowing Watt and
tiring her out. She finished sixth.
	   Jackson was riding despite the pain from strained abdominal and
inner thigh muscles suffered in practice here, and may miss the
time trial event.
	   ``It's really disappointing. ... But I have won some big races
this year. You can't win them all. It's just bad luck,'' she said.
	   She said the Canadian teamwork was excellent for the road race.
	   ``The Australians were publicly saying they were going to win
the race. I think that fueled our fire.''

Editorials: Calls for Clinton resignation, Congressional caution
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Editorials calling for President Bill Clinton to resign appeared
in weekend editions of newspapers in some big cities and small
towns. Others called on Congress to carefully weigh the evidence
before reaching a conclusion.
	    &UR; The Washington Post:
	   Kenneth Starr's report to Congress on evidence of possibly
impeachable conduct by President Clinton paints a devastating
portrait of Mr. Clinton's behavior, honor, candor and respect for
the obligations and dignity of his office. The compilation is such
that Congress has no choice but to initiate an impeachment inquiry
exploring seriously both the allegations themselves and the
threshold standard for the impeachment and removal of a president.
...
	   There is ... ample evidence in Mr. Starr's report of
presidential conduct that Congress could deem grounds for
impeachment. ...
	   The decision to write the report in a form that resembles a
steamy paperback smacks of an effort to embarrass the president.
...
	   Mr. Starr's errors, however, do not save Mr. Clinton. For even
when the excesses are stripped away, the case he has presented is
serious, while Mr. Clinton's current defense is contemptible. ...
	   Mr. Clinton's behavior is at the margins of impeachability --
straddling the line that separates disqualifying crimes from
conduct that merely mars indelibly the presidential office and the
man who holds it.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette:
	   ``The copy of the Starr report in today's edition ought to come
with some mouthwash to get rid of the taste _ though nothing could.
It is not a pleasant duty to deliver the news when it's the kind
that once could safely be left to the supermarket tabs. ...
Congress is now to decide whether all this lowness amounts to high
crimes and misdemeanors. Only then will we put this behind us. As
mom used to say when she gave us the castor oil that no amount of
orange juice could disguise: ``Here. You'll feel a lot better
soon.''
	   Excerpts from editorials in Saturday and Sunday editions of
other newspapers:
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Philadelphia Inquirer:
	   Bill Clinton should resign.
	   He should resign because his repeated, reckless deceits have
dishonored his presidency beyond repair.
	   He should resign because the impeachment anguish that his lies
have invited will paralyze his administration, at a time when an
anxious world looks to the White House for surefooted leadership.
...
	   He should resign because that is his best hope to preserve
shards of sympathy and respect from the verdict of history, to
which he has devoted so much self-absorbed worry.
	   He should resign because that is the best hope for sorely needed
national catharsis.
	   He should resign because it is the honorable thing.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   San Francisco Examiner:
	   He's a liar. He's an unfaithful husband. He's tarnished the
White House. And he's the president of the United States. For the
moment at least.
	   He's also a world class actor who admitted the truth only when
he found his lies no longer worked.
	   So what else is new?
	   Voters knew most of the worst about Bill Clinton when they
elected, and re-elected, him president. A few historical notes
testifying to Clinton's lack of veracity: Gennifer Flowers, the
draft, ``Don't ask; don't tell.'' ...
	   What's good for Bill Clinton no longer counts: He abused our
trust and ripped to tatters our faith in him. As far as we're
concerned, he can swing in the wind. The institution of the
presidency deserves better than to be held hostage to Clinton's
fate, happy or sad.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Daily News of New York:
	   The task before Congress and all Americans is fundamental to our
nation and to its government. It cannot be jeopardized by raw
emotion or salacious allegation. ... The challenge for Congress is
clear: to weigh both sides in a process that is not only fair, but
appears fair. ... The American public must reserve judgment. As in
ordinary trials, the prosecution goes first, the defense follows.
Only then is the verdict rendered.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The New York Times:
	   Whatever the outcome of the resignation and the impeachment
debates, the independent counsel report by Mr. Starr is devastating
in one respect, and its historic mark will be permanent. A
president who had hoped to be remembered for the grandeur of his
social legislation will instead be remembered for the tawdriness of
his tastes and conduct and for the disrespect with which he treated
a dwelling that is a revered symbol of presidential dignity. ...
	   This page has long held a similar view of the sanctity of law,
but we grant that the magnitude, complexity and, yes, the oddness
of this case require deep deliberation.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Cincinnati Enquirer:
	   Thanks to a historic vote by Congress yesterday, all of America
has a front-row seat to view the evidence and judge President
Clinton for ourselves, based on solid evidence, not steamy
conjecture.
	   Some of the report is shocking and explicit. But Mr. Clinton
made such sickening details unavoidable by insisting his dishonest
denials of sexual contact were ``legally accurate.''
	   Mr. Clinton has had his chance to tell his side from the most
powerful pulpit in the land. He chose to lie instead. Now it's time
to hear the bitter truth.
	   Congress has given the nation a chance to see what the Starr
report has gathered and judge the President _ not by rumors,
fragments and unconfirmed leaks, but from a primary-source document
of history.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   San Francisco Chronicle:
	   It should be clear that the independent counsel's findings _
however excruciating _ are still only allegations that must now be
vetted by the House of Representatives. ...
	   In coming days, Congress and the American people will hear the
case against Clinton as well as his defense. It is imperative that
the president gets a fair hearing and receives every benefit of the
doubt.
	   But when all the evidence has been heard, the nation will be
faced with a fundamental question: Is Bill Clinton fit to be
president of the United States?
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Daily Dispatch of Douglas, Ariz.:
	   We believe the time has come for President Clinton to resign for
the good of the country. ...
	   Mr. Clinton is a philanderer and a liar. He has contributed to
an unfortunate perception that all politics is sleaze. It is not
so, and must not be allowed to be so.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Tennessean of Nashville:
	   Clearly, the issues believed to be included in the report
involve serious rules of law. Congress must make its decisions not
just on information in the report but be mindful of the context of
its broad responsibility under the Constitution.
	   The release of the Starr report, as the investigation itself, is
an historic moment for the nation. The way Congress handles the
information and the way the American people react will say much to
the world about this nation, its regard for the constitutional
process and its character.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Reporter of Lebanon, Ind.:
	   President Bill Clinton should resign.
	   It is too late for the president to make amends for his
outrageous conduct with apologies. Those apologies should have come
months ago, when it first became evident that he was embroiled in a
tawdry affair with a woman young enough to be his daughter. ...
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Chronicle-Tribune of Marion, Ind.:
	   Clinton, like Nixon a generation ago, should realize the
position he has put his country in. He should realize that the
country and the office he holds have been distracted and damaged
enough.
	   He should resign.
	   And if he does not, Congress has the duty to proceed, calmly and
rationally, with the impeachment and trial process.
	   Clinton can be forgiven for his indiscretions, and he should be.
But he must also suffer the consequences of his actions. The
country already has.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   Detroit Free Press:
	   ``There was a time not too long ago when the Bill Clinton story
was truly an inspiration _ a dirt-poor kid in Big Boy jeans from a
place called Hope who fulfilled an improbable dream to become
president of the United States.
	   Now he is truly an embarrassment _ a powerful man who cheated on
his wife with an employee less than half his age, and got caught
lying about it. ...
	   Now, Clinton should resign and go home to Arkansas, although
that is completely out of character. While we have supported many
of his policies, we cannot say we would be devastated, since his
effective days are well past gone and his judgment and veracity
will be forever suspect.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   The Deseret News of Salt Lake City:
	   The deliberations occupying the House at the moment can hardly
be considered a constitutional crisis, as some are saying. They are
instead an example of the Constitution at work. They are
necessitated by the Constitution.
	   President Clinton has asked for forgiveness, and he ought to be
granted that request freely by each American. But Congress must
decide whether his mistakes have piled up enough consequences to
disqualify him from holding office and those are two completely
separate considerations.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING correcting name of McCarthy to Joe in last para.
 &UR; With US-Clinton

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Across Asia and Europe people are wondering why the
U.S. president's extramarital sex life should be made so public,
and whether the crisis in Washington might affect their own
countries.
	   ``A president naked in front of the world,'' read the frontpage
headline in South Korea's Hankook Ilbo newspaper on Sunday.
	   The paper devoted five pages to U.S. President Bill Clinton's
problems, including many of the lurid descriptions of his sexual
encounters with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report on his investigation.
	   Tokyo's English-language papers for a second day kept the
scandal on the front page, while Japanese language papers moved
latest developments to inside pages.
	   An editorial in the major Japanese newspaper Asahi called
Starr's report ``vivid and disgusting.'' The paper bemoaned the
damage done to the U.S. president at a time his leadership is
needed to deal with the Asian economic crisis, worldwide threats of
terrorism and economic and political strife in Russia.
	   ``President Clinton's sex scandal has none of the political
aspects of Watergate,'' the paper said, but concluded that ``if
this damages the credibility of American politics as well as the
leadership of President Clinton, it can no longer be treated as a
personal problem.''
	   In Hong Kong, the English-language daily South China Morning
Post gave the affair four pages, including commentary and excerpts
from Starr's report.
	   ``The time has come for Bill Clinton to stop apologizing and
resign himself to the fact that his fight for survival has reached
its end,'' a Post commentary said.
	   Front pages of the Chinese-language Oriental Daily News and
Apple Daily showed altered images of the president and Monica
Lewinsky in compromising poses.
	   Interest remained high in Europe too, with newspapers carrying
lengthy excerpts from the Starr reports and many stories.
	   The U.S. president ``must retain his ability to govern,'' German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was quoted as telling the Bild am Sonntag
newspaper. ``It is of utmost importance that the only world power
can fully take on its tasks. Asia, Africa, India _ everywhere there
are problems.''
	   In an editorial titled ``Hell is American,'' the French
center-left daily Le Monde, which ran a 16-page supplement, called
the Starr investigation a ``new McCarthyism,'' referring to Senator
Joe McCarthy who led a bitter campaign in the 1950s to expose
public figures suspected of having communist sympathies.

Government crowds march through Phnom Penh in show of force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with violence, quotes

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Scattered violence broke out Sunday
as thousands of government supporters marched in a show of strength
aimed at intimidating opposition protesters calling for the ouster
of strongman Hun Sen.
	   After battling vastly outnumbered opposition backers for the
past two days, the pro-Hun Sen crowd spent Saturday night in the
city's main sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage
a mass peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of
bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters, many of them trucked in from surrounding
areas, said they would occupy the grounds until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out in the run-up to the first meeting of the newly
elected National Assembly.
	   The government has banned opposition rallies from the capital's
streets but allows its own backers to roam freely with clubs and
other weapons under police protection.
	   Several pro-government demonstrators Sunday wrecked a cigarette
stall after failing to catch some opposition backers they saw
jeering them.
	   ``They say they are demonstrating for peace and democracy, but
they are violent,'' said Marn Nget, 30, the owner. ``Now my goods
are destroyed. Who is going to pay for this?''
	   Later some of the crowd stoned a shop from which they claimed
someone had fired a slingshot at them.
	   About 250 opposition protesters gathered near the U.S. Embassy
and home of opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The Hun Sen
crowd passed within two blocks, but unlike previous days made no
immediate move to attack them.
	   The prince and his ally, Sam Rainsy, challenge the results of
July 26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition parties allege massive fraud and have
threatened to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form
a new government.
	   Hun Sen launched a violent crackdown to end weeks of peaceful
protests Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He was not
home and no one was hurt. He has blamed opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, who accuses Hun Sen of staging a pretext for a crackdown.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed and scores
injured after Hun Sen unleashed his police, soldiers and political
supporters at the opposition activists.
	   Human-rights workers found a body which had been floating in a
canal Sunday, but it was too early to tell what the man had died
of.
	   Truckloads of helmeted police with Kalashnikov rifles patrolled
the streets and scanned the city from rooftops. On Saturday, they
openly weighed in on the side of the Hun Sen crowd in street
battles.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's election victory.
	   But Ranariddh has said that though he wants to avoid bloodshed,
he would rather face arrest than accept a victory for Hun Sen he
says does not reflect the will of the Cambodian people.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Ranariddh said Saturday, referring to the dead Khmer
Rouge leader whose regime caused the deaths of up to 2 million
people in the 1970s.

Thailand encouraging Internet surfers to install child-porn blocker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Foreign Ministry said Sunday
that a local activist group and a German company have developed a
software program to erase child pornography from the Internet and
is encouraging local Internet providers and users to install it.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said that the program
works like a virus scanner and was developed by End Child
Prostitution in Asian Tourism, an advocacy group, and an unnamed
German firm.
	   He said Thailand's office of Interpol, the international law
enforcement agency, and ECPAT were working together to distribute
the program.
	   Kobsak said the software is capable of identifying all files on
the Internet, the world wide computer network, containing child
pornography and erasing them from the user's computer.
	   Neither ECPAT nor Interpol could be reached for comment.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Computer glitches that
hindered the first day of Bosnia's second post-war national
elections appeared resolved Sunday, and voting began calmly.
	   The problem was minor, affecting only 30 to 40 of the more than
2,600 polling stations when the two-day election began Saturday.
Election organizers blamed computers for a lack of voters' lists or
proper ballots at the affected stations.
	   ``We have no reports of problems,'' said Nicole Szulc,
spokeswoman for the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is running the vote. ``We know all the materials have
been delivered.''
	   While Szulc was unable to confirm that all polling stations
opened on time Sunday, she said any delays would be caused by
setting up, rather than missing paperwork.
	   Angry crowds gathered at some of the closed polling stations
Saturday, with one group blocking a road in northern Bosnia to
protest the delay. All dispersed when the problem was explained,
officials said.
	   Otherwise, the first day of voting was calm in an election
considered crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
The accord halted the 3 1/2-year war in the former Yugoslav
republic.

Democratic leader probes Beijing's role in market intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The leader of a major opposition party
questioned whether Beijing was behind last month's government
intervention in the Hong Kong stock market, labeling the move as
out of character for the territory's financial officials.
	   The government's decision to foray into the markets last month
was uncharacteristic of its conservative monetary management,
Martin Lee, Chairman of the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's largest
party, said Sunday in an address on government-run Radio Hong Kong.
	   ``Can anyone believe that Mr. C. H. Tung would have dared to
approve of this decision without express endorsement from Beijing,
nay, without having been told to do so?'' he asked, referring to
Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa.
	   Last month, the government spent an estimated 15 percent of its
U.S. 96.5 billion dollars of foreign reserves in a two week buying
spree aimed at driving speculators out of the market. Speculators
had been blamed for short selling the Hong Kong dollar, stock and
futures markets.
	   Short selling is the selling of borrowed stock or currency on a
bet that the value will fall before it must be returned, enabling
the investor to pocket the difference.
	   Lee admitted he had no direct evidence that Beijing had been
involved in the decision to intervene.
	   Since the government intervened, it has launched a series of
measures to strengthen the currency and tighten rules against short
selling and proposed other ways to deter speculators. The currency
has been pegged at a rate of about 7.8 to one U.S. dollar for more
than a decade, but since last October has come under pressure from
short selling, driving local interest rates up.
	   The government's foray into the markets has damaged the
reputation of Hong Kong's free markets, Lee argued, calling for an
end to intervention to restore investor confidence.
	   Many economists and analysts have criticized the government for
eroding investor confidence and creating a false market.
	   Several legislators, who were generally supportive of the move
to defend the currency, criticized the government for spending tax
payers' dollars in the stock and futures markets without first
consulting the legislature.

Criminal case opened against former St. Petersburg mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's prosecutor general has opened a criminal
case against a former mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak, the
Interfax news agency reported Sunday.
	   Sobchak, who held office from 1991-96, faces charges of bribery
and abuse of power. He was questioned last autumn about alleged
abuses by his former aides. Prosecutors warned him then that he
would formally be brought up on corruption charges, Interfax said.
	   Sobchak has been in France since undergoing heart surgery in
Paris in November. He has said repeatedly that he will not return
to Russia until the general prosecutor clears him, Interfax said.
	   A former law professor, Sobchak was one of the leaders of
Russia's reform movement in the late 1980s.
	   Russian media reports, citing law enforcement officials, have
said he was under investigation for allegedly arranging to have his
apartment upgraded and for accepting another apartment as a gift
for his niece. A real estate company allegedly received privileges
from city authorities in return.
	   Sobchak has denied the accusations.

Australia takes women's doubles gold in tenpin bowling

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Weeks of hometown hype unraveled
Sunday when Australia took the gold and Malaysia settled for silver
in the women's doubles in tenpin bowling at the Commonwealth Games.
	   For all their yelling and flag-waving, dozens of raucous
Malaysian fans couldn't push their pair to victory in the first
ever tenpin bowling contest at the 68-year-old games. The games,
held every four years, opened Friday.
	   Instead, Australia's Maxine Nable and Cara Honeychurch ignored
shouts of ``Let's Go, Malaysia'' and knocked down 3,678 pins over
eight games. In two games, their lane neighbors were Lai Kin Ngoh
and Shalin Zulkifli of Malaysia, who finished with 3,548.
	   England's Gemma Burden and Pauline Buck took the bronze with
3,273.
	   Nable was the heroine, bowling fast and spinning heavily. She
scored an average of 239.13 per game and overshadowed her more
celebrated partner.
	   Honeychurch, World Bowler of the Year in 1996, ended with a
220.63 average in the bowling center at a ritzy shopping center
with an ancient Egyptian motif in the Malaysian capital.
	   ``I didn't expect I was going to be bowling that well,'' said
Nable, who faltered in the penultimate round but recovered. ``Like
any sport, it's the best on the day, and today it was us.''
	   Malaysia's best performance came from Lai, who had an average of
228.38.
	   As games host, Malaysia was entitled to introduce a sport at
which it excels. The Southeast Asian nation came third in the world
team championships in tenpin bowling in 1997 and fourth the
previous year.
	   Many Malaysians hoped their women bowlers would collect gold,
and local newspapers have extolled the talents of the team in a
string of articles.
	   ``We had pressure on us as everybody knows greater than any
other sport, any other athlete, in the games,'' said Sid Allen, a
British-born Canadian who coaches Malaysia.
	   He said his team was unable to capitalize on a rally in the
seventh game because the surface of the oiled lane was drying out,
making the ball curve more on its path toward the pins. So the
Malaysians were forced to busy themselves with adjustments.
	   ``The ball starts hooking more,'' Allen said. ``So you've either
got to move your feet, you've got to throw it faster, you've got to
spin it more, you've got to change equipment. Which one of those
things you have to do, that's the key.''

China and Japan to begin first talks on regional crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELAINE KURTENBACH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After months of acrimony over Tokyo's faltering
economy, East Asian powers China and Japan will hold long overdue
talks Monday on how to cope with the regional financial crisis.
	   The daylong meeting between senior Chinese and Japanese
officials is the first attempt by the two countries to ease
tensions over Japan's ailing economy and weak yen and seek
constructive ways to deal with the crisis.
	   China _ once dubbed the `sick man of Asia' _ finds itself in the
enviable position of enjoying stronger growth than its wealthier
neighbor.
	   Thanks to government controls, China's currency is cushioned
from the volatility that has stricken other Asian financial
markets. Although economic growth may not reach the government's
1998 target of 8 percent, it is bound to exceed that of Japan,
where the economy has shrunk for three consecutive quarters.
	   But Japan's economic woes are deeply troubling for China. Japan
is China's largest trading partner and one of its biggest
investors. Japan's slack demand for Chinese exports is dragging
down China's economy just as state industries lay off millions of
workers to adjust to market-style reforms.
	   China has harangued Japan for months over its inability to turn
its economy and currency around, accusing Tokyo of not doing its
part to help ease the Asian crisis.
	   Chinese economists, quoted in the state-run China Daily on
Sunday, dismissed a rebound by the yen last week as short-lived. Li
Guobin of the State Information Office, a government think tank,
noted Beijing's efforts to increase public spending to revive
domestic demand and offset losses from Japan and other Asian
markets.
	   At Monday's meeting, Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Koichi
Haraguchi and Chinese Vice Foreign Trade Minister Sun Zhenyu will
lead delegations of trade and finance officials.
	   President Jiang Zemin's cancellation of an official visit to
Japan last week, because of catastrophic floods in China, has
accentuated the importance of the gathering.
	   While the two countries' economies are deeply entwined and their
influence within Asia great, they have not found ways to cooperate
over the regional crisis. Although ties have improved in recent
years, distrust lingers from Japan's brutal 1931-1945 occupation of
much of China and their aspirations for dominance in Asia.
	   China's exports to Japan fell 4.3 percent in the first half of
the year from the same period last year to dlrs 13.7 billion,
according to Chinese customs statistics. Japan's first-half foreign
direct investment in China declined 30.7 percent to dlrs 1.16
billion.
	   The lower growth in trade and investment has helped slow
economic growth to 7 percent in the first half of the year from 8.8
percent in 1997.
	   The slowdown is complicating efforts to reform state industries,
long protected under central planning, and the banks that supported
them. State banks are now swamped with bad debts, and the
government is having trouble providing jobs or welfare payments for
laid-off workers, raising the possibility of unrest.

Small boat capsizes in storm off Russian Far East coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A small boat capsized off Russia's Far East coast
during a violent storm, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
It was not known how many people were aboard.
	   Staff manning a lighthouse at Cape Alevin, near the Okhotsk Sea
port of Magadan, saw the boat go down on Saturday night. Gale-force
winds and three-meter (9-foot) waves prevented rescue helicopters
and boats from being sent to the scene overnight. Three fishing
boats were sent to the area on Sunday, ITAR-Tass said.

England, Australia take first golds at shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ England and Australia took two
golds each in the opening four events of the Commonwealth Games
shooting competition at Langkwai Sunday.
	   England's Nigel Wallace and Chris Hector won the men's pairs air
rifle event with 1,173 points, seven ahead of Malaysia's Mutalib
Abdul Razak and Mohd Emran Zakaria and 10 ahead of Scottish pair
David Rattray and Robin Law.
	   Wallace scored 590 points and Hector 583.
	   ``We were under a lot of pressure and I am even more pleased
with my score because of that,'' said Wallace. ``We put the
pressure on ourselves because we expected a lot of ourselves. Now
we have done the business I'm looking forward to collecting my
medal.''
	   Nick Baxter and Michael Gault of England won the men's pairs
free pistol gold with 1,093 points. Australians David Moore and
Bruce Quick took the silver, while the bronze went to Canada's John
Rochon and Jean Pierre Huot.
	   While England dominated the men's events, Australia won the two
women's titles.
	   Carolyn Quigley and Kim Frazer, making their first games
appearance, won the women's pairs prone sport rifle event ahead of
Canada's Christina Ashcroft and Maureen Spinney and Scotland's
Shirley McIntosh and Susan Bell. The Australia's scored 1,174
points, two ahead of the Canadians and four ahead of the Scots.
	   Christine Trefry and Annette Woodward picked up the second gold
in the women's pairs sport pistol with 1,140 points. It was
Trefry's fourth Commonwealth Games gold and Woodward's third as
they finished ahead of New Zealand's Tania Corrigan and Jocelyn
Lees by two points. Malaysians Bibiana Ng Pei Chin and Norsita
Mahmud were third.

Brisbane, Canterbury weekend winners to advance to semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Steve Renouf scored a pair of tries as
Brisbane returned to form to outclass the Melbourne Storm 30-6 in a
National Rugby League semifinal Sunday.
	   The Broncos, upset by Parramatta last weekend, led 10-2 at
halftime and scored six tries to one despite being hit 8-1 in the
penalties.
	   Fullback Darren Lockyer, hooker Phillip Lee, replacement winger
Tonie Carroll and reserve forward Kevin Campion also scored tries
for Brisbane, which finished the regular season in first place.
	   Brisbane hosts Sydney City next Saturday while Parramatta and
Canterbury clash Sunday at Sydney Football Stadium in a battle of
the 1980s superpowers. On Saturday, Canterbury beat Newcastle 28-16
in extra time to advance.
	   Melbourne led 2-0 after a 14th minute penalty by halfback Brett
Kimmorley who was flattened in the third minute by Brisbane lock
Peter Ryan.
	   Winger Matt Geyer's 76th-minute try was Melbourne's last of a
strong debut year but could not avoid being Melbourne's worst loss
for 1998.
	   Ahead 16-0 just five minutes before halftime, Newcastle's
walking wounded again ran out of steam to drop out of the
premiership race in coach Malcolm Reilly's farewell match before
returning to England.
	   Canterbury captain Darren Britt sealed the win with a
93rd-minute try and fullback Rod Silva scored four minutes later
after the teams were tied 16-16 at fulltime.
	   ``I said to the guys after the game that in my experience that
that's the gutsiest win I've ever been associated with _ as a
player or anything else,'' said Bulldogs coach Steve Folkes.
	   The winners of next weekend's semifinals play in the grand final
on Sept. 27. (djp)

Troops flown to southern province to help rescue kidnapping victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine marines have been flown
to a southern province to help rescue several kidnapping victims,
including an Italian missionary, an official said Sunday.
	   Police and soldiers were massing around a suspected Muslim rebel
hideout in Zamboanga del Norte province where they believe Italian
Rev. Luciano Benedetti was being held, officials said.
	   Local officials and Muslim religious leaders, however, were
attempting to negotiate with the suspected abductors prior to any
military action.
	   Panfilo Lacson, chief of the presidential anti-crime task force,
said a company of marines has been flown from Maguindanao province
in the southern region of Mindanao to Zamboanga to help in rescue
operations.
	   National Police Director Roberto Lastimoso said they believe the
priest was being held in a remote village in Siraway in Zamboanga
del Norte, about 70 kilometers (45 miles) north of Zamboanga City.
	   Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, was kidnapped Tuesday in
Sibuco, south of Siraway, together with 12 Filipinos. The Filipinos
were later released unharmed in a mountainous area.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for Benedetti's kidnapping,
but police suspect the involvement of members of either the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front or the Abu Sayyaf.
	   Both are Muslim rebel groups still fighting the government in an
effort to establish a separate Islamic state in the southern
Philippines.
	   Benedetti, who was assigned to the Philippines in 1977, belongs
to a missionary group called the Pontifical Institute for Foreign
Missions and is one of about 70 Italian priests assigned to the
southern Philippines.
	   Italian Embassy officials have said they would not pay if the
abductors demand ransom.
	   Lacson said they were also attempting to solve two other
abductions. Unidentified men kidnapped three Chinese businessmen in
Sitangkai in Tawi-Tawi island, further south, also last Tuesday.
	   Police said the three businessmen, who remained unidentified,
were reported to be from Hong Kong. Their kidnappers took them in a
boat to an unknown destination, police said.
	   A day later, another group of kidnappers abducted an 80-year-old
mother of a Taiwanese businessman, his wife, his daughter and their
maid in Guiwan also in Zamboanga, police said.
	   The kidnappings occurred amid a high-profile campaign against
crime by President Joseph Estrada. Kidnappings, bank robberies and
other crimes are rampant despite on and off anti-crime drives and
have led to considerable capital flight in recent years.

NEC to post loss in fiscal first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's NEC Corp. will likely post a net loss of
about 10 billion yen (dlrs 76.3 million) in the six months ending
Sept. 30, its first such loss in five years, the Nihon Keizai
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   That's down from a net profit of 35.8 billion yen (dlrs 273
million) that the electronics giant had earned the same time last
year.
	   The loss is expected due to a steep decline in computer chips
prices and sluggish sales of communications equipment, the paper
said.
	   NEC's sales for the half year are expected to fall 7 percent to
2.2 trillion yen (dlrs 16.8 billion).
	   For the full year through March 1999, net profit is almost
certain to decline, despite a forecast in May of a 33 percent rise
in consolidated net profit to 55 billion yen (dlrs 419.8 million),
the paper reported.

Commemoration of 1984 killings ends peacefully; security on alert
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A prayer service to remember the
killings by troops of Muslim protesters in Jakarta in 1984 ended
peacefully as security forces remained on alert in the capital, a
news report said Sunday.
	   A crowd of Muslim faithful prayed Saturday night at a mosque
near the site of the shootings in the poverty-ridden Tanjung Priok
port district.
	   The service took place amid renewed calls for an inquiry into
the deaths, which some claim were in the hundreds.
	   It was also held as troops and police remained deployed in
central Jakarta after days of protests against President B.J.
Habibie. Students and others want Habibie to bring food prices down
or resign as Indonesia's worst economic crisis in 30 years grinds
on.
	   The shootings took place when Habibie's autocratic predecessor,
President Suharto, was at the height of his power.
	   Suharto quit last May after 32 years in office following riots
and other student protests.
	   He was replaced by Habibie, who has promised greater human
rights and has apologized for atrocities carried out by the
military during Suharto's reign.
	   Heartened by this, families and friends of the dead, along with
pro-democracy and Muslim activists, have demanded an inquiry into
the shootings and the role of two senior generals.
	   Witnesses at the time said security forces opened fire at
demonstrators during a street march against the arrests of several
anti-government Muslim clergy.
	   Suharto's government denied claims of widespread carnage and
maintained that only 18 people were killed.
	   Commemoration organizers said an inquiry should be held so that
justice could be done.
	   ``We demand clarification about the tragedy and on how many
people were killed and where they were buried,'' the newspaper
Kompas quoted one organizer, Syarifin Moeloek, as saying.
	   A group of victims' families have demanded an investigation into
the role of retired generals Benny Murdani and Try Sutrisno, who
later served as vice presidents under Suharto.
	   Murdani was Indonesia's armed forces commander, and Sutrisno was
Jakarta's military commander at the time.
	   The newspaper Republika quoted Sutrisno as saying he was ready
to take part in an inquiry, but he denied that hundreds had been
massacred.

Sacked deputy PM continues to tell his side of sex allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Unfazed by warnings against public
rallies, Malaysia's sacked deputy prime minister resumed his
political roadshow Sunday to tell his side of an alleged sex
scandal.
	   Anwar Ibrahim drove south to the state of Malacca Sunday for an
evening rally after drawing a massive crowd of more than 30,000
people the night before in northern Malaysia.
	   It was the largest show of support yet for the ousted minister,
causing sprawling traffic jams that forced thousands to walk
several kilometers (miles) to hear Anwar's speech near the rural
town of Jitra, the birthplace and power base of his nemesis, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``This shows that the people cannot be easily deceived,'' Anwar
told reporters following his speech, which ended after midnight.
``They're convinced there's a conspiracy at the highest level.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy and finance minister Sept. 2
on allegations of sexual misconduct. But the leader has not
explained the sacking, saying only that Anwar was ``unsuitable''
for government and dismissed on ``moral'' grounds.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the allegations, which also include
leaking state secrets, and blamed his ouster on a high-level
political plot to stem his growing popularity. He is under police
investigation on eight criminal charges and could face arrest.
	   Mahathir warned Saturday that he was ready to ``take action'' if
Anwar's campaign disrupted public order. He did not say what that
action might be.
	   Political rallies in Malaysia are illegal without police
permits. An Anwar aide said a permit had been obtained from police
for Saturday night's speech.
	   Until Friday, Anwar had remained holed up in his home in the
capital Kuala Lumpur, where he gave nightly speeches to crowds of
more than 6,000 people.
	   Many said they attended the rallies to hear Anwar's side of the
story, which has received minimal coverage in the
government-controlled local media.
	   Earlier Saturday, Anwar was mobbed by some 5,000 supporters who
flooded his rural hometown Cherok Tok Kun, in the northwestern
state of Penang, where he launched his nationwide political reform
campaign that calls for more political freedoms and greater
transparency in government.
	   The weekend's speeches were Anwar's first outside the capital,
Kuala Lumpur, since his ouster.
	   Before leaving the capital on Friday, Anwar attended prayers at
a mosque, where 10,000 supporters gathered to cheer him on.

Israel on `unprecedented' alert for attacks on Oslo anniversary
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants, deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   Israeli media described the alert status as unprecedented.
	   Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
accords, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the peace
process for failing to deliver security in the streets.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   Despite his misgivings, Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to
the agreement signed by the previous Labor government. ``We are
trying to fix its damage,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said that he had, in recent meetings with U.S. peace
envoy Dennis Ross, demanded that the Palestinians smother terror
groups like Hamas as a condition for advances in the peace process.
	   Hamas has promised to retaliate against Israel for its killing
Thursday of two fugitives of the group's military wing who were
wanted for allegedly taking part in attacks on Israel and planning
others.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge bombings against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Saturday throughout the West
Bank. At least 16 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were
injured in ensuing clashes.
	   In efforts to avert a possible Hamas attack, security forces
canceled leaves for police and soldiers and troops fanned out to
cities throughout the country to protect shopping areas and bus
stops - targets of previous suicide bomb attacks.
	   Despite the threats, Ross continued in his efforts to get
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to agree on a U.S.
proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the peace talks.
	   According to the intiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
smother anti-Israeli militants.
	   Neither side reported progress in Ross' meetings, which began
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Election organizers
apologized Sunday for computer glitches that hindered Bosnia's
second post-war national elections and said the problem appeared to
be resolved.
	   A few dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations failed to
open on the first day of voting Saturday because they lacked
voters' lists.
	   Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is running the vote, said all the
needed materials had been sent to the polling stations for Sunday's
second day of balloting.
	   ``The OSCE wishes to convey to the voters our sincere apologies
for any inconveniences that yesterday's glitch caused,'' Szulc
said, adding that polling stations would stay open later than the 4
p.m. (1400 GMT) closing time Sunday if necessary.
	   She said turnout Saturday was 33-35 percent, about the expected
level.
	   Voting resumed calmly on Sunday, with few long lines at polling
stations checked throughout the country.
	   Angry crowds gathered at some of the closed polling stations
Saturday, with one group blocking a road in northern Bosnia to
protest the delay. All dispersed when the problem was explained,
officials said.
	   Otherwise, the first day of voting was calm in the election
considered crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord,
which halted the 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Under the peace plan, Bosnia is divided into two ethnic-based
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation _ with the
goal of forcing a democratic evolution in the one-time communist
territory.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   Western allies led by the United States and European Union, who
effectively run the country now under the Dayton agreement, hope
ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war lose support
this weekend and eventually fade away.
	   In the first post-war election in 1996 and a local ballot last
year, the ruling hard-line parties lost significant support among
most Bosnians.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments still remain strong and the
outcome of major races involving hard-line candidates was
uncertain.
	   A total of 83 parties and coalitions, as well as independent
candidates, are listed on the complicated ballots, with voters only
choosing leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than
2.7 million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people are registered.
	   Individual candidates are running for the three spots on the
joint presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while
parties compete for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also will choose a republic president.

Senior Iranian official survives assassination attempt

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian official in charge of a
multibillion dollar foundation survived an assassination attempt
Sunday, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Mohsen Rafiqdoust, who heads the Bonyad Mostazafan and Janbazan,
a foundation devoted to helping the poor and veterans of the
1980-88 war with Iraq, was ``in satisfactory condition'' after the
attack, the agency said.
	   It did not make clear if he had been injured or shaken up or
give any other details.
	   Rafiqdoust had been minister of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard
Corps.
	   It was the second attack on a member of the ruling establishment
in less than a month.
	   Assadollah Lajevardi, a former Iranian chief prosecutor and head
of Iran's Prisons Organization, was shot and killed by two gunmen
on Aug. 23 near his drapery shop in Tehran's grand bazaar.
	   The Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group claimed
responsibility for Lajevardi's assassination.
	   In the latest incident, IRNA said that shots were fired into
Rafiqdoust's high-rise office in northern Tehran from hilltops
nearby. IRNA said Rafiqdoust was in his office at the time but
provided no other details.
	   ``Mohsen Rafiqdoust has escaped an attempt on his life and is in
satisfactory condition,'' state-run Tehran radio reported. It, too,
gave no details.
	   There were no immediate reports of arrests in the case.
	   Rafiqdoust was a middle-class merchant who became a key official
after the 1979 Islamic revolution. He organized security for
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's return from exile to lead the
revolution.
	   He drove Khomeini from the airport to the Behesht-e-Zahra
cemetery, where the leader made his first speech.
	   Rafiqdoust later became minister of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps but was dismissed after hundreds of thousands of
dollars allocated for weapons in the 1980-88 war with Iraq went
missing. The corps is a paramilitary force whose primary mission is
protecting the Islamic revolution.
	   His dismissal followed major battlefield defeats in the war.
	   In 1989, Rafiqdoust was named head of the Mostazafan foundation,
a multibillion dollar state conglomerate originally formed by the
takeover of the ousted shah's Pahlavi Foundation.
	   It later accrued the assets of wealthy Iranians who fled or were
executed. It controls more than 100 companies involved in such
diverse activities as hotels, real estate, food processing and
household goods.
	   The foundation is controlled by Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is not accountable to anyone but him.

Report: U.S.-made chastity belts go on sale in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A local company made headlines Sunday by
announcing the sale in Asia of U.S.-made chastity belts, to be
marketed to suspicious husbands, worried parents and single women
afraid of rape.
	   ``Some people may find them useful. Perhaps there are people who
have been hunting for them and don't know how or where to get
them,'' Eudora Ong of Creatif Marketing was quoted as saying by the
Sunday Times.
	   She told the newspaper her company holds an exclusive
distribution deal for Asia and the Middle East with Access Denied,
the U.S. company that makes the belts.
	   The belts, made of rust-proof surgical steel, will be sold
through mail order only with a price tag of 1,350 Singapore dollars
(dlrs 790).
	   Local doctors and women leaders, asked by the newspaper to
comment, derided the devices as ridiculous and unhygienic. One
doctor said chastity belts were more likely to be used in various
sexual practices than for protection.

Israel on `unprecedented' alert for attacks on Oslo anniversary

	   Palestinians since have assumed self-rule in the Gaza Strip and

major provisions of Oslo have gone unimplemented amid mutual
recrimination.

Canada's Bessette wins women's 92-kilometer cycling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS controversy over Watt &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Lyne Bessette, a convert
from track and field to cycling, edged New Zealand's Susy Pryde by
one bicycle length Sunday for the Commonwealth Games 92-kilometer
road race gold medal.
	   Australia's Anna Wilson had the race under control but finished
third after her left foot appeared to slip off the pedal in the
final sprint.
	   All three were timed in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 59 seconds over
roads left slippery by a light rain.
	   ``I knew I was in a good position, and I knew what to do,'' said
Bessette.
	   The 23-year-old Bessette, in her first year on Canada's national
team, had been a middle distance runner for 11 years before taking
up cycling two years ago. She now is taking leave from university
to train for the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``I still have the Olympics. My biggest dream is the Olympics,''
she said.
	   Pryde just missed winning New Zealand's 100th gold medal in
Commonwealth Games history.
	   After three laps of the six-lap race, the three medalists and
Louise Jones of Wales had established a lead of three minutes over
their nearest rivals.
	   Soon after the last lap started, the top three left Jones
behind. They traded the lead back and forth until the final sprint.
	   Wilson's blunder echoed a similar disastrous Australian slip up.
Track cycling team member Shane Kelly was the favorite for the kilo
gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but his foot slipped from
the pedal at the start.
	   ``I'm not happy to have a bronze, but I'm happy to have a
medal,'' Wilson said as she fought back tears.
	   Former Olympic champion Kathy Watt failed in her bid to win a
third consecutive Commonwealth Games gold medal. The Australian was
unable to stick with the leaders at the final bell and placed
fifth.
	   Canada's Linda Jackson took on the job of shadowing Watt and
tiring her out. She finished sixth.
	   Jackson was riding despite the pain from strained abdominal and
inner thigh muscles suffered in practice here, and may miss the
time trial event.
	   ``It's really disappointing. ... But I have won some big races
this year. You can't win them all. It's just bad luck,'' she said.
	   She said the Canadian teamwork was excellent for the road race.
	   ``The Australians were publicly saying they were going to win
the race. I think that fueled our fire.''
	   Jackson also said, ``I think everyone saw Australia worked
really well together today, except for Kathy Watt.''
	   ``She is not a team player - I can't understand why the
Australians keep selecting her,'' Jackson added.
	   Watt's fiance, Carey Hall, called Jackson's comments sour
grapes, adding: ``Let's face it, Kathy beat Linda in the road race
four years ago in Linda's home country.''
	   Earlier, Australian women's coach James Victor said, ``Everyone
raced professionally.''
	   Watt said, ``I would have liked to have won the road race, but
with the tactics of road racing, it could go any number of ways.''

Refugees' homes burned by arsonists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Arsonists burned almost 200 homes of refugees who
had recently returned to a tense Caucasus region, and another
family home was destroyed by a grenade, the Interfax news agency
reported Sunday.
	   Attacks took place in four villages where ethnic Ingush have
been living in Northern Ossetia. They had returned to their
villages after a bloody 1992 war between Ingush and Ossetians in
which hundreds were killed and thousands more forced to flee their
homes.
	   Citing the Ingush Interior Ministry, Interfax said that
ninety-seven trailer-homes and more than 40 houses were destroyed
by fire in the village of Kurtat on Saturday, and one house in the
village of Kartsa was ruined by a grenade-launcher.
	   The North Ossetian Interior Ministry said that 54 makeshift
homes in the village of Kombileyevka and 13 homes in the village of
Dongaron had been set ablaze, Interfax said.
	   The attackers were believed to be ethnic Ossetians, seeking
vengeance for the killings of six Ossetian policemen early
Saturday. Russia's acting Deputy Interior Minister Pyotr Latyshev
was dispatched to North Ossetia on Saturday, following the police
slayings, Interfax said.
	   The slain policemen had been manning a joint Ossetian-Ingush
checkpoint.
	   Tension was high elsewhere in the Caucasus, as well.
	   Police and army troops in Dagestan have been put on high alert,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday. Four Dagestani policemen
were abducted from their patrol car late Saturday and taken to
Chechnya. No conditions have been set for their release, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Russian media speculated that the kidnapping may have been in
response to the detention on Wednesday of opposition leader Mahomed
Khachilayev, an ally of renegade Chechen field commander Salman
Raduyev. Raduyev has demanded that Khachilayev be released by
midnight Sunday; otherwise, he will exact vengeance on
``pro-Russian'' Dagestan, he warned.

Pro-government crowds march through Phnom Penh in show of force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from president of Hun Sen's party,
crowd moving from embassy.

 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Scattered violence broke out Sunday
as thousands of government supporters marched in a show of strength
aimed at intimidating opposition protesters calling for the ouster
of strongman Hun Sen.
	   After battling vastly outnumbered opposition backers for the
past two days, the pro-Hun Sen crowd spent Saturday night in the
city's main sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage
a mass peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of
bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters, many of them trucked in from surrounding
areas, said they would occupy the grounds until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out in the run-up to the first meeting of the newly
elected National Assembly.
	   The government has banned opposition rallies from the capital's
streets but allows its own backers to roam freely with clubs and
other weapons under police protection. They wrecked a cigarette
stall Sunday after failing to catch some opposition backers they
saw jeering them.
	   ``They say they are demonstrating for peace and democracy, but
they are violent,'' said Marn Nget, 30, the owner. ``Now my goods
are destroyed. Who is going to pay for this?''
	   Later, some of the crowd stoned a house from which they claimed
someone had fired a slingshot.
	   As pro-government crowds ran loose, the president of Hun Sen's
ruling Cambodian People's Party, Chea Sim, asked people to
immediately stop all demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.
	   Chea Sim accused the opposition of looking to ``fan the fire of
hatred to create new crises.''
	   In the morning, about 250 opposition protesters gathered near
the U.S. Embassy and home of opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh. The Hun Sen crowd passed within two blocks but unlike
previous days made no immediate move to attack them.
	   But opposition supporters started marching away from the embassy
area in mid-afternoon, setting off the possibility of new clashes.
	   The prince and his ally, Sam Rainsy, challenge the results of
July 26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition parties allege massive fraud and have
threatened to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form
a new government.
	   Hun Sen launched a violent crackdown on Monday to end weeks of
peaceful protests after grenades were thrown at his house. He was
not home and no one was hurt. He has blamed opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, who accuses Hun Sen of staging the attack as a pretext for
a crackdown.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed and scores
injured after Hun Sen unleashed his police, soldiers and political
supporters at the opposition activists. Scores have been injured.
	   Human-rights workers found a body floating in a canal Sunday,
but it was too early to tell what the man had died of.
	   Truckloads of helmeted police with Kalashnikov rifles patrolled
the streets and scanned the city from rooftops. On Saturday, they
openly weighed in on the side of the Hun Sen crowd in street
battles.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's election victory.
	   But Ranariddh has said that while he wants to avoid bloodshed,
he would rather face arrest than accept a victory for Hun Sen he
says does not reflect the will of the Cambodian people.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Ranariddh said Saturday, referring to the dead Khmer
Rouge leader whose regime is blamed for murdering up to 2 million
people in the 1970s.

Eight-month old Saudi septuplets finally go home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Eight-month old Saudi
septuplets finally left the hospital after their parents' fears
that they couldn't care for the babies were eased, hospital
officials in southern Saudi Arabia said Sunday.
	   A good-bye party for the four boys and three girls was held
Saturday at the Abha Maternity Hospital, where they were born.
	   They then were transported home in an ambulance accompanied by
seven nurses, hospital director Abdullah Aoun told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview.
	   The party was attended by the nurses and doctors who cared for
the babies during their hospital stay as well as Health Ministry
officials, Aoun said.
	   The infants were in very good health and weighed between 5 kilos
(11 pounds) and 7.5 kilos (16.5 pounds) when they were discharged,
Aoun said.
	   The father, Abdullah al-Summan, gave a short speech thanking the
hospital for taking care of his children for so long. He also
thanked the Saudi royal family, including King Fahd and Crown
Prince Abdullah, for their financial help.
	   The babies were ready to leave the hospital six months ago, but
their parents feared they couldn't afford to care for them. Their
mother, Hasna Mohammed Humair, said she wanted help before bringing
them home.
	   The couple, who already have five children at home, then
received dlrs 213,000 in gifts from Saudi royalty and hired two
Indonesian nannies.
	   Al-Summan, a retired civil defense employee, receives a dlrs
1,066 monthly pension and drives a cab to earn extra money.
	   He had considered leaving the babies at the hospital till they
were a year old, but Humair, 41, said she was was finding it hard
to go twice a day to the hospital to visit the babies and help feed
them.
	   Now that they're home, she's not getting a lot of rest either.
	   ``By the time we put three of them to sleep, change and feed the
other four, the first three get up and need to be fed and
changed,'' she said from her home in Abha. ``Then it starts all
over again. I was only able to doze off a couple of times in a
chair in their room.''
	   The situation of the Saudi septuplets, born Jan. 14, is far
different from that of the world's other set of surviving
septuplets, born last November to Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey of
Carlisle, Iowa.
	   After the McCaughey babies were born, they were showered with
help. Corporations rushed to pledge or donate everything from free
groceries to car seats, diapers and college scholarships.
	   The McCaugheys also had as many as 60 volunteers working in
shifts at their home to help feed and care for their babies.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A small boat capsized off Russia's Far East coast
during a violent storm, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
	   Three people were believed to be aboard the vessel, which was
probably a fishing boat, the NTV television station reported.
	   Staff manning a lighthouse at Cape Alevin, near the Okhotsk Sea
port of Magadan, saw the boat go down on Saturday night. Gale-force
winds and three-meter (9-foot) waves prevented rescue helicopters
and boats from being sent to the scene overnight. Three fishing
boats were sent to the area on Sunday, ITAR-Tass said.

	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man was executed in the northern town of
Taez for murder, al-Jomhuriya newspaper reported Sunday.
	   It said Abdo Saeed Aqlan was executed by firing squad Thursday

	   Aqlan was convicted of murdering Hattan Abdullah Saeed in August
1996, the paper said. It gave no details of the crime.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian

Newspaper: Leeson could be freed in days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A rogue securities trader blamed for the 1995
collapse of Britain's oldest merchant bank could be freed from jail
in Singapore within days, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Sunday Business quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in
Singapore as saying Nick Leeson, 31, who is suffering from bowel
cancer, is awaiting approval from the island's head of state,
President Ong Teng Cheong, to be released from Changi jail on
compassionate grounds.
	   Leeson, sentenced in 1996 to 6 1/2 years for fraud and forgery
that led to the collapse of Barings Bank, is likely to return to
Britain immediately, the newspaper said.
	   ''His application for release has reached quite a critical
stage,'' Sunday Business quoted an unidentified Singapore official
as saying.
	   Sunday Business quoted his London lawyer, Stephen Pollard, as
saying he has been told Leeson is likely to be released soon, but
has not been given a date.
	   Leeson was returned to jail from Changi hospital last week, a
month after undergoing surgery to remove a tumor from his colon.
	   Barings collapsed after Leeson made millions of dollars in
unauthorized futures deals from his base in Singapore.

Israel on `unprecedented' security alert on Oslo anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants, deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   Israeli media said the alert status was unprecedented.
	   Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
accords, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the peace
process for not preventing terrorist attacks.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   Despite these misgivings, Netanyahu reaffirmed his commitment to
the agreement signed by the previous Labor government. ``We are
trying to fix its damage,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he had, in recent meetings with U.S. peace envoy
Dennis Ross, demanded the Palestinians suppress terror groups like
Hamas as a condition for advancing the peace process.
	   Hamas has promised to retaliate against Israel for its killing
Thursday of two fugitives of the group's military wing who were
wanted for their alleged involvement in attacks against Israel.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge bombings against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Saturday throughout the West
Bank. At least 16 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were
injured in ensuing clashes.
	   In efforts to avert a possible Hamas attack, security forces
canceled leaves for police and soldiers and troops fanned out to
cities throughout the country to protect shopping areas and bus
stops _ targets of previous suicide bomb attacks.
	   Despite the threats, Ross continued in his efforts to get
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to agree on a U.S.
proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the peace talks.
	   According to the intiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
smother anti-Israeli militants.
	   Neither side has reported any progress in Ross' meetings, which
began Wednesday.
	   Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 13, 1993
signing of the first Oslo peace accord between Israel and the
Palestinians, which set a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy.
	   Since the signing, Palestinians have assumed self-rule in the
Gaza Strip and now control large towns in the West Bank, but other
major provisions of Oslo have not been implemented amid mutual
recriminations.

South Africans need improvement says skipper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with later results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ South African cricket captain
Shaun Pollock admitted his team must improve its batting to feature
in the Commonwealth Games medals after another laborious
performance Sunday.
	   For the second match running, South Africa's batsmen were made
to look second rate by non-test playing teams as they ground out a
five-wicket victory over Bangladesh.
	   The win came after Pollock rescued his team from a tight
position against Northern Ireland earlier in the competition.
	   ``The batters haven't played very well, we're disappointed,''
Pollock said. ``Hopefully we can find some form _ if we're to have
any chance of the medals we've got to somehow get things going.''
	   South Africa faces Barbados in its next match and that result
will determine which team advances to the semifinals.
	   The team's bowlers are doing the job on helpful wickets and they
bowled out Bangladesh for 79 in 38.4 overs Sunday.
	   Pollock took a wicket with the first ball of the match and
claimed 1-11 off eight overs. Allrounder Jacques Kallis was the
best of the bowlers with 3-13 off seven overs.
	   New Zealand kept on course for a place in the semis by posting
an impressive 278 for six in 50 overs against Scotland.
	   Captain Stephen Fleming scored 102 and Adam Parore added 87.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry crowds marched on government
buildings Sunday, firing weapons in the air and hurling stones at
police to protest the assassination of a leading Albanian
opposition lawmaker.
	   Troops fired over the heads of the protesters trying to disperse
them. It was unclear how many people were injured. But the
atmosphere in this southern Balkan capital was tense.
	   The protesters set fire to three government cars parked in front
of Prime Minister Fatos Nano's office and shouted slogans demanding
his resignation. Stones and bullets shattered some of the windows

Events pick up pace, but so do problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Competition in most events picked
up pace Sunday, but so did problems at arenas where thousands of
athletes from 70 nations vied for Commonwealth Games medals.
	   As Malaysia's games organizers struggled with the complaints,
their Olympic host aspirations, voiced enthusiastically this week,
seemed a distant dream.
	   The first medal came from the cycling road race Saturday, and
with it came unforeseen challenges for the organizers.
	   Riders complained about slow tire changes, and there were no
television screens and few updates for fans at the start-finish
line.
	   Journalists covering the race, bunched together to watch the
outer portions of the course on a single small television, grumbled
about the lack of facilities, including a scarcity of phone lines
and the absence of food at the venue during the five-hour event.
	   Cycling reporters sent off a letter of protest to organizing
committee Sukom. Sukom's fax was running hot with complaints from
the swimming as well.
	   Swimming continued to be dogged by problems Sunday, failing to
start on time for the third consecutive session.
	   Citing technical troubles, the organizers held up the first
event for 45 minutes after the scheduled 9:02 a.m. starting time.
	   New Zealand swim coach Mark Bone said the delay had affected
some of his team, who had their race preparation thrown into
confusion.
	   Bone was also critical of drug testing procedures following the
Saturday night session.
	   New Zealand 200-meter freestyle swimmer Trent Bray had emerged
from his swim and warmed down, and was about to return to the
village before being informed he was required for a test.
	   ``If you're being drug tested you're meant to be notified
immediately after your swim,'' Bone said. ``The biggest problem for
Trent was that he wasn't able to rehydrate (drink) and as a
consequence he was sitting around until pretty late trying to go
through with the test.''
	   Bone was pleased random drug testing was being carried out, but
said it had to follow international protocol.
	   ``They could have easily missed Trent, and theoretically if
anyone was using drugs they could easily have got away in that
situation,'' Bone said. ``We have to get procedures right because
we want to make sure nobody slips through the net.''
	   The snafus at the pool involved the press too.
	   The official result for the 200-meter final was more than 30
minutes late because of the malfunctioning scoreboard.
	   Stadium officials turned out the lights and locked the doors
after the night's racing, trapping the swimming writer for the
London newspaper The Times. The reporter stumbled around in the
dark for about 15 minutes before he found a way out.
	   At the lawn bowling venue, sports managers were faced with
grumpy volunteers demanding allowances and perks promised to them.
	   Malaysian Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin conceded Sunday that
there were organizational problems with lawn bowling, a new
Commonwealth sport. ``Several issues arose yesterday,'' he told
reporters.
	   He said volunteers working at the event had listed their
complaints about payment of allowances, attire and transportation
to him.
	   On the cricket fields, problems remained with scoreboards and
screens.
	   The giant sightscreens, placed behind the bowlers, aren't
mounted on rails. As a result, coasters are bogged down in the
slush, making it difficult for groundsmen to move them.
	   There have been complaints about the pitches. At the grounds,
exposed for the first time to international cricket, bowlers are
finding it difficult to get pace off the pitch, and batsmen are
plagued by unpredictable bounce.
	   ``The pitches are soggy and the bounce is uneven,'' griped
Indian skipper Ajay Jadeja. ``These are not really international
class pitches.''
	   Meanwhile, the games' host website has been short on
information. Results aren't appearing and athlete biographies are
cursory.
	   And the results service at the rugby was also a mess, with the
wrong scorers given out all through Saturday's opening day. Rugby's
most famous player, Jonah Lomu, scored two tries in a victory
against Sri Lanka but the organizers were oblivious, crediting one
of his teammates.

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs with polls open, and number of eligible
voters. Lead with Stoiber voting expected by 1200 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Nursing a stein of beer in the Ratskeller
under Munich's neo-Gothic town hall, Benedict Weeger is the picture
of Bavaria: lederhosen, embroidered white shirt and green felt
vest, even a feathered felt hat.
	   The 72-year-old retired construction worker votes like a typical
Bavarian too. Polls opened Sunday morning for the state elections,
and Weeger intended to cast his ballot for the archconservative
Christian Social Union, which has governed Bavaria since 1962.
	   And he will again two weeks later in the national election.
``The CSU is the only party for me,'' he says with pride.
	   But not all voters in this tradition-loving state appear to feel
so loyal this time, and the result could spell bad news for
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's underdog re-election bid.
	   Polls show the CSU, part of Kohl's three-party coalition
government in Bonn, has to worry about making it over the 50
percent mark in a state vote for the first time in decades.
	   After scoring 52.8 percent in 1994, the worst showing in years,
the party's lead candidate, Gov. Edmund Stoiber, says a good result
Sunday would be over 50 percent.
	   That, Stoiber says, will keep his position secure in Munich and
give Kohl a ``hail Mary pass'' to help him catch up to his flashy
Social Democratic challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, who holds a steady
lead in the polls.
	   Anything less, though, could take whatever wind is left out of
Kohl's sails just two weeks before the Sept. 27 national vote.
	   An estimated 8.8 million voters were eligible to cast ballots
before polls close at 6 p.m. (1600 gmt).
	   Yet even a good showing for the CSU Sunday does not mean Kohl
can rest easy. Polls show many Bavarians planning to vote for
Stoiber are nevertheless disenchanted with Kohl, in office for 16
years.
	   Jutta, a Munich teacher who didn't want to give her last name,
likes the straight-talking Stoiber but gets passionately angry with
the ``wishy-washy'' politics in Bonn.
	   ``I'm a critical CSU fan,'' she says.
	   Complaining about Germany's high unemployment, rising crime and
other problems, pensioner Klaus Meyer can only shake his head.
``The other parties must be able to do it better.''
	   Schroeder's popular appeal to create a ``new center'' seems to
be helping his long-suffering Bavarian comrades as well.
	   Polls show the Bavarian Social Democrats coming in at about 34
percent _ which would be a gain of four percentage points over 1994
and cause for celebration in their camp.
	   But they're not the only ones chipping away at the CSU's base.
	   Several tiny conservative parties are running, including the
far-right Republicans, who are campaigning against foreigners and
European integration.

Memoirs of Singapore founder critical of Malaysian leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In excerpts of his memoirs leaked to the press
Sunday, the founder of modern Singapore blames corruption and lax
morals by Malaysia's leaders for ending the countries' brief-lived
political union in the 1960s, a charge that may further poison
already tense relations between the two neighbors.
	   In the memoirs due to go on sale later this week, Lee Kuan Yew,
75, the revered patriarch who ruled Singapore as prime minister for
31 years, looks back at the island nation's turbulent beginning in
Singapore's publishing event of the year.
	   Excerpts were printed in the government-controlled Sunday Times
newspaper.
	   Lee's memoirs take on extra significance because of a series of
recent financial and political tussles between glittering Singapore
and economically faltering Malaysia.
	   After becoming the first prime minister of independent Singapore
in 1959, Lee championed a merger with neighboring Malaysia, viewing
it as an escape from communist threats.
	   Lee has admitted he counts the failure of the 23-month-long
merger, which ended in 1965, as his biggest political regret.
	   Singapore's ``leaders were not like politicians in Malaya.
Singapore ministers were not pleasure-loving, nor did they seek to
enrich themselves,'' Lee writes in the new book, called ``The
Singapore Story.'' At that time, the neighboring land was called
Malaya.
	   Lee also brought up an attempt by Malaysians to bribe one of his
colleagues and recalled how on one occasion he had accompanied then
Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman and others to a men's
club in Kuala Lumpur where ``attractive call girls and even
starlets were available.''
	   Lee said he ate and played poker with his hosts but left ``as
soon as the girls arrived.''
	   Ironically, it was only after Malaysia kicked out Singapore,
accusing Lee and other Singapore leaders of meddling in the rest of
the federation, that Lee's real triumph began.
	   Prime minister from 1959 to 1990, Lee is credited with almost
single-handedly transforming a poor, malaria-ridden island into an
economic powerhouse and a model of incorruptibility and racial and
social harmony.
	   In 1990, Lee voluntarily stepped down and took the post of
senior minister without portfolio, but he continues to wield
enormous influence over this island nation of 3.1 million.
	   In his memoirs Lee also recalled a famous incident on Aug. 9,
1965, when he broke down in front of TV cameras while announcing
the end of union with Malaysia.
	   Lee said he had wanted the break-down part edited out: ``Among
Chinese, it is unbecoming to exhibit such a lack of manliness.''
But ultimately he was advised against it by the then head of
Singapore's radio and TV.
	   The publication of Lee's memoirs coincides with another tense
episode between predominantly Chinese Singapore and
Muslim-dominated Malaysia.
	   A recent spat over Singapore's shifting of a railroad border
post has been followed by mudslinging between the two countries'
officials and press.
	   All that revived the sensitive issue of water. Under agreements
set forth in two treaties, about half of the water consumed daily
by Singaporeans comes from Malaysia. Malaysians have hinted water
supplies could be turned off if disagreements deepen.
	   Lee said that a similar ploy was considered by Malaysia a
generation ago during the wrenching end of the union.
	   According to Lee, then-Prime Minister Tunku told the British
high commissioner that ``if Singapore's foreign policy is
prejudicial to Malaysia's interests, we could always bring pressure
to bear on them by threatening to turn off the water in Johor.''
	   ``My Story'' will be launched Wednesday in English and Chinese
by Simon and Schuster Asia, Singapore Press Holdings and Times
Publishing. Singapore Press Holdings owns the Sunday Times, which
published the first excerpts of Lee's eagerly awaited book.

Russia offers to transport Turkmen oil on tankers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has offered to transport about 2 million
tons of oil annually from the former Soviet republic of
Turkmenistan to Europe using tankers and two Russian ports, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Alexander Lugovets, the acting first deputy transport minister
and head of the Rosmorflot Merchant Marine Service, said that
Russia's Caspian Sea port of Makhachkala would soon be upgraded to
allow it to receive up to 6 million tons of oil, and ultimately 12
million tons, per year. He also said the Black Sea port of Tuapse
would be used for oil transport, Interfax said.
	   Lugovets said that Russia's biggest competitor in oil transport
by tankers through the Caspian Sea would be Azerbaijan.
	   Yet ``however impressive other projects may be, Russia today has
real and inexpensive routes of oil transport, including the
transport of Turkmen oil,'' he was quoted as saying.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters calling for
the ouster of strongman Hun Sen braved a heavy clampdown Sunday and
marched through the capital to cheers from Phnom Penh's citizens,
who threw them food and honked car horns in support.
	   The enthusiastic response contrasted with indifference and
muttered insults given a larger crowd of Hun Sen supporters, nearly
all of them carrying clubs, iron bars and other weapons, who
paraded through the city earlier in an intimidating show of
strength.
	   Opposition supporters, attacked by police and mobs of armed
supporters of Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party in the week-long
crackdown, set out about 200 strong Sunday afternoon from the U.S.
Embassy and opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh's house.
	   By the time they reached the city's main market, the numbers had
swelled to some 2,000. No police or ruling party backers
immediately confronted them.
	   ``The support for real democracy in Cambodia is growing and
growing,'' said Un Kim Huot, 27, an English teacher. ``During the
CPP demonstrations, you saw no support from the people. Look at
them now. But we need support from the United States, the father of
democracy.''
	   Earlier, scattered violence broke out as the pro-government
group poured through the city. Many had been trucked in over the
past few days from Hun Sen strongholds around Phnom Penh.
	   About 8,000 of them spent Saturday night in the city's main
sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage a mass
peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters said they would stay until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out until the first meeting of the new National
Assembly. But by mid-afternoon, most had cleared out and several
trucks were seen leaving the city.
	   The government has banned opposition rallies but allowed its own
armed backers to roam freely police protection. They wrecked a
cigarette stall Sunday after failing to catch some opposition
backers they saw jeering them.
	   ``They say they are demonstrating for peace and democracy, but
they are violent,'' said Marn Nget, 30, the owner. ``Now my goods
are destroyed. Who is going to pay for this?''
	   Later, some of the crowd stoned a house from which they claimed
someone had fired a slingshot.
	   As pro-government crowds ran loose, the president of Hun Sen's
ruling Cambodian People's Party, Chea Sim, asked people to
immediately stop all demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.
	   Chea Sim accused the opposition of looking to ``fan the fire of
hatred to create new crises.''
	   Ranariddh and his ally, Sam Rainsy, challenge the results of
July 26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition parties allege massive fraud and have
threatened to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form
a new government.
	   Hun Sen launched a violent crackdown to end weeks of peaceful
protests Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He was not
home and no one was hurt. He has blamed Sam Rainsy, who accuses Hun
Sen of staging the attack as a pretext for a crackdown.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed and scores
injured after Hun Sen unleashed his police, soldiers and political
supporters at the opposition activists. Scores have been injured.
	   Human-rights workers found a body that had been floating in a
canal Sunday, but it was too early to tell what the man had died
of.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's election victory.
	   But Ranariddh has said that though he wants to avoid bloodshed,
he would rather face arrest than accept a victory for Hun Sen he
says does not reflect the will of the Cambodian people.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Ranariddh said Saturday, referring to the dead Khmer
Rouge leader whose regime caused the deaths of up to 2 million
people in the 1970s.

Gunfire in Albanian capital as crowds protest killing of top

 &UR; UPDATES with details of violence, unrest. background

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry crowds marched on government
buildings in the Albanian capital on Sunday, firing weapons in the
air and hurling stones at police to protest the assassination of a
top opposition lawmaker.
	   Troops fired over the heads of the protesters trying to disperse
them. It was unclear how many people were injured. But the
atmosphere in this southern Balkan capital was tense.
	   The protesters torched three government cars in front of Prime
Minister Fatos Nano's office and shouted demands for his
resignation. Stones and bullets shattered some of the windows on
the fourth floor of the government building which includes Nano's
office.
	   A few of the protesters managed to enter the prime minister's
building. Witness could hear volleys of gunfire inside.
	   Explosions from the gasoline tanks of burning cars echoed
through the streets of this former Communist capital, and the
ground floor of the building, which includes Nano's office and
Cabinet meeting rooms, was in flames.
	   Officials said the Cabinet was meeting at the time of the
attack, but members had scurried out the back door to safety.
	   The estimated 1,500 people were responding to a call by
opposition leader Sali Berisha, the former president, to protest
Saturday's assassination of Azem Hajdari, a deputy of the
opposition Democratic Party.
	   Hajdari was hit by shots fired from two parked cars as he left
party headquarters, police said. He died shortly thereafter in a
nearby hospital.
	   One of Hajdari's two bodyguards also was killed, police said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Berisha
blamed Nano's party. The former president, in a statement Sunday,
gave Nano 24 hours to resign or the opposition would use ``all
means'' to force him out.
	   Nearly a year ago, Hajdari was shot and badly wounded in
Parliament by a rival legislator, who was later convicted of
attempted murder and sentenced to 11 years in jail.
	   The shooting was likely to inflame tensions in already-unstable
Albania, where Berisha's Democratic Party has tried to organize
mass resistance against the Socialist Party government that
replaced it last year.
	   After Hajdari was shot on Sept. 18, 1997, the Democratic Party
ordered days of protests against Nano and his Socialist-led
government, accusing it of masterminding the attack.
	   Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has barely
recovered from last year's nationwide riots which exploded after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many people
their life savings.
	   During the riots, mobs looted military armories, seizing more
than one million weapons, some of which ended up in the hands of
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence for neighboring
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Last week, the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged the Albanian government to take
measures to protect its armories in the face of rising political
tensions.

Osanai captures first career victory in Suntory Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INZAI, Japan (AP) _ Mamoru Osanai shot a 2-under-par 69 Sunday
and captured his first career victory by three strokes in the 100
million yen (dlrs 740,000) Suntory Open.
	   Osanai, a two-stroke leader overnight, birdied the second and
third holes and seemed heading for an easy win before he bogeyed
four straight holes from No. 4.
	   Osanai birdied the 10th but was tied for the lead at 7-under by
Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who sank his fifth birdie of the day on
the 13th. Osanai, playing in the last group, parred the 12th at
that moment.
	   Osanai vowed not to back off and quickly regained his swing and
rhythm. He birdied the 14th, 16th and 17th holes en route to a
10-under 274 total.
	   Ozaki, Japan's winningest golfer with 108 professional
victories, finished the round with a 67 for 7-under 277.
	   The victory, 28-year-old Osanai's first in three years on the
tour, was worth 18 million yen (dlrs 133,000). It compares to his
earnings of 5 million yen (37,000) for the whole 1997 season.
	   ``I'm happy. I can't think of anything that would be nicer than
this victory,'' said Osanai. ``And I'm glad that I beat Jumbo for
this once.''
	   The 51-year-old Jumbo, the eldest of three Ozaki brothers on the
Japan tour, coaches a score of golfers in his off-season class
called ``Jumbo's Army.'' Osanai is a member of the class.
	   Osanai said he had never outscored Jumbo before, even in
practice rounds. ``When Jumbo tied me, I somehow felt relaxed. I
think it apparently helped relieve me from pressure.''
	   Osanai has had no exempt status on the tour. He entered the
Suntory Open as a qualifier in a Japan PGA qualifying tournament.
He now is eligible to all tournaments the rest of the season and in
the 1999 season.
	   Nobumitsu Yuhara shot a 67 and shared third at 278 with Kazuhiko
Hosokawa and Hideki Kase. Hosokawa fired a 70 and Kase a 71.
	   U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen shot a 68 to place sixth at 279.
	   ``I had solid tee shots but I wasn't hitting the ball close,''
said Janzen, of Orlando, Florida. ``Iron play is very important on
a tough course like this.''
	   ``I'll seek my first victory in Japan next week,'' Janzen said,
referring to the ANA Open to be held in Sapporo on the northernmost
main island of Hokkaido.

Somali gunmen free Italian nun

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ An Italian nun abducted by Somali
gunmen was freed unharmed from three days in captivity, under
pressure from the women and children she served at a hospital.
	   Sister Marsa was released late Saturday after clan leaders
yielded to public demands and ordered the house in south Mogadishu
where she was being held surrounded by battlewagons.
	   The abductors fired on those campaigning for the nun's release,
but surrendered to Eyr subbclan leaders at dusk. No injuries were
reported.
	   Sister Marsa was kidnapped by gunmen apparently hired by an
accountant under scrutiny for financial misdealings at the SOS
charity hospital where she worked, sources said.
	   SOS officials made no comment.
	   Aid workers and foreigners have been kidnapped in Somalia by
militiamen eager to make easy money or to press a point since the
country disintegrated into a fiefdom of clans following the ouster
of late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.
	   Unusually in this case, the public pressed for Sister Marsa's
release. Politicians from various factions rallied to their cause.
	   The SOS hospital is the main provider of maternity and child
health care in Mogadishu, serving Somalis without charge. Hospital
staff quit working Thursday to protest the abduction. It was not
clear when the hospital would reopen.
	   Clan elders did not say what action, if any, they would take
against Sister Marsa's abductors.

Takanohana wins opening bout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana, seeking his
20th tournament title, threw down komusubi (junior champion second
class) Musoyama on Sunday, opening day of the Autumn Grand Sumo
tournament.
	   Yokozunas Akebono and Wakanohana and ozekis (champions)
Musashimaru and Takanonami also won their opening bouts in the
15-day tournament.
	   Wrestling before more than 11,000 spectators, including Crown
Prince Naruhito and his wife Masako, the 26-year-old Takanohana
held off Musoyama's attempts to throw him from the ring and then
toppled him with an arm throw at the ring's edge.
	   Takanohana won the last tournament in Nagoya, central Japan,
with 14-1.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan from Hawaii, charged No. 1 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Kaio and thrust him out by thrusting his hands
against his foe's throat. Akebono finished at 11-4, including a
victory over Takanohana, in the final bout in the last tournament
in Nagoya.
	   Ozeki Musashimaru held on at ring's edge several times during
his bout with No. 2 maegashira Kotonowaka before finally turning
the tables on him and forcing the taller wrestler out after two
minutes. Sumo wrestling usually ends in 10 to 15 seconds.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii, finished 12-3 in
the last tournament.
	   Ozeki Takanonami grabbed No. 2 maegashira Minatofuji's belt and
threw him down.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai, seeking promotion to
ozeki, charged No. 3 maegashira Asahiyutaka with hand thrusts and
sent him out. Chiyotaikai finished 11-4 in Nagoya.
	   No. 5 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kyokushuzan dodged to the
left in the initial charge, but No. 4 maegashira Wakanosato held on
and sent Kyokushuzan out of the ring.
	   Kyokushuzan, Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was promoted to the
present rank from No. 11 maegashira for his 9-6 record in Nagoya.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, pulled down equally-ranked Gokenzan.
	   Hoshitango ended the last tournament with a 6-1 record and moved
into the juryo division.
	   No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was
lifted out by equally-ranked Kushimaumi. Kyokutenho fell back to
the present rank from No. 15 maegashira after he finished 4-11 in
the previous tournament.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu,
or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, was forced out by equally-ranked
Saitoh. Hoshiandesu was promoted to the present rank from No. 10
for his 4-3 record in Nagoya.
	   In sandanme, the second highest junior division, No. 2-ranked
Ikemori, or Brazilian Luis go Ikemori from Sao Paulo, pushed out
No. 3-ranked Dewanosato.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Some 1,200 make pilgrimage to north, about 50 protest

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Some 1,200 Greek Cypriots crossed the
U.N.-patrolled buffer zone on Sunday to make a pilgrimage to a
monastery in the Turkish-occupied north.
	   But 50 others _ who refused to ask the Turkish Cypriots for
permission to make such a trip _ staged a quiet protest at the
buffer zone, where U.N. guards did not allow them to pass without
proper permits.
	   ``We have every right to travel to the north, to our homes and
holy sites, to carry out our religious duties without being asked
to recognize the occupation regime,'' said Aris Hajipanayiotou, a
leader of the protest group.
	   They said they would appeal to the European Human Rights Court.
	   Those who crossed were to be transported 160 kilometers (100
miles) in Turkish Cypriot buses to the St. Andreas Monastery on the
eastern tip of the island.
	   Cyprus has been split since Turkey invaded in 1974 in the wake
of an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with
Greece. A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is
recognized only by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Those who participated in the pilgrimage _ as well as those who
protested it _ included Greek Cypriots who were driven from or fled
their homes in the north after the invasion.
	   Greek Cypriot police initially prevented the protesters from
reaching the Ledra Palace Hotel checkpoint on the buffer zone with
barbed wire barricades. The checkpoint links the Greek and Turkish
Cypriot sectors of the capital.
	   The demonstrators then were allowed to approach the buffer zone
after the pilgrims had crossed.
	   Protesting Greek Cypriot women, dressed in black and holding lit
candles, demanded to be allowed to cross ``because it is our
right.''
	   The group denounced the pilgrimage, which was approved by the
Cyprus government, as tantamount to official recognition of the
breakway Turkish Cypriot state.
	   ``Asking for permission to enter the north amounts to unofficial
recognition,'' Hajipanayiotou complained.
	   This year's daylong pilgrimage to the monastery was just the
third arranged since the invasion.
	   The Turkish authorities reject the right of the 180,000 Greek
Cypriot refugees to return to the north.

Landslide blocks Bulgaria's only motor road to Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ A rain-triggered landslide in
southwestern Bulgaria on Sunday blocked the only major highway
linking Bulgaria to neighboring Greece, police reported.
	   There were no injuries in the accident which occurred at a spot
where the road enters into a deep ravine near the town of Simitli,
some 120 kilometers (75 miles) south of the capital Sofia.
	   The landslide was expected to snarl international traffic on the
busy road as clearing the highway would take rescuers about 5
hours, police said.
	   As a consequence of the Cold War, formerly communist Bulgaria
and NATO-member Greece have no other operational road links and
cross-points on their nearly 300-kilometer (188 mile) mountainous
common border.
	   Athens and Sofia have agreed to open three new border crossings
in the Rhodope Mountains and build road stretches to them under a
European Union supported project for motrways linking central and
western Europe with the Aegean.

Central bank threatens to revoke licenses if money changers hoard

foreign currencies

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a strong warning to the
country's money changers, Malaysia's central bank said their
licenses could be revoked if they hoard foreign currencies.
	   Money changers have also been warned to sell currencies at the
specified rates and keep the spreads between buying and selling
rates below 2 percent, Bank Negara said in a statement Sunday.
	   The steps follow complaints that money changers have been
charging exorbitant rates, especially for the U.S. dollar, which
has been officially pegged at 3.80 ringgit.
	   The statement also said money changers have been told to issue
official receipts for money transactions.
	   It said adequate supplies of foreign currency notes have also
been made available.
	   Meanwhile 500 ringgit and 1,000 ringgit notes will cease to be
legal tender on July 1 of next year. Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said this move was to make it more difficult to smuggle
ringgit into the country.
	   At the end of this month, Malaysia will cease to recognize
ringgit held offshore as legal tender as part of its money
tightening laws.

Montenegrin government deporting Kosovo refugees to Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Authorities in Montenegro _
Serbia's smaller partner in what's left of Yugoslavia _ started
Sunday deporting refugees from the war-torn Serbian province of
Kosovo, claiming the move was due to security reasons.
	   After 3.000 refuges from western Kosovo had camped under open
skies for two days and nights at Montenegro's border, being denied
entry into the cash-strapped republic, the police shipped in buses
Sunday morning and promised the refugees would be taken to
neighboring Albania.
	   ``This is a shame, they are our citizens, why should they be
deported to Albania, a foreign country,'' Hakija Ljesnjanin, an
indignant relief worker from Montenegrin border town of Plav, told
The Associated Press.
	   Buses planned to deport the 3,000 Kosovo Albanians in several
to-and-fro trips Sunday and an unofficial border crossing between
Albania and Montenegro was opened for this purpose.
	   The deportation was not against the will of the refugees, they
had welcomed our decision, said Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa
Burzan who visited the site Saturday evening.
	   The stormy weather had made it evident they could no longer stay
put, he said. The refugees had also refused to be separated,
declining an earlier government offer to bring the women and
children into Plav.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to what he said were
official reports that there were gunmen and arms among the
refugees.
	   This latest refugee drama began Friday night when police banned
entry into Montenegro to some 3,000 Kosovo refugees who had fled on
foot from last week's fighting in western Kosovo.
	   Having crossed a mountain gorge between Kosovo and Montenegro,
the refugees surfaced at the border crossing near Plav, 60
kilometers (37.5 miles) northeast of Montenegrin capital Podgorica.
	   Effectively trapped near border village of Bogajice, the Kosovo
refugees were allowed to camp out in chilly mountain weather in a
village schoolyard, while ethnic Albanians in Kosovo pleaded for
emergency aid for them.
	   Montenegro government, after an urgent session Friday, said it
no longer had the means to accept and provide for more ethnic
Albanian refugees fleeing Kosovo. This small republic has so far
registered more than 40,000 refugees from war-torn Kosovo.
	   With about 30,000 refugees already in Montenegro since the wars
in Bosnia and Croatia, this constitutes a total of 72,350 refugees
_ the equivalent of 11.6 percent of Montenegro's population.
	   The latest refugee drama comes despite efforts by international
officials desperately trying to help those driven into the open by
the six-month-old conflict before winter arrives.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In the latest flare-up of a decades-old ethnic
conflict, arsonists burned almost 200 homes of refugees who had
recently returned to a tense Caucasus region, the Interfax news
agency reported Sunday.
	   Attacks took place in four villages where ethnic Ingush have
been living in Northern Ossetia. They had returned to their
villages after bloody clashes between Ingush and Ossetians in 1992
in which hundreds were killed and thousands more forced to flee
their homes.
	   It was the first inter-ethnic violence inside Russia since the
Soviet Union's collapse, but it had its roots in a 1944 decision by
Soviet dictator Josef Stalin to deport the entire Ingush nation for
collaborating with the Nazis during World War II.
	   When the Ingush were permitted to return to the Caucasus in
1957, they found their homes inhabited by Ossetians. Ever since,
the two groups have claimed the same territory: the
3,626-square-kilometer (1,400-square-mile) Prigorod district of
what is now North Ossetia.
	   Citing the Ingush Interior Ministry, Interfax said that
ninety-seven trailer-homes and more than 40 houses were destroyed
by fire in the village of Kurtat on Saturday, and one house in the
village of Kartsa was wrecked by a grenade.
	   The North Ossetian Interior Ministry said that 54 makeshift
homes in the village of Kombileyevka and 13 homes in the village of
Dongaron had also been set ablaze, Interfax said. There were no
reports of any casualties.
	   The attackers were believed to be ethnic Ossetians, seeking
vengeance for the killings of five Ossetian policemen early
Saturday. Russia's acting Deputy Interior Minister Pyotr Latyshev
was dispatched to North Ossetia on Saturday, following the police
slayings, Interfax said.
	   The slain policemen had been manning a joint Ossetian-Ingush
checkpoint.
	   ``The main task of law enforcement organs now is to prevent an
escalation of tension in the Prigorod region of Northern Ossetia,''
Latyshev was quoted as saying Sunday by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Interior Ministry troops have been put on alert in both
republics, and are protecting the approaches to areas inhabited by
members of both ethnic groups, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Tension was high elsewhere in the Caucasus, as well.
	   Police and army troops in Dagestan have been put on high alert,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday. Four Dagestani policemen
were abducted from their patrol car late Saturday and taken to
Chechnya. No conditions have been set for their release, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Russian media speculated that the kidnapping may have been in
response to the detention on Wednesday of opposition leader Mahomed
Khachilayev, an ally of renegade Chechen field commander Salman
Raduyev. Raduyev has demanded that Khachilayev be released by
midnight Sunday; otherwise, he will exact vengeance on
``pro-Russian'' Dagestan, he warned.

Opposition braves clampdown to stage march; crowds cheer

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters calling for
the ouster of strongman Hun Sen braved a heavy clampdown Sunday and
marched through the capital to cheers from Phnom Penh's citizens,
who threw them food and honked car horns in support.
	   The enthusiastic response contrasted with indifference and
muttered insults given a larger crowd of Hun Sen supporters, nearly
all of them carrying clubs, iron bars and other weapons, who
paraded through the city earlier in an intimidating show of
strength.
	   Opposition supporters, attacked by police and mobs of armed
supporters of Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party in the week-long
crackdown, set out about 200 strong Sunday afternoon from a
gathering point near the U.S. Embassy and opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh's house.
	   Their numbers had swelled to 2,000 after marching through city's
main market and looping back toward downtown, where they were
eventually met by nervous-looking riot police with clubs and
assault rifles who let them pass.
	   ``The support for real democracy in Cambodia is growing and
growing,'' said Un Kim Huot, 27, an English teacher. ``During the
CPP demonstrations, you saw no support from the people. Look at
them now. But we need support from the United States, the father of
democracy.''
	   Earlier, scattered violence broke out as the pro-government
group poured through the city. Many had been trucked in over the
past few days from Hun Sen strongholds around Phnom Penh.
	   About 8,000 of them spent Saturday night in the city's main
sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage a mass
peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters said they would stay until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out until the first meeting of the new National
Assembly. But by mid-afternoon, most had cleared out of the city in
trucks.
	   One truck stopped near the airport and beat one man bloody for
reasons that were unclear.
	   The government has banned opposition rallies but allowed its own
armed backers to roam freely police protection. They wrecked a
cigarette stall Sunday after failing to catch some opposition
backers they saw jeering them.
	   ``They say they are demonstrating for peace and democracy, but
they are violent,'' said Marn Nget, 30, the owner. ``Now my goods
are destroyed. Who is going to pay for this?''
	   Later, some of the crowd stoned a house from which they claimed
someone had fired a slingshot.
	   As pro-government crowds ran loose, the president of Hun Sen's
ruling Cambodian People's Party, Chea Sim, asked people to
immediately stop all demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.
	   Chea Sim accused the opposition of looking to ``fan the fire of
hatred to create new crises.''
	   Ranariddh and his ally, Sam Rainsy, challenge the results of
July 26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition parties allege massive fraud and have
threatened to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form
a new government.
	   Hun Sen launched a violent crackdown to end weeks of peaceful
protests Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He was not
home and no one was hurt. He has blamed Sam Rainsy, who accuses Hun
Sen of staging the attack as a pretext for a crackdown.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed and scores
injured after Hun Sen unleashed his police, soldiers and political
supporters at the opposition activists. Scores have been injured.
	   Human-rights workers found a body that had been floating in a
canal Sunday, but it was too early to tell what the man had died
of.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's election victory.
	   Prince Sisowath Sririrath, a member of parliament for
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, met U.N. officials and said Ranariddh
could not speak to CPP leaders as long as opposition leaders are
barred from leaving the country. They have described themselves as
hostages. Ranariddh would meet the king Wednesday and hopes to see
Chea Sim after.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Ranariddh said Saturday, referring to the dead Khmer
Rouge leader whose regime caused the deaths of up to 2 million
people in the 1970s.

Host Malaysia wins men's doubles gold and women take silver
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with men's doubles &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ So that's why Malaysia wanted
tenpin bowling in the Commonwealth Games.
	   Watched by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian men's
pairing of Kenny Ang and Ben Heng won the gold medal in the
debutant sport Sunday while the women went home with the silver.
	   Ang and Heng overwhelmed their opponents at the Pyramid Bowl to
take control early and move steadily away with consistently high
scoring.
	   It was Malaysia's first gold of the championship it is hosting
and a noisy crowd roared the pair to victory.
	   Ang and Heng went into the final round 288 pins ahead of
Bermuda's Conrad Lister and Antoine Jones and won by 223 by the end
of the eight games with a score of 3,552.
	   The Bermudans held on for silver with a score of 3,329 and
Australia's Francis Ryan and Michael Muir took the bronze with
3,229.
	   While the Malaysian men lifted their arms in celebration, the
women had to settle for silver.
	   For all their yelling and flag-waving, dozens of raucous
Malaysian fans couldn't push their pair to victory in the first
ever tenpin bowling contest at the 68-year-old games.
	   Instead, Australia's Maxine Nable and Cara Honeychurch ignored
shouts of ``Let's Go, Malaysia'' and knocked down 3,678 pins over
eight games. In two games, their lane neighbors were Lai Kin Ngoh
and Shalin Zulkifli of Malaysia, who finished with 3,548.
	   England's Gemma Burden and Pauline Buck took the bronze with
3,273.
	   Nable was the heroine, bowling fast and spinning heavily. She
scored an average of 239.13 per game and overshadowed her more
celebrated partner.
	   Honeychurch, World Bowler of the Year in 1996, ended with a
220.63 average in the bowling center at a ritzy shopping center
with an ancient Egyptian motif in the Malaysian capital.
	   ``I didn't expect I was going to be bowling that well,'' said
Nable, who faltered in the penultimate round but recovered. ``Like
any sport, it's the best on the day, and today it was us.''
	   Malaysia's best performance came from Lai, who had an average of
228.38.
	   As games host, Malaysia was entitled to introduce a sport at
which it excels. The Southeast Asian nation came third in the world
team championships in tenpin bowling in 1997 and fourth the
previous year.
	   Many Malaysians hoped their women bowlers would collect gold,
and local newspapers have extolled the talents of the team in a
string of articles.
	   ``We had pressure on us as everybody knows greater than any
other sport, any other athlete, in the games,'' said Sid Allen, a
British-born Canadian who coaches Malaysia.
	   He said his team was unable to capitalize on a rally in the
seventh game because the surface of the oiled lane was drying out,
making the ball curve more on its path toward the pins. So the
Malaysians were forced to busy themselves with adjustments.
	   ``The ball starts hooking more,'' Allen said. ``So you've either
got to move your feet, you've got to throw it faster, you've got to
spin it more, you've got to change equipment. Which one of those
things you have to do, that's the key.''

U.N. rights chief tells Chinese of concern over cleric arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson told
state-run Chinese church groups Sunday about foreign concern over
the arrest of independent clerics, but said she believed religious
freedom in China was increasing.
	   After a meeting with leaders of Buddhist, Christian, Daoist and
Muslim groups, Robinson said she gave them copies of appeals from
Christian charities to the government calling for an end to
interference in unofficial churches.
	   China has closed unauthorized houses of worship and jailed
independent clerics, along with Catholic bishops and priests who
refuse to renounce allegiance to the Vatican.
	   Robinson said some of the religious leaders told her they had
good relations with unofficial churches and that religious
liberties had ``improved greatly.''
	   ``I think it's important to recognize that there have been
improvements in ... freedom of religion,'' said Robinson, who is
halfway through a 10-day trip to China _ the first ever by a U.N.
high commissioner for human rights.
	   On Monday, the former Irish president is to return to Beijing to
meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   In Shanghai, Robinson visited a retraining center for laid-off
workers, where she said the curriculum included instruction on
legal rights. She said she offered to collaborate on educational
programs.
	   China responds to human rights complaints by arguing that its
first priority is to raise living standards and provide stability.
	   Calling poverty ``an acute denial of many human rights,''
Robinson noted that during a one-day visit to Tibet last week she
saw not only a Buddhist monastery but also irrigation and forestry
projects.
	   ``It's important that as high commissioner I note where there is
progress made ... and that I have a fair approach,'' she said.
	   Robinson said that while in Tibet she was unable to see a
dissident monk or find the whereabouts of a boy not seen in public
since the Dalai Lama named him a high Buddhist cleric three years
ago.
	   However, she added, ``it's not ever a case of getting instant
answers. I regard this as the start of a continuing process.''
	   Robinson was concerned about monk Yulo Dawa Tsering because he
was arrested after speaking to a U.N. human rights team in 1994. A
member of a European Parliament delegation that saw him two years
ago said Tsering was ``not the master of his own movements.''
	   Chinese officials would not disclose the whereabouts of
9-year-old Gendun Choekyi Nyima but said he was with his family,
Robinson said.
	   The boy has not been seen since the May, 1995, announcement that
he was the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, the highest-ranking
spiritual leader in Tibet since the Dalai Lama fled into exile 40
years ago. Chinese officials forced the Tibetan clergy to choose a
replacement.
	   Robinson also expressed concern about the arrest of a
dissident's wife, who was dragged away from her Beijing hotel by
police. Chu Hailan, who was held for eight hours, told reporters
that police had beaten her.
	   ``I was very concerned that ... she suffered directly as a
consequence of wishing to see me,'' Robinson said.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Crowds angry at the slaying of an
opposition leader stormed the main government building Sunday,
setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers scurried out the rear exit.
	   The crackle of gunfire and explosions from government cars set
afire echoed through the streets of this unstable, former Communist
capital. At least one person was wounded, police said.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha appealed for calm until Monday's
funeral of slain ally, Azem Hajdari. But Berisha, speaking from the
balcony of his Democratic Party headquarters, warned that if Nano
did not resign within 24 hours, he would face ``catastrophic
consequences.''
	   Berisha's followers, some of them weeping in grief over
Hajdari's death, chanted ``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Berisha, the former president, spoke to the crowd about a
kilometer (half mile) from the prime minister's office, where
protesters marched earlier in the day.
	   Members of the crowd fired shots at police around the
headquarters of the Interior Ministry and the prime minister's
office. Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the
protesters heads.
	   When they arrived at the three-story prime minister's office,
protesters set fire to several government vehicles, then pushed
their way into the ground floor, which they also set ablaze.
	   Outside, witnesses could hear gunfire from inside the building
as fuel tanks of the blazing cars exploded.
	   The attack took place while Nano and his Cabinet were holding an
emergency meeting on the deteriorating situation following
Hajdari's slaying. The ministers scurried out the rear door through
the smoke and explosions.
	   Hajdari, a former student leader known as ``The Hero'' for his
opposition to Albanian Communist rule, was shot by gunmen from two
parked cars as he left the party headquarters.
	   He died later in hospital. One of Hajdari's two bodyguards also
was killed, police said.
	   Hajdari's supporters planned to transfer his body to the
sprawling Skanderberg Square in the heart of the capital for an
all-night vigil until the funeral service at 11 a.m. (0900 gmt)
Monday.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Berisha
blamed Nano's party. The former president, in a statement Sunday,
gave Nano 24 hours to resign or the opposition would use ``all
means'' to force him out.
	   Nearly a year ago, Hajdari was shot and badly wounded in
Parliament by a rival legislator, who was later convicted of
attempted murder and sentenced to 11 years in jail.
	   The shooting was likely to inflame tensions in already-unstable
Albania, where Berisha's Democratic Party has tried to organize
mass resistance against the Socialist Party government that
replaced it last year.
	   After Hajdari was shot on Sept. 18, 1997, the Democratic Party
ordered days of protests against Nano and his Socialist-led
government, accusing it of masterminding the attack.
	   Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has barely
recovered from last year's nationwide riots which exploded after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many people
their life savings.
	   During the riots, mobs looted military armories, seizing more
than one million weapons, some of which ended up in the hands of
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence for neighboring
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Last week, the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged the Albanian government to take
measures to protect its armories in the face of rising political
tensions.

Man arrested after voting box damaged
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOKANJ, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Police arrested one man Sunday
after a group stormed a voting station and damaged a box of ballots
in this village in the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   U.N. police spokesperson Andrea Angeli said the incident
occurred in Lokanj, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of
Sarajevo.
	   Angeli said the group entered the station at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT)
and damaged the box. One man was arrested by local Serb police, but
Angeli lacked any further details.
	   Despite Bosnia's deep ethnic divisions from its 3 1-2-year war
that ended in 1995, the two-day election for national leaders that
started Saturday has been mostly calm.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Election organizers
apologized Sunday for computer glitches that hindered Bosnia's
second post-war national elections and said the problem was
resolved.
	   A few dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations failed to
open on the first day of voting Saturday because they lacked
voters' lists. On Sunday, all but one was operating, and officials
expected the two days of voting to finish as scheduled by 4 p.m.
(1400 GMT).
	   ``The OSCE wishes to convey to the voters our sincere apologies
for any inconveniences that yesterday's glitch caused,'' said
Nicole Szulc, spokeswoman for the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is running the election.
	   She said turnout Saturday was 33-35 percent, about the expected
level for the opening day.
	   Angry crowds gathered at some of the closed polling stations
Saturday, with one group blocking a road in northern Bosnia to
protest the delay. All dispersed when the problem was explained,
officials said.
	   On Sunday, Bosnian Serb police arrested one man after a group
entered a voting station and damaged a ballot box, according to
U.N. police spokeswoman Andrea Angeli. The incident occurred in
Lokanj, a Bosnian Serb village about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo. No further details were immediately
available.
	   Otherwise, voting has been calm in the election considered
crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord, which halted
the 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic.

German supermodel cancels appearance at West Bank casino opening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Tel Aviv, Israel (AP) _ Supermodel Claudia Schiffer has canceled
an appearance at the opening of the first gambling casino in the
Palestinian autonomous areas, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
	   Schiffer told casino operators Friday that she unexpectedly had
to fulfill a prior contractual obligation. The supermodel was to
have been the main attraction at the gala opening Tuesday night.
	   The casino, a joint project of the Palestinian Authority,
Casinos Austrian and private investors, will open on the outskirts
of the West Bank town of Jericho as planned Wednesday but will
postpone its inaugural party to next month.
	   Tensions have been running high in the West Bank since Israeli
troops killed two fugitives of the Islamic militant group Hamas on
Thursday, setting off rioting by Palestinians and threats by Hamas
to retaliate with revenge bombings.
	   The casino has already come under harsh criticism from Hamas
militants who say gambling goes against Islam.
	   Casino spokeswoman Joanne Frankel said that Schiffer was aware
of the political situation when she agreed to the appearance and
did not cancel for security reasons. The casino will try to
reschedule Schiffer's appearance.

President Fujimori arrives for official visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
arrived here Sunday for a three-day official visit, the state news
agency, MTI reported.
	   Hungary is the third leg of the first-ever visit of a Peruvian
head of state to Eastern and Central Europe. Previously, he visited
Romania and Poland.
	   Fujimori is scheduled to meet his Hungarian counterpart and
host, Arpad Goencz, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, and House Speaker
Janos Ader.
	   In his entourage are Foreign Minister Alberto Ferrero Costa, and
several businessmen.
	   The delegations are to sign bilateral agreements on agriculture,
on promoting tourism and on sports.
	   On Monday, Fujimori will be awarded an honorary professorship at
Budapest University of Economics, and on Tuesday at the Szeged
University in southern Hungary.
	   The two countries established diplomatic relations in 1969.
	   The trade volume between Peru and Hungary has doubled in the
past three years. In 1997, Peru was Hungary's fourth biggest
trading partner from among the Latin American countries, with a 26
million dollars turnover.

Netanyahu hopes Clinton overcomes sex scandal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
called U.S. President Bill Clinton ``a friend'' on Sunday and said
he hoped the American leader would survive a scandal that could
lead to impeachment.
	   ``He is a friend to Israel,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio. ``We
of course want what is good for him and the United States.''
	   ``My impression is the American society, the democracy and
presidency are very, very secure institutions and I imagine they
will get through this in peace,'' Netanyahu added.
	   The Israeli prime minister had himself been embroiled in a sex
tangle when he admitted to cheating on his third wife while running
for the Likud party leadership in 1993.
	   Netanyahu made the affair public when he accused an opposing
candidate for the leadership of threatening to publicize the affair
if Netanyahu did not withdraw from the race.
	   Israel was abom the U.S.'' Rabinovich wrote in the Maariv newspaper.
	   ``Right now the Clinton administration cannot grant such support
and I doubt if the situation will change in the coming months,''
Rabinovich added.
	   Sunday's daily newspapers featured splashy headlines and lengthy
stories detailing Clinton's actions as described in Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's report to Congress, which was released
Friday.
	   Talk shows on the major radio stations centered on the chances
Clinton might be impeached, and the potential implications for
Israel.
	   ``Clinton in all his Nakedness'' and ``Clinton, Monica, and the
Cigar Between Them'' were two headlines that dominated the front
pages.
	   Starr's report detailed potentially impeachable offenses
committed by Clinton in his attempts to keep the affair a secret.
	   Two of the newspapers ran special editions and devoted most of
their front sections to the report and its implications.

German supermodel cancels appearance at West Bank casino opening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Supermodel Claudia Schiffer has canceled
an appearance at the opening of the first casino in the Palestinian
autonomous areas, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
	   Schiffer told casino operators Friday that she unexpectedly had
to fulfill a prior contractual obligation. The supermodel was to
have been the main attraction at the gala opening Tuesday night.
	   The casino, a project of the Palestinian Authority, Casinos
Austrian and private investors, will open on the outskirts of the
West Bank town of Jericho as planned Wednesday but will postpone
its inaugural party to next month.
	   Tensions have been high in the West Bank since Israeli troops
killed two fugitives of the Islamic militant group Hamas on
Thursday, setting off rioting by Palestinians and threats by Hamas
to retaliate with revenge bombings.
	   The casino has been criticized by Hamas militants who say
gambling is against Islam.
	   Casino spokeswoman Joanne Frankel said that Schiffer was aware
of the political situation when she agreed to the appearance and
did not cancel for security reasons. The casino will try to
reschedule Schiffer's appearance.

Huegill wins 100-meter butterfly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with finals; will be updated with later races &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World record holder Michael Klim
suffered a second crushing loss in succession Sunday when fellow
Australian Geoff Huegill beat him in his favored 100-meter
butterfly event at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Klim, who claimed four gold medals, two silver and a bronze and
was the outstanding swimmer at the World Championships in January,
was beaten by Ian Thorpe in his first event, Saturday's 200-meter
freestyle final.
	   Huegill, starting from lane 4 with Klim out in lane 2, touched
the wall first in a games record 52.81 seconds. He won easily from
fellow Australian Adam Pine (53.09), with Klim (53.50) third for a
clean sweep of the medals.
	   ``I'd like to think I was in control,'' Huegill said. ``I knew
I'd done all the background work for this.''
	   Huegill said he did not yet consider himself ahead of Klim, who
stalked away from waiting media without a word.
	   England's James Hickman, the third fastest qualifier, was
disqualified when the judges decided he had made an intentional
break. Hickman argued with an official but then sat down in his
chair to watch the start.
	   Klim set the world record at 52.15 late last year before winning
the title at the world championships. His life has been full of
sponsor commitments since then and his training background and
concentration are now on trial two years before the Sydney
Olympics.
	   Australia's Olympic and world butterfly champion Susie O'Neill
claimed her second gold, after winning Saturday's 4x200-meter
relay, with victory in the 200-meter freestyle Sunday. It was her
ninth Commonwealth medal, and sixth gold, stretching back to 1990.
She has entered eight events here.
	   O'Neill touched in 2 minutes, 0.24 seconds, with English veteran
Karen Pickering doing well to pick up silver in 2:01.19. Canada's
Jessica Deglau, the fastest qualifier, claimed bronze.
	   ``I wanted to go faster but I went out too slow to set a quick
time,'' O'Neill said.
	   Australian coach Don Talbot has given Thorpe another chance to
break the world record that he missed by .01 seconds in the
individual 200-meter race. Thorpe was to lead out the 4x200-meter
relay team later Sunday and could claim the record if his segment
were faster than Italian Giorgio Lamberti's 1989 time of 1:46.69.

Opposition braves clampdown to stage march; crowds cheer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with crowd swelling to 3,000, monks blessing marchers
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters calling for
the ouster of strongman Hun Sen braved a heavy clampdown Sunday and
marched through the capital to cheers from Phnom Penh's citizens,
who threw them food and honked car horns in support.
	   The enthusiastic response contrasted with indifference and
muttered insults given a larger crowd of Hun Sen supporters, nearly
all of them carrying clubs, iron bars and other weapons, who
paraded through the city earlier in an intimidating show of
strength.
	   Opposition supporters, attacked by police and mobs of armed
supporters of Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party in the week-long
crackdown, set out about 200 strong Sunday afternoon from the U.S.
Embassy and opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh's house.
	   Their numbers swelled to 3,000 after marching up and down the
city. Nervous-looking riot police armed with rifles and clubs let
them pass. Buddhist monks, several of whom have been beaten wounded
by police in the past week, sprinkled the marchers with water and
blessed them.
	   ``The support for real democracy in Cambodia is growing and
growing,'' said Un Kim Huot, 27, an English teacher. ``During the
CPP demonstrations, you saw no support from the people. Look at
them now. But we need support from the United States, the father of
democracy.''
	   Earlier, scattered violence broke out as the pro-government
group poured through the city. Many had been trucked in over the
past few days from Hun Sen strongholds around Phnom Penh.
	   About 8,000 of them spent Saturday night in the city's main
sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage a mass
peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters said they would stay until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out until the first meeting of the new National
Assembly. But by mid-afternoon, most had cleared out of the city in
trucks.
	   One stopped near the airport and beat one man bloody for reasons
that were unclear.
	   The government has banned opposition rallies but allowed its own
armed backers to roam freely police protection. They wrecked a
cigarette stall Sunday after failing to catch some opposition
backers they saw jeering them.
	   ``They say they are demonstrating for peace and democracy, but
they are violent,'' said Marn Nget, 30, the owner. ``Now my goods
are destroyed. Who is going to pay for this?''
	   Later, some of the crowd stoned a house from which they claimed
someone had fired a slingshot.
	   As pro-government crowds ran loose, the president of Hun Sen's
ruling Cambodian People's Party, Chea Sim, asked people to
immediately stop all demonstrations and counter-demonstrations.
	   Chea Sim accused the opposition of looking to ``fan the fire of
hatred to create new crises.''
	   Ranariddh and his ally, Sam Rainsy, challenge the results of
July 26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition parties allege massive fraud and have
threatened to deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form
a new government.
	   Hun Sen launched a violent crackdown to end weeks of peaceful
protests Monday after grenades were thrown at his house. He was not
home and no one was hurt. He has blamed Sam Rainsy, who accuses Hun
Sen of staging the attack as a pretext for a crackdown.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed and scores
injured after Hun Sen unleashed his police, soldiers and political
supporters at the opposition activists. Scores have been injured.
	   Human-rights workers found a body that had been floating in a
canal Sunday, but it was too early to tell the cause of death.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's election victory.
	   Prince Sisowath Sririrath, a member of parliament for
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, met U.N. officials and said Ranariddh
could not speak to CPP leaders as long as opposition leaders are
barred from leaving the country. They have described themselves as
hostages. Ranariddh would meet the king Wednesday and hopes to see
Chea Sim after.
	   ``The future of the country is really the most serious ... since
Pol Pot,'' Ranariddh said Saturday, referring to the dead Khmer
Rouge leader whose regime caused the deaths of up to 2 million
people in the 1970s.

	   KUSADASI, Turkey (AP) _ Two Italians and an Albanian were
detained Sunday for illegally sailing close to military areas and
entering Turkish waters without passports, police said.
	   The Coast Guard stopped the Greek-flagged Thomas-II yacht and
took Pastro Polsybo, Giovanni Vociano, both from Italy, and Cristo
Ziu, of Albanian, in for questioning, according to a statement from
the paramilitary police.
	   They had anchored near an Aegean coastal area close to Kusadasi
that is reserved for military training.
	   The men told the police they lost their way because of an
electrical failure on the yacht during the night and thought they
were at the Greek island of Samos. Kusadasi, some 80 kilometers (50
miles) south of the Aegean port city of Izmir, is within sight of
Samos.
	   The three were scheduled to appear in court later in the day.

Pope to parents: choose schools that teach the right values
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Parents have a duty to send their
children to schools that teach the right values, Pope John Paul II
said Sunday.
	   Speaking at a Mass at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo,
in the hills southeast of Rome, the pontiff said schools help
children develop in many aspects, including spiritual.
	   Parents, he said, have ``the right and duty to choose schools
that best correspond to their own values.''
	   To students, the pope said that they should return to school
this fall with ``joy,'' remembering that children in many parts of
the world don't have an opportunity to get an education.

Congolese rebels deny losing Lubutu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rebels denied the Congolese government's
claim that it has recaptured Lubutu, a town on a key route between
two rebel strongholds.
	   Rebel-run Radio Bukavu said Saturday that forces opposing
President Laurent Kabila still controlled Lubutu, about 360
kilometers (225 miles) northwest of rebel headquarters in Goma,
eastern Congo, and about the same distance southeast of rebel-held
Kisangani on the Congo River.
	   The radio report, monitored by the BBC in Kenya, also said
rebels captured Shabunda and in eastern Kivu Province, as well as
Buta and Banalia, both on a road that runs north from Kisangani.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened ethnic
hatred.
	   After an all-night session, African leaders meeting in Ethiopia
failed Saturday to agree on a cease-fire in Congo's 6-week civil
war and said more consultations were needed.
	   The Congo fighting is on the agenda of the annual Southern
African Development Community summit scheduled for Monday on the
Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.

Vice chairman of Myanmar opposition party threatened with arrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The vice chairman of Myanmar opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party was threatened with
arrest in a commentary in a government-run newspaper Sunday.
	   The commentary in Sunday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper said
that Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National League for Democracy,
had violated the terms of his 1995 parole from prison and would
have to serve out the remainder of his sentence if he continued to
violate Myanmar laws.
	   The NLD said earlier this week that the military has arrested
702 of its members since May, including 194 elected members of
parliament.
	   More than half the arrests took place this week as the
government sought to prevent the NLD from convening parliament. The
NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election
the military refused to honor.
	   Also on Sunday, a student exiles group claimed that 15 military
officers, including army colonels, had been arrested by the ruling
junta for planning to meet and talk with Suu Kyi.
	   The report from the All Burma Students Democratic Front could
not be independently confirmed and the military government
spokesman was not available for comment.
	   NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo, 71, who has been imprisoned twice by
Myanmar's military leaders, is a former defense minister, army
commander in chief, Buddhist monk and lawyer.
	   He was placed under house arrest the same day as Suu Kyi in 1989
and later sentenced to three years in Insein Prison for violating
the 1950 Emergency Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows the
military to jail people for as little as allegedly thinking
anti-government thoughts.
	   In 1992, the military extended Tin Oo's sentence by another
seven years. He was released on March 15, 1995 after he appealed to
Gen. Than Shwe, the junta leader, according to the commentary in
the New Light of Myanmar.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   ``While serving the prison terms, Tin Oo submitted an appeal to
Senior General Than Shwe asking for pardon and promising he will
not take part in any political activities or in any activity that
would hamper the government's development works,'' the commentary
said.
	   ``On humanitarian grounds and due to Tin Oo's previous service
in the army, the remaining prison sentence was suspended. He signed
an undertaking saying he would not violate the law,'' it said.
	   ``Tin Oo may have to serve the remaining prison sentence if he
does not live up to his promises.''
	   The commentary also accused Tin Oo of trying to sow discord in
the army.
	   In 1974, Tin Oo ran afoul of former dictator Ne Win when he
refused to order his troops to open fire on unarmed student
demonstrators.
	   Ne Win accused him of plotting a coup and had him imprisoned in
1976. He was amnestied in 1980.
	   He retains a reputation as having been a heroic commander who
was well-liked by his troops, but he inspires a deep animosity from
officers in the military government for opposing military rule.
	   Tin Oo fought alongside Suu Kyi's father, independence hero Aung
San, during the campaign to end British colonial rule in the 1940s
and was among the first group of officers commissioned in the Burma
army.

Soldiers learn to be nice to the press while peacekeeping
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KRIVOLAK, Macedonia (AP) _ Canadian soldiers manning a
checkpoint wrestled an inquiring reporter to the ground, slapped a
bone-crunching hammerlock on him and stuck the barrel of an M-16
rifle in his ear.
	   This is NOT how to deal with the press during a peacekeeping
mission, the smiling instructor told an onlooking group of British
and Hungarian troops watching a demonstration during NATO exercises
in this southern Balkan nation.
	   It was a scenario the Canadian Forces have conducted many times
in teaching military units from around the world how to deal with
the press while on duty in tense areas.
	   A refugee was attempting to pass through the roadblock to return
to his home. Refused, he was creating a scene, shouting and waving
his arms. At just that moment, along comes the last thing in the
world the poor sergeant at the checkpoint needs - a television
crew, which immediately begins filming.
	   ``No filming, no filming,'' shout the soldiers, grabbing the
camera, chasing the cameraman away and throwing the reporter to the
ground.
	   ``How many of you think that was the correct way to deal with
the press?'' Maj. Yvon Desjardins asked the two squads of
infantrymen after the end of the demonstration.
	   While in their heart of hearts, at least some of them were
gleefully saying ``Yesssss!'' as the reporter squawked and writhed
on the ground, the audience sagely shook their heads in unison and
said ``Nooooo.''
	   One Canadian in the group said this is the point where
frequently some audiences cheer. That, however, is the wrong
response.
	   More than 500 troops from 13 NATO nations and 13 non-member
states are participating in week-long exercises in Macedonia. The
theme is peacekeeping, and instruction is being given in many of
the aspects of the job - setting up checkpoints, foot patrolling,
dealing with refugees, securing an area, and, of course, dealing
with the press.
	   ``Always do your primary job first,'' advised Desjardins. In
this case, that meant taking care of the refugee. Let the reporter
watch what he wants to watch. Tell him politely you will deal with
him when you get a minute.
	   ``Use the media as an opportunity to carry your message back
home and around the world,'' the Canadian major suggested.
	   Some of Desjardins' advice:
	   - ``Be honest. If you don't know something, say so.''
	   - ``Never lie to the media. They will find out you are lying.''
	   - ``There is no such thing as off-the-record.''
	   While there may be occasions that officers and other high-ups
might find it useful to speak unattributably, the average soldier
on the ground never has a reason to do so.
	   - ``If something is classified, say so and explain why.''
	   - ``Never say anything you would not feel comfortable with
seeing associated with your name on the front page of a newspaper
or on TV.''
	   - ``Basically, talk to your grandmother.''
	   A lot of media people don't know much about the military. Keep
it simple. Don't use jargon.
	   - ``Not all media are honest, but most of them are, just like
soldiers.''
	   - ``If you screw up, they will be there.''

Fans bid farewell to Japanese film director Kurosawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ More than 35,000 actors, directors and fans
gathered Sunday at a movie studio in Yokohama to bid farewell to
Japan's most famous film director, Akira Kurosawa, who died last
week at age 88.
	   Actor Tatsuya Nakadai, who starred in Kurosawa's classic
``Kagemusha,'' hosted the public funeral service at Kurosawa's
studio in Yokohama, 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of Tokyo.
	   Many of the biggest names in Japanese film showed up at the
studio in Yokohama. Tributes from foreign directors such as George
Lucas and Martin Scorsese were also read.
	   ``In life, there is no happy end as in a film. We always have to
say good-by at the end. However, Kurosawa's film will live longer
than himself. Therefore, in my mind, I reckon this as a happy
ending,'' said Hisao Kurosawa, the director's son.
	   At the end of the non-religious service, the audience filed to
the front of the room to lay white carnations before a
black-and-white photograph of a smiling Kurosawa wearing his
trademark sunglasses and cap.
	   Music from one of his best known movies, ``Seven Samurai,''
played.
	   Kurosawa's 56-year career included a trio of Oscars for such
films as ``Rashomon.'' He died of a stroke last Sunday.
	   A private service for family members and close friends was held
Tuesday.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt, France and Italy will hold joint
naval maneuvers off the coast of Egypt's port city of Alexandria
starting next Saturday, an official at the French Embassy in Cairo
said Sunday.
	   The exercises, code named Cleopatra, will involve day and night
activities and include simulated air attacks on a naval convoy, the
official said. He spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   Two French Mirage 2000 aircraft will take part, he said, as will
Egyptian F-16 fighter jets. Ships will include Italy's submarine Da
Vinci and the French destroyer Cassard.
	   The exercises program are scheduled to last until Sept. 24.

Search continues for new Spanish coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Veteran coach Luis Aragones on Sunday
rejected an offer to take on Spain's beleaguered national soccer
squad, sending the Spanish Football Federation scurrying to find
another option to replace Javier Clemente who resigned last week,
state-owned radio reported.
	   Clemente's departure was promoted by a humiliating 3-2 defeat by
semiprofessional Cyprus that added insult to the injury of a
disappointing World Cup performance.
	   According to the radio, Aragones refused the job because the
Federation insisted he work with Clemente's support team rather
than bring in his own.
	   Clemente had overseen the national squad in 62 games for a
record 36 wins, 20 ties and six losses. But this record was
overshadowed by Spain's ignominious exit from the World Cup in the
first round.
	   The Federation was due to meet later Sunday to discuss who to
offer the job to next, the radio said.
	   With Aragones ruling himself out, Jose Antonio Camacho was the
most frequently mentioned option to restore national soccer pride.
Camacho, 43, resigned as Real Madrid's coach in July after just
days on the job.
	   A regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989, Camacho
won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies, before retiring as
a player and going on to coach first-division teams Espanyol and
Sevilla.
	   Aragones, 60, retired from coaching first-division Betis last
August. He holds the record for the most games as coach in the
Spanish league _ 611 _ having trained powerhouse FC Barcelona for
one season in 1988, and Atletico de Madrid on three occasions over
the last 20 years.

South Africans need improvement says skipper
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Barbados beating Northern Ireland, Kiwis beating
Scots &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ South African cricket captain
Shaun Pollock admitted his team must improve its batting to feature
in the Commonwealth Games medals after another laborious
performance Sunday.
	   For the second match running, South Africa's batsmen were made
to look second rate by non-test playing teams as they ground out a
five-wicket victory over Bangladesh.
	   By contrast, Barbados openers Philo Wallace and Sherwin
Campbell, who both play test cricket for the West Indies, hammered
144 for the first wicket in a massive score of 296 for four in a
176-run win over Northern Ireland. Wallace hit 92 and Campbell 60.
	   And a century by Stephen Fleming and 87 by Adam Parore helped
New Zealand to 278 for six against Scotland, which was bowled out
for 101. Fleming made 102.
	   South Africa's win came after Pollock rescued his team from a
tight position against Northern Ireland earlier in the competition.
	   ``The batters haven't played very well, we're disappointed,''
Pollock said. ``Hopefully we can find some form _ if we're to have
any chance of the medals we've got to somehow get things going.''
	   South Africa faces Barbados in its next match and that result
will determine which team advances to the semifinals.
	   The team's bowlers are doing the job on helpful wickets and they
bowled out Bangladesh for 79 in 38.4 overs Sunday.
	   Pollock took a wicket with the first ball of the match and
claimed 1-11 off eight overs. Allrounder Jacques Kallis was the
best of the bowlers with 3-13 off seven overs.

Vice chairman of Myanmar opposition party threatened with arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS dateline to Bangkok

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The vice chairman of Myanmar opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi's political party was threatened with
arrest in a commentary in a government-run newspaper Sunday.
	   The commentary in Sunday's New Light of Myanmar newspaper said
that Tin Oo, vice chairman of the National League for Democracy,
had violated the terms of his 1995 parole from prison and would
have to serve out the remainder of his sentence if he continued to
violate Myanmar laws.
	   The NLD said earlier this week that the military has arrested
702 of its members since May, including 194 elected members of
parliament.
	   More than half the arrests took place this week as the
government sought to prevent the NLD from convening parliament. The
NLD won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election
the military refused to honor.
	   Also on Sunday, a student exiles group claimed that 15 military
officers, including army colonels, had been arrested by the ruling
junta for planning to meet and talk with Suu Kyi.
	   The report from the All Burma Students Democratic Front could
not be independently confirmed and the military government
spokesman was not available for comment.
	   NLD Vice Chairman Tin Oo, 71, who has been imprisoned twice by
Myanmar's military leaders, is a former defense minister, army
commander in chief, Buddhist monk and lawyer.
	   He was placed under house arrest the same day as Suu Kyi in 1989
and later sentenced to three years in Insein Prison for violating
the 1950 Emergency Provision Act, a sweeping law that allows the
military to jail people for as little as allegedly thinking
anti-government thoughts.
	   In 1992, the military extended Tin Oo's sentence by another
seven years. He was released on March 15, 1995 after he appealed to
Gen. Than Shwe, the junta leader, according to the commentary in
the New Light of Myanmar.
	   Myanmar is also known as Burma.
	   ``While serving the prison terms, Tin Oo submitted an appeal to
Senior General Than Shwe asking for pardon and promising he will
not take part in any political activities or in any activity that
would hamper the government's development works,'' the commentary
said.
	   ``On humanitarian grounds and due to Tin Oo's previous service
in the army, the remaining prison sentence was suspended. He signed
an undertaking saying he would not violate the law,'' it said.
	   ``Tin Oo may have to serve the remaining prison sentence if he
does not live up to his promises.''
	   The commentary also accused Tin Oo of trying to sow discord in
the army.
	   In 1974, Tin Oo ran afoul of former dictator Ne Win when he
refused to order his troops to open fire on unarmed student
demonstrators.
	   Ne Win accused him of plotting a coup and had him imprisoned in
1976. He was amnestied in 1980.
	   He retains a reputation as having been a heroic commander who
was well-liked by his troops, but he inspires a deep animosity from
officers in the military government for opposing military rule.
	   Tin Oo fought alongside Suu Kyi's father, independence hero Aung
San, during the campaign to end British colonial rule in the 1940s
and was among the first group of officers commissioned in the Burma
army.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The six Arab states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council will try to raise the percentage of their nationals working
in local industries to at least 75 percent by the year 2020,
Kuwait's minister of commerce and industry said Sunday.
	   The Kuwait News Agency quoted the minister, Abdul-Aziz
al-Dakheel, as saying the move is necessary to increase
industrialization and employment.
	   Most such jobs have attracted few Gulf workers and, instead,
rely on foreigners, especially Asians.
	   KUNA did not provide any figures, but a report published in
Al-Siyassah daily Sunday said the percentage of GCC nationals
working in industrial jobs was 2 percent in the United Arab
Emirates, 15 percent in Saudi Arabia and Oman, 7.8 percent in
Kuwait, 4.2 percent in Qatar and 32 percent in Bahrain.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The U.N. sanctions committee has approved a
further dlrs 21 million worth of Jordanian exports to Iraq under
the oil-for-food deal.
	   The Trade Ministry said Sunday that this raises to dlrs 28.6
million the total of approved Jordanian exports under the fourth
phase of the program and to dlrs 333 million the total since it
began nearly two years ago.
	   The latest U.N. approval covers contracts for soap, detergent,
vegetable oil, eggs and medicine, the ministry said.
	   Outside the oil-for-food deal, Iraq imports more than dlrs 200
million a year of Jordanian industrial products, making Baghdad the
largest importer of Jordanian goods.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception from U.N. trade
sanctions imposed in 1990 to punish Iraq for its invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The pre-1990 trade volume with Iraq exceeded dlrs 1 billion a
year.

Memoirs of Singapore founder critical of Malaysian leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of book to ``The Singapore Story'' in final graf
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ In excerpts of his memoirs published in the
press Sunday, the founder of modern Singapore blames corruption and
lax morals by Malaysia's leaders for ending the countries'
brief-lived political union in the 1960s, a charge that may further
poison already tense relations between the two neighbors.
	   In the memoirs due to go on sale later this week, Lee Kuan Yew,
75, the revered patriarch who ruled Singapore as prime minister for
31 years, looks back at the island nation's turbulent beginning in
Singapore's publishing event of the year.
	   Excerpts were printed in the government-controlled Sunday Times
newspaper.
	   Lee's memoirs take on extra significance because of a series of
recent financial and political tussles between glittering Singapore
and economically faltering Malaysia.
	   After becoming the first prime minister of independent Singapore
in 1959, Lee championed a merger with neighboring Malaysia, viewing
it as an escape from communist threats.
	   Lee has admitted he counts the failure of the 23-month-long
merger, which ended in 1965, as his biggest political regret.
	   Singapore's ``leaders were not like politicians in Malaya.
Singapore ministers were not pleasure-loving, nor did they seek to
enrich themselves,'' Lee writes in the new book, called ``The
Singapore Story.'' At that time, the neighboring land was called
Malaya.
	   Lee also brought up an attempt by Malaysians to bribe one of his
colleagues and recalled how on one occasion he had accompanied then
Malaysian prime minister Tunku Abdul Rahman and others to a men's
club in Kuala Lumpur where ``attractive call girls and even
starlets were available.''
	   Lee said he ate and played poker with his hosts but left ``as
soon as the girls arrived.''
	   Ironically, it was only after Malaysia kicked out Singapore,
accusing Lee and other Singapore leaders of meddling in the rest of
the federation, that Lee's real triumph began.
	   Prime minister from 1959 to 1990, Lee is credited with almost
single-handedly transforming a poor, malaria-ridden island into an
economic powerhouse and a model of incorruptibility and racial and
social harmony.
	   In 1990, Lee voluntarily stepped down and took the post of
senior minister without portfolio, but he continues to wield
enormous influence over this island nation of 3.1 million.
	   In his memoirs Lee also recalled a famous incident on Aug. 9,
1965, when he broke down in front of TV cameras while announcing
the end of union with Malaysia.
	   Lee said he had wanted the break-down part edited out: ``Among
Chinese, it is unbecoming to exhibit such a lack of manliness.''
But ultimately he was advised against it by the then head of
Singapore's radio and TV.
	   The publication of Lee's memoirs coincides with another tense
episode between predominantly Chinese Singapore and
Muslim-dominated Malaysia.
	   A recent spat over Singapore's shifting of a railroad border
post has been followed by mudslinging between the two countries'
officials and press.
	   All that revived the sensitive issue of water. Under agreements
set forth in two treaties, about half of the water consumed daily
by Singaporeans comes from Malaysia. Malaysians have hinted water
supplies could be turned off if disagreements deepen.
	   Lee said that a similar ploy was considered by Malaysia a
generation ago during the wrenching end of the union.
	   According to Lee, then-Prime Minister Tunku told the British
high commissioner that ``if Singapore's foreign policy is
prejudicial to Malaysia's interests, we could always bring pressure
to bear on them by threatening to turn off the water in Johor.''
	   ``The Singapore Story'' will be launched Wednesday in English
and Chinese by Simon and Schuster Asia, Singapore Press Holdings
and Times Publishing. Singapore Press Holdings owns the Sunday
Times, which published the first excerpts of Lee's eagerly awaited
book.

Cabinet appoints new publications director
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Cabinet has appointed Jordanian
columnist Eyad Qattan as press and publications director,
Information Minister Nasser Judeh said Sunday.
	   He succeeds Bilal Tal in the job, which is largely one of
censorship.
	   The move comes amid media complaints that a new press law,
enacted last month under the previous government, restricts press
freedom.
	   Abdullah Hassanat, chief editor of The Jordan Times, hailed the
appointment of Qattan.
	   ``The government is signaling its intention to softly implement
the press law by appointing a liberal-minded scholar to replace the
one who was perceived to be behind the press law,'' Hassanat said.
	   Judeh, who took over the information portfolio in a government
change on Aug. 20, has pledged to implement the press law in ``the
most flexible and positive way.''
	   Qattan has worked as columnist at several Jordanian dailies. He
was critical of the press law drafted by the government of Prime
Minister Abdul-Salam Majali, who resigned on Aug. 19.
	   The press law bans publication of material that could be
regarded as disparaging to King Hussein and the royal family, heads
of state and the army, or publications deemed harmful to Jordan's
security and monetary stability.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Crowds angry at the slaying of an
opposition leader stormed the main government building Sunday,
setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers scurried out a side exit.
	   The crackle of gunfire and explosions from government cars set
afire echoed through the streets of this unstable, former Communist
capital. At least two people were wounded, police said, including
an officer of the Republic Guard unit shot in the leg while
defending Nano's office.
	   Opposition members said one protester was killed, but there was
no official confirmation. Party members were unable to say where
the body was taken.
	   At a rally after the attack, opposition leader Sali Berisha
appealed for calm until Monday's funeral of his slain ally, Azem
Hajdari, who was shot dead Saturday as he left Democratic Party
headquarters.
	   But Berisha, speaking from the balcony of the party
headquarters, warned that if Nano did not resign within 24 hours,
he would face ``catastrophic consequences.''
	   Berisha's followers, some of them weeping in grief over
Hajdari's death, chanted ``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Trouble started about 10:45 a.m. (0845 gmt) when about 1,500
Democratic Party members marched to the Interior Ministry to
protest Hajdari's slaying. The crowd pelted the building with
stones, fired pistols in the air and set fire to a government-owned
car.
	   The crowd then continued down the city's main street to the
prime minister's office. Protesters began firing at the third
floor, which contains Nano's offices. Troops responded with volleys
of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the crowd forced its way into the three-story building,
traded pistol shots with the guards and set fire to the ground
floor. Nano and his Cabinet were holding an emergency meeting on
the deteriorating situation following Hajdari's slaying.
	   The ministers scurried out a side exit through the smoke and
amid explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had
set on fire. The crowd returned to Democratic Party headquarters,
where they dispersed after a brief rally where Berisha appealed for
calm.
	   President Rexhep Meidani issued a statement also urging
restraint. He called on police to find Hajdari's killers as quickly
as possible. The Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs
100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the
killers.
	   Rumors of unrest elsewhere in this impoverished Balkan country
swept the capital but could not be confirmed. One unconfirmed
report spoke of unrest in the Democratic Party stronghold of
Kavaja, where crowds were said to have blocked the main national
highway.
	   Hajdari, 35, was one of the most popular and dynamic figures in
Albanian politics. He was a former student leader known as ``The
Hero'' for his opposition to Albanian Communist rule.
	   He was shot by gunmen from two parked cars as he left the party
headquarters. He died later in hospital. One of Hajdari's two
bodyguards also was killed, police said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Berisha
blamed Nano's party. The former president, in a statement Sunday,
gave Nano 24 hours to resign or the opposition would use ``all
means'' to force him out.
	   Nearly a year ago, Hajdari was shot and badly wounded in
Parliament by a rival legislator, who was later convicted of
attempted murder and sentenced to 11 years in jail.
	   Hajdari's supporters planned to transfer his body later Sunday
to the sprawling Skanderberg Square in the heart of the capital for
an all-night vigil until the funeral service at 11 a.m. (0900 gmt)
Monday.
	   The shooting has inflammed tensions in already-unstable Albania,
where Berisha's Democratic Party has tried to organize mass
resistance against the Socialist Party government that replaced it
last year.
	   After Hajdari was shot on Sept. 18, 1997, the Democratic Party
ordered days of protests against Nano and his Socialist-led
government, accusing it of masterminding the attack.
	   Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has barely
recovered from last year's nationwide riots which exploded after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many people
their life savings.
	   During the riots, mobs looted military armories, seizing more
than one million weapons, some of which ended up in the hands of
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence for neighboring
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, which is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Last week, the 54-nation Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe urged the Albanian government to take
measures to protect its armories in the face of rising political
tensions.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Klim lifted Australia's
4x200-meter freestyle relay team to a world record, capping the
country's clean sweep of all five of Sunday's swimming gold medals
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Klim fought back after a disastrous individual 100-meter
butterfly event to join Ian Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski and Matt Dunn
in recording 7 minutes, 11.86 seconds, .09 inside the Unified
Team's record at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   Earlier, Geoff Huegill inflicted another crushing defeat on
butterfly world record holder Klim to start Australia's gold rush.
	   Australia now has eight of the 10 golds contested here and is
aiming for the record 25 golds it achieved in 1994 in Victoria,
Canada.
	   Klim suffered his second loss in succession when Huegill beat
him into third place in his favored 100-meter butterfly race.
	   Klim, who claimed four gold medals, two silver and a bronze and
was the outstanding swimmer at the World Championships in January,
was beaten by Thorpe in his first event, Saturday's 200-meter
freestyle final.
	   The 15-year-old Thorpe missed the world record in that race by
.01 seconds, and was given another chance to break it in the
opening leg of the 4x200, but his 1:47.48 was well outside the
9-year-old mark of 1:46.69.
	   Huegill, starting from lane 4 with Klim out in lane 2, touched
the wall first in a games record 52.81 seconds. He won easily from
fellow Australian Adam Pine (53.09), with Klim (53.50) third for a
clean sweep of the medals.
	   ``I'd like to think I was in control,'' Huegill said. ``I knew
I'd done all the background work for this.''
	   Huegill said he did not yet consider himself ahead of Klim, who
stalked away from waiting media without a word.
	   ``I don't regard myself as the best around in this event yet,''
Huegill said. ``Michael is still the world record holder and I
think he deserves to stay as the No. 1 until someone can smash his
record.''
	   Klim set the world record at 52.15 late last year before winning
the title at the world championships. His life has been full of
sponsor commitments since then and his training background and
concentration are now on trial two years before the Sydney
Olympics.
	   England's James Hickman, the third fastest in heats, was
disqualified when the judges decided he had made an intentional
break. Hickman argued with an official but then sat down in his
chair to watch the start.
	   Hickman had a chance to atone two races later in the 400-meter
individual medley, and just missed the gold medal with a brave,
late surge at winner Trent Steed.
	   Hickman led out for the first half but Steed held a strong lead
going into the final 100 meters of freestyle and was then lucky to
hold the 22-year-old at bay.
	   ``I was a little bit disappointed (about the disqualification)
but I had another race to focus on so I couldn't dwell on it,''
Hickman said. ``There's no point crying about it (but) I'll
probably get angry about it later.''
	   Australia's Olympic and world butterfly champion Susie O'Neill
claimed her second gold, after winning Saturday's 4x200-meter
relay, with victory in the 200-meter freestyle Sunday. It was her
ninth Commonwealth medal, and sixth gold, stretching back to 1990.
She has entered eight events here.
	   O'Neill touched in 2 minutes, 0.24 seconds, with English veteran
Karen Pickering doing well to pick up silver in 2:01.19. Canada's
Jessica Deglau, the fastest qualifier, claimed bronze.
	   Pickering was a double gold medalist in Victoria in 1994 but at
26 was expected to struggle here.
	   O'Neill, who needs three more golds to match Michael Wenden as
Australia's most prolific Commonwealth champion, said she had an
upset stomach before Sunday's races.
	   ``I was a bit worried,'' O'Neill said. ``Going into the race I
tried to get it out of my head but it was always in the back of my
mind. I would have liked to have gone faster than that, so I might
just use that as an excuse.''
	   Former world champion Samantha Riley, fighting back after
missing a medal at the world championships, powered out early and
comfortably won the women's 200-meter breaststroke.
	   Riley finished in 2:27.30, with Canada's Courtenay Chuy and
Laura Van Oosten taking silver and bronze.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia set a relay world record
and swept all five golds in the pool at the Commonwealth Games
Sunday.
	   The quartet of Ian Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski, Matt Dunn and
Michael Klim, recorded seven minutes, 11.86 seconds in the 4x200
freestyle relay to beat the record of 7:11.95 set by the Unified
Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   Second place England was almost 12 seconds behind as the
Australians confirmed their domination in the pool in the most
emphatic way after victories in Sunday's four other swimming
events.
	   The parade of gold medals at the National Aquatic Center took
Australia's total to 13, with England the closest challenger on
four, while host Malaysia won the first Commonwealth Games tenpin
bowling title Sunday for its first of the Games.
	   Geoff Huegill began the five-star Australian performance in
100-meter butterfly sweep ahead of Andrew Pine and world record
holder Michael Klim in 51.81, a Games record.
	   Susie O'Neill won her sixth Commonwealth gold medal by
overpowering England's Karen Pickering in the 200 freestyle in
2:00.24 and Trent Steed held off a late charge by England's James
Hickman to win the 400-meter individual medley for another Aussie
triumph.
	   Former world record holder Samanatha Riley cruised to an easy
victory in the 200 breaststroke, leaving two Canadians behind in
silver and bronze, and then came the best of all, the relay world
record.
	   Although Thorpe, who Saturday missed the 9-year-old world 200
freestyle mark by .01, was well outside this time on the opening
leg, the quartet stayed well inside the relay record throughout the
swim.
	   Outside of the pool, host Malaysia won the first Commonwealth
men's tenpin bowling title while its women took silver in the
women's double event.
	   With Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in the crowd, the men's
doubles pairing of Kenny Ang and Ben Heng overwhelmed their
opponents to win the title by a huge 223 pins with Bermuda's Conrad
Lister and Antoine Jones second and Australia's Francis Ryan and
Michael Muir third.
	   Maxine Nable and Cara Honeychurch won the women's event for
Australia ahead of Malaysia's Lai Kin Ngoh and Shalin Zulkifli with
England's Gemma Burden and Pauline Buck.
	   Tenpin bowling was one of six new sports added to the schedule
for these Games.
	   In the women's 92 kilometer road race, Canada's Lyne Bessette
pounced on a blunder by Australian cyclist Anna Wilson with the
finish line in sight to burst through and win the gold.
	   A half length ahead of Besette and New Zealand's Susy Pryde with
400 meters to go, Wilson had the lead in the 92-kilometer road race
around rainy Kuala Lumpur when her left foot slipped out of the
pedal as she prepared to charge to the line.
	   The Australian lost speed and momentum and Bessette saw her
chance. The Canadian hit the front, closely followed by the Kiwi
and Bessette crossed the line a cycle length ahead of Pryde for the
gold medal with the Australian two lengths back third.
	   All three riders were given 2 hours 24 minutes 59 seconds with
Louise Jones of Wales a distant fourth, more than 1 1/2 minutes
behind.
	   Australian and English competitors each gained two more golds on
the shooting ranges at Langkawi Island, off Malaysia's east coast.
	   Christine Trefry and Annette Woodward won the women's pairs
sport pistol and Carolyn Quigley and Kim Frazer triumphed in the
women's pairs prone sport rifle.
	   England's Nigel Wallace and Chris Hector won the men's pairs air
rifle and Nick Baxter and Michael Gault took gold in the pairs free
pistol.
	   But the two dominant nations in the shooting bowed to India's
Mansher Singh and Manavjit Singh in the pairs trap competition.

Malaysian child squash star gets notice, even from her king

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ She's 15 years old, likes math at
school and shopping with pals. And as Malaysia's squash wonder,
Nicol David also loves to give world-class players the jitters.
	   David, No. 1 in the women's field in Asia, made a splash at the
Commonwealth Games before succumbing Sunday to Linda Charman of
England, a top 10 player who dwarfed the Malaysian teen-ager in
size.
	   But judging by her poise and speed, the girl's future seems a
bright one.
	   Malaysians certainly think so.
	   Hundreds of people packed the stands to cheer her, whooping so
much that the referee had to hush them into silence. Even Malaysian
King Tuanku Ja'afar, looking casual in a blue sports jacket, took a
front row seat with bodyguards in tow.
	   ``I'm still young so there's no pressure on me,'' David said
after her 9-6, 9-6, 9-0 loss. ``Every time I play, all I do is keep
focused, play my game and not worry about my opponents.''
	   David, who started playing with her two sisters a decade ago,
beat experienced Melanie Jans of Canada in a first-round match and
is scheduled to play doubles Wednesday.
	   She has made big strides in the last six months, reaching the
final of an international tournament in Malaysia before pulling out
with a fever. On the way, she beat No. 10 Alison Wray of England.
	   David trains for two hours daily and works out with light
weights. Already a veteran of the junior tournament circuit, she
has played in England, Scotland, Hong Kong and Australia. Her
father is an engineer and her mother is a schoolteacher.
	   Her black hair dyed with streaks of the national color, yellow,
David opened with a backhand volley winner against Charman that had
the crowd yelping in delight. But she grew error-prone as the
26-year-old Englishwoman wore her down.
	   ``I learned quite a lot from that game,'' David said. ``I have
to keep patient. I can't afford to make any loose shots.''
	   She'll also have to grow more. At times, she was simply too
small to reach Charman's low crosscourt drives.
	   Richard Glanfield, a British coach on the Malaysian squash team,
said he and David's parents don't want to press her into a
professional career too early. Registering her in the Commonwealth
Games was more of an experiment, he said.
	   ``We put her in this event for fun,'' he said. ``It's just for
the exposure.''
	   But David, who turned 15 on Aug. 26, looked at ease Sunday
night. Like an old pro, she signed autographs for fans, posed for
their snapshots and flashed a smile at the king.

Kuwait sending humanitarian aid to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait will send humanitarian aid to the
famine-stricken people of Sudan, the Cabinet said Sunday.
	   Relations between the two countries were strained when Sudan
backed Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but they have been
warming of late.
	   The emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, ordered the aid shipped
to Sudan ``as a contribution to lifting the suffering'' of the
Sudanese people, a Cabinet statement said. It gave no details of
the kinds of supplies were involved.
	   Drought and an ongoing civil war have led to famine in southern
Sudan.
	   Earlier this year, Kuwait gave permission for a Sudanese
diplomat to work in the Sudanese Embassy here. Last month, Kuwait
restored postal services with Sudan.

Yeltsin hails opening of memorial chapel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin paid tribute Sunday to
Russians who have perished while fighting catastrophes, calling on
the nation to remember their heroism.
	   He sent his letter to those taking part in the opening ceremony
on Sunday for a new memorial chapel named for a holy icon of the
Virgin Mary, called ``Joy for All Who Grieve.'' The chapel is
dedicated to people who died while responding to natural and other
disasters that have struck Russia.
	   ``Nature is unpredictable, and on some occasions we cannot
counter its destructive force. It is within our abilities, however,
to avoid conflicts, bloodshed and the deaths of people,'' Yeltsin
wrote.
	   ``Accord and civic peace in society depend on us, on our common
sense and goodwill.''

New Zealand businessman dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Sir Francis Renouf, one of New
Zealand's best-known business personalities and philanthropists,
died Sunday at the age of 80.
	   Renouf was credited with introducing an array of innovations to
the New Zealand commerce during the 1950s, including share
underwriting and the establishment of a national share index in
1957.
	   He received a knighthood in 1987 and was inducted into the
Business Hall of Fame last year.
	   In 1981 he established Frank Renouf and Co., Renouf Corporation
and Renouf Properties and was once listed among New Zealand's 50
richest people with an estimated net worth of at least US dlrs 45
million.
	   However, he lost much of his fortune in the 1987 share market
crash, which also saw Renouf Corporation come close to collapse. He
had earlier resigned as chairman of the company.
	   After a divorce from his first wife, two high-profile marriages
_ to Susan Peacock-Sangster and Countess Michele Griaznoff _ and
acrimonious divorces kept his name in the news during the 1980s and
early 1990s.
	   Three years after his highly publicized split from
Peacock-Sangster, Renouf married Countess Michele in 1991. However
the couple separated after three months.

Germany launches aid airlift for Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany will begin distributing aid in
famine-struck Sudan on Sunday after shipments to the north African
nation were delayed by last month's U.S. military strike against a
suspected chemical arms factory, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Two German military transport planes and 50 soldiers are in
place in the Sudanese capital Khartoum to start the airlift, the
ministry said.
	   Up to four flights daily are to bring humanitarian aid to
hundreds of thousands of people facing famine in southern Sudan,
where rebels and government forces have fought since 1983.
	   The government declared a unilateral cease-fire in the area Aug.
3 to promote the flow of aid. German defense officials say the
airlift is supposed to run for at least two months.
	   The airlift under the United Nations flag had been scheduled to
start Aug. 21, but Germany put it off after the U.S. attack on the
Khartoum factory a day earlier.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has led a 15-year war for
greater autonomy in southern Sudan from the Arab, Muslim-dominated
government in the north. About 1.5 million people have died in
fighting and famines since 1983.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Crowds angry at the slaying of an
opposition leader stormed the main government building Sunday,
setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers scurried out a side exit.
	   One protester was killed and four guards were wounded while
defending Nano's office, police said. The crackle of gunfire and
explosions from government cars set afire echoed through the
streets of this unstable, former Communist capital.
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said armed crowds of opposition supporters
blockaded the main national highway near Kavaja, about 30
kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Tirana.
	   At a rally after the attack, opposition leader Sali Berisha
appealed for calm until Monday's funeral of his slain ally, Azem
Hajdari, who was shot dead Saturday as he left Democratic Party
headquarters.
	   But Berisha, speaking from the balcony of the party
headquarters, warned that if Nano did not resign within 24 hours,
he would face ``catastrophic consequences.''
	   Berisha's followers, some of them weeping in grief over
Hajdari's death, chanted ``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Trouble started about 10:45 a.m. (0845 gmt) when about 1,500
Democratic Party members marched to the Interior Ministry to
protest Hajdari's slaying. The crowd pelted the building with
stones, fired pistols in the air and set fire to a government-owned
car.
	   The crowd then continued down the city's main street to the
prime minister's office. Protesters began firing at the third
floor, which contains Nano's offices. Troops responded with volleys
of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the crowd forced its way into the three-story building,
traded pistol shots with the guards and set fire to the ground
floor. Nano and his Cabinet were holding an emergency meeting on
the deteriorating situation following Hajdari's slaying.
	   The ministers scurried out a side exit through the smoke and
amid explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had
set on fire. The crowd returned to Democratic Party headquarters,
where they dispersed after a brief rally where Berisha appealed for
calm.
	   President Rexhep Meidani also urged restraint and called on
police to find Hajdari's killers as quickly as possible. The
Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs 100,000 reward
for information leading to the arrest of the killers.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Klim overcame a defeat in
his favorite event to lead home a world record swim by Australia's
4x200-meter freestyle team at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday.
	   Klim, holder of the world record for the 100-meter butterfly,
was beaten into third in that final. A little over an hour later,
he returned the fastest split as Australia crushed the former
record in the relay.
	   Klim joined Ian Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski and Matt Dunn in
recording seven minutes, 11.86 seconds to beat the record of
7:11.95 set by the Unified Team which competed at the 1992
Barcelona Olympics.
	   ``I hadn't had the best of meets so far but this was a new one
and I put the others behind me,'' said Klim, who was also beaten in
the 200-meter individual freestyle by Thorpe on Saturday. ``I knew
I was capable of it and just wanted to go out there and prove it.''
	   Klim had the fastest split of 1:47.42 but Thorpe was also
impressive, leading the team out with a 1:47.48.
	   Australian coach Don Talbot gave Thorpe a chance to break the
world record he missed by .01 seconds in the individual swim by
sending him out first.
	   Thorpe was unable to match the 1:46.70 from Saturday's swim,
which put him close to Italian Giorgio Lamberti's 1989 mark of
1:47.69.
	   ``I was happy with the swim but a little disappointed I went
slow for the team,'' Thorpe said. ``I'm sure Australia will be
proud of us.''
	   The team, with Grant Hackett instead of Dunn, won the world
title in Perth earlier this year, inflicting a rare defeat on the
United States.
	   Kowalski clocked 1:47.81 as second swimmer and Dunn put the
pressure on Klim by recording a 1:49.15 split.
	   Klim said he had never been in a similar position.
	   ``I've never had a chance to do that before,'' said Klim. ``I
had it in the back of my mind that I never wanted to let anyone
down. I looked up at the guys and they were screaming and cheering
so I knew we had done what we wanted to do.''

OSCE appeals for calm, Daan is CORRECT
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe appealed Sunday for calm amid unrest
triggered by the assassination of opposition politician Azem
Hajdari.
	   `It's perfectly understandable that people have anger, like I'd
be angry, and I am angry, but there's no justice to be found in
violence,'' OSCE Ambassador Daan Everts of Denmark said in an
interview with Albanian television.
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buldings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.
	   Everts said the government should be allowed to pursue the
investigation of Hajdari's death without fear of violence.
	   ``But it doesn't help the government to do this if it is
surrounded by violence and buildings on fire,'' he said. ``This is
democracy, there is a parliament, there have been elections, and if
there is a crisis, the polititions should solve it....''
	   Everts said that on Monday there will be a meeting of the heads
of the international organizations in Tirana and all the foreign
ambassadors. He said the envoys would issue an appeal to Albania to
``stay peaceful and don't answer to the appeals for violence...''

Yehudi Menuhin awards dlrs 500,000 Stradivarius to young violinist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Gypsy politician on Sunday called on
authorities to properly respect his violinist father, after Yehudi
Menuhin awarded the Romanian violinist's dlrs 500,000 Stradivarius
to a young musician.
	   ``The Romanian state is obliged... to fulfill certain conditions
as a moral duty to my father Ion Voicu,'' said Madalin Voicu, a
Gypsy or Roma lawmaker, by telephone.
	   In 1956, the Romanian government bought the 18th century
Stradivarius from Ion Voicu. His nimble fingers and stirring
renderings of the classics, were as technically perfect as he was
talented and inspired generations of Romanian musicians in his four
decades of activity. He died in 1997.
	   Under Communism, Voicu received the rare honor ``Artist of the
People.'' Most of his earnings from concerts abroad had to be given
to the state, according to Communist rules.
	   His son wants a park named after the violinist, the state to pay
for the restoration of his Bucharest house and for the government
to organize a competition for young talent under Ion Voicu's name.
	   Great violinist Menuhin is in Bucharest for a two-week
international festival of music and song. The 80-year-old master
awarded the Stradivarius to a 33-year old Romanian violinist
Saturday, although he seemed less than thrilled, with the
musician's 40 minutes interpretation of the classics.
	   In order to enter the competition, violinists had to be 25-35
years old and be residents in Romania. Only two people entered.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet statement; five injured in West Bank
clashes, meeting slated for evening &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A third straight day of clashes Sunday in the
West Bank town of Bethlehem left five Palestinian youths injured
from rubber bullets fired by Israeli soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants, deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to retaliate against
Israel for its killing Thursday of two top fugitives, members of
the group's military wing who were wanted for alleged involvement
in attacks against Israel and planning others.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge attacks against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Saturday in several West Bank
cities. At least 16 Palestinians and two Israeli soldiers were
injured in ensuing clashes.
	   Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
peace accords, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the
occasion to point to the continuing terror threat Israel faces.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   In efforts to avert a possible Hamas attack, Israeli security
forces canceled leaves for police and soldiers and troops fanned
out to cities throughout the country to protect shopping areas and
bus stops _ targets of previous suicide bomb attacks.
	   Despite the threats, American envoy Dennis Ross continued in his
efforts to get Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
agree on a U.S. proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the peace
talks.
	   Under the intiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
work hard to contain anti-Israeli militants.
	   Neither side has reported any progress in Ross' meetings, which
began Wednesday, and Netanyahu told his Cabinet that the
Palestinians were backing down on previously agreed to conditions.
	   ``There was progress in the talks with the Palestinians and we
had almost reached certain understandings but the Palestinians
backed down on these understandings,'' the prime minister said,
according to a Cabinet statement.
	   Netanyahu said in talks with Ross, he had demanded the
Palestinians suppress terror groups like Hamas as a condition for
advancing the peace process.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, have accused Israel as using
security matters as a pretext for delaying West Bank pullbacks it
had already promised to make.
	   The Oslo accords set a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy, and since their signing, the Palestinians have assumed
self-rule in the Gaza Strip and now control large towns in the West
Bank.
	   But many major provisions have not been implemented, and each
side accuses the other of blocking further progress.
	   Ross had more talks set later Sunday with Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. He as
speaking to them together _ a break from his practice so far of
shuttling back and forth in separate meetings between the two
sides.
	   However, the talks, being held at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ned Walker, were centering on secondary issues including
the opening of a Palestinian airport and a so-called safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza.

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Oompah music from a brass band was in the
air as Bavarian state Gov. Edmund Stoiber voted Sunday in his
hometown south of Munich in the foothills of the Alps.
	   Stoiber, whose conservative Christian Social Union has governed
Bavaria since 1962, was confident his party would retain its
majority in the state parliament _ and in the process help
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chances of winning a fifth term in
national elections Sept. 27.
	   Polls show Kohl trailing his flashy Social Democratic
challenger, Gerhard Schroeder. About a third of the electorate also
is undecided, and Stoiber said he thought voters could still be won
over to the conservative camp.
	   ``Many ordinary voters in Germany who maybe now are still
undecided about voting for Helmut Kohl would be motivated by a very
positive CSU result in Bavaria,'' Stoiber said after voting in his
hometown of Wolfsrathausen, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of
Munich.
	   The CSU, which exists only in Bavaria, is the state's equivalent
to Kohl's Christian Democrats. The two govern together in Germany's
national coalition along with a third, smaller party.
	   After scoring 52.8 percent in 1994, the worst showing in years,
Stoiber says anything over 50 percent Sunday would be a good
result, enabling him to keep his position secure in Munich, the
capital of this deeply Catholic state, and give Kohl a
``psychological boost'' to help him catch up to poll-leading
Schroeder.
	   Yet polls show the CSU must worry about making it over the
50-percent mark in a state vote for the first time in decades.
	   The popular Schroeder has campaigned as the voice of change, and
his vow to create a ``new center'' seems to be helping his party in
the Bavaria state vote. Polls show the Bavarian Social Democrats
coming in at about 34 percent _ which would be a gain of four
percentage points over 1994 and cause for celebration in their
camp.
	   And even a good showing for the CSU Sunday does not mean Kohl
can rest easy. Many Bavarians planning to vote for Stoiber are
nevertheless disenchanted with Kohl, in office for 16 years.
	   Armin Vogel, a civil servant who turned out to vote in
Wolfsrathausen wearing lederhosen and a woolen sweater, said
Stoiber _ his neighbor when the governor is in town _ is far more
popular in Bavaria than Kohl.
	   His daughter, 27-year-old Alexandra Vogel, agreed.
	   ``I think it'll be close. I hope Kohl can make it,'' she said of
the federal vote two weeks away. But ``many people can't stand the
sight of him anymore. I think the SPD will get a lot of votes just
because of Kohl. People think he's been there too long.''
	   And the Social Democrats are not the only ones chipping away at
the CSU's base.
	   Several tiny conservative parties are running, including the
far-right Republicans, who are campaigning against foreigners and
European integration.
	   An estimated 8.8 million voters were eligible to cast ballots
before polls close at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). State officials said voter
turnout at midday, with rain across most of Bavaria and snow in the
mountains, was running slightly below the 1994 election, when
turnout was 67.8 percent.

Politician wants Australia to become republic before Sydney
</HEADLINE>
Olympics

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Opposition Leader Kim Beazley said
Sunday he wants Australia to become a republic by 2000 so that an
Australian head of state can open the Sydney Olympics.
	   The Australian Labor Party leader made the comment during Sunday
night's televised debate with Prime Minister John Howard as the
leaders continued campaigning for national elections Oct. 3 that
will choose Australia's next government.
	   As a member of the Commonwealth, Australia's formal head of
state is the Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.
	   While Howard is an avowed monarchist, he has said that he would
like to open the Games himself if he wins the October vote. Under
Olympic committee rules, the head of state of a host nation is
expected to perform the opening ceremony for the games.
	   Beazley's comments echoed those of Australia's last Labor prime
minister, Paul Keating, who was defeated in March 1996.
	   Sunday's debate dealt mainly with tax, economic issues and other
domestic concerns.
	   After the debate, commentators called Beazley the clear winner
because of his rhetoric on a vision for Australia, the need for
national unity and his plans for a republic.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Crowds angry at the slaying of an
opposition leader stormed the main government building Sunday,
setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers scurried out a side exit.
	   One protester was killed and four guards were wounded while
defending Nano's office, police said. The crackle of gunfire and
explosions from government cars set afire echoed through the
streets of this unstable, former Communist capital.
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said, armed crowds of opposition supporters
blocked the main national highway near Kavaja, about 30 kilometers
(18 miles) southwest of the capital, Tirana.
	   At a rally after the attack, opposition leader Sali Berisha
appealed for calm until Monday's funeral of his slain ally, Azem
Hajdari, who was shot to death Saturday as he left Democratic Party
headquarters.
	   But Berisha, speaking from the balcony of the party
headquarters, warned that if Nano did not resign within 24 hours,
he would face ``catastrophic consequences.''
	   Berisha's followers, some of them weeping in grief over
Hajdari's death, chanted ``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Trouble started about 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) when about 1,500
Democratic Party members marched to the Interior Ministry to
protest Hajdari's slaying. The crowd pelted the building with
stones, fired pistols in the air and set fire to a government-owned
car.
	   The crowd then continued down the city's main street to the
prime minister's office. Protesters began firing at the third
floor, which contains Nano's offices. Troops responded by shooting
over the protesters heads.
	   The crowd forced its way into the three-story building, traded
pistol shots with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano
and his Cabinet were holding an emergency meeting on the
deteriorating situation following Hajdari's slaying.
	   The ministers scurried out a side exit through the smoke and
amid explosions of gas tanks of cars that the protesters had set on
fire. The crowd returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed after Berisha appealed for calm at a brief rally.
	   President Rexhep Meidani also urged restraint and called on
police to find Hajdari's killers as quickly as possible. The
Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs 100,000 reward
for information leading to their arrest.
	   Hajdari's supporters planned to transfer his body later Sunday
to the sprawling Skanderberg Square in the heart of the capital for
an all-night vigil until the funeral service at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT)
Monday.
	   The shooting has inflamed tensions in already-unstable Albania,
where Berisha's Democratic Party has tried to organize mass
resistance against the Socialist Party government that replaced it
last year.
	   Hajdari, 35, was one of the most popular and dynamic figures in
Albanian politics. He was a former student leader known as ``The
Hero'' for his opposition to Albanian Communist rule.
	   He was shot by gunmen from two parked cars as he left the party
headquarters. He died later in hospital. One of Hajdari's two
bodyguards also was killed, police said.
	   Nobody immediately claimed responsibility, but Berisha blamed
Nano's party. The former president, in a statement Sunday, gave
Nano 24 hours to resign or the opposition would use ``all means''
to force him out.
	   Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has barely
recovered from last year's nationwide riots which exploded after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many people
their life savings.

Hattori wins Japan LPGA Championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIHO, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori fired an unimpressive
4-over-par 76 Sunday but still won the Japan LPGA Championship by
three strokes for her second major title on the tour.
	   A four-stroke leader overnight, Hattori got off to a shaky start
with a bogey-5 on the first hole but recovered quickly with a
birdie-4 on the second.
	   But she often missed the fairway and hit into the rough,
suffering bogeys on the third, sixth, 10th and 12th.
	   Hattori, however, wasn't the only player among overnight leaders
struggling for over-par scores at the windswept, par-72 Miho Golf
Club course, known for its narrow fairway and punitive rough.
	   With a round of two birdies and six bogeys, Hattori finished at
a 2-over 290, three shots ahead the 5-over 293 of second-place Yuri
Kawanami, who shot a 73.
	   Hattori's third victory of the season, and 10th overall in seven
years on the tour, was worth 12.6 million yen (dlrs 93,000) from a
purse of 70 million yen (dlrs 518,000). She also received a
five-year tour card.
	   The 30-year-old Hattori, winner of the 1984 Japan Women's
Amateur and the 1985 U.S. Women's Amateur Championships, won her
first major title in the 1994 Japan Women's Open.
	   ``I tried not to, but it was nerve-wracking today,'' said
Hattori. ``I was trying throughout to stay cool. But I was hitting
the ball harder than usual.''
	   The victory lifted her to the top of the money earnings list
with 47.8 million yen (dlrs 354,000).
	   Kawanami, after starting six shots off the pace, birdied the
fifth and sixth holes and briefly shared the lead with Hattori
before shooting a bogey-6 on the 13th. She then suffered a double
bogey at No. 15.
	   Yuri Fudo shot a 76 and placed third at 294.
	   Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen and South Korean Ko Woo-soon had 72s and
shared fourth at 295 with second-round leader Lee O-soon of South
Korea and Hiromi Kobayashi, winner of the Rainbow Classic on the
U.S. tour last month. Lee turned in a 75 and Kobayashi a 74.
	   Defending champion Akiko Fukushima shot a fat 78 and placed
eighth at 296.
	   Fukushima, the tour's top money winner in the last two seasons,
was seeking her second victory of the season.

Taliban claims to have seized key center for Afghan opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban army said Sunday
that it has seized a key stronghold in central Afghanistan from a
northern alliance of opposition forces. The claim could not
immediately be confirmed.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Muttaqi said Bamiyan, a city in
the central Afghanistan province of the same name, fell to the
religious army early Sunday.
	   Satellite telephone calls to the northern alliance's Bamiyan
headquarters were not answered, so no verification was immediately
possible.
	   The Taliban and its northern-based enemies are fighting on
several fronts. The Taliban army, which has vowed to restore peace
in the war-ravaged country and transform Afghanistan into a purist
Islamic state, has made significant progress in recent weeks.
	   Taliban fighter jets pounded Bamiyan on Saturday as part of an
offensive that began Friday. The Taliban also claimed on Saturday
that it seized an airport near Bamiyan, 125 kilometers (80 miles)
west of the capital of Kabul. The northern alliance denied the
claim.
	   Both sides routinely make contradictory claims in their battle
over the roughly 10 percent of Afghanistan still held by the
northern alliance, which is composed of minority ethnic groups.
	   Bamiyan was one of four provinces held by the alliance, and was
controlled by the Shiite Muslim group Hezb-e-Wahadat. The province
also is the site of key air bases, where Iran, which supports the
alliance is believed to have flown in military supplies.
	   The loss of Bamiyan to the Taliban would be a major blow to the
northern-based alliance which has suffered several serious setbacks
in recent months. The Taliban movement is dominated by Sunni
Muslims, who are in the majority in Afghanistan
	   On Sunday, Taliban-controlled Kabul radio also claimed that four
northern alliance commanders and their troops switched sides in the
conflict to join the Taliban in their offensive on Bamiyan.
	   There also were reports over the weekend that hundreds of Shiite
Muslims were fleeing the areas because they were afraid invading
Taliban troops would kill them.
	   In an attempt to prevent retaliatory attacks on Shiite Muslims,
the Taliban-run radio has been issuing almost nightly warnings to
its troops to ``protect'' their Shiite captives and newly conquered
areas.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, has been
accused of the widespread killing Shiite Muslims in August in the
northern town of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Eleven Iranian diplomats vanished in that attack. Last week the
Taliban admitted that nine of them had been killed by Taliban
troops. The religious army blamed the slayings on renegades acting
without the authorization of their movement's supreme leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar. The fate of the other two diplomats is not known.
	   Iran has warned that it would avenge the killings and ordered an
exercise by 200,000 troops on its Afghan border. Experts fear the
exercise could be a prelude to military retaliation by Tehran or
its official intervention on the side of the anti-Taliban alliance.
	   On Saturday,Taliban leaders said they had reinforced their
troops in western Afghanistan, but did not expect an attack from
Iran.
	   The Taliban also has offered to let Iran fly into northern
Mazar-e-Sharif to collect the bodies of the slain diplomats.

Iran voices concern over Turkish ties with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami told
visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismael Cem on Sunday that Tehran
was unhappy with Ankara's military cooperation with Israel, Iranian
television reported.
	   Turkey's ties with Israel ``provoked the feelings of the Islamic
world'' and were unnecessary, the television broadcast quoted
Khatami as saying.
	   ``Turkey does not need to cooperate with Israel which has shown
its aggressive nature,'' toward Muslim countries, Khatami told Cem.
	   Turkey says its cooperation with Israel, including planned naval
exercises in the Mediterranean Sea in November, is not directed
against other countries. But several Arab and Islamic states in the
region have expressed concern about the emerging alliance.
	   Cem, who arrived here Saturday for a three-day visit, later held
talks on Afghanistan with his Iranian counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi.
	   Cem condemned the killing of nine Iranian diplomats by the
Taliban as ``a savage act'' and said Afghanistan has become a
factor for instability in the region, the official Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
said its militiamen killed the Iranian diplomats after capturing
the Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The Taliban, which are widely believed to be supported by
Pakistan, accuse Iran of backing an Afghan opposition alliance.

England, Australia take first golds at shooting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with trap shooting medals &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ India's Mansher Singh and Manavjit
Singh won the men's pair trap competition, breaking an English and
Australian monopoly on shooting gold medals at the Commonwealth
Games Sunday.
	   The Indian pair hit 192 of the 200 targets they shot at.
Australians Michael Diamond and Benjamin Kelley took the silver
medal with 190, and Ian R. Peel and Robert Borsley of England won
the bronze with 189.
	   In earlier events on the opening day of shooting, England and
Australia took two golds each.
	   England's Nigel Wallace and Chris Hector won the men's pairs air
rifle event with 1,173 points, seven ahead of Malaysia's Mutalib
Abdul Razak and Mohd Emran Zakaria and 10 ahead of Scottish pair
David Rattray and Robin Law.
	   Wallace scored 590 points and Hector 583.
	   ``We were under a lot of pressure and I am even more pleased
with my score because of that,'' said Wallace. ``We put the
pressure on ourselves because we expected a lot of ourselves. Now
we have done the business I'm looking forward to collecting my
medal.''
	   Nick Baxter and Michael Gault of England won the men's pairs
free pistol gold with 1,093 points. Australians David Moore and
Bruce Quick took the silver, while the bronze went to Canada's John
Rochon and Jean Pierre Huot.
	   While England dominated the men's events, Australia won the two
women's titles.
	   Carolyn Quigley and Kim Frazer, making their first games
appearance, won the women's pairs prone sport rifle event ahead of
Canada's Christina Ashcroft and Maureen Spinney and Scotland's
Shirley McIntosh and Susan Bell. The Australia's scored 1,174
points, two ahead of the Canadians and four ahead of the Scots.
	   Christine Trefry and Annette Woodward picked up the second gold
in the women's pairs sport pistol with 1,140 points. It was
Trefry's fourth Commonwealth Games gold and Woodward's third as
they finished ahead of New Zealand's Tania Corrigan and Jocelyn
Lees by two points. Malaysians Bibiana Ng Pei Chin and Norsita
Mahmud were third.

Eight-month old Saudi septuplets finally go home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FAIZA SALEH AMBAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Eight-month old Saudi
septuplets finally left the hospital after their parents' fears
that they couldn't care for the babies were eased, hospital
officials in southern Saudi Arabia said Sunday.
	   A goodbye party for the four boys and three girls was held
Saturday at the Abha Maternity Hospital, where they were born.
	   They then were taken home in an ambulance accompanied by seven
nurses, hospital director Abdullah Aoun told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview.
	   The infants were in good health and weighed between 5 kilos (11
pounds) and 7.5 kilos (16.5 pounds), Aoun said.
	   The babies were ready to leave the hospital six months ago, but
their parents feared they couldn't afford to care for them. Their
mother, Hasna Mohammed Humair, said she wanted help before bringing
them home.
	   The couple, who already have five children at home, then
received dlrs 213,000 in gifts from Saudi royalty and hired two
Indonesian nannies.
	   The father, Abdullah al-Summan, a retired civil defense
employee, receives a dlrs 1,066 monthly pension and drives a cab to
earn extra money.
	   He had considered leaving the babies at the hospital until they
turned a year old, but Humair, 41, said she was finding it hard to
go twice a day to the hospital to visit the babies and help feed
them.
	   Now that they're home, she's not getting a lot of rest either.
	   ``By the time we put three of them to sleep, change and feed the
other four, the first three get up and need to be fed and
changed,'' she said from her home in Abha. ``Then it starts all
over again. I was only able to doze off a couple of times in a
chair in their room.''
	   The situation of the Saudi septuplets, born Jan. 14, is far
different from that of the world's other set of surviving
septuplets, born last November to Kenny and Bobbi McCaughey of
Carlisle, Iowa.
	   After the McCaughey babies were born, they were showered with
help. Corporations rushed to pledge or donate everything from free
groceries to car seats, diapers and college scholarships.
	   The McCaugheys also had as many as 60 volunteers working in
shifts at their home to help feed and care for their babies.

Florida State upset by N.C. State; Paterno gets 300th victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was a joyous day for Joe Paterno, and an
upsetting one for Bobby Bowden. Paterno became just the sixth NCAA
coach to win 300 games when No. 9 Penn State routed Bowling Green
48-3.
	   ``I'm so overwhelmed, I really can't tell you how welled up I am
with the memories,'' the 71-year-old coach said after Saturday's
win.
	   Bowden, whose 282 victories are second behind Paterno among
active major-college coaches, had far different emotions after
watching No. 2 Florida State lose to North Carolina State 24-7 in
Raleigh, North Carolina.
	   ``Yeah, I'm pretty stunned,'' said Bowden, whose team was
favored by 25 points.
	   Torry Holt, who caught five TD passes against the Seminoles last
season in a 48-35 loss, burned Florida State again. He scored on a
68-yard (62 meters) punt return and a 63-yard (58 meters) pass from
Jamie Barnette as the Wolfpack handed the Seminoles just their
second ACC loss in 49 games since joining the league in 1992.
	   Chris Weinke, a 26-year-old quarterback playing his first season
for Florida State (1-1, 0-1 ACC), threw a school-record six
interceptions against N.C. State (2-0, 1-0).
	   At Penn State, two of Paterno's players lifted him onto their
shoulders and carried him to the middle of the field, where he
addressed the 96,291 fans at Beaver Stadium.
	   ``After 48 years at Penn State, I salute all the efforts of
every team I've been a part of, and that includes all you fans and
all you alumni. I love every one of you,'' said Paterno, whose
career record is 300-77-3.
	   Only three major-college coaches are ahead of Paterno on the
career victory list _ Bear Bryant (323), Pop Warner (319) and Amos
Alonzo Stagg (314). Eddie Robinson, who retired from Grambling last
season, holds the NCAA record with 408 wins and John Gagliardi, who
still coaches at St. John's, Minnesota, is second with 342.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Ohio State 49, Toledo 0; No.

Opposition braves clampdown to stage march; crowds cheer

workers investigating killings.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Thousands of protesters calling for
the ouster of strongman Hun Sen braved a heavy clampdown Sunday and
marched through the capital to cheers from Phnom Penh's citizens,
who threw them food and honked car horns in support.
	   But as night fell, clusters of gunfire rang out in the vicinity
of the U.S. Embassy, where many of the marchers had ended up. At
least one man, a motorcycle driver, was hit in the leg by several
bullets. The gunfire appeared to come from ruling party supporters
and their allies, the riot police.
	   The protesters scattered when a monsoon storm broke.
	   The enthusiastic response for the protesters contrasted with
indifference and muttered insults given earlier in the day to a
larger crowd of Hun Sen supporters, nearly all of them carrying
clubs and other weapons, who paraded through the city in an
intimidating show of strength.
	   Opposition supporters, attacked by police and mobs of armed
supporters of Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party in the week-long
crackdown, set out about 200 strong Sunday afternoon from the U.S.
Embassy and opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh's house.
	   Their numbers swelled to 3,000 after marching up and down the
city. Nervous-looking riot police armed with rifles and clubs let
them pass. Buddhist monks, several of whom have been beaten wounded
by police in the past week, sprinkled the marchers with water and
blessed them.
	   ``The support for real democracy in Cambodia is growing and
growing,'' said Un Kim Huot, 27, an English teacher. ``During the
CPP demonstrations, you saw no support from the people. Look at
them now. But we need support from the United States, the father of
democracy.''
	   Earlier, scattered violence broke out as the pro-government
group poured through the city. Many had been trucked in over the
past few days from Hun Sen strongholds around Phnom Penh.
	   About 8,000 of them spent Saturday night in the city's main
sports stadium, where the opposition had hoped to stage a mass
peaceful rally Sunday but called it off over fears of bloodshed.
	   Hun Sen's supporters said they would stay until Sept. 24 to keep
the opposition out until the first meeting of the new National
Assembly. But by mid-afternoon, most had cleared out of the city in
trucks.
	   One supporter stopped near the airport and beat one man bloody
for reasons that were unclear.
	   The government has banned opposition rallies but allowed its own
armed backers to roam freely under police protection. They wrecked
a cigarette stall Sunday after failing to catch some opposition
backers they saw jeering them.
	   ``They say they are demonstrating for peace and democracy, but
they are violent,'' said Marn Nget, 30, the owner. ``Who is going
to pay for this?''
	   The president of the CPP, Chea Sim, asked people to immediately
stop all demonstrations and counter-demonstrations, accusing the
opposition of looking to ``fan the fire of hatred to create new
crises.''
	   Ranariddh and his ally, Sam Rainsy, dispute the results of July
26 elections where Hun Sen's party won the most parliamentary
seats. The opposition alleges massive fraud and has threatened to
deny Hun Sen the two-thirds majority he needs to form a new
government.
	   Hun Sen cracked down on weeks of peaceful protests Monday after
grenades were thrown at his house. He was not home and no one was
hurt. He has blamed Sam Rainsy, who accuses Hun Sen of creating a
pretext to crush the opposition.
	   At least four people have been confirmed killed from the
violence and scores injured. Human-rights workers found two bodies
Sunday and were investigating reports of six more of people who
appeared to have been killed and dumped. They feared the killings
could be political.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and the army's top general pressured
opposition leaders Friday to accept Hun Sen's election victory.
	   Prince Sisowath Sirirath, a member of parliament for Ranariddh's
FUNCINPEC party, met U.N. officials and said Ranariddh could not
speak to CPP leaders as long as opposition leaders are barred from
leaving the country. They have described themselves as hostages.
Ranariddh would meet the king Wednesday and hopes to see Chea Sim
after.

World wonders whether President Clinton can survive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; PRECEDE Tokyo &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Clinton

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu called
President Clinton a friend and predicted he will survive. German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl hoped the United States' role in the world
has not been compromised.
	   And newspapers around the world devoted pages Sunday to the
crisis in Washington over lurid revelations about Clinton's
extramarital sex life, including his encounters with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Many editorial writers concluded Clinton will remain in office,
despite what Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says is a raft of
impeachable offenses.
	   ``More than ever, le Comeback Kid seems determined to fight,''
headlined France's weekly Journal de Dimanche newspaper.
	   ''More perhaps than any politician in history, he has the guile
and stamina'' to survive, opined London's Sunday Telegraph, a
frequent critic of Clinton. ''But if he does, it will be a victory
for the political art rather than a victory for honor.''
	   In contrast, Hong Kong's English-language daily, The South China
Morning Post, felt that ``the time has come for Bill Clinton to
stop apologizing and resign himself to the fact that his fight for
survival has reached its end.''
	   Netanyahu said Clinton was ''a friend to Israel'' with the
strength to survive.
	   ``My impression is the American society, the democracy and
presidency are very, very secure institutions and I imagine they
will get through this in peace,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Kohl was concerned that the U.S. president ``must retain his
ability to govern.''
	   ``It is of utmost importance that the only world power can fully
take on its tasks. Asia, Africa, India _ everywhere there are
problems,'' he was quoted as telling Bild am Sonntag.
	   Many abhorred the graphic detail in Starr's report.
	   The major Japanese newspaper Asahi called it ``vivid and
disgusting'' and bemoaned the damage done to the U.S. president at
a time when he needs to show firm leadership in the world.
	   ``President Clinton's sex scandal has none of the political
aspects of Watergate,'' the paper said, but concluded that ``if
this damages the credibility of American politics as well as the
leadership of President Clinton, it can no longer be treated as a
personal problem.''
	   In an editorial titled ``Hell is American,'' the French
center-left daily Le Monde, which ran a 16-page supplement, called
the Starr investigation a ``new McCarthyism,'' referring to Senator
Joe McCarthy who led a bitter campaign in the 1950s to expose
public figures suspected of having communist sympathies.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Crowds angry at the slaying of an
opposition leader stormed the main government building Sunday,
setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers scurried out a side exit.
	   One protester was killed and four guards were wounded while
defending Nano's office, police said. The crackle of gunfire and
explosions from government cars set afire echoed through the
streets of this unstable, former Communist capital.
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said, armed crowds of opposition supporters
blocked the main national highway near Kavaja, about 30 kilometers
(18 miles) southwest of the capital, Tirana.
	   At a rally after the attack, opposition leader Sali Berisha
appealed for calm until Monday's funeral of his slain ally, Azem
Hajdari, who was shot to death Saturday as he left Democratic Party
headquarters.
	   But Berisha, speaking from the balcony of the party
headquarters, warned that if Nano did not resign within 24 hours,
he would face ``catastrophic consequences.''
	   Berisha's followers, some of them weeping in grief over
Hajdari's death, chanted ``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Trouble started about 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) when about 1,500
Democratic Party members marched to the Interior Ministry to
protest Hajdari's slaying. The crowd pelted the building with
stones, fired pistols in the air and set fire to a government-owned
car.
	   The crowd then continued down the city's main street to the
prime minister's office. Protesters began firing at the third
floor, which contains Nano's offices. Troops responded by shooting
over the protesters heads.
	   The crowd forced its way into the three-story building, traded
pistol shots with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano
and his Cabinet were holding an emergency meeting on the
deteriorating situation following Hajdari's slaying.
	   The ministers scurried out a side exit through the smoke and
amid explosions of gas tanks of cars that the protesters had set on
fire. The crowd returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed after Berisha appealed for calm at a brief rally.
	   President Rexhep Meidani also urged restraint and called on
police to find Hajdari's killers as quickly as possible. The
Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs 100,000 reward
for information leading to their arrest.
	   Hajdari's supporters planned to transfer his body later Sunday
to the sprawling Skanderberg Square in the heart of the capital for
an all-night vigil until the funeral service at 11 a.m. (0900 GMT)
Monday.
	   The shooting has inflamed tensions in already-unstable Albania,
where Berisha's Democratic Party has tried to organize mass
resistance against the Socialist Party government that replaced it
last year.
	   Hajdari, 35, was one of the most popular and dynamic figures in
Albanian politics. He was a former student leader known as ``The
Hero'' for his opposition to Albanian Communist rule.
	   He was shot by gunmen from two parked cars as he left the party
headquarters. He died later in hospital. One of Hajdari's two
bodyguards also was killed, police said.
	   Nobody immediately claimed responsibility, but Berisha blamed
Nano's party. The former president, in a statement Sunday, gave
Nano 24 hours to resign or the opposition would use ``all means''
to force him out.
	   Albania, one of the poorest countries in Europe, has barely
recovered from last year's nationwide riots which exploded after
the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many people
their life savings.

US men, Romanian women defend eight boat world titles
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ The United States and Romania ended
their world rowing championship campaigns on a high note Sunday,
each successfully defending their prestigious eights titles.
	   The American crew, which included five men from the gold medal
winning team at last year's worlds, held off a fierce attack by the
Germans to cross first in 5 minutes, 38.78 seconds and defend their
title.
	   Germany, with almost a completely new crew, closed in
dangerously on the Americans in the final 500m (550-yards), but
were unable to convert, crossing a tiny .68 seconds back.
	   The American victory marked the first time a men's team has
managed to defend its title since West Germany won in 1989 and
1990. A Unified German team won the event the next season.
	   ``Throughout the year there was the fear that American men can't
repeat,'' said Christopher Aherens, the American stroke. ``So we
used that as a focus. It kept us hungry and driving forward.
	   ``Our last title was great, but we wanted to bring it to a
higher level.''
	   Romania's women also defended their eights crown, completing the
2,000m course on the Fuehlinger See in 6:14.62.
	   This time the United States settled for silver, the American
women crossing second 1.19 adrift. Canada's women took the bronze
in 6:18.25.
	   Despite missing the coveted eights title, host Germany once
again clinched the overall, capturing five gold and five silver
medals.
	   Italy was the second most successful nation, collecting three
golds, three silvers and three bronzes. Britain, which also won
three titles, also had a silver. The United States sat fourth
overall, with a tally of two golds, three silvers and four bronzes.
	   The Americans' second gold medal came as a surprise with a
spectacular victory in the lightweight double sculls.
	   Joining forces just six weeks ago, Americans Sarah Garner and
Christine Collins led throughout most of the race, scarcely
challenged, to cross first 7:03.73. The duo finished a solid 2.80
ahead of defending champion Germany, while Romania took bronze,
trailing by 5.72.
	   Garner, the lightweight single scull titlist last year, and
Collins, a three-time world champion in other lightweight
disciplines, both switched to double sculls, the only women's
Olympic lightweight event, so they could compete in Sydney.
	   ``I'm really psyched and surprised by how it's going,'' said
Garner, who underwent shoulder surgery earlier this year. ``We
hoped for top three but never dreamed we'd actually win.''
	   Australia's Oarsome Foursome, the 1996 coxless four champions
Nick Green, James Tomkins, Mike McKay and Drew Ginn, clinched gold
in the coxed four.
	   Steered by Brett Hayman, the four cruised to victory, crossing
in 6:09.43, almost four seconds ahead of Croatia, second in
6:12.97. Italy was third in 6:13.59.
	   The Olympic champions missed selection for the coxless four this
season, after illness kept them out of Australian trials. Instead
they opted for the coxed four, then split up to compete in the
pairs events.
	   On Sunday Green and Tomkins won gold in the coxed pairs with
Brett Haymen, and McKay and Ginn took silver in the coxless.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu called
President Clinton a friend and predicted he will survive. German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl hoped the United States' role in the world
has not been compromised.
	   And newspapers around the world devoted pages Sunday to the
crisis in Washington over lurid revelations about Clinton's
extramarital sex life, including his encounters with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Many editorial writers concluded Clinton will remain in office,
despite what Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says is a raft of
impeachable offenses.
	   ``More than ever, le Comeback Kid seems determined to fight,''
headlined France's weekly Journal de Dimanche newspaper.
	   ``More perhaps than any politician in history, he has the guile
and stamina'' to survive, opined London's Sunday Telegraph, a
frequent critic of Clinton. ``But if he does, it will be a victory
for the political art rather than a victory for honor.''
	   In contrast, Hong Kong's English-language daily, The South China
Morning Post, felt that ``the time has come for Bill Clinton to
stop apologizing and resign himself to the fact that his fight for
survival has reached its end.''
	   Netanyahu said Clinton was ``a friend to Israel'' with the
strength to survive.
	   ``My impression is the American society, the democracy and
presidency are very, very secure institutions and I imagine they
will get through this in peace,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Kohl was concerned that the U.S. president ``must retain his
ability to govern.''
	   ``It is of utmost importance that the only world power can fully
take on its tasks. Asia, Africa, India _ everywhere there are
problems,'' he was quoted as telling Bild am Sonntag.
	   Many abhorred the graphic detail in Starr's report.
	   The major Japanese newspaper Asahi called it ``vivid and
disgusting'' and bemoaned the damage done to the U.S. president at
a time when he needs to show firm leadership in the world.
	   ``President Clinton's sex scandal has none of the political
aspects of Watergate,'' the paper said, but concluded that ``if
this damages the credibility of American politics as well as the
leadership of President Clinton, it can no longer be treated as a
personal problem.''
	   In an editorial titled ``Hell is American,'' the French
center-left daily Le Monde, which ran a 16-page supplement, called
the Starr investigation a ``new McCarthyism,'' referring to Senator
Joe McCarthy who led a bitter campaign in the 1950s to expose
public figures suspected of having communist sympathies.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Domingo Martinez singled home a run against Kip
Gross in the two-run first inning as the Seibu Lions edged the
Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 2-1 at Seibu
Dome Sunday.
	   The second-place Lions are only a half game behind the Fighters.
	   Former Triple-A Rochester player Martinez's single came after
Gross gave up a walk and hit Ken Suzuki with a pitch. Then, Koji
Otsuka hit a one-run single.
	   Gross (1-2), formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, limited the
Lions to two hits over six innings, but took the loss.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks scored three runs in
the first inning and went on to beat the Kintetsu Buffaloes 7-4.
	   The Hawks, who extended their winning streak to three, moved
into third place. The Hawks are only a half game behind the Lions
and one game behind the Fighters.
	   At Kobe, Takeshi Hidaka singled home the winning run in the
bottom of the 10th inning, giving the Orix BlueWave a 4-3 victory
over the Chiba Lotte Marines.
	   In the Central League, the front-running Yokohama BayStars
rapped out 16 hits, including a three-run home run by Toshio Haru
and trounced the Hanshin Tigers 11-0 at Yokohama.
	   The BayStars are 3 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who beat the Yomiuri Giants 7-4 at Tokyo Dome.
	   The Dragons Takeshi Yamasaki drove in four runs with two home
runs. He has 24 homers this season.
	   Sun Dong-yol, formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of South Korea's
professional Baseball League, held the Giants hitless in the last
inning for his 26th save.
	   At Hiroshima, Eric Anthony drove in five runs with two home runs
as the Yakult Swallows beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 10-5.
	   Anthony, formerly with the Los Angeles Dodgers, hit a three-run
home run in the sixth and a two-run homer in the ninth. He has 12
homers this season.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia set a relay world record
and swept all five golds in the pool at the Commonwealth Games
Sunday.
	   The quartet of Ian Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski, Matt Dunn and
Michael Klim, recorded seven minutes, 11.86 seconds in the 4x200
freestyle relay to beat the record of 7:11.95 set by the Unified
Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   Second place England was almost 12 seconds behind as the
Australians confirmed their domination in the pool in the most
emphatic way after victories in Sunday's four other swimming
events.
	   The world record was especially satisfying for Klim, a quadruple
world titlist in January who was beaten in the 200-meter individual
freestyle by Thorpe on Saturday and Geoff Huegill in Sunday's 100
butterfly.
	   ``I hadn't had the best of meets so far but this was a new one
and I put the others behind me,'' said Klim,
	   ``I knew I was capable of it and just wanted to go out there and
prove it.''
	   The parade of gold medals at the National Aquatic Center took
Australia's total to 13, with England the closest challenger on
four, while host Malaysia won the first Commonwealth Games tenpin
bowling title Sunday for its first of the Games.
	   The Australians also won the women's team gymnastics and women's
pairs tenpin title and two shooting golds.
	   Huegill began the five-star Australian performance in 100-meter
butterfly sweep ahead of Adam Pine and world record holder Klim in
51.81, a Games record.
	   Susie O'Neill won her sixth Commonwealth gold medal by
overpowering England's Karen Pickering in the 200 freestyle in
2:00.24 and Trent Steed held off a late charge by England's James
Hickman to win the 400-meter individual medley for another Aussie
triumph.
	   Former world record holder Samanatha Riley cruised to an easy
victory in the 200 breaststroke, leaving two Canadians behind in
silver and bronze, and then came the best of all, the relay world
record.
	   Although Thorpe, who Saturday missed the 9-year-old world 200
freestyle mark by .01, was well outside this time on the opening
leg, the quartet stayed well inside the relay record throughout the
swim.
	   Outside of the pool, host Malaysia won the first Commonwealth
men's tenpin bowling title while its women took silver in the
women's double event.
	   With Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in the crowd, the men's
doubles pairing of Kenny Ang and Ben Heng overwhelmed their
opponents to win the title by a huge 223 pins with Bermuda's Conrad
Lister and Antoine Jones second and Australia's Francis Ryan and
Michael Muir third.
	   Maxine Nable and Cara Honeychurch won the women's event for
Australia ahead of Malaysia's Lai Kin Ngoh and Shalin Zulkifli with
England's Gemma Burden and Pauline Buck.
	   Tenpin bowling was one of six new sports added to the schedule
for these Games.
	   In the women's 92 kilometer road race, Canada's Lyne Bessette
pounced on a blunder by Australian cyclist Anna Wilson with the
finish line in sight to burst through and win the gold.
	   A half length ahead of Besette and New Zealand's Susy Pryde with
400 meters to go, Wilson had the lead in the 92-kilometer road race
around rainy Kuala Lumpur when her left foot slipped out of the
pedal as she prepared to charge to the line.
	   The Australian lost speed and momentum and Bessette saw her
chance. The Canadian hit the front, closely followed by the Kiwi
and Bessette crossed the line a cycle length ahead of Pryde for the
gold medal with the Australian two lengths back third.
	   All three riders were given 2 hours 24 minutes 59 seconds with
Louise Jones of Wales a distant fourth, more than 1 1/2 minutes
behind.
	   The Australian quintet of Allana Slater, Lisa Skinner, Trudy
McIntosh, Zeena McLaughlin and Katarina Frketic triumphed in the
gymnastics arena with England taking the silver and Canada the
bronze.
	   Australian and English competitors each gained two more golds on
the shooting ranges at Langkawi Island, off Malaysia's east coast.
	   Christine Trefry and Annette Woodward won the women's pairs
sport pistol and Carolyn Quigley and Kim Frazer triumphed in the
women's pairs prone sport rifle.
	   England's Nigel Wallace and Chris Hector won the men's pairs air
rifle and Nick Baxter and Michael Gault took gold in the pairs free
pistol.
	   But the two dominant nations in the shooting bowed to India's
Mansher Singh and Manavjit Singh in the pairs trap competition.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Klim lifted Australia's
4x200-meter freestyle relay team to a world record, capping the
country's clean sweep of all five of Sunday's swimming gold medals
at the Commonwealth Games.
	   Klim fought back after a disastrous individual 100-meter
butterfly event to join Ian Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski and Matt Dunn
in recording 7 minutes, 11.86 seconds, .09 inside the Unified
Team's record at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   ``I hadn't had the best of meets so far but this was a new one
and I put the others behind me,'' said Klim. ``I knew I was capable
of it and just wanted to go out there and prove it.''
	   Australian coach Don Talbot wasn't surprised by Klim's relay
swim.
	   ``Peer group pressure helps to get them up and he wouldn't dare
swim badly at the end. They'd choke him,'' Talbot said.
	   Earlier, Geoff Huegill inflicted another crushing defeat on
butterfly world record holder Klim to start Australia's gold rush.
	   Australia has won eight of the 10 golds contested here and is
aiming for the record 25 golds it achieved in 1994 in Victoria,
Canada.
	   Klim was beaten in the 200-meter individual race, another event
which he won at the world titles, by Thorpe Saturday.
	   The 15-year-old Thorpe missed the world record in that race by
.01 seconds, and was given another chance to break it in the
opening leg of the 4x200, but his 1:47.48 was well outside the
9-year-old mark of 1:46.69.
	   ``He's a young boy,'' said Talbot. ``He's not going to break
records to order.''
	   Huegill, starting from lane 4 with Klim out in lane 2, touched
the wall first in a games record 52.81 seconds. He won easily from
fellow Australian Adam Pine (53.09), with Klim (53.50) third for a
clean sweep of the medals.
	   ``I don't regard myself as the best around in this event yet,''
Huegill said. ``Michael is still the world record holder and I
think he deserves to stay as the No. 1 until someone can smash his
record.''
	   Klim set the world record at 52.15 late last year before winning
the title at the world championships. His life has been full of
sponsor commitments since then and his training background and
concentration are now on trial two years before the Sydney
Olympics.
	   England's James Hickman, the third fastest in heats, was
disqualified when the judges decided he had made an intentional
break. Hickman argued with an official but then sat down in his
chair to watch the start.
	   Hickman had a chance to atone two races later in the 400-meter
individual medley, and just missed the gold medal with a brave,
late surge at winner Trent Steed.
	   Hickman led out for the first half but Steed took over. He had a
strong lead going into the final 100 meters of freestyle and was
then lucky to hold the 22-year-old at bay.
	   ``I was a little bit disappointed (about the disqualification)
but I had another race to focus on so I couldn't dwell on it,''
Hickman said. ``There's no point crying about it (but) I'll
probably get angry about it later.''
	   Australia's Olympic and world butterfly champion Susie O'Neill
claimed her second gold, after winning Saturday's 4x200-meter
relay, with victory in the 200-meter freestyle Sunday. It was her
ninth Commonwealth medal, and sixth gold, stretching back to 1990.
She has entered eight events here.
	   O'Neill touched in 2 minutes, 0.24 seconds, with English veteran
Karen Pickering doing well to pick up silver in 2:01.19. Canada's
Jessica Deglau, the fastest qualifier, claimed bronze.
	   Pickering was a double gold medalist in Victoria in 1994 but at
26 was expected to struggle here.
	   O'Neill, who needs three more golds to match Michael Wenden as
Australia's most prolific Commonwealth champion, said she had an
upset stomach before Sunday's races.
	   ``I was a bit worried,'' O'Neill said. ``I would have liked to
have gone faster than that, so I might just use that as an
excuse.''
	   Former world champion Samantha Riley, fighting back after
missing a medal at the world championships, powered out early and
comfortably won the women's 200-meter breaststroke.
	   Riley finished in 2:27.30, with Canada's Courtenay Chuy and
Laura Van Oosten taking silver and bronze.

Police find 150 gold bars hidden in fugitive financier's

<TEXT>
	   AREZZO, Italy (AP) _ Fugitive Italian financier Licio Gelli had
something of a golden touch when it came to geraniums and begonias:
150 ingots' worth, as it turned out.
	   Italian newspapers said Sunday that police found the gold bars,
valued at more than dlrs 1.76 million, buried in huge terra-cotta
pots brimming with flowers that decorate the terrace of Gelli's
mansion in Tuscany.
	   The reports said at least some of the gold might come from a
cache the Italian fascists stole from Yugoslavia during World War
II.
	   The 79-year-old Gelli is one of Italy's more colorful
characters. He headed the once-powerful and secretive P2 Masonic
Lodge and was a key player in the fraudulent collapse of Italy's
largest private bank.
	   Until P2 was exposed in 1981, Gelli ran a covert, anti-communist
network of people in the government, military and, probably,
financial circles. The lodge was suspected of plotting to install a
right-wing dictatorship in Italy.
	   Equally spectacular was the 1983 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
brought down by dlrs 1.3 billion in loans made to dummy corporation
in Latin America.
	   Gelli was convicted of complicity in the bank collapse and
sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison. But he slipped
away from his mansion in Arezzo, the Villa Wanda, in May shortly
after the conviction was upheld.
	   He was arrested last week on the French Riviera and is now in a
hospital in Nice.
	   Italian news reports said police were apparently tipped to the
hidden gold by documents confiscated from Gelli's hideout in the
French resort town of Cannes.
	   Digging into the flowerpots with bare hands, police unearthed
150 gold ingots weighing 164 kilos (363 pounds) and valued at 3
billion Italian lire (dlrs 1.76), the reports said.
	   They said some of the ingots bear stamps from Eastern European
countries, and are believed to have be part of 60 tons of gold the
Italian fascists stole in 1942 from Yugoslavia; 20 tons of which
disappeared. Italian newspapers said that Gelli was one of the
people in charge of guarding the gold.
	   This isn't the first time, Gelli's been caught with a stash of
gold bars.
	   In 1983, when Gelli was living as a fugitive in Buenos Aires
during the P2 investigation, police found a 10-ingot stash. Another
250 kilos (550 pounds) were found stashed in Swiss banks in 1996.
	   In addition, police found dlrs 3.5 million worth of currency in
a secret room in Gelli's son's apartment in Arezzo last July.

German Greens under fire on terror suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens faced pressure Sunday to
dump a prominent politician who has admitted he channeled money for
years to a left-wing terrorist suspect.
	   The Free Democrats, a party in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling
coalition, urged the Greens to withdraw Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a
former leftist radical, from his seat in the European Parliament.
	   A lawmaker from the opposition Social Democrats called for a
probe into Cohn-Bendit's links with Hans-Joachim Klein, who was
arrested in a French cafe last week after 22 years on the run.
	   Klein's capture shortly before Germany's Sept. 27 election has
raised suggestions, notably by his lawyer, that the timing was
politically motivated to boost Kohl's re-election campaign.
Government officials have denied any link.
	   Cohn-Bendit says he helped finance Klein while he lived under a
false name in a village in Normandy.
	   The Free Democrats' parliamentary leader, Hermann-Otto Solms,
said over the weekend that keeping Cohn-Bendit in the European
parliament would cast doubt on the Greens' commitment to the German
constitution.
	   Willfried Penner, a Social Democrat who heads parliament's
domestic affairs committee, called for an investigation into the
Greens politician.
	   ``This could involve obstruction of justice,'' he was quoted
Sunday as telling the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
	   Klein _ believed to be a former accomplice of Cold War terrorist
``Carlos the Jackal'' _ had been sought for alleged involvement in
a 1975 attack on an OPEC conference in Vienna in which three people
were killed.

Police find 150 gold bars hidden in fugitive financier's

<TEXT>
	   AREZZO, Italy (AP) _ Fugitive Italian financier Licio Gelli had
something of a golden touch when it came to geraniums and begonias:
150 ingots' worth, as it turned out.
	   Italian newspapers said Sunday that police found the gold bars,
valued at more than dlrs 1.76 million, buried in huge terra-cotta
pots brimming with flowers that decorate the terrace of Gelli's
mansion in Tuscany.
	   The reports said at least some of the gold might come from a
cache the Italian fascists stole from Yugoslavia during World War
II.
	   The 79-year-old Gelli is one of Italy's more colorful
characters. He headed the once-powerful and secretive P2 Masonic
Lodge and was a key player in the fraudulent collapse of Italy's
largest private bank.
	   Until P2 was exposed in 1981, Gelli ran a covert, anti-communist
network of people in the government, military and, probably,
financial circles. The lodge was suspected of plotting to install a
right-wing dictatorship in Italy.
	   Equally spectacular was the 1983 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
brought down by dlrs 1.3 billion in loans made to dummy corporation
in Latin America.
	   Gelli was convicted of complicity in the bank collapse and
sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison. But he slipped
away from his mansion in Arezzo, the Villa Wanda, in May shortly
after the conviction was upheld.
	   He was arrested last week on the French Riviera and is now in a
hospital in Nice.
	   Italian news reports said police were apparently tipped to the
hidden gold by documents confiscated from Gelli's hideout in the
French resort town of Cannes.
	   Digging into the flowerpots with bare hands Friday night, police
unearthed 150 gold ingots weighing 164 kilos (363 pounds) and
valued at 3 billion Italian lire (dlrs 1.76), the reports said.
	   They said some of the ingots bear stamps from Eastern European
countries, and are believed to have be part of 60 tons of gold the
Italian fascists stole in 1942 from Yugoslavia; 20 tons of which

After broken promises, German city asks which candidate can keep

<TEXT>
	   CHEMNITZ, Germany (AP) _ More than any other city, the former
Karl-Marx-Stadt is a monument to east Germany's communist past,
with enormous block-long buildings imposing on wide boulevards and
a huge bronze head of Karl Marx himself. Its slogan: ``Workers of
the world, unite!''
	   What remains in the city, which reclaimed its pre-communist name
of Chemnitz after the Berlin Wall fell, is the husk of a discarded
system. There's not a glimmer of the promises voiced and implied
when democracy and capitalism arrived nine years ago in a joyous
swoop.
	   As Germany approaches its third national election since East and
West were unified, the mood nationally favors change. Across the
east, however, it's one of skepticism that any candidate can keep
his promises to a region where so many have been broken.
	   Chemnitz (pronounced KEM-nitz), is eastern Germany's fourth
largest city but by no measure does it reflect the prosperity of
Europe's richest country.
	   While other downtowns buzz on Friday afternoons with workers
wrapping up the week's business, Chemnitz drags with economic
lethargy: no bustle and plenty of parking. While shoppers crowd
other cities on Saturdays, the commercial center of Chemnitz is
empty.
	   Twice before, eastern voters have flocked to Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, the man who engineered German unification. Kohl is
campaigning for re-election on his image of stability, a strong
hand in uncertain times.
	   The message of change belongs to his challenger, Gerhard
Schroeder of the Social Democrats. Promoting political renewal
after 16 years of conservative rule, Schroeder pledges on the one
hand to restore social programs cut by Kohl's Christian
Democrat-led government and on the other to establish a
business-friendly climate.
	   Both men promise to create jobs to ease unemployment edging 10.6
percent nationwide and 17 percent in the east. But eastern voters,
far more than in the west, listen with the skeptical ears of the
disappointed.
	   In 40 years of communist leadership, the promise of a socialist
utopia was never realized. And the ``blooming landscapes'' of
democratic capitalism promised by Kohl have not taken root in the
stony center of Chemnitz _ or in much of eastern Germany.
	   ``It's not just the lack of jobs and lower incomes,'' says
Torsten Kleditzsch, chief political writer at the city's daily, Die
Freie Presse. ``Many eastern Germans don't feel like true citizens
of Germany. People feel like they have very little influence on the
political life.''
	   When candidates talk, east German voters listen for clues to how
promises will be kept. How unemployment will be reduced. Where the
money will come from to improve training and education of young
workers. How restored social programs will be financed.
	   In early September, 2,000 people packed a Chemnitz auditorium to
hear Schroeder speak during a three-day campaign swing through
eastern Germany. He backed the cornerstone of his platform _ job
creation _ with bravado: ``If we haven't reduced unemployment in
four years, then we won't deserve to be re-elected.''
	   The audience applauded. But many left wanting details.
	   ``He tried to appeal to most people by saying only that he wants
change. But for people who think more deeply about politics, it's
nothing. He said nothing concrete,'' said Sebastian Andrae, a
first-time voter completing his obligatory year of civil service.
	   Schroeder failed that day to win Andrae's vote.
	   Neither candidate has given voters much to bank on, and polls
reflect a growing sense of disillusionment. Both Schroeder and Kohl
have slipped in popularity in eastern Germany in the five months
since campaigning began.
	   Gregor Gysi, parliamentary leader of the ex-communist Party of
Democratic Socialism, is by far the most popular politician in the
region, with 42 percent support to Schroeder's 33 percent and
Kohl's 21 percent.
	   Gysi isn't a candidate for chancellor, but his appeal could draw
voters who are looking for change to his party, bleeding support
from Schroeder's Social Democrats.
	   Chemnitz, with an unemployment rate of nearly 20 percent, is no
worse off than other eastern cities. But in investment terms, it
lags behind Leipzig, a trade-fair city, and Dresden, an emerging
technological hub.
	   Long an industrial center, Chemnitz was hit hard by the
transition to a market economy, when privatization closed
inefficient state-run industry and thousands of textile and
machinery jobs were lost.
	   Production at the city's surviving factories may be as strong as
ever, but it is achieved with fewer workers. In 1989, there were
90,000 industrial jobs in Chemnitz. Today, there are 15,000 to
17,000.
	   A saying often repeated by the popular state governor, Kurt
Biedenkopf, reflects Chemnitz' place in the economic order: ``Money
is earned in Chemnitz, traded in Leipzig and handed out in
Dresden.''
	   Many here are looking for a candidate to provide the political
spark that will change that, and revive Chemnitz.

	   VITEZ, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ On the main road through this
Bosnian Croat stronghold, campaign posters are plastered with
pictures of indicted war crimes suspects.
	   Top international officials traveling through Vitez during
Bosnia's two-day election this weekend could see them. NATO-led
foreign troops patrolling the town can't miss them.
	   But no one has ordered them removed, even though people indicted
for war crimes are banned from any role in public life, including
the election Saturday and Sunday for national leaders.
	   It is another chapter in Bosnia's story of hatred and confusion
that always ends with the timeless adage _ the more things change,
the more they stay the same.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since Bosnia's
devastating 3 1-2-year war ended in 1995, was run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Voting
concluded Sunday, with first results expected Tuesday.
	   It gave voters a choice between hard-line ethnic leaders from
the war era and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan
that halted the fighting.
	   Under the Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two
entities _ a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters
selected a three-member presidency _ one from each ethnic group _
along with a national parliament and separate parliaments in each
entity.
	   Bosnian Croats are the smallest of the three ethnic groups and
believe they are being squeezed out by the former war rivals. Their
fears are clear from their words and the campaign billboards in
Vitez, 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Sarajevo and the
hometown of some Bosnian Croats indicted for war crimes against
Muslims and Serbs.
	   Most posters for Kresimir Zubak, the Bosnian Croat on the
three-member Bosnian presidency, have been defaced with black paint
or burned. Zubak left the hard-line Croatian Democratic Union to
create the more moderate New Croatian Initiative.
	   Some rival posters for Ante Jelavic of the Croatian Democratic
Union have photos of indicted war crimes suspects Dario Kordic and
Tihomir Blaskic plastered on them. Both are on trial before the
U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Netherlands.
	   ``I'm not optimistic. We don't have any future anymore,'' said
Ivan Obradovic, 57, a Bosnian Croat refugee from Travnik who voted
in Vitez. ``What was happened between (the rival parties) is the
worst thing that could happen to us Croats.''
	   He blamed Zubak, saying the former judge ``changed his position
like a Gypsy changes his horse.''
	   Pensioner Anto Strbac, 65, said he hoped the election would
somehow improve things by giving people a choice, unlike the war
years and the decades of communist rule before that.
	   ``Conflict between Bosnian Croats is sinking us,'' said Strbac,
who is missing his left leg and lives with his wife on a pension of
60 German marks (dlrs 33) a month. ``I don't know, maybe this cleft
will mean something better in the future.''
	   The voting was hindered by computer glitches that caused a few
dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations to fail to open
Saturday. All but one operated on Sunday.
	   Bosnian Serb police arrested one man Sunday after a group
entered a voting station and damaged a ballot box, according to
U.N. police spokesman Andrea Angeli. The incident occurred in
Lokanj, a Bosnian Serb village about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for election considered
crucial to the future of the Dayton peace accord.
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   The Western allies hope ethnic-driven political parties that
waged the war lose support this weekend and eventually fade away.
They blame hard-liners for obstructing implementation of the peace
plan, which calls for the estimated 1 million people displaced by
the war to return to their homes.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments favoring ethnically pure
territories remain strong, and the outcome of major races involving
hard-line candidates was uncertain.
	   A total of 83 parties and coalitions, as well as independent
candidates, are listed on the complicated ballots, with voters only
choosing leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than
2.7 million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people were registered.

Schummaker wins at Monza, ties Hakkinen in world standings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _Michael Schumacher fought back from a
disastrous start, led the Ferrari trials in Sunday's Italian Grand
Prix and tied championship leader Mika Hakkinen atop the world
standings.
	   The sixth season victory gave the German driver of the Ferrari
team a total of 80 points, the same as Hakkinen, who finished
fourth in the 14th championship event.
	   Schummacher led British teammate Eddie Irvine by 37.9 seconds
following 53 dramatic laps which initally looked a flop for the
home cars and then ended in a dream result.
	   His younger, brother Ralf Schummacher, drove his Jordan-Mugen
Honda, to third place, with a gap of 41.1 seconds.
	   Hakkinen, who spun off while dueling with his Ferrari rivel for
first place in the race, trailed the winner by 55.6 seconds, in a
McLaren-Mercedes, only pocketing three points.
	   He entered the Italian race with a seven-point lead.
	   Nearly 100,000 home team fans went wild as Ferrari drivers took
the two top places with Schumacher bettering his chances to win his
third world drivers title.

No Mission Impossible as Aussies clinch first gymnastic gold

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Five Australians, one dancing to
the theme from ``Mission Impossible,''' won the Commonwealth Games
team gold medal in women's gymnastics Sunday. It was Australia's
first team gymnastics victory at the Games.
	   The teenage students garnered 111.408 points to defeat defending
champion England, which got 110.640 points in a neck and neck
competition that remained in the balance until the last rotation.
The bronze went to Canada, which had 108.884.
	   ``We are so excited. We were up to a slow start but we did it as
a team,'' said Australian all-round champion Zeena McLauglin as she
and and her teammates grouped outside the arena, still clad in
purple leotards, waiting for the medal presentation ceremony.
	   ``This was the best performance I have ever seen from Australian
girls,'' manager Frances Crampton said. ``It is history.''
	   Australia went into its last routine, the floor exercises,
leading by a half point over England, which was doing its final
performance on the balance beam.
	   After three false starts, Lisa Skinner, a 17-year-old who
finished 36th overall at the Atlanta Olympics, performed to
``Mission Impossible'' scoring heavily with a clean 1 1/2 twist and
artistic body movements.
	   A couple of fumbles cut her score to 8.875, which Australia
eventually dumped under the rule to pick the best three results
from four performers.
	   With pressure building, Trudy McIntosh _ at 14 the youngest
Australian in the Commonwealth squad _ produced a near flawless
performance of 9.337, getting enormous heights in her somersaults.
	   McIntosh had earlier produced the best performance of the day on
the balance beam with a score of 9.725.
	   Allana Slater, 17, followed McIntosh with 9.362, executing a
perfect thrid line: a double twist forward. The last one to go in
was McLaughlin. With her act crucial to consolidating a victory,
the 17-year-old from Melbourne, came up with the team's best score
of 9.550.
	   Meanwhile, England started disastrously with Annika Reeder
slipping on the balance beam, a misstep that brought her score down
to 8.712. England cast it aside to take the best scores of Lisa
Mason (9.675), Kelly Hackman (9.362) and Melissa Wilcox (9.012).
	   But their combined score of 28.049 was not enough to overtake
the Australians who had built upon their 0.568 point lead on the
floor. Katarina Frketic was used only on the balance beam where she
scored 9.237.
	   Asked who was the heroine of the day, the girls cried: ``Our
coaches!''
	   The English competitors, traditionally strong on tumbling and
twisting, also suffered on the uneven bars, getting a low score of
26.737 points.
	   Asked if they were under pressure, knowing that their final
routines would make the difference between gold and silver, the
English girls chorused: ``No!''
	   ``I felt quite relieved,'' said Mason.
	   ``We were not looking at the scores,'' said Reeder. ``We were
just trying to enjoy ourselves.''

Senior Iranian official survives assassination attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES and EDITS throughout with IRNA saying official was not
injured. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A senior Iranian official in charge of a
multibillion dollar foundation survived an assassination attempt
Sunday, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Mohsen Rafiqdoust, a former minister of the Revolutionary Guard
Corps, was in his high-rise office in North Tehran when shots were
fired through the window from nearby hills, IRNA reported.
	   The agency initially suggested Rafiqdoust had been injured,
saying he was ``in satisfactory condition'' and ``received no
serious injuries. But later it said Rafiqdoust was not hurt.
	   An official at his foundation, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Rafiqdoust had attended prayers about 2{ hours
after the incident.
	   ``I was tending to my daily work when suddenly the window of my
office was sprayed with bullets,'' IRNA quoted Rafiqdoust as
saying. ``It shows that they (perpetrators) had been planning this
for a while.''
	   Rafiqdoust blamed the shooting on ``counter-revolutionaries who
are trying to show that Iran is unsafe.''
	   ``The enemies of the Islamic revolution want to hit at the
regime by assassinating those serving it,'' Rafiqdoust told IRNA.
	   ``I would be proud to be martyred for the revolution,'' he said.
	   The attack on Rafiqdoust, who heads the Bonyad Mostazafan and
Janbazan, a foundation devoted to helping the poor and veterans of
the 1980-88 war with Iraq, was the second on a member of the ruling
establishment in less than a month.
	   Assadollah Lajevardi, a former Iranian chief prosecutor and head
of Iran's Prisons Organization, was shot and killed by two gunmen
on Aug. 23 near his drapery shop in Tehran's grand bazaar.
	   The Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq opposition group claimed
responsibility for Lajevardi's assassination.
	   Rafiqdoust was a middle-class merchant who became a key official
after the 1979 Islamic revolution. He organized security for
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's return from exile to lead the
revolution.
	   He drove Khomeini from the airport to the Behesht-e-Zahra
cemetery, where the leader made his first speech.
	   Rafiqdoust later became minister of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps but was dismissed after hundreds of thousands of
dollars allocated for weapons in the 1980-88 war with Iraq went
missing. The corps is a paramilitary force whose primary mission is
protecting the Islamic revolution.
	   His dismissal followed major battlefield defeats in the war.
	   In 1989, Rafiqdoust was named head of the Mostazafan foundation,
a multibillion dollar state conglomerate originally formed by the
takeover of the ousted shah's Pahlavi Foundation.
	   It later accrued the assets of wealthy Iranians who fled or were
executed. It controls more than 100 companies involved in such
diverse activities as hotels, real estate, food processing and
household goods.
	   The foundation is controlled by Iran's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is not accountable to anyone but him.

Kabila on way to Mauritius for another summit on Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo-Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Deeply divided southern African
leaders gathered Sunday on this Indian Ocean island with plans to
yet again tackle the Congo crisis.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila was expected to be one of five
opening speakers on Sunday, but a spokesman said he would probably
arrive late and miss the opening ceremonies at the two-day Southern
African Development Community gathering.
	   Kabila was en route to the meeting, where he planned to repeat
previous pleas for all 14 SADC countries to condemn the alleged
invasion of Congo by Rwanda and Uganda, the South African Press
Association cited Kikaya Binkarubi, Congo's charge d'affairs in its
Zimbabwe embassy, as saying.
	   Heads of state have failed on three previous summits to broker a
cease-fire in the six-week-old attempt by rebels, backed by Uganda
and Rwanda, to unseat Kabila's government.
	   Three SADC countries _ Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola _ have sent
troops to back Kabilia. But South African President Nelson Mandela,
the chairman of the organization, has opposed a military solution
and sought a negotiated settlement.
	   The crisis is the most serious threat to security in central
Africa in years.
	   Mandela warned Saturday that a brokered cease-fire would take
some time to implement, and dismissed questions from reporters
about the possibility of intervention by the United Nations.
	   The Congo crisis was expected to overshadow SADC's intention to
discuss political and economic integration in the region.
	   Twelve SADC countries would be represented by their presidents,
with only Malawi and the Seychelles sending lower level officials.
	   African defense leaders meeting in Ethiopia failed Saturday to
agree on a cease-fire.

Drechsler Wins Women's Long Jump, Ending Jones' Winning Streak

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Germany's Heike Drechsler
leaped 7.07 meters to win the women's long jump at the World Cup
Sunday, ending American Marion Jones' unbeaten string at 37
victories this year.
	   Jones came into the event's final day with high expectations
after setting World Cup records in the women's 100- and 200-meter
sprints at Johannesburg's high altitude of 1,650 meters above sea
level. But she could manage only 7.0 meters on the wet track --
well below her best this year of 7.31.
	   The 34-year-old Drechsler, two-time world champion, had two
jumps of 7.07, and as she rose the first time from the sand she
pumped her arms and cheered.
	   China's Guan Yingnan finished third with a jump of 6.74.
	   Drechsler said the chilly, damp conditions made the long jump
more difficult than usual, but she had special incentive going
against the highly touted Jones. Jones had not lost in the 100,
200, long jump or relays this year.
	   ``It's not easy to jump in these conditions,'' Drechsler said.
``But it was motivation for me jumping against her.''
	   The 22-year-old Jones refused to use the weather as an excuse.
It rained off and on during Sunday's events, with a temperature of
7 degrees Celsius.
	   ``I can't blame the weather. It's the same for all of us. It's
not as if it just got cold just for me,'' Jones said.
	   Despite running her best times ever in the sprints on Friday and
Saturday, Jones said she was happy to be done competing in
Johannesburg.
	   ``I'm ready to go home,'' she said. ``My body's due for some
rest.''
	   On the track, local favorite Frankie Fredericks of Namibia raced
to victory in the men's 200-meter sprint in 19.97 seconds, his best
time over the distance this year. Gentry Bradley of the United
States finished second in 20.38 with Troy Douglas of the
Netherlands third at 20.40.
	   Frederick's time set a World Cup record, breaking the mark of
20.00 by Brazil's Robson da Silva in 1989.
	   ``When the fans come out, you have to perform,'' Fredericks
said. ``I am very pleased with the time today.''
	   American Charles Austin outdueled Cuban Javier Sotomayer in the
men's high jump, clearing 2.31 for the title. Sotomayer was second
at 2.28.

Top seeds Nicol, Fitz-Gerald advance to quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ World No. 1 Peter Nicol of
Scotland advanced easily Sunday to the quarterfinals of the
Commonwealth Games squash tournament, but two others among the top
eight men's seeds were ousted.
	   Welsh player David Evans, seeded 11th, beat No. 5 Simon Parke of
England 9-4, 0-9, 2-9, 9-5, 9-1, and No. 16 Craig Wapnick of South
Africa defeated No. 8 Byron Davis of Australia, 1-9, 9-4, 9-4, 9-4
in a match marked by a series of collisions.
	   Nicol advanced by beating No. 10 Graham Ryding of Canada 9-4,
9-4, 9-1.
	   In Monday's quarterfinals, Nicol meets No. 7 Mark Chaloner of
England, who edged No. 9 Martin Heath of Scotland 9-2, 9-6, 2-9,
9-10, 9-5.
	   No. 2 Jonathan Power of Canada defeated No. 14 Zarak Jehan Khan
of Pakistan 9-6, 9-0, 9-4, advancing to a meeting with Evans.
	   Wapnick next plays No. 4 Alex Gough, a 9-6, 9-1, 3-9, 9-7 winner
over No. 15 Kenneth Low of Malaysia.
	   No. 3 Rodney Eyles will meet No. 6 Paul Johnson of England.
Eyles ousted fellow Australian David Palmer, the 12th seed, 10-9,
7-9, 9-2, 9-7. Johnson beat another Australian, No. 13 Craig
Rowland, 10-9, 9-5, 9-5.
	   In women's competition, the top eight seeds all advanced, led by
world No. 1 Sarah Fitz-Gerald, who ousted No. 12 Natalie Grainger
of South Africa 9-5, 9-0, 9-0.
	   She next plays England's Suzanne Horner, seeded 5th, a 9-2, 9-2,
9-5 winner over No. 16 Carla Venter of South Africa.
	   No. 2 Michelle Martin beat Australian compatriot Robyn Cooper,
the 11th seed, 9-3, 10-8, 9-3. She next meets No. 8 Linda Charman
of England, who won 9-6, 9-6, 9-0 against Nicol David, a
15-year-old Malaysian crowd favorite who was cheered on by the
nation's king during their match.
	   In other quarterfinals, No. 3 Cassie Jackman of England meets
No. 6 Carol Owens of Australia, and No. 4 Sue Wright of England
plays No. 7 Leilani Joyce of New Zealand.
	   Jackman had the hardest time advancing, finally overcoming No. 9
Claire Nitch of South Africa, 7-9, 9-1, 9-4, 6-9, 10-8.

Michael Schumacher wins at Monza, ties Hakkinen in world standings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with detail, quotes, ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Michael Schumacher fought back from a
disastrous start, led a 1-2 Ferrari triumph in Sunday's Italian
Grand Prix and tied championship leader Mika Hakkinen atop the
world standings.
	   The sixth season victory gave the German driver of the Ferrari
team a total of 80 points, the same as Hakkinen who finished fourth
in the 14th championship event.
	   Schumacher led British teammate Eddie Irvine by 37.9 seconds
following 53 dramatic laps which initially looked a flop for the
home cars and then ended into a dream result.
	   Michael's younger brother, Ralf Schumacher, drove his
Jordan-Migen Honda to third place, with a gap of 41.1 seconds.
	   Hakkinen, who spun off while dueling with his Ferrari rival for
first place, still completed the race in a McLaren-Mercedes, only
pocketing 3 points. He trailed the winner by 55.6 seconds.
	   Jean Alesi, in a Sauber-Petronas and Damon Hill, in a
Jordan-Mugen Honda, finished within championship points, in fifth
and sixth place respectively.
	   Hill, winner of the previous GP in Belgium in which both
Schumacher and Hakkinen did not finish, was the first of the lapped
drivers.
	   Thousands of fans, waving red-and-yellow Ferrari flags, flocked
into the track as Schumacher completed a triumphant parade left
after winning the race in one hour, 17 minutes, 9.672 seconds at an
average speed of 237.591 kph (147.306 mph).
	   Hakkinen, who had antered the Italian GP with a seven-point
lead, took advantage of a slow start of Schumacher from the pole
position to lead the initial laps.
	   The bad start of the idolized German driver, which dropped
Schumacher to fourth place, silenced a crowd of nearly 100,000
Ferrari supporters.
	   The fans regained their hope and enthusiasm in the 17th lap when
McLaren's David Coulthard, who had driven past Hakkinen in the
ninth lap, blew the engine of his car while Schumacher charged from
third to first overtaking Hakkinen with a daring attack just before
the Lesmo corner.
	   ``Yes, I made a terrible start,'' Schumacher said. ``At one
moment I thought I could not save my race and reach the leading
McLarens. I'm overjowved for winning at Monza.''
	   It was Schumacher's second win at Ferrari home track in three
years.
	   As the Schumacher brothers celebrated their first podium ever
together, Michael embraced the younger Ralf who prevented Hakkinen
to keep the championship leadership by one points beating the
Finnish driver for third place.
	   Sunday's victory at the home track of Ferrari boosted
Schumacher's chances to win his third world drivers title.
	   The decisive championship points will be awarded in the
remaining races _, the Luxembourg GP at Nurburgring on Sept. 27 and
the Japanese GP at Suzuka on Nov. 1.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A major Austrian bank said Sunday it is
ready for a ``comprehensive review'' of its Nazi-era past and has
already held ``constructive'' talks in New York to resolve claims
by Holocaust survivors.
	   In a statement, Creditanstalt and its parent company, Bank
Austria, said its attorneys met Thursday in New York with lawyers
for Holocaust victims on the compensation issue.
	   Although the statement made no mention of any agreement, the
bank said the ``confidential, constructive discussion'' was held
``in a good, objective atmosphere and will be mutually continued.''
	   The bank said it ``is extremely anxious to have a comprehensive
review of the role of'' Creditanstalt, which was taken over by
Germany's Deutsche Bank during the Nazi era.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of an opposition
leader, crowds stormed the main government building Sunday, setting
fire to the ground floor and sending Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers fleeing in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded as marchers and police traded gunfire. Clouds of smoke
from burning cars rose over the center of this former Communist
capital.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha urged his followers to remain
calm until Monday's funeral of popular politician Azem Hajdari, 35,
who was shot dead Saturday in front of opposition Democratic Party
headquarters.
	   Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and warned
him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping in grief,
chanted ``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The violence raised fears of a repeat of the 1997 nationwide
riots which swept this country after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Instability in Albania could spread throughout the southern
Balkans and impede U.S. and European efforts to solve the crisis in
neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for
independence from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. The
rebels maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania.
	   Hajdari, a charismatic former student leader and chief deputy of
Berisha, was mortally wounded Saturday by gunmen firing from a car
parked in front of Democratic Party headquarters. A bodyguard was
also killed.
	   Supporters planned to bring his body to the sprawling
Skanderberg Square for an all-night vigil before Monday's funeral.
President Rexhep Meidani called on police to find Hajdari's killers
as quickly as possible.
	   The Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs 100,000
reward for information leading to the arrest of the assassins.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Berisha
blamed Nano's party, and at a Sunday morning rally, the former
president warned the opposition would use ``all means'' to force
him out.
	   After Berisha issued his ultimatum, about 1,500 of his followers
marched to the Interior Ministry, firing pistols in the air and
pelting the building with stones.
	   After setting fire to a ministry vehicle, marchers continued
down the city's main street to the prime minister's office.
Protesters opened fire at the third floor, which contains Nano's
offices. Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the
protesters heads.
	   But the crowd forced its way into the building, traded gunfire
with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano and his
Cabinet were holding an emergency meeting at the time.
	   They fled out a side exit through the smoke and amid explosions
of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had set on fire.
The crowd then returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed at Berisha's urging.
	   Later Sunday, the government announced it would take ``all
measures necessary'' to defend the state against those ``calling
for revenge and blood.''
	   The government urged the Democratic Party ``to control armed
people, avoid confrontations with police and wait for the results
of the investigation.''
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buldings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.''
	   Everts said heads of the international organizations in Tirana
and all the foreign ambassadors would meet Monday to urge Albanians
to ``stay peaceful and don't answer to the appeals for
violence...''

Politicians protest ethnic Hungarian demands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Calling some ethnic Hungarian leaders
extremists, Romanian politicians on Sunday denounced Hungarian
demands for double citizenship and territorial autonomy.
	   Even Bela Marko, the moderate leader of the party which
represents the interests of Romania's 1.7 million Hungarian
minority distanced himself from some of the Hungarian claims,
although he added they were ``mere proposals.''
	   Politicians from a broad range of parties didn't take it like
that.
	   ``These decisions are designed to exacerbate splits (in the
government).. and many of the decisions are aberrations,'' said
Alexandru Sassu of the Democratic Party, which is in the
government. He was quoted by national news agency Rompres.
	   Sassu called the territorial demands ``unconstitutional.'' An
opposition leader Adrian Nastase said the ideas were ``a
revisionist form of Hungarian extremism.''
	   Bishop Laszlo Toekes, who is credited with sparking the 1989
anti-communist revolt, was one of the main author's of the demands.
	   There is currently a power struggle going on in the party called
the Union of Democratic Hungarians in Romania, between Toekes,
considered a hardliner, and Marko, a moderate.
	   Toekes and others feel that Marko has betrayed the interests of
Romania's second largest minority, after the party joined the
ruling coalition almost two years ago.
	   Ethnic Hungarians also protested military exercises and not
enough decision-making power at a local level. Romanians also make
similar protests.
	   Among the demands, was also the immediate return of Hungarian
church properties, seized by the Communists in 1948. Many
properties belonging to Romanian churches have not been returned.

Yeltsin hails opening of memorial chapel

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Patriarch blessing chapel; background
about chapel being dedicated to Chernobyl victims, other details. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With a tribute from President Boris Yeltsin, the
Russian Orthodox Church opened a new chapel Sunday dedicated to
victims of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.
	   The chapel at Moscow's Mitino cemetery, the final resting place
of 28 firefighters who died as a result of their service at
Chernobyl, is called ``Joy for All Who Grieve.''
	   Yeltsin sent a letter to those taking part in the opening
ceremony, paying tribute to all Russians who have perished while
fighting catastrophes and calling on the nation to remember their
heroism.
	   At the ceremony, the chapel was blessed by Patriarch Alexy II,
the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who also laid a wreath at
a memorial to Chernobyl victims.
	   Construction work on the chapel began on April 26, the 12th
anniversary of the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine,
which was then part of the Soviet Union.
	   ``Nature is unpredictable, and on some occasions we cannot
counter its destructive force. It is within our abilities, however,
to avoid conflicts, bloodshed and the deaths of people,'' Yeltsin
wrote.
	   ``Accord and civic peace in society depend on us, on our common
sense and goodwill.''

 &UR; Mubarak meets U.S. envoy on Mideast peace
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with meeting ending, comments from Ross and
Amr Moussa, Ross's departure.
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. envoy Dennis Ross said Sunday that
a wide gap still existed between the Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Ross met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak near the port
city of Alexandria to update him on his latest talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   ``I would say at this point that there are still many issues
that have to be worked through on all the parts of our
initiative,'' Ross said at a joint news conference with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa at the Bourg el-Arab air base near
Alexandria.
	   ``There are areas where ... some progress was made but there are
also other areas where there are differences that have to be
overcome,'' Ross said. He did not elaborate.
	   His meetings with Arafat and Netanyahu came against a tense
backdrop of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces
following Israel's killing of two wanted Hamas fugitives.
	   The Palestinians claimed that the killings were timed to doom
Ross's mission.
	   Moussa criticized the killings and urged restraint on both
sides. He said, however, the necessary ``calm atmosphere cannot
come only with a Palestinians commitment, but should also be an
Israeli one, particularly where extremist settlers are concerned.''
	   Talks between Israel and the Palestinians stalled more than a
year and a half ago after Israel announced that it was going ahead
with construction of a new Jewish neighborhood in Arab east
Jerusalem.
	   The two sides have been haggling over the American initiative.
	   Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, has been
a mediator in Middle East peace negotiations.
	   Ross left later for Jerusalem.

Taliban claims to have seized key center for Afghan opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 15 grafs with Iranian radio claim of Pakistani

ancient Buddhist archaeological treasures. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban army said Sunday
that it has seized a key stronghold in central Afghanistan from a
northern alliance of opposition forces. The claim could not
immediately be confirmed.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Muttaqi said Bamiyan, a city in
the central Afghanistan province of the same name, fell to the
religious army early Sunday.
	   Satellite telephone calls to the northern alliance's Bamiyan
headquarters were not answered, so no verification was immediately
possible.
	   The Taliban and its northern-based enemies are fighting on
several fronts. The Taliban army, which has vowed to restore peace
in the war-ravaged country and transform Afghanistan into a purist
Islamic state, has made significant progress in recent weeks.
	   Taliban fighter jets pounded Bamiyan on Saturday as part of an
offensive that began Friday. The Taliban also claimed on Saturday
that it seized an airport near Bamiyan, 125 kilometers (80 miles)
west of the capital of Kabul. The northern alliance denied the
claim.
	   Both sides routinely make contradictory claims in their battle
over the roughly 10 percent of Afghanistan still held by the
northern alliance, which is composed of minority ethnic groups.
	   Bamiyan was one of four provinces held by the alliance, and was
controlled by the Shiite Muslim group Hezb-e-Wahadat. The province
also is the site of key air bases, where Iran, which supports the
alliance is believed to have flown in military supplies.
	   Iran's state radio claimed Sunday that warplanes from
neighboring Pakistan, believed to support the Taliban, had been
spotted bombing of Bamiyan, causing heavy casualties. The report,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, cited an
anonymous northern alliance spokesman as saying Bamiyan was still
being bombed.
	   Pakistani officials reached in Islamabad said they had no
information about alleged Pakistani involvement in the attacks and
could not comment.
	   The loss of Bamiyan to the Taliban would be a major blow to the
northern-based alliance which has suffered several serious setbacks
in recent months. The Taliban movement is dominated by Sunni
Muslims, who are in the majority in Afghanistan
	   On Sunday, Taliban-controlled Kabul radio also claimed that four
northern alliance commanders and their troops switched sides in the
conflict to join the Taliban in their offensive on Bamiyan.
	   There also were reports over the weekend that hundreds of Shiite
Muslims were fleeing the areas because they were afraid invading
Taliban troops would kill them.
	   In an attempt to prevent retaliatory attacks on Shiite Muslims,
the Taliban-run radio has been issuing almost nightly warnings to
its troops to ``protect'' their Shiite captives and newly conquered
areas.
	   The Taliban also promised on Sunday to protect two Buddhist
archaeological treasures in Bamiyan province. Two years ago, the
Taliban vowed to destroy the world's largest Buddha statues if they
captured Bamiyan. The Buddhas were built about 1,500 years ago and
before Islam became the dominant in Afghanistan.
	   Abdur Rahman Huttaqi, a spokesman for the religious army, said
Sunday that the Taliban had ordered its fighters to preserve the
statutes, the largest of which is 57 meters (190 feet) tall.
Taliban considers them symbols of idol worship, which it forbids.

Montenegrin government deports Kosovo refugees to Albania

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Authorities in Montenegro deported
about 3,000 Kosovo refugees Sunday, transporting them to the
Albanian border after refusing them admission to the republic's
already crowded refugee centers.
	   The authorities claimed the move was due to security reasons and
that the cash-strapped Montenegro _ Serbia's smaller partner in
what's left of Yugoslavia _ could no longer provide for the influx
of refugees from the the war-torn Serbian province.
	   The drama began Friday when the 3,000 ethnic Albanians appeared
at the Montenegrun border town of Plav after having made a
treacherous journey on foot over a mountain gorge dividing Kosovo
and Montenegro.
	   But police at Plav, 60 kilometers (37.5 miles) northeast of
capital Podgorica, denied them entry.
	   Having nowhere to turn, the group camped for two days and nights
under open skies, in chilly mountain weather, with only a few
hundred blankets and meager food provided by local relief
officials.
	   On Sunday, Montenegrin police loaded the refugees on buses and
drove them to the Albanian border at Vrmos. The border is normally
closed but was opened in order to allow the refugees to cross by
foot into Albania.
	   ``This is a shame. They are our citizens, why should they be
deported to Albania, a foreign country,'' said Hakija Ljesnjanin, a
relief worker. Kosovo Albanians, along with Montenegrins, hold
Yugoslav citizenship.
	   But Montenegrin deputy Premier Dragisa Burzan, who visited the
site Sunday, said the refugees welcomed the decision to send them
to Albania.
	   The stormy weather had made it evident they could no longer stay
put, he said. The refugees had also refused to be separated and
declined an earlier government offer to bring the women and
children into Plav.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to what he said were
official reports that there were gunmen and arms among the
refugees.
	   The police, fearing there were members of the Kosovo Liberation
Army among the refugees, did not come into close contact with the
group but claimed to have discovered a ``large amount of various
arms and some uniforms scattered along the trail'' the refugees had
covered.
	   Most of the 3,000 refugees were women and children, Burzan said.
	   ``We distributed food parcels as the refugees came on board our
buses that drove them to Vrmos,'' Burzan said.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
Fernando del Mundo, confirmed that UNHCR had been advised by
Montenegro of the move but warned of another crisis.
	   ``We have reports of at least 3,000 more Kosovo refugees are
currently on the move towards Montenegro and its sealed border,''
del Mundo said.
	   On Friday, Montenegro government at an urgent session decided it
could no longer accept refugees from Kosovo. This small republic
has already registered more than 40,000 refugees from the war-torn
province.
	   With about 30,000 refugees sheltered in Montenegro since the
wars in Bosnia and Croatia, this constitutes a total of 72,350
refugees _ the equivalent of 11.6 percent of Montenegro's
population.

Festival erupts into controversy as its director quits

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ The Venice Film Festival erupted into a
frenzy of excitement even before the prizes were handed out Sunday
when the director suddenly announced he was quitting and called the
competition ``stupid and arrogant.''
	   Felice Laudadio, in his second year as the head of the
prestigious festival, said he thought the festival had too many
movies _ and too many prizes.
	   In his resignation letter, Laudadio proposed a radical change:
no competition and no awards, except for the movie the audience
likes best. ``This way only the most loved movie will get an
award,'' he said.
	   His resignation instantly sparked rumors of political
interference, with reporters questioning whether he'd been under
pressure see that the main prize goes to an Italian film. Laudadio
sharply denied any pressure.
	   The prizes, which will be announced at a ceremony Sunday night,
awarded by an international jury.
	   His resignation is especially surprising given the good
reception the festival got this year. Industry insiders say Venice
was back in form, with a good mix of Hollywood and foreign films.
	   Laudadio snubbed Hollywood last year and was also criticized for
giving Italian films the cold shoulder. This year, he included a
number of high-profile American movies in the festival and was
careful to showcase a number of Italian productions.
	   The critics were generally warm to Hollywood, but savaged many
of the Italian offerings.
	   Laudadio also pared down the program to just over 100 films,.
about a third the number screened the year before.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Battered by its worst flooding in
decades, Bangladesh is set to face stunted economic growth for some
years and it will take billions of dollars to repair the damage to
the nation and its economy, analysts said Sunday.
	   ``The investment needed to replenish the damages to the economy
may go up to 10 percent of the Gross Domestic Product,'' said
Wahiduddin Mahmud, former finance and planning adviser to the
government. Bangladesh's GDP during the last fiscal year was dlrs.
34 billion.
	   But fighting hunger and disease remained the immediate concerns
of the government and international relief agencies in a country
where at least 35 million people _ a quarter of the country's
population _ are suffering due to the floods.
	   More than 10 million people could be at risk from
life-threatening waterborne diseases or malnutrition, The New
Nation daily Sunday quoted a senior United Nations official as
saying. The devastating flood has already claimed 900 lives.
	   ``Once the water recedes, there will be virtually no food or
work for millions, so the government will have to feed them and
provide employment,'' said Khushi Kabir, a local volunteer.
	   The Bangladeshi government has issued an international appeal
for relief worth dlrs. 880 million, including dlrs. 112 million
food aid. Relief is pouring in.
	   The United States flew in a chartered jet Saturday with plastic
sheets, woolen blankets and water purifying units that will be
distributed in flood-hit areas by CARE, a U.S.-based humanitarian
organization.
	   Two C-130 US aircraft with 46 officers of the U.S. Air Force
also arrived in the Bangladeshi capital Saturday to help the relief
effort.
	   Neighboring India, where severe floods have claimed more than
2,500 lives, was sending 200,000 metric tons of food grain to
Bangladesh, officials said. New Delhi also has sent medicines worth
dlrs 100,000.

Michael Schumacher wins at Monza, ties Hakkinen in world standings

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Michael Schumacher fought back from a
disastrous start, led a 1-2 Ferrari triumph in Sunday's Italian
Grand Prix and tied championship leader Mika Hakkinen atop the
world standings.
	   The sixth season victory gave the German driver of the Ferrari
team a total of 80 points, the same as Hakkinen who finished fourth
in the 14th championship event.
	   Schumacher led British teammate Eddie Irvine by 37.9 seconds
following 53 dramatic laps which initially looked a flop for the
home cars and then ended into a dream result.
	   Michael's younger brother, Ralf Schumacher, drove his
Jordan-Mugen Honda to third place, with a gap of 41.1 seconds.
	   Hakkinen, who spun off while dueling with his Ferrari rival for
first place, still completed the race in a McLaren-Mercedes, only
pocketing 3 points. He trailed the winner by 55.6 seconds.
	   Jean Alesi, in a Sauber-Petronas and Damon Hill, in a
Jordan-Mugen Honda, finished within championship points, in fifth
and sixth place respectively.
	   Hill, winner of the previous GP in Belgium in which both
Schumacher and Hakkinen did not finish, was the first of the lapped
drivers.
	   Thousands of fans, waving red-and-yellow Ferrari flags, flocked
into the track as Schumacher completed a triumphant parade lap
after winning the race in one hour, 17 minutes, 9.672 seconds at an
average speed of 237.591 kph (147.306 mph).
	   Hakkinen, who had antered the Italian GP with a seven-point
lead, took advantage of a slow start of Schumacher from the pole
position to lead the initial laps.
	   The bad start of the idolized German driver, which dropped
Schumacher to fourth place, silenced a crowd of nearly 100,000
Ferrari supporters.
	   The fans regained their hope and enthusiasm in the 17th lap when
McLaren's David Coulthard, who had driven past Hakkinen in the
ninth lap, blew the engine of his car while Schumacher charged from
third to first overtaking Hakkinen with a daring attack just before
the Lesmo corner.
	   ``Yes, I made a terrible start,'' Schumacher said. ``At one
moment I thought I could not save my race and reach the leading
McLarens. I'm overjoyed for winning at Monza.''
	   It was Schumacher's second win at Ferrari home track in three
years.
	   As the Schumacher brothers celebrated their first podium ever
together, Michael embraced the younger Ralf who prevented Hakkinen
to possibly keep the championship leadership by one point, beating
the Finnish driver for third place.
	   Sunday's victory boosted Schumacher's chances to win his third
world drivers title.
	   The decisive championship points will be awarded in the
remaining races _, the Luxembourg GP at Nurburgring on Sept. 27 and
the Japanese GP at Suzuka on Nov. 1.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The editor-in-chief and a prominent
correspondent for a major Georgian newspaper were attacked by an
armed group in downtown Tbilisi, police said Saturday. Both were
hurt, one seriously.
	   There was no indication why the group attacked the two men, who
work for the daily newspaper Asaval-Dasavali. The paper is
considered politically independent and influential.
	   The editor, Lasha Nadareishvili, was seriously injured in the
attack, according to Algudzha Dzhamburia, chief of the police
district where the incident occurred Friday night. Correspondent
David Okropiridze was hit in the head with the butt of a gun, but
was less seriously hurt.
	   Dzhamburia said the incident is under investigation.

Drugs, water and politics mix at IOC board meeting

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ten years after the biggest doping
scandal in Olympic history, the IOC is back in Seoul to discuss its
latest strategy for fighting the use of performance-enhancing
drugs.
	   The International Olympic Committee executive board begins a
four-day meeting Monday that was scheduled to coincide with the
10th anniversary of the Seoul Games.
	   Those games, which marked a turning point in South Korea's path
to democracy, came off without the political boycotts which marred
previous Olympics and without the feared terrorism or military
action from rival North Korea.
	   But the 1988 games are also remembered for Ben Johnson, the
Canadian sprinter who rocketed to victory in the 100-meter dash in
an astonishing 9.79 seconds _ only to get stripped of his gold
medal and world record after testing positive for steroids.
	   Ten years on, the problem of performance-enhancing drugs is more
acute than ever, brought back to the top of the IOC agenda after
the revelations of systematic doping which nearly wrecked this
summer's Tour de France.
	   The IOC announced a major initiative at an emergency board
meeting in Lausanne last month, outlining plans to form a special
agency to coordinate random drug-testing around the world.
	   Further details will be discussed at this week's meeting. The
four IOC vice presidents who serve on the 12-member board are
leading the project, which will be finalized at a Feb. 2-3
anti-doping summit in Lausanne.
	   Conspicious by his absence in Seoul will be Prince Alexandre de
Merode, chairman of the IOC medical commission and the
organization's top official in the anti-doping fight.
	   De Merode is no longer a member of the executive board but, as
head of the medical panel, would normally submit a report. However,
IOC officials said he was presiding over a sports and television
conference in Monte Carlo.
	   De Merode courted controversy last month when he accused Spanish
sports doctors of having a ``tendency towards doping.'' The IOC
subsequently convened a clear-the-air meeting with de Merode and
Spanish officials. Afterwards, the IOC issued a statement praising
Spain's anti-doping record.
	   On other issues, Sydney organizers will report to the IOC on
preparations for the 2000 games, which begin two years from
Tuesday.
	   Most of the recent focus has been on Sydney's water crisis. More
than 3 million residents of the city have been boiling tap water
after tests revealed dangerous levels of contamination.
	   But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, speaking last week at
the Commonwealth Games in Malaysia, said he he had been assured the
water problems would be fixed before the Sydney Games.
	   Organizers of the 2004 Athens Games will make their first
detailed progress report to the IOC board, less than two weeks
after Samaranch and other IOC officials visited the Greek capital
to get a first-hand look at the venues.
	   Also present in Seoul this week are representatives of the six
cities bidding for the 2006 Winter Games. They are Sion,
Switzerland; Zakopane, Poland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin,
Italy; Klagenfurt, Austria; and Helsinki, Finland.
	   Seoul will be the setting for the IOC session next June when the
2006 host city is selected.
	   Behind the scenes, this week's meetings provide an ideal
political platform for South Korea's top Olympic official, Kim
Un-yong.
	   Kim, a senior member of the IOC executive board, is considered
among the potential candidates to succeed Samaranch when his latest
term expires in 2001.
	   Kim has invited dozens of IOC members to Seoul for the 10th
anniversary celebrations.
	   In a special supplement Monday, The Korea Times runs a
flattering profile of Kim, praising his role as the ``driving
force'' behind the 1988 Games and citing his ``crowning
achievement'' of getting taekwondo approved as an official Olympic
sport in Sydney.

Bierhoff chosen Germany's player of the year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff, the AC Milan striker
and new German captain, has been chosen Germany's Player of the
Year for the 1997-98 season, according to a poll published Sunday.
	   Bierhoff, who was the leading scorer in the Italian league last
season when he scored 27 goals for Udinese, got 501 votes in a poll
of sports writers conducted for the soccer magazine Kicker.
	   Lothar Matthaeus, the 37-year-old Bayern Munich veteran, was a
distant second in the annual poll was 196 votes.
	   Olaf Marschall, the striker who helped Kaiserslautern win the
Bundesliga title last season, took third place with 107 votes.
	   ``This vote compensates for all the difficult years,'' Bierhoff
said.
	   Bierhoff, 30, had an undistinguished career in Bundesliga clubs
and became a national team player only after blooming in Italy.

Montgomerie wins; Garrido can't overcome 4-stroke penalty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Montgomerie, Garrido quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COVENTRY, England (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie shot a closing round
3-under 69 Sunday to win the British Masters by one stroke over
Sweden's Pierre Fulke and Eduardo Romero of Argentina.
	   Fulke closed with a 5-under 67 and Romero was almost as good
with a 68.
	   Three players finished two strokes back _ Andrew Oldcorn (68),
Ignacio Garrido (69) and Paolo Quirici (72). Quirici led by a
stroke after three rounds.
	   Montgomerie, fighting a slight slump the last few months,
birdied the 13th, 14th and 17th holes to win 125,000 pounds (dlrs
210,750) at the Forest of Arden course in central England.
	   The 35-year-old Scot has a remarkable record on this course. In
five events here, he's now won twice and been second three times.
	   ``I just seem to play well here,'' he said. ``It's always nice
to come to a course where you have won.
	   ``But this is very satisfying because I've been struggling with
my game for the last two months and I've won in very demanding
conditions. It's nice to come back.''
	   Montgomerie, who has won the European PGA money title the last
five years, now trails leader Lee Westwood by 34,446 pounds (dlrs
58,076) and No. 2 Darren Clarke by 25,050 (dlrs 42,234) with four
events to play.
	   Clarke, who led after two rounds, managed only 20th place with a
3-over 75. Westwood shot 2-under 70 and finished 12th.
	   The hard luck story belonged to Ryder Cup Spaniard Ignacio
Garrido. He finished two strokes behind Montgomerie but would have
won had it not been for a four-stroke penalty in the second round
after it was discovered he had a 15th club in his bag, one more
than the permitted number.
	   It belonged to his caddie, a professional himself who was
practicing for a European tour pre-qualifying event and left his
own 5-iron in Garrido's bag by mistake.
	   ``I had to forget the penalty and I still thought I could win,''
Garrido said. ``I did well to get really close, but unfortunately
four shots was too big an advantage to give the rest.
	   ``Every time my caddie looked at the scoreboard he knew I should
be winning. You can imagine how he felt _ terrible.''

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Germany's Heike Drechsler
leaped 7.07 meters to win the women's long jump at the World Cup
Sunday, ending American Marion Jones' unbeaten string at 37
victories this year.
	   Jones came into the event's final day with high expectations
after setting World Cup records in the women's 100- and 200-meter
sprints at Johannesburg's high altitude of 1,650 meters above sea
level. But she could manage only 7.0 meters on the wet track --
well below her best this year of 7.31.
	   The 34-year-old Drechsler, two-time world champion, had two
jumps of 7.07, and as she rose the first time from the sand she
pumped her arms and cheered.
	   China's Guan Yingnan finished third with a jump of 6.74.
	   Drechsler said the chilly, damp conditions made the long jump
more difficult than usual, but she had special incentive going
against the highly touted Jones. Jones had not lost in the 100,
200, long jump or relays this year.
	   ``It's not easy to jump in these conditions,'' Drechsler said.
``But it was motivation for me jumping against her.''
	   The 22-year-old Jones refused to use the weather as an excuse.
It rained off and on during Sunday's events, with a temperature of
7 degrees Celsius.
	   ``It's the same for all of us. It's not as if it just got cold
just for me,'' Jones said.
	   Despite running her best times ever in the sprints on Friday and
Saturday, Jones said she was happy to be done competing in
Johannesburg.
	   ``I'm ready to go home,'' she said. ``My body's due for some
rest.''
	   In the three-day team competition, Africa won the men's title
with 110 points, followed by Europe in second with 109 and Germany
third with 102. The Americas had 97, the United States 94, Britain
89, Asia 64 and Oceania 53.
	   The United States won the women's title with 96 points, with
Europe second at 94 and Africa third at 88. Russia had 87, the
Americas 81, Germany 75, Asia 45 and Oceania 42.
	   Local favorite Frankie Fredericks of Namibia raced to victory in
the men's 200-meter sprint in 19.97 seconds, his best time over the
distance this year. Gentry Bradley of the United States finished
second in 20.38 with Troy Douglas of the Netherlands third at
20.40.
	   Frederick's time set a World Cup record, breaking the mark of
20.00 by Brazil's Robson da Silva in 1989.
	   ``When the fans come out, you have to perform,'' Fredericks
said. ``I am very pleased with the time today.''
	   American Charles Austin outdueled world record-holder Javier
Sotomayer of Cuba in the men's high jump, clearing 2.31 meters for
the title. Sotomayer was second at 2.28.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles, Germany's Falk Balzer upset
Britain's Colin Jackson, out-leaning the world record-holder at the
finish to win in 13.10. Jackson was second in 13.11 and Cuban Anier
Garcia took third at 13.14.
	   In other men's events, Germany's Dieter Baumann won the 3,000 in
7 minutes, 56.24 seconds and Britain's Steve Backley won the
javelin with a throw of 88.71 meters. The U.S. 1,600-meter relay
team of Mark Everett, Antonio Pettigrew, Joey Woody and Jerome
Young won with a time of 2:59.28.
	   In women's track events, Nigeria's Falilat Ogunkoya took the 400
in 49.52 and Romania's Gabriela Szabo won the 3,000 at 9:00.54. The
United States won the 400-meter relay, with Cheryl Taplin, Chryste
Gaines, Inger Miller and Carlette Guidry finishing in 42.00
seconds.
	   Germany's Franka Dietzsch claimed the women's discus title at
67.07 meters.
	   The World Cup offered dlrs 3.5 million in prize money.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of an opposition
leader, crowds stormed the main government building Sunday, setting
fire to the ground floor and sending Prime Minister Fatos Nano and
his ministers fleeing in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded as marchers and police traded gunfire. Clouds of smoke
from burning cars rose over the center of this former Communist
capital.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha urged his followers to remain
calm until Monday's funeral of popular politician Azem Hajdari, 35,
who was shot dead Saturday in front of opposition Democratic Party
headquarters.
	   Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and warned
him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping, chanted
``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The Interior Ministry reported ``unlawful developments'' in
``other towns'' but gave no further details. Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga also said the situation in the country's maximum
security prison was ``tense'' but without elaboration.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Tirana urged Albanians to ``put down their
weapons, crease threatening violence and pursue legitimate
democratic and legal means to deal with the situation.''
	   ``Leaders of all Albania's political parties must behave
responsibly,'' the American statement said.

Canada's Ross scores easy victory over old foe; two more Kenyans go
</HEADLINE>
out &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Canada's Troy Amos Ross pounded
out a one-sided Commonwealth Games points victory Sunday over Paul
Mgongo of Cameroon, the light-heavyweight he beat on the way to the
Olympic quarterfinal two years ago.
	   Fighting in the Commonwealths for the first time, the
24-year-old lefthander started slowly but repeatedly found the
target in the last three rounds to score a 20-6 victory and reach
the quarterfinal.
	   Ross, who lost to the eventual gold medalist, Vassili Jirov of
Kazakstan, in Atlanta, meets India's Gurcharan Singh for a place in
the semifinal. Gurcharan won his fight against Enroy Toney of St.
Vincent on a disqualication in round two.
	   Kenya's grim series of woes continued Sunday with the
elimination of two fighters in their first contests.
	   Light-middleweight Peter Ngumi was stopped in two rounds by
Australia's Richard Rowles and heavyweight Fredrick Oracho tumbled
to New Zealand's Garth Da Silva when the referee halted the contest
in round one.
	   That means that four of the Kenyan team, which won two titles at
the last Games in Victoria, British Colombia, are already out of
the competition after only two days of competition.
	   On Saturday, bantamweight Nicholas Oyugi and flyweight Bernard
Njoroge withdrew from their contests with the team saying they had
ankle injuries although officials at the arena suggested they did
not make the weight.

Look back in anger: dashed hopes on Oslo accords anniversary

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The fifth anniversary of the signing of the
landmark Oslo peace accords _ meant to usher in a new era in the
Middle East _ found Israelis and Palestinians united in only one
respect Sunday: an outpouring of sadness and anger.
	   The West Bank and Gaza were sealed off, locking tens of
thousands of restive Palestinian workers out of Israel. Israeli
soldiers fired rubber bullets and tear gas at stone-throwing
youngsters in the West Bank for a third straight day, injuring at
least five Palestinians. Islamic militants have made ominous
threats of revenge attacks.
	   And an American mediator was laboring at what many have come to
see as a Sisyphean task _ trying to break the 18-month
Israel-Palestinian deadlock. ``Dennis Ross has not visited us for
four months, and nobody missed him,'' an Israeli newspaper
commentary said.
	   The Oslo accords _ sealed on Sept. 13, 1993 by a sunlit
handshake between Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin on the White
House lawn _ were meant to set Palestinians on the road to eventual
autonomy and help Israel extricate itself from an endless cycle of
hatred and violence in the Palestinian territories it ruled.
	   That step toward peace, however incomplete and tentative,
nonetheless carried a heavy price.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said 279 Israelis have been
killed in terror attacks since the signing, and 315 Palestinians
have been killed by Israeli forces or civilians since then,
according to the Israeli human rights group Betselem.
	   The peace process, commentator Zvi Bar-El wrote in Sunday's
edition of the Haaretz newspaper, ``looks more and more like a
cease-fire between wars.''
	   On the anniversary day, both Israel and the Palestinian
governments laid blame for the seemingly intractable impasse on the
other side. At the street level, though, the tone was one of
simpler human sorrow.
	   ``I'm so disappointed, so disturbed by the Oslo agreements. ...
We were expecting a lot out of them,'' said Ahmad Jabel, 42, owner
of a small clothing store in the divided West Bank town of Hebron.
	   ``They promised us that we'd have an economy like Hong Kong or
Singapore,'' he said, shaking his head as he remembered those heady
early days. ``But in my shop, you don't see anyone buying clothes _
Some days we open and close without selling anything.''
	   To be sure, Oslo has wrought changes. The Gaza Strip is
self-ruled, and Arafat's Palestinian Authority controls the West
Bank's major population centers. The Palestinians have many of
statehood's trappings _ a parliament, armed forces _ and are slowly
building other institutions of a nascent nation.
	   But despite all that, Palestinians from all walks of life say
they often feel themselves a subject people. Jewish settlements
that dot the West Bank grow daily, Israeli soldiers patrol roads
and staff checkpoints, and at any time Israel can clamp shut its
borders to thousands of Palestinian workers, as it has for the past
three days.
	   On the Israeli side, ordinary citizens from both the right and
left agree that the quarrel with the Palestinians has reached fever
pitch. What they cannot agree on is how to prevent it from spiking
even higher.
	   For the right, spearheaded by the Jewish settler movement, the
solution is obvious: keep what they consider Israel's biblical
birthright _ the West Bank _ and abandon the peace accords.
	   ``Bury Oslo, not our dear ones!'' about 40 demonstrators shouted
Sunday at a protest outside the prime minister's residence. They
read lists of names of Israelis killed since the signing of the
accords, chanting after each: ``God will avenge this blood!''
	   The left-leaning Israelis who turned out in the tens of
thousands for a peace demonstration in Tel Aviv on Saturday night,
though, said it was the delay in carrying out Oslo's provisions
that was costing lives.
	   ``If what Israel wants is real security, then deepening the
hatred for your enemies is counterproductive,'' said demonstrator
Ilan Vitemberg. ``Everyone needs a safe place, but not at the
expense of others,'' echoed his friend, marcher Peter Olsen.
	   Palestinian impatience is growing daily, as could clearly be
seen Sunday when marchers in a squalid Bethlehem refugee camp
burned a black coffin labeled ``Oslo.''
	   ``The olive branch has fallen _ Long live the armed struggle!''
they shouted.
	   The Netanyahu and Arafat governments each say they'll continue
the peace process _ but those pledges are highly qualified ones.
	   ``We are committed to the agreement, as faulty as it is, on the
condition that it will be implemented by the other side, namely in
the area of the war on terror,'' Netanyahu told his Cabinet on
Sunday.
	   Palestinians have an additional motive for keeping Oslo alive _
because the accords' framework could play a key part in their
eventual declaration of statehood.
	   Arafat has said that declaration will come May 4, 1999, with or
without Israel's agreement _ because that, according to the
Palestinian interpretation, is when the Oslo accords expire.
	   ``For now, there is nothing we can do but shelter the flame of
peace we signed five years ago,'' Palestinian parliament speaker
Ahmed Qureia wrote in Sunday's al-Ayyam newspaper. ``That is
bringing us to the moment of the birth of our Palestinian state.''

Aussies, S. Africa allege rigging of hockey draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia and South Africa accused
Commonwealth Games host Malaysia on Sunday of manipulating the
men's hockey draw to favor itself.
	   Australian coach Terry Walsh questioned why the only teams in
Group B to play back-to-back games were both playing their second
game against Malaysia.
	   And South African coach David Carr said it was suspicious that
Malaysia had rest days before playing its toughest group opponents,
England and Canada.
	   Under the draw, Malaysia played highly rated Pakistan Sunday
night, a day after Pakistan drew 3-3 in a tough match with Canada.
Malaysia held Pakistan to a 1-1 draw.
	   Last Thursday, Malaysia beat Kenya 4-0 when the African country
was coming out of a clash with Pakistan the previous day.
	   ``It certainly seems suspicious that Malaysia is the only team
to play their toughest opposition after a rest day,'' Carr said.
	   ``Ah yes, Kenya had to play back-to-back and their second game
was against Malaysia. But that's the way sometimes the draw works.
It just happens that way, I think.''
	   Carr said the international governing body, FIH, should have
spotted the irregularity.
	   ``Whether you like it or not, these are the cold facts.''
	   Asked if he was insinuating anything, Walsh said: ``No, it's
quite obvious.''
	   In group A, all six teams _ Australia, India, New Zealand, South
Africa, Trinidad and Tobago and Wales _ play back-to-back games,
with no country gaining the advantage.
	   In Sunday's game against Pakistan, Malaysia scored when Chairil
Anwar Aziz tapped a penalty corner taken by a teammate into the
goal in the 15th minute. Pakistan's Ali Raza equalized through a
penalty corner in the 54th.
	   The draw has enhanced Malaysia's semifinal hopes as it stands
second in the group with four points. Pakistan leads the group with
five points.
	   Pakistan trounced the Malaysians 7-2 at the World Cup in May.
Malaysia beat Pakistan 2-1 at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl's Bavarian allies won state
elections Sunday, according to exit polls, giving the chancellor a
needed boost in his campaign for an unprecedented fifth term in
national voting just two weeks away.
	   The Christian Social Union, which rules in the national
parliament with Kohl's Christian Democrats, won about 52 percent of
the vote. Kohl's rivals, the Social Democrats, won 30 percent _
about the same results as four years ago. The liberal Green party
also won seats in the state parliament.

Spain's Olano claims overall lead with time trial win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALCUDIA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Spain's Abraham Olano of the
Banesto team stormed through Sunday's ninth stage individual time
trial to take the overall leadership of the Tour of Spain cycling
marathon.
	   Olano covered the 39.5-kilometer (24.5-mile) flat run in 47
minutes and 7 seconds. His closest rival, Melchor Mauri of the Once
team, needed 41 seconds more.
	   Prior to the ninth leg held on the island of Mallorca, one of
the Mediterranean Balearic Islands, Olano was at No. 5 in the
standings of the 22-stage Tour.
	   Fellow Banesto rider Jose Maria Jimenez, who went into the time
trial in the lead, needed over four minutes more than Olano to
peddle the windy course.
	   Switzerland's Alex Zuelle of Festina, one of the favorites to
take the stage, put in a disappointing performance and came in 2
minutes and 24 seconds behind the winning time.
	   But another favored sprinter, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of the
Once, put in a strong run and moved up one place in the overall
table to No. 2.
	   The cyclists are due a rest day Monday in preparation for a week
of grueling mountain stages through northern Spain.

Ventola salvages draw for star-studded Inter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With no help from its veteran stars, Internazionale
of Milan turned to an unheralded youngster to avoid a shocking
upset Sunday.
	   Striker Nicola Ventola came off the bench in the second half and
scored twice in five minutes as Inter rallied from a two-goal
deficit to earn a 2-2 draw against promoted Cagliari to open the
Italian League season.
	   The 20-year-old, acquired from Bari over the summer, produced on
an afternoon when Brazil's Ronaldo was serving a one-game
suspension carried over from last season and veterans Roberto
Baggio and Youri Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup
champions, were ineffective.
	   Inter was not the only big club that had trouble with a mediocre
one Sunday.
	   Italian Cup holder Lazio of Rome, widely considered a contender
for the Serie A title, allowed Piacenza's Simone Inzaghi _ younger
brother of former scoring champion Filippo _ to net his first
league goal with three minutes left and settled for a 1-1 draw on
the road.
	   And Juventus of Turin opened its quest for a third consecutive
championship with a dominant first half and poor second one, but
did manage to escape Perugia with a 4-3 win.
	   Putting a damper on the Juventus victory was an injury to
playmaker Zinedine Zidane, France's World Cup hero, who left the
game in the first half.
	   After Juventus took a 3-0 lead, Perugia fought back with two
goals by Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, fitting on a weekend
when 16 of the 27 goals were scored by foreigners.
	   In Sunday's other game, Bari edged Venezia 1-0.
	   On Saturday, German striker Oliver Bierhoff scored twice to lead
a rebuilt AC Milan past Bologna 2-0, AS Roma rallied for a 3-1
victory over promoted Salernitana, Fiorentina beat regional rival
Empoli 2-0, and Udinese and Sampdoria of Genoa drew 2-2.
	   The five games were pushed up one day to give extra rest and
preparation to clubs making UEFA Cup debuts Tuesday.

 &UR; Five hurt in clashes as envoy's talks continue &QL;

details on first clash &QL; 
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A third straight day of West Bank
clashes Sunday left five Palestinian youths injured from rubber
bullets fired by Israeli soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants, deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to retaliate against
Israel for its killing Thursday of two top fugitives, members of
the group's military wing who were wanted for alleged involvement
in attacks against Israel and planning others.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge attacks against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Friday and Saturday in several
West Bank cities. Those clashes left a total of 21 Palestinians
injured.
	   On Sunday, at Tekoa village on the outskirts of Bethlehem,
students threw stones at passing by army jeeps, and soldiers
responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring five of the
students.
	   Later in the day, about 100 protesters marched in Bethlehem's
Deheishe refugee camp, burning Israeli and American flags, but
there were no injuries reported.
	   Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
peace accords, which set a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy, and and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the
occasion to point to the continuing terror threat Israel faces.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   In efforts to avert a possible Hamas attack, Israeli security
forces canceled leaves for police and soldiers and troops fanned
out to cities throughout the country to protect shopping areas and
bus stops _ targets of previous suicide bomb attacks.
	   Despite the tensions, American envoy Dennis Ross continued in
his efforts to get Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to agree on a U.S. proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the
peace talks.
	   Under the intiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
work hard to contain anti-Israeli militants.
	   Ross had more talks set later Sunday with Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. He as
speaking to them together _ a break from his practice so far of
shuttling back and forth in separate meetings between the two
sides.
	   However, the talks, being held at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ned Walker, were centering on secondary issues including
the opening of a Palestinian airport and a so-called safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Neither side has reported any real progress in Ross' meetings,
which began Wednesday, and Netanyahu told his Cabinet that the
Palestinians were wavering on previously agreed to conditions.
	   ``There was progress in the talks with the Palestinians and we
had almost reached certain understandings but the Palestinians
backed down on these understandings,'' the prime minister said,
according to a Cabinet statement.
	   Netanyahu said in talks with Ross, he had demanded the
Palestinians suppress terror groups like Hamas as a condition for
advancing the peace process.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, have accused Israel as using
security matters as a pretext for delaying West Bank pullbacks it
had already promised to make.

	   ``If this result holds, it's a big defeat for the SPD, and gives

	   After scoring 52.8 percent in 1994, the CSU's worst showing in
years, Bavarian state Gov. Edmund Stoiber had said that anything
over 50 percent on Sunday would be a good result, giving Kohl a
``psychological boost'' to help him catch up to the Social

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Helmut Kohl's Bavarian allies won state
elections Sunday, according to exit polls, giving the chancellor a
boost in his flagging campaign for an unprecedented fifth term in
national voting just two weeks away.
	   The Christian Social Union, which rules in the national
government with Kohl's Christian Democrats, won about 52 percent of
the vote. Kohl's rivals, the Social Democrats, won 30 percent _
about the same results as four years ago. The liberal Green party
also won seats in the state parliament.
	   ``If this result holds, it's a big defeat for the SPD, and gives
us a big boost for the federal election,'' said Michael Glos, the
leader of the CSU in the federal parliament.
	   Bavarian state Gov. Edmund Stoiber had said that anything over
50 percent on Sunday would be a good result, giving Kohl a
``psychological boost'' to help him catch up to the Social
Democrat's popular chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Yet Kohl cannot rest easy. Many Bavarians who had planned to
vote for Stoiber were nevertheless disenchanted with Kohl, in
office for 16 years.
	   Armin Vogel, a civil servant who turned out to vote wearing
lederhosen and a woolen sweater, said Stoiber is far more popular
in Bavaria than Kohl.
	   An estimated 8.8 million Bavarians were eligible to vote. State
officials said voter turnout at midday, with rain across most of
the Alpine state and snow in the mountains, was running slightly
below the 1994 election, when turnout was 67.8 percent.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam and FC Utrecht both
dropped their first points of the season Sunday, drawing 2-2 in a
top-of-the-table crowd-pleaser.
	   The major beneficiary was Feyenoord Rotterdam, which now leads
the Dutch premiership outright with 12 points from four games, two
ahead of Utrecht, Ajax and Vitesse Arnhem.
	   Finn Jari Litmanen put Ajax ahead after just six minutes but
then American defender John O'Brien, on loan from Ajax, equalized
for his current employer on the stroke of half time.
	   South African Benni McCarthy looked to have won the game for
Ajax with a stylish goal but Utrecht came back hard in the closing
stages.
	   Tom van Mol was adjudged to have handled the ball in forcing it
into the Ajax net, but then striker Michael Mols scored a
legitimate equalizer.
	   In the dying minutes Ajax defender Mario Melchiot cleared off
the goal line to save a point for the Dutch champion, which starts
its Champions League campaign at Croatia Zagreb Wednesday.
	   In Sunday afternoon's other game Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink's
winner gave FC Twente a 1-0 win over RKC Waalwijk.

New Zealand, Australia, Fiji reach quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Running up big scores to boost
their places in the standings, New Zealand, Australia, Fiji and
South Africa led the way Sunday into the quarterfinals of the
Commonwealth Games rugby sevens tournament.
	   New Zealand, aiming to regain lost credibility after a series of
defeats in 15-a-side rugby, ran up 91 points without reply in a
game against the Bahamas in the games' 7-a-side competition in
which matches are only 14 minutes long.
	   Samoa, Canada, England and Wales rounded out the last eight in
the sport's Commonwealth Games' debut as the teams expected to make
it to the final stages all survived.
	   On Monday, New Zealand meets Wales, South Africa plays Samoa,
Fiji meets Canada, and Australia faces England. The semifinals and
gold medal game are scheduled later in the day.
	   Rankings for advancement depended on the number of tries scored,
and New Zealand racked up 22 in beating Tonga 41-12 and the Bahamas
91-0.
	   Tongan captain Taani Afu became the first player suspended from
the tournament.
	   He was sent off for a high tackle on a New Zealand opponent, and
was given a two-match suspension.
	   Tonga led 12-0 after two early tries and then 12-10 at halftime,
but the second half belonged entirely to New Zealand.
	   Australia amassed 21 tries in beating Papua New Guinea 59-14 and
then Sri Lanka 68-5.
	   World champion Fiji had 20 in lopsided victories of 63-5 over
Malaysia and 71-0 against Kenya.
	   South Africa shut out the Cook Islands 38-0 and Swaziland 79-0,
with a total of 19 tries.
	   Samoa upset England 19-12 before trouncing Trinidad and Tobago
85-0. England recovered with a 50-7 victory over the Trinidad team.
	   Canada beat Wales 45-7, but the Welsh still advanced thanks to a
62-0 victory over the Cayman Islands. Canada drubbed the Caymans
47-0.

ROME: debuts Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   At Cagliari, Roberto Muzzi assisted on Sierra Leone striker
Mohamed Kallon's goal in the 30th minute and then scored himself
with a header from 8 meters (yards) out in the 41st as Cagliari,
which finished third in Serie B last season, built its 2-0 lead.
	   But the game changed course in the 63rd, when Inter coach Luigi
Simoni pulled Baggio and Djorkaeff in favor of Ventola, 20, and
Andrea Pirlo, 19. Ventola rocketed an acrobatic scissors kick into
the lower corner from 12 meters (yards) away in the 77th, before
sliding to beat 'keeper Alessio Scarpi to the ball and tapping it
home in the 81st.
 &UR; Piacenza 1, Lazio 1 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, Inzaghi headed home the equalizer from 2 meters
(yards) out to steal a win from Lazio, which had taken the lead in
the 73rd minute when Yugoslav striker Dejan Stankovic, a reserve,
sent a long-distance blast under the crossbar.
 &UR; Juventus 4, Perugia 3 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids, Croat defender Igor
Tudor and Italian international Gianluca Pessotto each scored in
the opening 45 minutes for Juventus.
	   With Juventus content to sit on its lead, Perugia found plenty
of space to operate and Nakata took advantage. The 21-year-old
scored off close-range shots in the 51st and 59th minutes to cut
his club's deficit to 3-2. Uruguayan striker Daniel Fonseca, who
replaced Zidane, scored Juve's fourth goal in the 65th, while
Perugia added Antonio Bernardini's penalty kick with two minutes to
go.
 &UR; Bari 1, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, striker Gianluca Zambrotta chested down a cross and
drove the ball home from close range nine minutes into the match
for the hosts.
 &UR; Saturday's action: &QC; 
 &UR; Milan 3, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Bierhoff headed in French winger Ibrahim Ba's cross
from the right flank in first-half injury time and made it 2-0 in
the 51st minute with a penalty kick. Brazil's Leonardo added
Milan's final goal with nine minutes left.
	   Bierhoff, whose 27 goals for Udinese last season were the most
in Serie A in 37 years, was one of five new starters acquired by
Milan over the summer.
 &UR; Parma 0, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, midfielder Diego Fuser wasted two clear scoring
opportunities as the hosts' attack was not nearly as in synch as
the defense was.
 &UR; Roma 3, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Salernitana _ in the top flight for the first time in
50 years _ shocked the 62,650 spectators at Olympic Stadium by
taking the lead on Cameroon midfielder Rigobert Song's goal in the
41st minute. But defender Luca Fusco was sent off four minutes
later and the hosts capitalized, with two Paulo Sergio goals
bracketing one by Francesco Totti.
 &UR; Fiorentina 2, Empoli 0 &QC; 
	   At Florence, Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa scored in the sixth
minute and assisted on Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta's goal in
the 60th.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Sampdoria 2 &QC; 
	   At Udine, all four goals came in the first half. Midfielder
Jonathan Bachini and Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso scored for
Udinese, while Sampdoria scored off an own-goal and saw striker
Vincenzo Montella add the club's second.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second post-war
national elections ended peacefully Sunday, with voters turning out
in large numbers and several polling stations allowing people
waiting in line to vote after the official closing time.
	   Polling stations closed officially at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT), but
people waiting in line at 62 stations were permitted to cast their
votes after the closing time, according to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which ran the election.
	   The voting was hindered by computer glitches that caused a few
dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations to fail to open
Saturday. All but one operated on Sunday.
	   ``The OSCE wishes to convey to the voters our sincere apologies
for any inconveniences that yesterday's glitch caused,'' said OSCE
spokeswoman Nicole Szulc.
	   Bosnian Serb police also arrested one man Sunday after a group
entered a voting station and damaged a ballot box, according to
U.N. police spokesman Andrea Angeli. The incident occurred in
Lokanj, a Bosnian Serb village about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for election considered
crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
	   Turnout nationwide was described as heavy, with about 33 percent
of registered voters casting ballots Saturday and more than that on
Sunday. Initial returns were expected Tuesday.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, gave
voters a choice between hard-line ethnic leaders from the war era
and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan that halted
the fighting.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two entities _
a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters selected a
three-member presidency _ one from each ethnic group _ along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in each entity.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   Pensioner Anto Strbac, 65, said he hoped the election would
somehow improve things by giving people a choice, unlike the war
years and the decades of communist rule before that.
	   ``Conflict between Bosnian Croats is sinking us,'' said Strbac,
who is missing his left leg and lives with his wife on a pension of
60 German marks (dlrs 33) a month. ``I don't know, maybe this cleft
will mean something better in the future.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Western allies led by the United States and the European Union,
who effectively run the country now under the Dayton agreement,
hope ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war will lose
support this weekend and eventually fade away.
	   In the first post-war election in 1996 and a local ballot last
year, the ruling hard-line parties saw their backing decrease even
though they still won.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong and the outcome
of major races involving hard-line candidates was uncertain.
	   A total of 83 parties, coalitions and independent candidates,
were listed on the complicated ballots, with voters choosing only
leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than 2.7
million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people were registered.
	   Individual candidates ran for the three spots on the joint
presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while parties
competed for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also chose a republic president.

Police find 150 gold bars hidden in fugitive financier's

<TEXT>
	   AREZZO, Italy (AP) _ Fugitive Italian financier Licio Gelli had
something of a golden touch when it came to geraniums and begonias:
150 ingots' worth, as it turned out.
	   Italian newspapers said Sunday that police found the gold bars,
valued at more than dlrs 1.76 million, buried in huge terra-cotta
pots brimming with flowers that decorate the terrace of Gelli's
mansion in Tuscany.
	   The reports said at least some of the gold might come from a
cache the Italian fascists stole from Yugoslavia during World War
II.
	   The 79-year-old Gelli is one of Italy's more colorful
characters. He headed the once-powerful and secretive P2 Masonic
Lodge and was a key player in the fraudulent collapse of Italy's
largest private bank.
	   Until P2 was exposed in 1981, Gelli ran a covert, anti-communist
network of people in the government, military and, probably,
financial circles. The lodge was suspected of plotting to install a
right-wing dictatorship in Italy.
	   Equally spectacular was the 1983 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano,
brought down by dlrs 1.3 billion in loans made to dummy
corporations in Latin America.
	   Gelli was convicted of complicity in the bank collapse and
sentenced to 12 years and eight months in prison. But he slipped
away from his mansion in Arezzo, the Villa Wanda, in May shortly
after the conviction was upheld.
	   He was arrested last week on the French Riviera and is now in a
hospital in Nice.
	   Italian news reports said police were apparently tipped to the
hidden gold by documents confiscated from Gelli's hideout in the
French resort town of Cannes.
	   Digging into the flowerpots with bare hands Friday night, police
unearthed 150 gold ingots weighing 164 kilos (363 pounds) and
valued at 3 billion Italian lire (dlrs 1.76 million), the reports
said.
	   They said some of the ingots bear stamps from Eastern European
countries, and are believed to have be part of 60 tons of gold the
Italian fascists stole in 1942 from Yugoslavia; 20 tons of which
disappeared. Italian newspapers said that Gelli was one of the
people in charge of guarding the gold.
	   This isn't the first time, Gelli's been caught with a stash of
gold bars.
	   In 1983, when Gelli was living as a fugitive in Buenos Aires
during the P2 investigation, police found a 10-ingot stash. Another
250 kilos (550 pounds) were found stashed in Swiss banks in 1996.
	   In addition, police found dlrs 3.5 million worth of currency in
a secret room in Gelli's son's apartment in Arezzo last July.

Spain's Olano claims overall lead with time trial win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALCUDIA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Spain's Abraham Olano of the
Banesto team stormed through Sunday's ninth stage individual time
trial to take the overall leadership of the Tour of Spain cycling
marathon.
	   Olano covered the 39.5-kilometer (24.5-mile) flat run in 47
minutes and 7 seconds. His closest rival, Melchor Mauri of the Once
team, needed 41 seconds more.
	   Prior to the ninth leg held on the island of Mallorca, one of
the Mediterranean Balearic Islands, Olano was at No. 5 in the
standings of the 22-stage Tour.
	   Fellow Banesto rider Jose Maria Jimenez, who went into the time
trial in the lead, needed over four minutes more than Olano to
peddle the windy course.
	   Switzerland's Alex Zuelle of Festina, one of the favorites to
take the stage, had a disappointing performance and came in 2
minutes and 24 seconds behind the winning time.
	   But another favored sprinter, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of the
Once, put in a strong run and moved up one place in the overall
table to No. 2.
	   The cyclists are due a rest day Monday in preparation for a week
of grueling mountain stages through northern Spain.

Kosovo's major ethnic Albanian party pleads for calm in Tirana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The leading ethnic Albanian
political party in Serbia's strife-torn Kosovo province pleaded
Sunday for calm in neighboring Albania, saying unrest on Tirana
streets could only bring more distress to all Albanians.
	   The Democratic League of Kosovo, or LDK _ province's major
Albanian party led by Ibrahim Rugova _ issued a statement appealing
for peace and calm among Albanian brethren after opposition
protesters attacked the prime minister's office.
	   The LDK condemned the Saturday killing of Albania's opposition
leader Azem Hajdari and said it was ``not a primitive and vengeful
act'' as some reports claimed, ``but a political assassination.''
	   The charismatic Hajdari was immensely popular among Kosovo
Albanians _ he often spoke up on their behalf _ and ties were
traditionally strong between Rugova's party and that of Albania's
opposition leader Sali Berisha.
	   ``We fear Hajdari's assassination is a continuation of slaying
of democracy, the nation and the Albanian state which began in
1997,'' Rugova's party statement read, referring to the unrest
which erupted in Albania last spring.
	   Hajdari's killing was ``a stab in the back to Kosovo's Albanians
for whom the corrupt government of Fatos Nano doesn't care,'' the
Kosovo Albanian Liberal Party, close to Rugova's LDK, said.
	   Rugova called on political parties in Albania to exercise
``calm, cool-headed and rational behavior, in the interest of the
country's stability.''
	   His party also appealed to Albanian brethren to ``have in mind
the plight of Kosovo Albanians, bleeding under Serb military and
police repression.''
	   Several hundred ethnic Albanians have been killed in Kosovo
since Serb forces launched a crackdown on militant separatists in
early March and more than 200,000 of the province's residents have
been displaced in the clashes.
	   Thousands have also fled the fighting in Kosovo _ Serbia's
province where Albanians outnumber Serbs roughly 9-1 _ to seek
sanctuary in northern Albania.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Namibian sprinter Frankie
Fredericks said Sunday he will reconsider running in the
Commonwealth Games if someone from his government contacts him to
discuss a comment that had insulted him.
	   ``I love my country, if they would just talk to me,'' Fredericks
said after winning the men's 200-meter sprint in 19.97 seconds at
the World Cup.
	   Fredericks had announced he would not compete in the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur because he was angered after
Prime Minister Hage Geingob said Namibian boxer Harry Simon
outclassed the sprinter by winning the super welterweight title.
	   Fredericks, who took silver in the 100- and 200-meter races in
the past two Olympics, was Namibia's sole hope for a medal at the
Commonwealth Games.
	   Last month, Geingob was quoted at a World Boxing Organization
championship match in Johannesburg as saying: ``Frank is a world
class sprinter, but he doesn't have a gold from Olympics yet. By
way of being Namibian heroes, they will rank about the same, but
Harry is a world champion.''
	   His absence at Kuala Lumpur would be a blow to the Commonwealth
Games, which is already missing some of the world's top sprinters.

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A third straight day of West Bank
clashes Sunday left five Palestinian youths injured from rubber
bullets or tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants, deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to retaliate against
Israel for its killing Thursday of two top fugitives, members of
the group's military wing who were wanted for alleged involvement
in attacks against Israel and planning others.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge attacks against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Friday and Saturday in several
West Bank cities. Those clashes left a total of 21 Palestinians
injured.
	   On Sunday, at Tekoa village on the outskirts of Bethlehem,
students threw stones at passing by army jeeps, and soldiers
responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring five of the
students.
	   Later in the day, about 100 protesters marched in Bethlehem's
Deheishe refugee camp, burning Israeli and American flags, but no
injuries were reported.
	   Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
peace accords, which set a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the occasion
to point to the continuing threat of terror against Israel.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   In efforts to avert a possible Hamas attack, Israeli security
forces canceled leaves for police and soldiers and troops fanned
out to cities throughout the country to protect shopping areas and
bus stops _ targets of previous suicide bomb attacks.
	   Despite the tensions, American envoy Dennis Ross continued in
his efforts to get Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to agree on a U.S. proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the
peace talks.
	   Under the intiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
work hard to contain anti-Israeli militants.
	   Earlier Sunday, Ross met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
near the port city of Alexandria, Egypt, to update him on his
latest talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   ``I would say at this point that there are still many issues
that have to be worked through on all the parts of our
initiative,'' Ross said at a joint news conference with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa at the Bourg el-Arab air base near
Alexandria.
	   Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, has been
a mediator in Middle East peace negotiations.
	   Ross left later for Jerusalem, where he had more talks set later
Sunday with Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. He was speaking to them together _ a break
from his practice so far of shuttling back and forth in separate
meetings between the two sides.
	   However, the talks, being held at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ned Walker, were centering on secondary issues including
the opening of a Palestinian airport and a so-called safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Neither side has reported any real progress in Ross' meetings,
which began Wednesday, and Netanyahu told his Cabinet that the
Palestinians were wavering on previously agreed to conditions.
	   ``There was progress in the talks with the Palestinians and we
had almost reached certain understandings but the Palestinians
backed down on these understandings,'' the prime minister said,
according to a Cabinet statement.
	   Netanyahu said in talks with Ross, he had demanded the
Palestinians suppress militant groups like Hamas as a condition for
advancing the peace process.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, have accused Israel as using
security matters as a pretext for delaying West Bank pullbacks it
had already promised to make.

	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Four terrorist attacks killed nine
people and injured six others in central and eastern Algeria over
the weekend, security forces said Sunday.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the attacks, but
suspicion fell on Muslim militants waging a 6 1/2 year-old
insurgency against the military-backed government that has left
75,000 people dead.
	   Without providing details, security forces said the latest
attacks took place Saturday and Sunday in Laghouat, 410 kms (250
miles) south of Algiers; Chlef, 120 kms (70 miles) southwest of
Algiers, and Constantine, 430 kms (260 kms) east of Algiers.
	   The Armed Islamic Group, the most violent movement of the
insurgency, is known to have sent fighters from the Algiers area to
eastern Algeria, despite intensified sweeps by security forces in
the region.
	   The eastern region had been a stronghold of the Islamic
Salvation Army, the military wing of the Islamic Salvation Front
that reached a truce with the government in October last year.
	   The attacks followed Friday's announcement by President Liamine
Zeroual that he would hold an early presidential election by next
February, to allow him to step down before his term ends in 2000.
	   Zeroual had come under fire from hard-liners for the truce with
the Salvation Front, which launched the insurgency after the
government canceled January 1992 parliamentary elections it was
poised to win.

Ajax and FC Utrecht share points

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Ajax Amsterdam and FC Utrecht both
dropped their first points of the season Sunday, drawing 2-2 in a
top-of-the-table crowd-pleaser.
	   The major beneficiary was Feyenoord Rotterdam, which now leads
the Dutch premiership outright with 12 points from four games, two
ahead of Utrecht, Ajax and Vitesse Arnhem.
	   Finn Jari Litmanen put Ajax ahead after just six minutes but
then American defender John O'Brien, on loan from Ajax, equalized
for his current employer on the stroke of half time.
	   South African Benni McCarthy looked to have won the game for
Ajax with a stylish goal but Utrecht came back hard in the closing
stages.
	   Tom van Mol was judged to have handled the ball in forcing it
into the Ajax net, but then striker Michael Mols scored a
legitimate equalizer.
	   In the last minutes Ajax defender Mario Melchiot cleared off the
goal line to save a point for the Dutch champion, which starts its
Champions League campaign at Croatia Zagreb Wednesday.
	   In Sunday afternoon's other game Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink's
winner gave FC Twente a 1-0 win over RKC Waalwijk.

Government agrees on a deficit 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ For the first time since the
collapse of the Communist rule in 1989, the Czech government opted
Sunday for a deficit budget it says will stimulate the country's
ailing economy.
	   Prime Minister Milos Zeman said his Social Democratic minority
Cabinet voted at its extraordinary session Sunday to approve a
deficit of 26.8 billion koruna (dlrs 878.7 million.)
	   He said that with the 1999 revenues estimated at 580.9 billion
koruna (dlrs 19 billion), the deficit is aimed at stimulating
economic growth in a situation he described as an ``economic
crisis.''
	   ``The government analyzed (the country's) economic situation ...
and it is our obligation not to continue restrictive policies that
did not prove right and that in fact provoked this crisis,'' Zeman
told reporters after the Cabinet session.
	   Finance Minister Ivo Svoboda, who originally was in favor of a
balanced budget, said that the planned deficit is ``acceptable.''
	   He acknowledged, however, that some 19 billion koruna (dlrs
622.9 million) the state plans to raise by increasing some consumer
taxes and social insurance already are included in the estimated
revenues for the next year. Those tax and insurance hikes first
will have to be approved by the parliament.
	   Should the increase be rejected by the parliament, Zeman said
that ``a discussion on whether the deficit could be bigger or
spendings lower will be necessary.''
	   It was not immediately clear what chances for approval the
budget will have in the 200-seat lower chamber of the parliament,
where the Social Democrats hold only 74 seats.
	   Center-right opposition parties have repeatedly said they would
not vote for a deficit budget and also were objecting any increases
in social insurance.
	   According to law, the parliament must receive the draft budget
by the end of this month. But individual chapters of the budget are
still to be discussed by the Cabinet.

Colombian Ricard leads Middlesbrough over Tottenham 3-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Colombian striker Hamilton Ricard scored two
first-half goals Sunday to lead Middlesbrough to a 3-0 victory that
ended Tottenham's winning streak at two games.
	   Ricard, a 2-million pound (dlrs 3.4 million) transfer from the
Colombian side Cali Deportivo, scored in the 25th and 32nd to give
newly promoted Middlesbrough eight points in five games _ the same
total as Manchester United, Wimbledon and West Ham. Tottenham has
six points.
	   It was Middlesbrough's second straight away victory as Vladimir
Kinder got the final goal with three minutes to play.
	   Ricard scored both goals from about 18 meters (yards) and each
time showed strength and ball control, fighting off defenders to
find space to shoot.
	   Aston Villa leads England's Premier League with 13 points
followed by Liverpool with 10 and Leeds and Derby with nine each.
	   Villa took the league lead Saturday as Paul Merson, who joined
the club last week on a transfer from Middlesbrough, scored on a
penalty in a 2-0 victory over Wimbledon. Ian Taylor scored the
other.
	   Liverpool Saturday suffered its first loss of the season,
falling 2-1 at West Ham to fall out of first place.
	   In addition to the changes at the top of English soccer,
Saturday also saw Chelsea get its first win of the young season,
Alan Shearer score twice for Newcastle, and a victory for
powerhouse Manchester United.
	   Defending league and F.A. Cup champion Arsenal also drew 1-1 at
Leicester, the undefeated Gunners' fourth straight draw of the
season.
	   Liverpool, with three victories and a draw in its first four
games, fell as John Hartson and Eyal Berkovic gave West Ham a 2-0
lead. Karlheinz Riedle scored for Liverpool in the final two
minutes to make it close.
	   Chelsea defeated Nottingham Forest 2-1 on goals by Italy's
Gianfranco Zola and Gustavo Poyet of Uruguay.
	   England international Shearer, after only one goal in open play
in the last 19 league games since coming back from injury, got two
in Newcastle's 4-0 win over Southampton.
	   Shearer's goal in the 38th came on a penalty, the end result of
a red card given to Southampton's Jason Dodd. Southampton is
without a point in five matches. He also scored in the 8th minute.
	   Shearer was initially awarded a goal in the 90th minute, but it
was later credited as an own-goal for Southampton.
	   Manchester United dominated Coventry to win 2-0 with goals from
Dwight Yorke _ his third in two games _ and Ronny Johnsen. Arsenal
got its 1-1 draw with a goal in the final minute by Stephen Hughes.
	   In other Premier League games Saturday: Charlton 1, Derby 2;
Everton 0, Leeds 0; Sheffield Wednesday 3, Blackburn 0.
	   In England's first division Sunday, West Brom defeated Bristol
City 3-1 and Norwich and Bury drew 0-0.
	   On Saturday in the first division, Birmingham fell 3-1 to Bolton
and failed to take sole possession of first place. Huddersfield and
Birmingham each have 16 points atop the league.
	   Sunderland and Bury each have 15 points. Sunderland drew 1-1
Saturday with Wolverhampton. Wolves have 14 points followed by West
Brom with 13.
	   Saturday in Scotland's Premier Division, league-leading Rangers
settled for a 0-0 draw at Dundee United. Elsewhere in Scotland's
top league: Aberdeen 1, Motherwell 1; Celtic 1, Kilmarnock 1;
Hearts 0, Dundee 2; St. Johnstone 1, Dunfermline 1.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With no help from its veteran stars, Internazionale
of Milan turned to an unheralded youngster to avoid a shocking
upset Sunday.
	   Striker Nicola Ventola came off the bench in the second half and
scored twice in five minutes as Inter rallied from a two-goal
deficit to earn a 2-2 draw against promoted Cagliari to open the
Italian League season.
	   The 20-year-old, acquired from Bari over the summer, produced on
an afternoon when Brazil's Ronaldo was serving a one-game
suspension carried over from last season and Roberto Baggio and
Youri Djorkaeff, a member of France's World Cup champions, were
ineffective.
	   Inter was not the only big club that had trouble with a mediocre
one Sunday.
	   Italian Cup holder Lazio of Rome, widely considered a contender
for the Serie A title, allowed Piacenza's Simone Inzaghi _ younger
brother of former scoring champion Filippo _ to net his first
league goal with three minutes left and settled for a 1-1 draw on
the road.
	   And Juventus of Turin opened its quest for a third consecutive
championship with a dominant first half and poor second one, but
did manage to escape Perugia with a 4-3 win.
	   Putting a damper on the Juventus victory was an injury to
playmaker Zinedine Zidane, France's World Cup hero, who limped off
the field after a rough tackle in the 22nd minute.
	   After Juventus took a 3-0 lead, Perugia fought back with two
goals by Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, fitting on a weekend
when 16 of the 27 goals were scored by foreigners.
	   In Sunday's other game, Bari edged Venezia 1-0.
	   On Saturday, German striker Oliver Bierhoff scored twice to lead
a rebuilt AC Milan past Bologna 2-0, AS Roma rallied for a 3-1
victory over promoted Salernitana, Fiorentina beat regional rival
Empoli 2-0, AC Parma and Vicenza drew 0-0, and Udinese and
Sampdoria of Genoa drew 2-2.
	   The five games were pushed up one day to give extra rest and
preparation to clubs making UEFA Cup debuts Tuesday.
	   At Cagliari, Roberto Muzzi assisted on Sierra Leone striker
Mohamed Kallon's goal in the 30th minute and then scored himself
with a header from 8 meters (yards) out in the 41st as the
Sardinians, who finished third in Serie B last season, built their
2-0 lead.
	   But the game changed course in the 63rd, when Inter coach Luigi
Simoni pulled Baggio and Djorkaeff in favor of Ventola, 20, and
Andrea Pirlo, 19. Ventola rocketed an acrobatic scissors kick into
the lower corner from 12 meters (yards) away in the 77th, before
sliding to beat 'keeper Alessio Scarpi to the ball and tapping it
home in the 81st.
 &UR; Piacenza 1, Lazio 1 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, Inzaghi headed home the equalizer from 2 meters
(yards) out to steal a win from Lazio, which had taken the lead in
the 73rd minute when Yugoslav striker Dejan Stankovic, a reserve,
sent a long-distance blast under the crossbar. Lazio's new,
high-priced forward tandem of Chile's Marcelo Salas and Italian
international Christian Vieri rarely threatened to score.
 &UR; Juventus 4, Perugia 3 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids, Croat defender Igor
Tudor and Italian international Gianluca Pessotto each scored in
the opening 45 minutes for Juventus.
	   With Juventus content to sit on its lead, Perugia found plenty
of space to operate and Nakata took advantage. The 21-year-old
scored off close-range shots in the 51st and 59th minutes to cut
his club's deficit to 3-2. Uruguayan striker Daniel Fonseca, who
replaced Zidane, scored Juve's fourth goal in the 65th, while
Perugia added Antonio Bernardini's penalty kick with two minutes to
go.
 &UR; Bari 1, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, striker Gianluca Zambrotta chested down a cross and
drove the ball home from close range nine minutes into the match
for the hosts.
 &UR; Saturday's action: &QC; 
 &UR; Milan 3, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Bierhoff headed in French winger Ibrahim Ba's cross
from the right flank in first-half injury time and made it 2-0 in
the 51st minute with a penalty kick. Brazil's Leonardo added
Milan's final goal with nine minutes left.
	   Bierhoff, whose 27 goals for Udinese last season were the most
in Serie A in 37 years, was one of five new starters acquired by
Milan over the summer.
 &UR; Parma 0, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, midfielder Diego Fuser wasted two clear scoring
opportunities as the hosts' attack was not nearly as in synch as
the defense was.
 &UR; Roma 3, Salernitana 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Salernitana _ in the top flight for the first time in
50 years _ shocked the 62,650 spectators at Olympic Stadium by
taking the lead on Cameroon midfielder Rigobert Song's goal in the
41st minute. But defender Luca Fusco was sent off four minutes
later and the hosts capitalized, with two Paulo Sergio goals
bracketing one by Francesco Totti.
 &UR; Fiorentina 2, Empoli 0 &QC; 
	   At Florence, Portuguese midfielder Rui Costa scored in the sixth
minute and assisted on Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta's goal in
the 60th.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Sampdoria 2 &QC; 
	   At Udine, all four goals came in the first half. Midfielder
Jonathan Bachini and Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso scored for
Udinese, while Sampdoria scored off an own-goal and saw striker
Vincenzo Montella add the club's second.

Taliban refuses to surrender any suspects to Iran in diplomats'
</HEADLINE>
murder &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's religious rulers on
Sunday rejected an Iranian demand to turn over renegade Taliban
soldiers who killed nine Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, saying
any suspects would face justice at home.
	   The slayings and the disappearance of two other Iranian envoys
when the Taliban religious army seized the northern Afghan town of
Mazar-e-Sharif in an Aug. 8 battle has heightened tensions between
Afghanistan and its powerful neighbor.
	   On Saturday, Iran, which has vowed to avenge the killings,
announced that it was sending 200,000 troops for war games on the
Afghan border, leading to fears that Tehran was mulling military
retaliation.
	   The Taliban, which controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
responded by saying it was sending thousands of its own religious
warriors to the border.
	   The Taliban has agreed to turn over the bodies of nine diplomats
to Iran, probably on Monday. After a month of denying any knowledge
of the missing Iranians, the religious army claimed the bodies were
found last week. The army says it knows nothing of the two missing
Iranian envoys, which Tehran has said may have escaped.
	   However, the Taliban snubbed their hostile neighbor's demands
for an apology and for the surrender of any suspects in the
killings. The Taliban army claims it has no suspects, and insists
the killers acted without authorization from the movement's supreme
leader, Mullah Omar.
	   ``We are not accepting the demand by the Iranian government that
the Taliban turn over these soldiers,'' Maluvi Abdulhahi Mutmain, a
Taliban spokesman, told The Associated Press by satellite telephone
from his headquarters in Kandahar. ``This is an internal affair,
and we shall handle it.''
	   In Islamabad, the Taliban's ambassador to Pakistan, Maluvi
Saeed-ur-Rehman, also rejected any demand to surrender the killers
or to apologize.
	   ``We will never tender an apology to Iran for the diplomats'
killing as ... Afghanistan is not involved in the incident,'' he
said on Sunday. ``The shooting occurred without the knowledge of
local Taliban commanders.''
	   Rehman said any suspects, if found, would be tried in
Afghanistan. Iran has said it holds the Taliban responsible for the
killings, because they occurred in Taliban-held territory.
	   On Sept. 6, and before the nine diplomats were confirmed dead,
the Taliban turned over five of at least 50 Iranian captives in
Afghanistan to Iran in a goodwill gesture as the dispute with
Tehran heated up. Iran demanded the release of all its citizens.
	   However, Rehman said a northern alliance of minority ethnic
groups, which is fighting the Taliban northern alliance and is
widely believed to be backed by Iran, would have to release Taliban
prisoners before talks on freeing Iranian captives could begin.
	   Iran is still recovering from its devastating 1980-88 war with
Iraq and has no appetite for another fight, especially in
Afghanistan, where rebel troops frustrated Soviet forces in a
1979-89 war and forced them out.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of a popular
opposition leader, crowds stormed the main government building
Sunday, setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano and his ministers fled in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded. The United States and the European Union appealed for
calm, fearful the turmoil could topple Albania's elected government
and spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha also urged his followers to
remain calm until Monday's funeral of his ally Azem Hajdari, 35, a
popular, charismatic politician fatally wounded Saturday in front
of Democratic Party headquarters.
	   But Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and
warned him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping, chanted
``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The Interior Ministry reported ``unlawful developments'' in
``other towns'' but gave no further details. Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga also said the situation in the country's maximum
security prison was ``tense'' but without elaboration.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Tirana urged Albanians to ``put down their
weapons, crease threatening violence and pursue legitimate
democratic and legal means to deal with the situation.''
	   ``Leaders of all Albania's political parties must behave
responsibly,'' the American statement said. The European Union
expressed concern that the killings ``could lead to further
violence which would make national reconciliation even more
difficult.''
	   The violence raised fears of a repeat of the 1997 nationwide
riots which swept this country after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. The rebels maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Berisha
blamed Nano's party, and at a Sunday morning rally, the former
president warned the opposition would use ``all means'' to force
him out.
	   After Berisha issued his ultimatum, about 1,500 of his followers
marched Sunday to the Interior Ministry, firing pistols in the air
and pelting the building with stones.
	   The crowd set fire to a ministry vehicle, then continued down
the city's main street to the prime minister's office. Protesters
opened fire at the third floor, which contains Nano's offices.
Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the protesters forced their way into the building, traded
gunfire with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano and
his Cabinet fled out a side exit through the smoke and amid
explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had set
on fire.
	   The crowd then returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed at Berisha's urging.
	   Late Sunday, supporters brought Hajdari's body to the sprawling
Skanderberg Square for an all-night vigil before Monday's funeral.
President Rexhep Meidani called on police to find Hajdari's killers
as quickly as possible.
	   The Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs 100,000
reward for information leading to the arrest of the assassins. The
government pledged ``all measures necessary'' to defend the state
against those ``calling for revenge and blood.''
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buldings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.''
	   Everts said heads of the international organizations in Tirana
and all the foreign ambassadors would meet Monday to urge Albanians
to ``stay peaceful and don't answer to the appeals for
violence...''

Military leader freed from house arrest after being forced
</HEADLINE>
step-down &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A military commander who was forced by
junior officers to publicly resign his post appeared Sunday to be
headed for restoration to full power, according to sources in
Lesotho.
	   Lt. Gen. Makhula Mosakeng, who apparently announced that he
would resign as commander of the Lesotho Defense force at gunpoint
during a radio address on Friday, was freed from house arrest on
Sunday, his daughter, Lisemelo Mosakeng, told The Associated Press
in a telephone interview.
	   Mosakeng appeared to be headed for restoration to full power
over the military after the South African Defense Minister Joe
Modise intervened, an American diplomat said.
	   ``There may be a voluntary resolution in progress that may
return the command structure to its original authority tomorrow
(Monday),'' said Raymond Brown, the deputy chief of the U.S.
embassy.
	   Modise traveled Saturday to the tiny mountain kingdom of 2
million people located within the borders of South Africa on a
special mission from South African President Nelson Mandela, said
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana.
	   He met with military leaders, including Mosakeng, until late
Saturday night.
	   ``I don't think we need to be alarmed by the situation in
Lesotho,'' Mandela was quoted as telling journalists at a summit of
Southern African Development Community leaders in the Indian Ocean
island nation of Mauritius.
	   The unrest in Lesotho came as opposition parties were disputing
the results of last May's general elections.
	   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe _ called on to mediate the
election dispute _ have reportedly concluded in a report that
Lesotho's electoral commission mishandled the May vote, which gave
the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy a landslide victory.
	   Lesotho has a history of political upheaval and coups.

Libya disbands Arab unity ministry to protest Arab failure to defy
</HEADLINE>
sanctions

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya will disband a ministry responsible
for promoting Arab unity to protest Arab inaction to have U.N.
sanctions lifted, the official Libyan news agency reported Sunday.
	   It said the Libyan Parliament will abolish the General People's
Committee for Libyan Unity at its next session. It did not give a
date.
	   The decision to disband the ministry was in line with Libya's
``belonging to the African continent,'' the agency, JANA, said. It
was monitored by the British Broadcasting News Agency.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has sharply criticized Arab
countries for their failure to support Libya to have the sanctions
lifted.
	   The sanctions _ which ban air travel to and from the country _
were imposed in 1992 to force Libya to hand over two suspects in
the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
that killed 270 people.
	   In a television interview Thursday, Gadhafi drew a contrast
between the Organization of African Unity which adopted a stance to
defy the sanctions in its June summit in Ouagadougou, Upper Volta,
and that of the Arab world.
	   ``Those who met in Ouagadougou are not Arabs, they are
Africans,'' Gadhafi said in the interview which was monitored by
the BBC.
	   ``The Arabs should support us all the same, not from the point
of view of being Arabs, but from the viewpoint that it (sanctions)
is an international issue and the Libyan people have rights,''
Gadhafi said.
	   This week's meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Cairo will
be a test for the league to show its support for Libya, Gadhafi
said.
	   JANA said Libya will be represented at the meeting by Jumma
al-Fuzzani, the minister in charge of the General People's
Committee for Unity. It will be his final job as the head of that
ministry, JANA said.

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
allies won Bavarian state elections Sunday, according to exit
polls, energizing Kohl's flagging campaign for an unprecedented
fifth term in national voting just two weeks away.
	   The vote in tradition-minded Bavarian _ where leather hiking
garb and beer gardens form a folksy counterpoint to high-tech
industry in the Alpine state _ was less a test of the long-ruling
Christian Social Union than a gauge of voter mood before the Sept.
27 parliamentary poll.
	   No one expected the CSU to lose in a state they have ruled since
1962. Pundits regardless saw the vote as a measure of Kohl's
future, because the Bavarian-only party is partnered with Kohl's
Christian Democrats in the federal government.
	   The CSU won about 52 percent of the vote. Kohl's rivals, the
Social Democrats, won 30 percent _ about the same results as four
years ago and a bit of a disappointment for party's chancellor
candidate, Gerhard Schroeder, who unlike Kohl had campaigned in
Bavaria for the local party.
	   State Gov. Edmund Stoiber called the Social Democrat result ``a
huge slap'' for the party's ambitions at the national level. ``I am
certain that Bavaria is sending a signal for an upswing for the
entire CDU/CSU.''
	   The Social Democrats quickly disputed the election's link with
the federal vote, saying the CSU won on the immense popularity of
the long-serving Stoiber _ and not because of Kohl.
	   Stoiber did not even mention the chancellor during his stump
speeches, apparently fearful of being tainted by Kohl's lethargic
campaign.
	   ``The CSU kept its role in the federal government in Bonn under
wraps, it kept the chancellor under wraps,'' said Bavarian SPD
official Franz Maget. ``The conditions are difficult for us in
Bavaria.
	   Pre-election polls showed that about 6 percent of people
planning to vote for Stoiber's party in Bavaria were not going to
vote for Kohl's in the national election. Many voters apparently
feel Kohl is out of fresh ideas after 16 years in office. And
Schroeder _ at 54, 14 years Kohl's junior _ has campaigned as the
voice of change.
	   Armin Vogel, a civil servant who turned out to vote wearing
lederhosen and a woolen sweater, said Stoiber is far more popular
in Bavaria than Kohl, and that Kohl may lose the national vote.
	   His daughter, 27-year-old Alexandra Vogel, agreed.
	   ``I think it'll be close. I hope Kohl can make it,'' she said.
But ``many people can't stand the sight of him anymore. I think the
SPD will get a lot of votes just because of Kohl. People think he's
been there too long.''
	   Despite the focus on this election, Bavaria an unlikely
bellwether of how voters feel across the country.
	   One of the richest of Germany's 16 states, Bavaria is deeply
Catholic and highly independent, with a tiny separatist movement
serving as an indicator of the state's renegade spirit. The
movement was not part of the state vote.
	   Even the SPD candidate, Renata Schmidt, was hard-pressed to
convince voters that they would be better off with a change in
government.
	   Her campaign even tried to put a negative spin on the state's
unemployment rate _ at 6.5 percent the lowest in the nation _
saying it was being reduced less quickly than the rest of the
country. The national unemployment rate is 10.6 percent.
	   In other election results, the liberal Greens party won 5.3
percent. The far-right Republican party won 3.9 percent, under the
5 percent minimum required for gaining seats in parliament.
	   An estimated 8.8 million Bavarians were eligible to vote. State
officials put voter turnout at about 70 percent, despite rain
across most of the Alpine state and snow in the mountains.

French govt silent, but politician says `I told you so'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French government remained silent about the
Clinton sex scandal Sunday, but the head of a center-right party
said the controversy makes a case for politicians to guard their
private lives.
	   ``By continuously turning the spotlight on supposedly idyllic
couples ... and their supposedly absolute virtues to win elections,
they shouldn't be surprised when it boomerangs,'' said Francois
Bayrou, head of Democratic Force.
	   ``You have to be discreet. Who's perfect? No one,'' Bayrou, a
former education minister, told reporters when asked about the
scandal surrounding U.S. President Bill Clinton and former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``If you put on the scale the stability of the planet and the
sad capers with Monica Lewinsky, it's completely different,'' he
said. ``There's a fragility of democracies that's a source of worry
for everyone.''
	   The French have allowed its politicians to shield their private
lives from public scrutiny. The late President Francois Mitterrand
wasn't confronted about his illegitimate daughter until she was an
adult and he was at the end of his career, and the revelation
caused little debate.
	   A Sunday newspaper, noting continued support for Clinton in the
polls, suggested the president stood a chance to overcome the
scandal.
	   ``America doesn't abandon Bill Clinton,'' headlined France's
weekly Journal de Dimanche. ``More than ever, le Comeback Kid seems
determined to fight,'' the paper reported.

<TEXT>
	   ALCUDIA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Spain's Abraham Olano of the
Banesto team stormed through Sunday's ninth stage individual time
trial to take the overall leadership of the Tour of Spain cycling
marathon.
	   Olano covered the 39.5-kilometer (24.5-mile) flat run in 47
minutes and 7 seconds. His closest rival, Melcior Mauri of the
Once-Deustche Bank team, needed 41 seconds more.
	   ``Everything turned out well but there was a stretch when I lost
my rhythm because of the strong wind that blew almost all the
time,'' Olano told reporters after the race.
	   Prior to the ninth leg held on the island of Mallorca, one of
the Mediterranean Balearic Islands, Olano was at No. 5 in the
standings of the 22-stage Tour.
	   Fellow Banesto rider Jose Maria Jimenez, who went into the time
trial in the lead, needed over four minutes more than Olano to
peddle the windy course.
	   Switzerland's Alex Zuelle of Festina, one of the favorites to
take the stage, put in a disappointing performance and came in 2
minutes and 24 seconds behind the winning time.
	   But another favored sprinter, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of the
Once, put in a strong run and moved up one place in the overall
table to No. 2.
	   American former world champion Lance Armstrong also came in
strong, placed sixth in the stage and holding on to the No. 4 spot
in the Tour standings.
	   The cyclists are due a rest day Monday in preparation for a week
of grueling mountain stages through northern Spain.
	   ``This victory is a big morale boost for the upcoming high
mountain stages where you always have to be looking out for
breakaway attempts,'' Olano said of his win.

Congolese rebels deny losing Lubutu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kabila expected in Mauritius Monday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rebels denied the Congolese government's
claim that it has recaptured Lubutu, a town on a key route between
two rebel strongholds.
	   Rebel-run Radio Bukavu said Saturday that forces opposing
President Laurent Kabila still controlled Lubutu, about 360
kilometers (225 miles) northwest of rebel headquarters in Goma,
eastern Congo, and about the same distance southeast of rebel-held
Kisangani on the Congo River.
	   The radio report, monitored by the BBC in Kenya, also said
rebels captured Shabunda and in eastern Kivu Province, as well as
Buta and Banalia, both on a road that runs north from Kisangani.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.
	   Rebels trying to unseat Congo's year-old government claim Kabila
has failed to implement democratic reforms and has worsened ethnic
hatred.
	   After an all-night session, African leaders meeting in Ethiopia
failed Saturday to agree on a cease-fire in Congo's 6-week civil
war and said more consultations were needed.
	   The Congo fighting is on the agenda of the annual Southern
African Development Community summit, which opened Sunday on the
Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius.
	   Kabila, who was expected Monday, planned to repeat previous
pleas for all 14 SADC countries to condemn what he alleges is an
invasion of Congo by Rwanda and Uganda, a summit official said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British newspaper reported Sunday that the
securities trader blamed for the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest
merchant bank could be freed from jail in Singapore within days.
But the country's prison authority reportedly denied the story.
	   Sunday Business quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in
Singapore as saying Nick Leeson, 31, who is suffering from bowel
cancer, is awaiting approval from the island's head of state,
President Ong Teng Cheong, to be released from Changi jail on
compassionate grounds.
	   Leeson, sentenced in 1996 to 6 1/2 years for fraud and forgery
that led to the collapse of Barings Bank, is likely to return to
Britain immediately, the newspaper said.
	   But Singapore television reported late Sunday that the country's
Prisons Department spokesman denied that Leeson will be set free
within days.
	   Sunday Business quoted Leeson's London lawyer, Stephen Pollard,
as saying he has been told Leeson is likely to be released soon,
but has not been given a date.
	   Leeson was returned to jail from Changi hospital last week, a
month after undergoing surgery to remove a tumor from his colon.
	   Barings collapsed after Leeson made millions of dollars in
unauthorized futures deals from his base in Singapore.

Taliban claims to have seized key center for Afghan opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban army said Sunday
that it has seized a key stronghold in central Afghanistan from a
northern alliance of opposition forces.
	   Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Muttaqi said Bamiyan, a city in
the central Afghanistan province of the same name, fell to the
religious army early Sunday after three days of fierce battles
against the northern alliance that had held it.
	   The state news agency in Iran, a country closely linked to the
anti-Taliban alliance, confirmed Sunday that the Taliban seized
Bamiyan. Telephone calls to the northern alliance's Bamiyan
headquarters were not answered.
	   The Taliban and its northern-based enemies are fighting on
several fronts. The Taliban army, which has vowed to restore peace
in the war-ravaged country and transform Afghanistan into a purist
Islamic state, has made significant progress in recent weeks.
	   Taliban fighter jets pounded Bamiyan on Saturday as part of an
offensive that began Friday. The Taliban also claimed on Saturday
that it seized an airport near Bamiyan, 125 kilometers (80 miles)
west of the capital of Kabul. The northern alliance denied the
claim.
	   Both sides routinely make contradictory claims in their battle
over the roughly 10 percent of Afghanistan still held by the
northern alliance, which is composed of minority ethnic groups.
	   Bamiyan was one of four provinces held by the alliance, and was
controlled by the Shiite Muslim group Hezb-e-Wahadat. The province
also is the site of key air bases, where Iran, which supports the
alliance is believed to have flown in military supplies.
	   Iran's state radio claimed Sunday that warplanes from
neighboring Pakistan, believed to support the Taliban, had been
spotted bombing of Bamiyan, causing heavy casualties. The report,
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, cited an
anonymous northern alliance spokesman as saying Bamiyan was still
being bombed.
	   Pakistani officials reached in Islamabad said they had no
information about alleged Pakistani involvement in the attacks and
could not comment.
	   The loss of Bamiyan to the Taliban was a major blow to the
northern-based alliance which has suffered several serious setbacks
in recent months. The Taliban movement is dominated by Sunni
Muslims, who are in the majority in Afghanistan

Newspaper: Leeson could be freed in days

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British newspaper reported Sunday that the
securities trader blamed for the 1995 collapse of Britain's oldest
merchant bank could be freed from jail in Singapore within days.
But the country's prison authority reportedly denied the story.
	   Sunday Business quoted unidentified diplomatic sources in
Singapore as saying Nick Leeson, 31, who is suffering from bowel
cancer, is awaiting approval from the island's head of state,
President Ong Teng Cheong, to be released from Changi jail on
compassionate grounds.
	   Leeson, sentenced in 1996 to 6 1/2 years for fraud and forgery
that led to the collapse of Barings Bank, is likely to return to
Britain immediately, the newspaper said.
	   But Singapore television reported late Sunday that the country's
Prisons Department spokesman denied that Leeson will be set free
within days.
	   Sunday Business quoted Leeson's London lawyer, Stephen Pollard,
as saying he has been told Leeson is likely to be released soon,
but has not been given a date.
	   On Sunday, Pollard was quoted as telling Press Association, the
British national news agency, that he was expecting to hear fairly
soon about an application for early release on compassionate
medical grounds, but ``reports that Mr. Leeson could be released
within days are all hypothesis.''
	   Leeson was returned to jail from Changi hospital last week, a
month after undergoing surgery to remove a tumor from his colon.
	   Barings collapsed after Leeson made millions of dollars in
unauthorized futures deals from his base in Singapore.

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ The Italian film ``The Way We Laughed,''
the bittersweet story of two brothers from Sicily who move to the
industrial north, won the coveted Golden Lion award Sunday at the
55th Venice Film Festival.
	   The jury also gave a surprise award for lifetime achievement to
Warren Beatty, whose ``Bulworth,'' a political satire about race,
class, power, money and media was considered a top contender for
the Golden Lion.
	   Sean Penn won the best actor award for his performance in
``Hurlyburly,'' a dark tale about two roommates and their friends
set against a backdrop of Hollywood power plays. The best actress
award went to the French actress Catherine Deneuve for ``Place
Vendome,'' the story of an alcoholic widow whose legacy rekindles
mysteries from the past.
	   Honors for best director went to Emir Kusturica, a native of
Sarajevo, for his acclaimed ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' a surreal
comedy about two Gypsy godfathers made without professional actors.
	   ``The Way We Laughed,'' directed by Gianni Amelio, was the first
Italian film in a decade to win the festival's top prize. Set in
1958-1964, the movie sets the story of the two brothers against the
backdrop of an Italy beginning to make the transition from poverty
to affluence.
	   The festival was in a frenzy even before the prizes were handed
out because of the surprise resignation of its director, Felice
Laudadio, who called the competition ``stupid and arrogant.''
	   Laudadio, in his second year as the head of the prestigious
festival, said he thought there were too many movies _ and too many
prizes.
	   In his resignation letter, Laudadio proposed a radical change:
no competition and no awards, except for the movie the audience
likes best. ``This way only the most loved movie will get an
award,'' he said.
	   His resignation instantly sparked rumors of political
interference, with reporters questioning whether he'd been under
pressure see that the Golden Lion went to ``The Way We Laughed.''
Laudadio sharply denied any pressure.
	   The prizewinners were chosen by an international jury from among
19 competing films, including four American movies.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of a popular
opposition leader, crowds stormed the main government building
Sunday, setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano and his ministers fled in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded. The United States and the European Union appealed for
calm, fearful the turmoil could topple Albania's elected government
and spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including the neighboring
Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha also urged his followers to
remain calm until Monday's funeral of Azem Hajdari, 35, a popular,
charismatic politician fatally wounded Saturday in front of
Democratic Party headquarters.
	   Nobody immediately claimed responsibility.
	   But Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and
warned him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping, chanted
``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The Interior Ministry reported ``unlawful developments'' in
``other towns'' but gave no further details. Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga also said the situation in the country's maximum
security prison was ``tense'' but did not elaborate.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Tirana urged Albanians to ``put down their
weapons, cease threatening violence and pursue legitimate
democratic and legal means to deal with the situation.''
	   ``Leaders of all Albania's political parties must behave
responsibly,'' the American statement said. The European Union
expressed concern that the killings ``could lead to further
violence which would make national reconciliation even more
difficult.''
	   The violence raised fears of a repeat of the 1997 nationwide
riots that swept this country after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Instability in Albania could also impede U.S. and European
efforts to solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. The rebels maintain sanctuaries in northern
Albania.
	   After Berisha issued his ultimatum, about 1,500 of his followers
marched Sunday to the Interior Ministry, firing pistols in the air
and pelting the building with stones.
	   The crowd set fire to a ministry vehicle, then continued down
the city's main street to the prime minister's office. Protesters
opened fire at the third floor, which contains Nano's offices.
Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the protesters forced their way into the building, traded
gunfire with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano and
his Cabinet fled out a side exit through the smoke and amid
explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had set
on fire.
	   The crowd then returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed at Berisha's urging.
	   Late Sunday, supporters brought Hajdari's body to the sprawling
Skanderberg Square for an all-night vigil before Monday's funeral.
President Rexhep Meidani called on police to find Hajdari's killers
as quickly as possible.
	   The Interior Ministry announced a dlrs 50,000 to dlrs 100,000
reward for information leading to the arrest of the assassins. The
government pledged ``all measures necessary'' to defend the state
against those ``calling for revenge and blood.''
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   Everts said heads of the international organizations in Tirana
and all the foreign ambassadors would meet Monday to urge Albanians
to ``stay peaceful and don't answer to the appeals for
violence...''

Experts blame river sludge for death and injury in bridge collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ It was polluted sludge from the bottom
of the Yarkon River _ ingested by Australian athletes when the
bridge they were crossing plunged into the water _ that led to at
least one of their deaths, experts told a legislative committee
Sunday.
	   Four Australian athletes died last year after the footbridge
beneath them buckled at the opening ceremonies of the Maccabiah
Games, an international sporting event for Jewish athletes,
plunging them into the Yarkon River.
	   Five Israelis are being tried for criminal negligence in
connection to the collapse. Medical witnesses at the trial have
debated whether pollution caused any of the deaths.
	   A hospital spokesman told lawmakers Sunday that Warren Zines,
one of the athletes who died and Sasha Alterman who survived but
spent 10 months in critical condition after pollutants apparently
caused her to develop bacterial meningitis, both developed their
illnesses because of water they swallowed during the accident.
	   A spokesman for the Yarkon River Authority said that local
polluters have dumped a dangerous level of sewage into the water,
but that the top layer of the river is less polluted and not
dangerous.
	   ``If the Australians had not drunk the water stirred up by the
bridge collapse from the base of the river, they would not have
gotten sick,'' said director David Pergament.
	   Committee chairman Micha Goldman criticized the river authority
for not putting up fences and signs warning people of pollution.
	   ``You are sending people to their deaths,'' he said.
	   Goldman called upon Israel's Environment Ministry to crack down
on polluters and said the committee will tour the river to
investigate proposed clean-up solutions.

Kabila on way to Mauritius for another summit on Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mandela, Dos Santos quotes; ADDS background. &QL; 
 &UR; With Congo-Rebels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAND BAIE, Mauritius (AP) _ Deeply divided southern African
leaders gathered Sunday on this Indian Ocean island with plans to
yet again tackle the Congo crisis.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila was expected to be one of five
opening speakers on Sunday, but he missed the opening ceremonies at
the two-day Southern African Development Community gathering.
	   Kabila was en route to the meeting, where he planned to repeat
previous pleas for all 14 SADC countries to condemn what he alleges
is an invasion of Congo by Rwanda and Uganda, the South African
Press Association cited Kikaya Binkarubi, Congo's charge d'affairs
in its Zimbabwe embassy, as saying.
	   Heads of state have failed on three previous summits to broker a
cease-fire in the 6-week-old attempt by rebels, apparently backed
by Uganda and Rwanda, to unseat Kabila's government.
	   African defense leaders meeting in Ethiopia failed Saturday to
agree on a cease-fire.
	   Three SADC countries _ Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola _ have sent
troops to back Kabilia. But South African President Nelson Mandela,
the chairman of the organization, has opposed a military solution
and stressed in his opening address the need for a negotiated
settlement.
	   The crisis is one of the most serious threats to security in
central Africa in years.
	   The Congo crisis was expected to overshadow SADC's intention to
discuss political and economic integration in the region, as well
other conflicts.
	   Mandela, also in his address, expressed deep distress at the
renewed conflict in Angola, and urged UNITA rebels to comply with a
U.N. peace plan.
	   ``We have great confidence in the initiatives of the United
Nations in seeking the resolution of the Angolan crisis,'' Mandela
said.
	   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, in his speech,
lambasted UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, who he said did not want
peace in Angola.
	   ``In Angola the peace process is paralyzed,'' Dos Santos said.
	   He accused Savimbi of abusing the U.N. peace accord to buy time
to reorganize his forces, and said he was involved in efforts to
overthrow Kabila.
	   The future of SADC's committee on politics, defense and security
also was expected to be the leaders' agendas.
	   Tension are high between South Africa, which wants the committee
to be an integral part of SADC, and Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe who is chairman of the committee and wants it to have a
large degree of autonomy.
	   The committee was suspended last year because of the differences
about how it should operate.
	   Twelve SADC countries were represented by their presidents, with
only Malawi and the Seychelles sending lower level officials.

Italian film wins Golden Lion at Venice, Beatty gets surprise

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ The Italian film ``The Way We Laughed,''
the bittersweet story of two brothers from Sicily who move to the
industrial north, won the coveted Golden Lion award Sunday at the
55th Venice Film Festival.
	   The jury also gave a surprise award for lifetime achievement to
Warren Beatty, whose ``Bulworth,'' a political satire about race,
class, power, money and media was considered a top contender for
the Golden Lion.
	   Sean Penn won the best actor award for his performance in
``Hurlyburly,'' a dark tale about two roommates and their friends
set against a backdrop of Hollywood power plays. The best actress
award went to the French actress Catherine Deneuve for ``Place
Vendome,'' the story of an alcoholic widow whose legacy rekindles
mysteries from the past.
	   Honors for best director went to Emir Kusturica, a native of
Sarajevo, for his acclaimed ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' a surreal
comedy about two Gypsy godfathers made without professional actors.
	   ``The Way We Laughed'' (Cosi Ridevano), directed by Gianni
Amelio, was the first Italian film in a decade to win the
festival's top prize. Set in 1958-1964, the movie sets the story of
the two brothers against the backdrop of an Italy beginning to make
the transition from poverty to affluence.
	   The festival was in a frenzy even before the prizes were handed
out because of the surprise resignation of its director, Felice
Laudadio, who called the competition ``stupid and arrogant.''
	   Laudadio, in his second year as the head of the prestigious
festival, said he thought there were too many movies _ and too many
prizes.
	   In his resignation letter, Laudadio proposed a radical change:
no competition and no awards, except for the movie the audience
likes best. ``This way only the most loved movie will get an
award,'' he said.
	   His resignation instantly sparked rumors of political
interference, with reporters questioning whether he'd been under
pressure see that the Golden Lion went to ``The Way We Laughed.''
Laudadio sharply denied any pressure.
	   The prizewinners were chosen by an international jury from among
19 competing films, including four American movies.
	   Laudadio's resignation was is especially surprising given the
good reception the festival got this year. Industry insiders say
Venice was back in form, with a good mix of Hollywood and foreign
films.
	   Laudadio snubbed Hollywood last year and was also criticized for
giving Italian films the cold shoulder. This year, he included a
number of high-profile American movies in the festival and was
careful to showcase a number of Italian productions.
	   The critics were generally warm to Hollywood, but savaged many
of the Italian offerings.
	   Laudadio also pared down the program to just over 100 films,
about a third the number screened the year before.
	   The members of the jury were: Italian director Ettore Scola,
Brazilian director Hector Babenco, Lithuanian director Sharunas
Bartas, American director Kathryn Bigelow, German director Reinhard
Hauff, French critic Daniele Heymann, Indian producer-director
Ismail Merchant, Chilean writer Luis Sepulveda and British
director-actress Tilda Swinton.
	   The jurors awarded the prize for best original screenplay to
French director Eric Rohmer for his ``Conte d'Automne,'' the final
chapter in his series of films about attraction and love. The
cinematography award went to Luca Bigazzi for the Italian movie
``The Pear Tree'' (l'Albero delle Pere), while its 14-year-old
star, Niccolo Senni, took the honors for the best young performer.
	   The jury also gave a special prize went to the Romanian film
``Terminus Paradis,'' the story of the divergent destinies of a pig
farmer and a maid in Bucharest directed by Lucian Pintille.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
allies won Bavarian state elections Sunday, according to exit
polls, energizing Kohl's flagging campaign for an unprecedented
fifth term in national voting just two weeks away.
	   The vote in tradition-minded Bavaria _ an Alpine state where
leather hiking garb and beer gardens form a folksy counterpoint to
high-tech industry _ was less a test of the long-ruling Christian
Social Union than a gauge of voter mood before the Sept. 27
parliamentary poll.
	   No one expected the CSU to lose in a state they have ruled since
1962. Pundits regardless saw the vote as a measure of Kohl's
future, because the Bavaria-only party is partnered with Kohl's
Christian Democrats in the federal government.
	   The CSU won about 53 percent of the vote. Kohl's rivals, the
Social Democrats, won 29 percent _ one point down from elections
four years ago and a disappointment for party's chancellor
candidate, Gerhard Schroeder who unlike Kohl campaigned in Bavaria
for the local party.
	   State Gov. Edmund Stoiber called the Social Democrat result ``a
huge slap'' for the party's ambitions at the national level. ``I am
certain that Bavaria is sending a signal for an upswing for the
entire CDU/CSU.''
	   The Social Democrats quickly disputed the election's link with
the federal vote, saying the CSU won on Stoiber's immense
popularity _ and not because of Kohl.

Mission accomplished for Davenport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with women's doubles. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport had been in tennis' waiting
room a long time.
	   Touted as one of America's finest young players after winning
the U.S. Open junior championship in 1992, she was unable to push
past the promise of her potential.
	   Except for a couple of doubles championships, Davenport carried
the label of a Grand Slam also-ran. Then came a dream summer that
ended with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over defending champion Martina
Hingis for the U.S. Open crown, the title she's always craved.
	   ``The sight at the end of the tunnel of winning the Grand Slam
was what kept me going,'' she said.
	   Davenport's Olympic gold medal in 1996 was largely ignored, but
it was a signal she was getting ready to move into tennis' upper
echelon.
	   Last September, she reached the U.S. Open semifinals for the
first time and then got to semis at the Australian and French Opens
and the quarters at Wimbledon.
	   ``At the French, everybody criticized me for playing a bad match
in the semis,'' she said, recalling a straight-sets loss to
eventual champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. ``I looked at it as such
a positive. I did so well at the French. I thought I was hitting
the ball well.
	   ``Again at Wimbledon, I thought I was doing well. Once Wimbledon
ended, I couldn't wait for the hardcourt season to begin.''
	   Davenport won three straight matches on hardcourts in California
and had a 14-match winning streak in the weeks before the Open.
	   She also embarked on a fitness program that trimmed 25 pounds
(11.34 kilos) and left her quicker than ever. Even a semifinal loss
to Steffi Graf in an Open tuneup couldn't diminish her enthusiasm.
	   She marched through the Open like a player on a mission, and it
paid off.
	   ``The two weeks have been great,'' she said. ``I didn't lose a
set. I played great tennis. I don't think I ever really got down on
myself, which has been a big thing. I was able to really, in my
eyes, act like a champion and really win the title.''
	   Hingis did not make it easy. With Davenport up a set and serving
for a 5-2 lead in the second, the world's No. 1 player rallied.
	   ``She stopped making her errors,'' Davenport said. ``She was
running me around an awful lot then.''
	   In the past, that has been the recipe for beating Davenport, and
Hingis knew it. There was also some buzz around the tour that
Davenport got down on herself in tough spots.
	   Not this time.
	   Even after Hingis moved in front 5-4, Davenport would not be
denied.
	   ``Definitely some nerves crept in,'' she said. ``I got down 4-5
but I was able to break at love, get my footing back in the match
and just play well. ... I don't think I let anything bother me. I
was very focused. I was very calm.''
	   Davenport became the Open's first American-born women's champion
since Chris Evert in 1982. The significance was not lost on
22-year-old from Newport Beach, California.
	   ``No one's done it in a long time,'' she said. ``I'm proud to be
the first one.''

Spain's Olano claims overall lead with time trial win

Lance Armstrong; CORRECTS spelling of Melcior sted Melchor. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ALCUDIA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Spain's Abraham Olano of the
Banesto team stormed through Sunday's ninth stage individual time
trial to take the overall leadership of the Tour of Spain cycling
marathon.
	   Olano covered the 39.5-kilometer (24.5-mile) flat run in 47
minutes and 7 seconds. His closest rival, Melcior Mauri of the
Once-Deustche Bank team, needed 41 seconds more.
	   ``Everything turned out well, but there was a stretch when I
lost my rhythm because of the strong wind that blew almost all the
time,'' Olano told reporters after the race.
	   Prior to the ninth leg held on the island of Mallorca, one of
the Mediterranean Balearic Islands, Olano was at No. 5 in the
standings of the 22-stage Tour.
	   Fellow Banesto rider Jose Maria Jimenez, who went into the time
trial in the lead, needed over four minutes more than Olano to
finish the windy course.
	   Switzerland's Alex Zuelle of Festina, one of the favorites to
take the stage, put in a disappointing performance and came in 2
minutes and 24 seconds behind the winning time.
	   But another favored sprinter, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert of the
Once, put in a strong run and moved up one place in the overall
table to No. 2.
	   American former world champion Lance Armstrong placed sixth in
the stage and held on to the No. 4 spot in the Tour standings.
	   The cyclists are due a rest day Monday in preparation for a week
of grueling mountain stages through northern Spain.
	   ``This victory is a big morale boost for the upcoming high
mountain stages where you always have to be looking out for
breakaway attempts,'' Olano said.

Late goal by South African stuns Dortmund

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A goal by South African international
Delron Buckley three minutes from the end gave Bochum an upset 1-0
victory at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday.
	   The game was marred by an incident in the 17th minute, when a
full bottle of water hurled from the section the stands filled with
Bochum fans hit Dortmund midfielder Thomas Haessler in the head.
	   Haessler, who was preparing to take a corner kick when he was
struck, suffered a cut but returned to the game seven minutes
later.
	   A crowd of 67,000 fans saw the match between the two rival clubs
from the same area.
	   Buckley's goal sent Dortmund, Champions Cup winner two seasons
ago, to its second defeat in four games.

	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ A radical Palestinian guerrilla leader
vowed Sunday _ on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
peace accords _ to keep up armed struggle against Israel.
	   ``The birth of the Al Mujahed (holy warrior) Popular Army _ Al
Aqsa Brigade _ confirms our adherence to arms and the resistance
option until the Israeli occupation of (Arab) territories is
eliminated and Al Aqsa Mosque is liberated,'' said Col. Munir
Makdah.
	   Makdah, who opposes Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's 1993
peace accords with Israel, spoke at a graduation of some 200
Palestinian fighters at the teeming refugee camp of Ein El-Hilweh
in southern Lebanon.
	   Ein El-Hilweh, on the outskirts of the southern port city of
Sidon, is home to 55,000 refugees.
	   Makdah also praised last month's bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania last month 258 people.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia received a
red carpet welcome from Prince Charles on Sunday at the beginning
of a three-nation tour.
	   Since Saudi King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, Abdullah has
been running the country's day-to-day affairs.
	   During a two-week trip that also will take him to France and the
United States, Abdullah will discuss the stalled Middle East peace
process and regional security issues, according to officials in his
office who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He also hope to encourage more European and American investment
in Saudi Arabia, they said.
	   Prince Abdullah flew into London's Heathrow Airport aboard a
private Boeing 747 jet from Riyadh and was met by Prince Charles
and a Royal Air Force guard of honor. A military band played the
British and Saudi national anthems.
	   Abdullah is to meet with Prime Minister Tony Blair at 10 Downing
St. He will visit Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle in Scotland
and also have discussions with Prince Charles.
	   British, French and American forces are stationed in Saudi
Arabia to help patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq that was
set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims from the
Iraqi regime.
	   Saudi Arabia, with the world's largest oil reserves, has been
facing budget problems because of low oil prices on international
markets. The kingdom has been trying to lure foreign investment as
part of its efforts to diversify its economy into non-oil areas.
	   Abdullah will fly to France on Wednesday before heading to the
United States Sept. 19, his office said.

Ferrari driver caps season-long pursuit at Monza

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Two-time world champion Michael Schumacher
capped a seven-month pursuit Sunday by equaling Mika Hakkinen on
points in the world Formula One championship.
	   Leading teammate Eddie Irvine for a 1-2 Ferrari triumph in the
Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher piled up 80 points in 14 races and
annulled a gap from his Finnish rival which had reached as high as
22 points following the Monaco GP, in May.
	   Each victory awards 10 points with 6 points going to the
second-place.
	   With only two championship races left, on circuits that should
fit Ferrari cars more than McLaren-Mercedes, the German driver can
look forward to his third world drivers title in five years _ an
achievement that appeared almost impossible by mid season.
	   Sunday's victory did not come without problems as Schumacher was
off to a slow start from the pole position and slipped to fourth
place in the initial laps.
	   A blown engine, which stopped the leading McLaren-Mercedes of
David Coulthard, and a daring attack by Schumacher on Hakkinen's
other McLaren during the decisive 17th lap vaulted the Ferrari
driver from third to first place among the cheers of 110,000
partisan fans who had fallen silent following the bad start.
	   Hakkinen, who led Schumacher by seven points prior to the
Italian race, definitely compromised his chances of keeping a
narrow championship lead by falling from second to fourth place in
the final laps.
	   The Finnish driver, who has commanded the world standings since
winning the first two season races in Australia and Brazil, spun
off at the Roggia corner while chasing the race leader, only 2.8
seconds behind.
	   Hakkinen avoided stalling in the gravel and roared back into the
track, but he could not avoid being overtaken by Irvine for second
place and by Michael's younger brother, Ralf, for third.
	   Ralf Schumacher, who drove a Jordan-Mugen Honda, hugged his
brother on the podium as thousands of Ferrari supporters waved the
red-and-yellow flags with the prancing horse logo.
	   Ralf is expected to join Williams next year and team with
two-time CART champion Alex Zanardi.
	   ``I must thank Eddie and Ralf for helping me to earn
co-leadership,'' Schumacher said. ``I'm looking forward to the next
races, on circuits where Ferrari should be more competitive.''
	   The two last championship races _ the GP of Luxembourg at
Nurburgring and the Japanese GP at Suzuka _ are scheduled on Sept.
27 and Nov. 1.
	   The Nurburgring circuit, which already hosted the German GP this
year, is considered Schumacher's home track and one of his favorite
venues.
	   Defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve, who had been as
slow as Schumacher starting in front row, did not finish.
	   The Canadian driver retired during the 37th of the 53-lap race,
while holding fourth place in his Williams.
	   Long out of contention for the title, Villeneuve already
announced he will join the newly-established British American
Racing team next year.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second post-war
national elections ended peacefully Sunday, with voters turning out
in large numbers and several polling stations allowing people
waiting in line to vote after the official closing time.
	   Polling stations closed at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT), but people waiting
at that time at 62 stations were permitted to cast their votes,
according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which ran the election.
	   The voting was hindered by computer glitches that caused a few
dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations to fail to open
Saturday due to missing voter registration lists. All but one
operated on Sunday.
	   Bosnian Serb police arrested one man Sunday after a group
entered a voting station and damaged a ballot box, according to
U.N. police spokesman Andrea Angeli. The incident occurred in
Lokanj, a Bosnian Serb village about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for election considered
crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also caused some
voters to show up at the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''
	   Turnout nationwide was described as heavy, with about 33 percent
of registered voters casting ballots Saturday and more than that on
Sunday. Initial returns were expected Tuesday.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, gave
voters a choice between hard-line ethnic leaders from the war era
and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan that halted
the fighting.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two entities _
a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters selected a
three-member presidency _ one from each ethnic group _ along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in each entity.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   ``I think these elections are a good chance to finally change
the situation in which we are living now,'' said Senada Malanovic,
25, a Muslim woman in the southern town of Mostar. ``I'm not quite
sure how much people from these areas will use that chance.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Western allies led by the United States and the European Union,
who effectively run the country now under the Dayton agreement,
hope ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war will lose
support this weekend and eventually fade away.
	   In the first post-war election in 1996 and a local ballot last
year, the ruling hard-line parties saw their backing decrease even
though they still won.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong and the outcome
of major races involving hard-line candidates was uncertain.
	   A total of 83 parties, coalitions and independent candidates,
were listed on the complicated ballots, with voters choosing only
leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than 2.7
million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people were registered.
	   Individual candidates ran for the three spots on the joint
presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while parties
competed for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also chose a republic president.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of a popular
opposition leader, crowds stormed the main government building
Sunday, setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano and his ministers fled in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded. The United States and the European Union appealed for
calm, fearful the turmoil could topple Albania's elected government
and spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha also urged his followers to
remain calm until Monday's funeral of his ally Azem Hajdari, 35, a
popular, charismatic politician fatally wounded Saturday in front
of Democratic Party headquarters.
	   But Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and
warned him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping, chanted
``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Later, Berisha's Democratic Party issued a three-point demand
calling on Nano to resign by noon (1000 gmt) Monday; establishment
of a ``technical government'' to prepare for new elections and to
find Hajdari's killers.
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The Interior Ministry reported ``unlawful developments'' in
``other towns'' but gave no further details. Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga also said the situation in the country's maximum
security prison was ``tense'' but without elaboration.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Tirana urged Albanians to ``put down their
weapons, crease threatening violence and pursue legitimate
democratic and legal means to deal with the situation.''
	   ``Leaders of all Albania's political parties must behave
responsibly,'' the American statement said. The European Union
expressed concern that the killings ``could lead to further
violence which would make national reconciliation even more
difficult.''
	   The violence raised fears of a repeat of the 1997 nationwide
riots which swept this country after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are
fighting for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. The rebels maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility. But Berisha
blamed Nano's party, and at a Sunday morning rally, the former
president warned the opposition would use ``all means'' to force
him out.
	   After Berisha issued his ultimatum, about 1,500 of his followers
marched Sunday to the Interior Ministry, firing pistols in the air
and pelting the building with stones.
	   The crowd set fire to a ministry vehicle, then continued down
the city's main street to the prime minister's office. Protesters
opened fire at the third floor, which contains Nano's offices.
Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the protesters forced their way into the building, traded
gunfire with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano and
his Cabinet fled out a side exit through the smoke and amid
explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had set
on fire.
	   The crowd then returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed at Berisha's urging.
	   Late Sunday, supporters brought Hajdari's body to the sprawling
Skanderberg Square for an all-night vigil before Monday's funeral.
President Rexhep Meidani called on police to find Hajdari's killers
as quickly as possible.
	   In a nationally televised address, Meidani urged all politicians
to `stop the language of hate.''

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The tourists arrive in Peggy's
Cove by the busload, cameras in hand, to climb on the oceanside
rocks and snap pictures of what locals claim is the most
photographed lighthouse in all of Canada.
	   But there's a pall these days: the death of the 229 people
aboard Swissair Flight 111.
	   Eleven days after the plane crashed into the Atlantic 5 miles (8
kilometers) off the coast, the postcard-pretty fishing village is
starting to return to normal _ sort of.
	   Alongside the tourists are victims' relatives who came here to
mourn, and dozens of police and military personnel remain as the
recovery of remains and the investigation into the crash continue.
	   Most of the tourists had planned to come here months before the
Geneva-bound McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 plunged into the sea on Sept.
2.
	   Some visitors, like Carol Ambrozy, 59, of Athol, Massachusetts,
had considered skipping this part of their Nova Scotia tour after
the disaster.
	   ``Your first instinct is to avoid it, and that's not right,''
she said, fighting tears. ``There's a need for people to
acknowledge what happened and to pay their respects.''
	   In the days after the crash, the tiny town _ accessible only by
a road off a coastal highway _ was closed off. No tourists allowed.
The locals had to prove residency to get to their seaside cottages.
	   On Tuesday, the town was reopened, and more and more people have
been arriving.
	   Business is usually booming this time of year, said Diane
Waters, the hostess at the Sou'Wester, a local restaurant-cum-gift
shop with a water view from nearly every table. But on Saturday,
only five tour buses stopped in _ less than half of what's typical
for September.
	   ``Slowly, it's getting back to normal,'' she said Sunday as she
rang up customers' breakfast bills. ``It's going to take a while,
but we'll get back.''
	   The signs of the crash are still everywhere. At the base of the
lighthouse is a memorial to the victims _ teddy bears, Bibles,
flowers and notes reading ``God be with you.'' Off the rocks, out
at sea, U.S. and Canadian navy and coast guard vessels were clearly
visible despite the overcast day.
	   From those ships, divers were searching for human remains, and a
salvage vessel was preparing to hoist pieces of wreckage from
180-foot (55 meter) depths.
	   On Sunday, as tourists milled about, police escorted about a
dozen adults and children, all relatives of the victims, to the
lighthouse rocks. Locals called it an odd and somber paradox.
	   Many of the tourists said they felt a connection to the crash by
simply being here.
	   Mauro Cusce, 70, of Yorktown, Virginia, said some prayers and
sang ``Amazing Grace'' as he and 40 others pulled into Peggy's Cove
on their tour bus.
	   The placemats and refrigerator magnets he bought from the
Sou'Wester on Sunday ``have meaning now, rather than (being) just a
trinket.''
	   Sheila Crooks, owner of the Breakwater Inn, had all three of her
guest rooms filled with tourists Saturday night _ the first time in
more than a week that she had a full house of people other than
reporters.
	   But not all is normal. The water view from the front of her inn
is still obstructed by green military tents and police vehicles.
	   The local fishermen have been hard-hit financially. Over the
weekend, authorities reduced a 250-square-mile
(650-square-kilometer) no-fishing zone to about 212 square miles
(550 square kilometers). Fisheries managers, however, have been
escorting boats that need to get in and out of the exclusionary
zone, and have allowed some fishermen with tuna trapped in area
nets to feed their catch and make sure the fish are doing all
right, said Peter Partington, regional director of fisheries
management.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of a popular
opposition leader, crowds stormed the main government building
Sunday, setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano and his ministers fled in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded. The United States and the European Union appealed for
calm, fearful the turmoil could topple Albania's elected government
and spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including the neighboring
Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha also urged his followers to
remain calm until Monday's funeral of Azem Hajdari, 35, a popular,
charismatic politician fatally wounded Saturday in front of
Democratic Party headquarters.
	   Nobody immediately claimed responsibility.
	   But Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and
warned him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping, chanted
``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Later, Berisha's Democratic Party issued a three-point demand
calling on Nano to resign by noon (1000 gmt) Monday; establishment
of a ``technical government'' to prepare for new elections and to
find Hajdari's killers.
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The Interior Ministry reported ``unlawful developments'' in
``other towns'' but gave no further details. Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga also said the situation in the country's maximum
security prison was ``tense'' but did not elaborate.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Tirana urged Albanians to ``put down their
weapons, cease threatening violence and pursue legitimate
democratic and legal means to deal with the situation.''
	   ``Leaders of all Albania's political parties must behave
responsibly,'' the American statement said. The European Union
expressed concern that the killings ``could lead to further
violence which would make national reconciliation even more
difficult.''
	   The violence raised fears of a repeat of the 1997 nationwide
riots that swept this country after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Instability in Albania could also impede U.S. and European
efforts to solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. The rebels maintain sanctuaries in northern
Albania.
	   After Berisha issued his ultimatum, about 1,500 of his followers
marched Sunday to the Interior Ministry, firing pistols in the air
and pelting the building with stones.
	   The crowd set fire to a ministry vehicle, then continued down
the city's main street to the prime minister's office. Protesters
opened fire at the third floor, which contains Nano's offices.
Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the protesters forced their way into the building, traded
gunfire with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano and
his Cabinet fled out a side exit through the smoke and amid
explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had set
on fire.
	   The crowd then returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed at Berisha's urging.
	   Late Sunday, supporters brought Hajdari's body to the sprawling
Skanderberg Square for an all-night vigil before Monday's funeral.
President Rexhep Meidani called on police to find Hajdari's killers
as quickly as possible.
	   In a nationally televised address, Meidani also urged all
politicians to `stop the language of hate.''

Chirac phones his support; politician says `I told you so'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chirac comment

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac called Bill Clinton
on Sunday and assured him of his support while the U.S. president
was in the grips of a sex scandal.
	   In a half-hour phone call, Chirac ``reiterated all his esteem
and friendship for President clinton during the personal test he is
going through,'' Chirac spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said late
Sunday.
	   ``At a moment when the world is confronted by grave political
and financial uncertainties, it is essential for us all that the
president of the United States be able to fully exert his
responsibilities,'' Colonna said, quoting Chirac.
	   The two leaders spoke about Iraq, where the ambassadors of
France, Russia and China had just made an appeal to the Baghdad
government to U.N. weapons inspections to resume, Colonna said.
	   They discussed the world financial situation and the crisis in
Russia. On Kosovo, they spoke of ``their determination to get
negotiations relaunched,'' the spokeswoman said.
	   Meanwhile, the head of a center-right party said the controversy
makes a case for politicians to guard their private lives.
	   ``By continuously turning the spotlight on supposedly idyllic
couples ... and their supposedly absolute virtues to win elections,
they shouldn't be surprised when it boomerangs,'' said Francois
Bayrou, head of Democratic Force.
	   ``You have to be discreet. Who's perfect? No one,'' Bayrou, a
former education minister, told reporters when asked about the
scandal surrounding Clinton and former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``If you put on the scale the stability of the planet and the
sad capers with Monica Lewinsky, it's completely different,'' he
said. ``There's a fragility of democracies that's a source of worry
for everyone.''
	   The French have allowed its politicians to shield their private
lives from public scrutiny. The late President Francois Mitterrand
wasn't confronted about his illegitimate daughter until she was an
adult and he was at the end of his career, and the revelation
caused little debate.
	   A Sunday newspaper, noting continued support for Clinton in the
polls, suggested the president stood a chance to overcome the
scandal.
	   ``America doesn't abandon Bill Clinton,'' headlined France's
weekly Journal de Dimanche. ``More than ever, le Comeback Kid seems
determined to fight,'' the paper reported.

Death toll crosses 2,600 in Indian floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Floods that inundated large parts of
northern and eastern India have killed at least 2,632 people, and
officials said Sunday they feared the toll would go higher.
	   Although floods have begun to recede in the last few days, the
number of deaths may continue to inch up as waterborne diseases
claim new victims from the worst flooding to hit India in decades.
	   In the worst-hit Uttar Pradesh state, India's most populous,
1,967 people have died since the major rivers in the state _ the
Ganges and the Jamuna _ overflowed their banks and flooded the
low-lying fertile plains.
	   Now, officials and relief volunteers are bracing to fight an
outbreak of disease.
	   ``People are drinking the same water they are bathing and
washing clothes in. No insecticides have been sprayed on the
stagnant waters,'' said state official Surendra Awasthi.

Search continues for new Spanish coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from Aragones regarding his rejection of
offer &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Veteran coach Luis Aragones on Sunday
rejected an offer to take on Spain's beleaguered national soccer
squad, sending the Spanish Football Federation scurrying to find
another option to replace Javier Clemente, state-owned radio
reported.
	   Clemente's departure last week was promoted by a humiliating 3-2
defeat by semiprofessional Cyprus that added insult to the injury
of a disappointing World Cup performance.
	   Aragones refused the job because the Federation insisted he work
with Clemente's support team rather than bring in his own, the
coach told the national news agency EFE.
	   ``Any coach would like to train their national side but the job
is complicated and the responsibility high, so if the offer is a
closed offer it is important to think about it very hard,'' EFE
quoted Aragones as saying.
	   But according to the agency Aragones hinted that the Federation
could soften its position. ``Other routes could be opened,'' he
told EFE.
	   If no new route is opened for Aragones, the most frequently
mentioned option to restore national soccer pride is the fans'
favorite Jose Antonio Camacho. Camacho, 43, resigned as Real
Madrid's coach in July after just days on the job.
	   A regular on Madrid's first team between 1974 and 1989, Camacho
won six championships and two UEFA Cup trophies, before retiring as
a player and going on to coach first-division teams Espanyol and
Sevilla.
	   Aragones, 60, retired from coaching first-division Betis last
August. He holds the record for the most games as coach in the
Spanish league _ 611 _ having trained powerhouse FC Barcelona for
one season in 1988, and Atletico de Madrid on three occasions over
the last 20 years.
	   Clemente had overseen the national squad in 62 games for a
record 36 wins, 20 ties and six losses. But this record was
overshadowed by Spain's ignominious exit from the World Cup in the
first round.

 &UR; Kosovo Albanians say 14 refugees killed in ambushes
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports of ambush of refugees, details of more
refugees approaching Montenegro; CHANGES Dateline, Byline; no

 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   DRELJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav republic of Montenegro
transported 3,200 Kosovo refugees to Albania on Sunday, saying it
could not provide for them even though they are citizens of
Yugoslavia.
	   In addition, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
said at least 14 Kosovo Albanian civilians had been killed in
ambushes while trying to cross into Montenegro, which along with
Serbia forms all that remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, and its 2 million, mostly ethnic
Albanian inhabitants are _ along with Montenegrins _ citizens of
Yugoslavia. The refugees were fleeing fighting in Kosovo, where
Albanian rebels are battling government forces for independence.
	   Claims of 14 dead could not be confirmed. But residents of this
village high above the Rugove valley said they knew of two refugees
killed this weekend by Yugoslav army snipers.
	   The villagers said all the refugees came from Istinic, about 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, where up to 40,000 refugees
camped late last week to flee an advance of Serb security forces.
All refugees left Istinic in recent days, forced out by Serb
police.
	   Authorities in Montenegro said they deported the 3,200 ethnic
Albanians because of security reasons and the fact that the
cash-strapped government could no longer provide for them.
	   The group had made the treacherous journey on foot over the
mountain gorge dividing Kosovo and Montenegro and arrived Friday at
the Montenegrin border town of Plav, 60 kilometers (37.5 miles)
northeast of Montenegro's capital Podgorica.
	   The police there denied them entry. Having nowhere to turn, the
group camped for two days and nights under open skies, in chilly
mountain weather, with only a few hundred blankets and meager food
provided by local relief officials.
	   On Sunday, Montenegrin police shipped the refugees by bus to the
Albanian border, which was temporarily reopened to allow them to
cross.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan, who visited the site
again Sunday, claimed the refugees welcomed the move.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to what he said were
official reports that there were gunmen and arms among the
refugees.
	   Police said they discovered a ``large amount of various arms and
some uniforms scattered along the trail,'' implying some of the
refugees belonged to the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces that has killed
hundreds and left more than 265,000 homeless since it began six
months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier.
	   Residents of Drelje said a few thousand tired and hungry
refugees, mostly women, children and elderly, straggled past their
villages this weekend en route to Montenegro.
	   The group, which is currently camped out just inside Kosovo
territory, is addition to those deported.
	   ``There are many ill and old,'' said a teacher in Drelje. The
teacher, who refused to give his name, said four of the group died
from sickness and accused Yugoslav army snipers in the region of
killing two male refugees.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
Fernando del Mundo, said his organization had reports of at least
3,000 more refugees on the move toward Montenegro.
	   On Friday, Montenegrin government announced it would no longer
accept refugees from Kosovo, despite their Yugoslav citizenship.
The small republic has already registered more than 40,000 refugees
from the war-torn province.
	   Montenegro has about 72,350 refugees _ the equivalent of 11.6
percent of its population _ including about 30,000 who fled
fighting earlier this decade in the former Yugoslav republics of
Croatia and Bosnia.

World wonders whether President Clinton can survive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 11-13 with Brazil reaction &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Clinton &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu called
President Clinton a friend and predicted he will survive. German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl hoped the United States' role in the world
has not been compromised.
	   And newspapers around the world devoted pages Sunday to the
crisis in Washington over lurid revelations about Clinton's
extramarital sex life, including his encounters with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   Many editorial writers concluded Clinton will remain in office,
despite what Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr says is a raft of
impeachable offenses.
	   ``More than ever, le Comeback Kid seems determined to fight,''
headlined France's weekly Journal de Dimanche newspaper.
	   ``More perhaps than any politician in history, he has the guile
and stamina'' to survive, opined London's Sunday Telegraph, a
frequent critic of Clinton. ``But if he does, it will be a victory
for the political art rather than a victory for honor.''
	   In contrast, Hong Kong's English-language daily, The South China
Morning Post, felt that ``the time has come for Bill Clinton to
stop apologizing and resign himself to the fact that his fight for
survival has reached its end.''
	   Netanyahu said Clinton was ``a friend to Israel'' with the
strength to survive.
	   ``My impression is the American society, the democracy and
presidency are very, very secure institutions and I imagine they
will get through this in peace,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio.
	   Kohl was concerned that the U.S. president ``must retain his
ability to govern.''
	   ``It is of utmost importance that the only world power can fully
take on its tasks. Asia, Africa, India _ everywhere there are
problems,'' he was quoted as telling Bild am Sonntag.
	   In Brazil, Rio de Janeiro's broadsheet O Globo, under the
headline ``Clinton Humiliated,'' examined the report over five
pages.
	   Jornal do Brasil, another Rio broadaheet, devoted a page and a
half to the story, saying the Clinton was pathetic as a lame duck
and that the scandal could damage world economy.
	   But it called the Starr enquiry ``theater of the absurd.'' The
Jornal dismissed the sexual aspect of the report and said only
three accusations were serious: perjury, obstruction of justice and
abuse of power.
	   Many abhorred the graphic detail in Starr's report.
	   The major Japanese newspaper Asahi called it ``vivid and
disgusting'' and bemoaned the damage done to the U.S. president at
a time when he needs to show firm leadership in the world.
	   ``President Clinton's sex scandal has none of the political
aspects of Watergate,'' the paper said, but concluded that ``if
this damages the credibility of American politics as well as the
leadership of President Clinton, it can no longer be treated as a
personal problem.''
	   In an editorial titled ``Hell is American,'' the French
center-left daily Le Monde, which ran a 16-page supplement, called
the Starr investigation a ``new McCarthyism,'' referring to Senator
Joe McCarthy who led a bitter campaign in the 1950s to expose
public figures suspected of having communist sympathies.

Aris, Ionikos draw, share second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Aris Salonica and Ionikos Nikea played to
a 1-1 draw Sunday to share second place of the Greek first division
soccer league.
	   The draw sent the two teams into a four-way tie in second place
of the league. Defending champion Olympiakos and AEK Athens are the
other two clubs sharing the position.
	   They four clubs are two points behind Panathinaikos Athens which
is at the top of the league with nine points after three games.
	   In games played Saturday, Panathinaikos beat Ethnikos Asteras
4-1 at home. Olympiakos defeated Verria 3-0 away on goals from
Vassilis Karapialis in the 15th minute, Brazilian midfielder
Luciano de Souza in the 37th and Ghanaian striker Peter Oforiquaye
in the 44th.
	   AEK played to a scoreless draw against newcomer Panelefsiniakos
Elefsina away.
	   Both Aris and Ionikos played rough. As a result, the two teams
ended the match with only nine players each.
	   Scottish striker Graig Brewster gave Ionikos a 1-0 lead with a
blistering shot from outside the area in the 55th.
	   Aris, encouraged by more than 20,000 supporters, reacted and
managed to level with Manolis Mitsopoulos after a melee in front of
the Ionikos goalmouth in the 77th.
	   On Saturday, Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha scored twice as
Panathinaikos trounced Ethnikos Asteras 4-1.
	   Playing at the Athens Olympic stadium before 10,000 spectators,
Panathinaikos went ahead in the score with Warzycha off a pass from
Costas Kiassos in the 6th. s But one minute later, the visitors
levelled with a ground-hugging right-footed free kick by Serbian
striker Davor Jakovlevic.
	   Panathinaikos, Polish goaltender Jozef Wandzik made a
spectacular save to a powerful shot by Jakovlevic in the 15th.
	   The hosts besieged Ethnikos Asteras' area the rest of the half,
firing three shots onto Vangelis Hosadas' bars and losing at least
four more scoring chances.
	   Norway's Frank Strandli, installed by Greek coach Vassilis
Daniel as a third striker after the rest period, gave his team the
lead in the 64th off a perfect pass from midfielder Erik Mykland,
Panathinaikos' second Norwegian player.
	   In the 79th, Fotis Lagos made things easier for Panathinaikos
when, in his effort to save a weak shot from Kiassos, he sent the
ball into his team's goalmouth.
	   Warzycha sealed the victory in the 80th.

Kosovo Albanians say 14 refugees killed in ambushes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRELJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav republic of Montenegro
transported 3,200 Kosovo refugees to Albania on Sunday, saying it
could not provide for them even though they are citizens of
Yugoslavia.
	   In addition, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
said at least 14 Kosovo Albanian civilians had been killed in
ambushes while trying to cross into Montenegro, which along with
Serbia forms all that remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, and its 2 million, mostly ethnic
Albanian inhabitants are _ along with Montenegrins _ citizens of
Yugoslavia. The refugees were fleeing fighting in Kosovo, where
Albanian rebels are battling government forces for independence.
	   Claims of 14 dead could not be confirmed. But residents of this
village high above the Rugove valley said they knew of two refugees
killed this weekend by Yugoslav army snipers.
	   The villagers said all the refugees came from Istinic, about 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, where up to 40,000 refugees
camped late last week to flee an advance of Serb security forces.
All refugees left Istinic in recent days, forced out by Serb
police.
	   Authorities in Montenegro said they deported the 3,200 ethnic
Albanians because of security reasons and the fact that the
cash-strapped government could no longer provide for them.
	   The group had made the treacherous journey on foot over the
mountain gorge dividing Kosovo and Montenegro and arrived Friday at
the Montenegrin border town of Plav, 60 kilometers (40 miles)
northeast of Montenegro's capital Podgorica.
	   The police there denied them entry. Having nowhere to turn, the
group camped for two days and nights under open skies, in chilly
mountain weather, with only a few hundred blankets and meager food
provided by local relief officials.
	   On Sunday, Montenegrin police shipped the refugees by bus to the
Albanian border, which was temporarily reopened to allow them to
cross.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan, who visited the site
again Sunday, claimed the refugees welcomed the move.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to what he said were
official reports that there were gunmen and arms among the
refugees.
	   Police said they discovered a ``large amount of various arms and
some uniforms scattered along the trail,'' implying some of the
refugees belonged to the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces that has killed
hundreds and left more than 265,000 homeless since it began six
months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier.
	   Residents of Drelje said a few thousand tired and hungry
refugees, mostly women, children and elderly, straggled past their
villages this weekend en route to Montenegro.
	   The group, which is currently camped out just inside Kosovo
territory, is addition to those deported.
	   ``There are many ill and old,'' said a teacher in Drelje. The
teacher, who refused to give his name, said four of the group died
from sickness and accused Yugoslav army snipers in the region of
killing two male refugees.
	   A spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
Fernando del Mundo, said his organization had reports of at least
3,000 more refugees on the move toward Montenegro.
	   On Friday, Montenegrin government announced it would no longer
accept refugees from Kosovo, despite their Yugoslav citizenship.
The small republic has already registered more than 40,000 refugees
from the war-torn province.
	   Montenegro has about 72,350 refugees _ the equivalent of 11.6
percent of its population _ including about 30,000 who fled
fighting earlier this decade in the former Yugoslav republics of
Croatia and Bosnia.

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The editor-in-chief and a prominent
correspondent for a major Georgian newspaper were attacked by an
armed group in downtown Tbilisi, police said Sunday. Both were
hurt, one seriously.
	   There was no indication why the group attacked the two men, who
work for the daily newspaper Asaval-Dasavali. The paper is
considered politically independent and influential.
	   The editor, Lasha Nadareishvili, was seriously injured in the
attack, according to Algudzha Dzhamburia, chief of the police
district where the incident occurred Friday night. Correspondent
David Okropiridze was hit in the head with the butt of a gun, but
was less seriously hurt.
	   Dzhamburia said the incident is under investigation.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second post-war
national elections ended peacefully Sunday, with voters turning out
in large numbers and several polling stations allowing people
waiting in line to vote after the official closing time.
	   Robert Barry, the official in charge of organizing the vote,
called it ``the most successful elections held here since'' the war
ended in 1995, while the European overseer of Bosnia called it a
``great day for democracy.''
	   ``It proves the maturity of the Bosnian people,'' said Carlos
Westendorp, the high representative from Europe.
	   Polling stations closed at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) on the second day
of voting, but people waiting at that time at 62 stations were
permitted to cast their votes, according to Barry's Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which ran the election.
	   The voting was hindered by computer glitches that caused a few
dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations to fail to open
Saturday due to missing voter registration lists. All but one
operated on Sunday.
	   Bosnian Serb police arrested one man Sunday after a group
entered a voting station and damaged a ballot box, according to
U.N. police spokesman Andrea Angeli. The incident occurred in
Lokanj, a Bosnian Serb village about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo.
	   In Banja Luka in the Bosnian Serb republic, police detained a
Sarajevo-based television crew for two hours, allegedly for filming
the office of republic President Biljana Plavsic without
permission. Barry called the detention outrageous and said it would
be investigated as a violation of election rules.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for the election considered
crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also resulted in
some voters going to the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''
	   Turnout nationwide exceeded 70 percent, Barry said, and initial
returns were expected Tuesday.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, gave
voters a choice between hard-line ethnic leaders from the war era
and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan that halted
the fighting.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two entities _
a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters selected a
three-member presidency _ one from each ethnic group _ along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in each entity.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   ``I think these elections are a good chance to finally change
the situation in which we are living now,'' said Senada Malanovic,
25, a Muslim woman in the southern town of Mostar. ``I'm not quite
sure how much people from these areas will use that chance.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Western allies led by the United States and the European Union,
who effectively run the country now under the Dayton agreement,
hope ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war will lose
support this weekend and eventually fade away.
	   In the first post-war election in 1996 and a local ballot last
year, the ruling hard-line parties saw their backing decrease even
though they still won.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong and the outcome
of major races involving hard-line candidates was uncertain.
	   ``I hope ... it would have been another step in the right
direction of pluralism, of moderation in the country,'' Westendorp
said.
	   A total of 83 parties, coalitions and independent candidates,
were listed on the complicated ballots, with voters choosing only
leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than 2.7
million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people were registered.
	   Individual candidates ran for the three spots on the joint
presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while parties
competed for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also chose a republic president.

Mission accomplished for Davenport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with women's doubles &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport had been in tennis' waiting
room a long time.
	   Touted as one of America's finest young players after winning
the U.S. Open junior championship in 1992, she was unable to push
past the promise of her potential.
	   Except for a couple of doubles championships, Davenport carried
the label of a Grand Slam also-ran. Then came a dream summer that
ended with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over defending champion Martina
Hingis for the U.S. Open crown, the title she's always craved.
	   ``The sight at the end of the tunnel of winning the Grand Slam
was what kept me going,'' she said.
	   The joy of that accomplishment was hardly diminished Sunday when
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva lost the women's doubles title to
Hingis and Jana Novotna 6-3, 6-3.
	   For Hingis, it completed a doubles Grand Slam. She won with
Mirjana Lucic at Australia, then with Novotna at the French,
Wimbledon and U.S., becoming only the fourth woman in history to
complete the sweep.
	   Until the Open, Davenport's only Slam successes had been in
doubles. She won the French in 1996 with Mary Joe Fernandez and the
U.S. Open last year with Novotna. Her Olympic gold medal in 1996
was largely ignored, but it was a signal she was getting ready to
move into tennis' upper echelon.
	   Last September, she reached the U.S. Open semifinals for the
first time and then got to semis at the Australian and French Opens
and the quarters at Wimbledon.
	   ``At the French, everybody criticized me for playing a bad match
in the semis,'' she said, recalling a straight-sets loss to
eventual champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. ``I looked at it as such
a positive. I did so well at the French. I thought I was hitting
the ball well.
	   ``Again at Wimbledon, I thought I was doing well. Once Wimbledon
ended, I couldn't wait for the hardcourt season to begin.''
	   Davenport won three straight matches on hardcourts in California
and had a 14-match winning streak in the weeks before the Open.
	   She also embarked on a fitness program that trimmed 25 pounds
(11.34 kilos) and left her quicker than ever. Even a semifinal loss
to Steffi Graf in an Open tuneup couldn't diminish her enthusiasm.
	   She marched through the Open like a player on a mission, and it
paid off.
	   ``The two weeks have been great,'' she said. ``I didn't lose a
set. I played great tennis. I don't think I ever really got down on
myself, which has been a big thing. I was able to really, in my
eyes, act like a champion and really win the title.''
	   Hingis did not make it easy. With Davenport up a set and serving
for a 5-2 lead in the second, the world's No. 1 player rallied.
	   ``She stopped making her errors,'' Davenport said. ``She was
running me around an awful lot then.''
	   In the past, that has been the recipe for beating Davenport, and
Hingis knew it. There was also some buzz around the tour that
Davenport got down on herself in tough spots.
	   Not this time.
	   Even after Hingis moved in front 5-4, Davenport would not be
denied.
	   ``Definitely some nerves crept in,'' she said. ``I got down 4-5
but I was able to break at love, get my footing back in the match
and just play well. ... I don't think I let anything bother me. I
was very focused. I was very calm.''
	   Davenport became the Open's first American-born women's champion
since Chris Evert in 1982. The significance was not lost on
22-year-old from Newport Beach, California.
	   ``No one's done it in a long time,'' she said. ``I'm proud to be
the first one.''

	   KRIVOLAK, Macedonia (AP) _ Canadian soldiers staffing a
checkpoint wrestled a man pretending to be a reporter to the
ground, twisted his arm behind his back and stuck the barrel of an
M-16 rifle in his ear.
	   This is an example of how NOT to deal with the media during a
peacekeeping mission, the smiling instructor told a group of
British and Hungarian troops watching a demonstration during NATO
exercises in this southern Balkan nation.
	   It was a scenario the Canadian Forces have conducted many times
in teaching military units from around the world how to deal with
the media while on duty in tense areas.
	   In the scenario, a refugee attempted to pass through the
roadblock to return to his home. Refused, he created a scene,
shouting and waving his arms. At the same time, a television crew
arrived and immediately began filming.
	   ``No filming, no filming,'' shouted the soldiers, grabbing the
camera, chasing the cameraman away and throwing the reporter to the
ground.
	   ``How many of you think that was the correct way to deal with
the press?'' Maj. Yvon Desjardins asked the two squads of
infantrymen after the end of the demonstration.
	   They shook their heads in unison and said, ``Nooo.'' But one
Canadian said this is the point where some audiences have cheered.
That, however, is the wrong answer.
	   More than 500 troops from 13 NATO nations and 13 nonmember
states are participating in week-long exercises in Macedonia. The
theme is peacekeeping, and instruction is being given on setting up
checkpoints, foot patrolling, dealing with refugees, securing an
area, and, of course, dealing with the media.
	   ``Always do your primary job first,'' advised Desjardins. In
this case, that meant taking care of the refugee and letting the
reporter watch what he wants to watch.
	   ``Use the media as an opportunity to carry your message back
home and around the world,'' he said.
	   Some of Desjardins' advice:
	   - ``Be honest. If you don't know something, say so.''
	   - ``Never lie to the media. They will find out you are lying.''
	   - ``There is no such thing as off-the-record.''
	   _ While there may be occasions that officers and other superiors
might find it useful to speak with attribution, the average soldier
on the ground never has a reason to do so.
	   - ``If something is classified, say so and explain why.''
	   - ``Never say anything you would not feel comfortable with
seeing associated with your name on the front page of a newspaper
or on TV.''
	   - ``Basically, talk to your grandmother.''
	   - ``Not all media are honest, but most of them are, just like
soldiers.''
	   - ``If you screw up, they will be there.''

Reformers tar new government as Communist; Primakov says it's not
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two leading advocates of free market reforms
assailed Russia's new government Sunday as a Communist revival, but
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov defended his team and insisted it
was dedicated to economic reform.
	   ``The continuity of the course of reforms will be guaranteed,''
Primakov said in a television interview, his first since taking
office Friday. He said Communists in his Cabinet would work for the
government, not their party.
	   Primakov was appointed after the Communist-dominated parliament
turned down President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   The new premier, who is the former foreign minister, was warmly
welcomed by Communist leaders.
	   Among the key appointments to his cabinet is a Communist Party
member and former head of the Soviet Union's central planning
agency who will be the new government's top economic official.
	   Also, the new head of the Central Bank is a former Soviet State
Bank chief whose previous response to economic trouble was to print
more money.
	   That has enraged some leading advocates of market-oriented
economic reforms, who say the country is sharply reversing course.
	   ``What has happened in this country means that the Communist
Party of the Russian Federation has come to power,'' former Deputy
Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said in an interview on the Zerkalo
television program. ``The Communist Party is the governing party
now.''
	   His remarks were echoed by former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar,
considered the architect of Russia's market reforms.
	   Gaidar was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying it was
hard to say how long the ``government of communists'' would take to
``destroy elements of a free market economy in Russia.''
	   ``Unfortunately,'' he added, ``it is clear that it will surely
do that.''
	   Primakov insisted that would not be the case. In his interview
on the influential Itogi television program, he was asked about the
appointment of Yuri Maslyukov, the former central planner, as
deputy prime minister for economic policy.
	   ``The appointment of Maslyukov is quite acceptable,'' Primakov
said. ``It does not mean that in the government he will accomplish
the line that will be dictated by the Communist Party. ... It's
absolutely out of the question.''
	   ``In the government,'' Primakov added, ``there will be people
who will belong to one team, and they will be professionals.''
	   However, Primakov also said the new government would have a
``socially-oriented'' economic policy that would balance market
reforms with the needs of the public.
	   He added, without elaboration, that he would seek to correct
``some of the mistakes made in the past.''
	   The lurching economic reform efforts of previous administrations
have ultimately led to the country's current crisis, in which the
value of the ruble has slid and the government has effectively
defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The new prime minister spent part of his day Sunday meeting with
top military officials. He didn't speak about military matters in
his interview, except to say he was ``categorically against'' a
military solution to Russia's continuing problems with the renegade
region of Chechnya.
	   Meanwhile, Maslyukov told the Echo Moscow radio station that he
intended to submit a draft of a ruble stabilization program to
Primakov on Monday. He didn't describe what it would contain, and
added: ``There is no thoroughly considered economic program to
overcome the crisis in Russia. It will be ready by the end of next
week.''

One killed in shootout between Gypsies and Albanian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ One person was killed Sunday in
northern Bohemia after about 200 angry Gypsies gathered in front of
a building housing Albanian refugees, the news agency CTK reported.
	   The agency quoted police spokesman Jarmila Hrubesova as saying
the Gypsies, also known as Roma, arrived in front of the house in
Vansdorf, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) north of here, to seek
revenge for a friend beaten in a cafe fight with Albanians the
night before.
	   Hrubesova said one of the Gypsies was killed in a shootout that
began shortly after the crowd arrived. It was unclear who fired the
shot.
	   Efforts to contact police in Vansdorf were unsuccessful due to
poor telephone lines to the area.

Report: Three suspects confess to killing four U.N. workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three suspects have confessed to killing four
United Nations workers in Tajikistan, a Russian news agency
reported Sunday.
	   The three men were arrested last week and confessed after being
presented with strong evidence against them, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said, citing a spokesman for the Tajik Interior Ministry,
Dzhumakhon Khatami.
	   Khatami identified the three as Mirzomuddin Valiyev, 29, Yakub
Darveshev, 25, and Sayedrakhmon Dovudov, 25, and said they were
members of an armed opposition group. The report said authorities
will not discuss the alleged motive for the crime.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed July 20 while on a regular
patrol in the mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of
Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. All were shot in the the head.
	   In the wake of the killings, the United Nations recalled all
non-essential foreign staff from the Central Asian nation and said
it would not assist the return of former Tajik rebels from
Afghanistan until the suspects were arrested.
	   Observers from the International Red Cross and Tajik opposition
groups were to have monitored the interrogation of the three
suspects last week.

Scary Spice weds in little village church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LITTLE MARLOW, England (AP) _ In a little church filled with
guests all dressed in white, Spice Girl Mel B married dancer David
Gulzar on Sunday, then celebrated with champagne next door at her
country mansion.
	   A white vintage Cadillac carrying the 23-year-old groom to the
church was was mobbed by photographers and fans, as was a car
carrying Posh Spice Victoria Adams and driven by her fiance David
Beckham.
	   Baby Spice Emma Bunton and Sporty Spice Mel C arrived separately
by car. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell was not thought to be
among the guests.
	   The Rev. Sue Irwin was escorted by police into the 12th century
St. John the Baptist, where she married the couple in a 40 minute
service
	   The 23-year-old bride _ expecting a baby next year _ wore a
white dress, a blue garter given to her by Baby Spice Emma Bunton,
and antique earrings from her mother. She was given away by her
father.
	   Wedding guests sang Bob Marley's ``One Love'' and two
traditional hymns. There was also music from the London Community
Gospel Choir and an all-female string quartet.
	   On a day of sunshine and showers, the reception was held in a
huge marquee in the mansion's grounds in which a small artificial
lake had been built.
	   The bride went to great lengths to shield her big day from the
public eye.
	   A white canvas tunnel was constructed between the gate in the
mansion garden wall and the church door, completely shielding
guests from view.
	   The secrecy disappointed many fans who had waited outside.
Brittany Stallwood, 7, had waited for hours without seeing a single
Spice Girl.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' she said. ``I didn't see any of them, but
I have still enjoyed the day.''
	   Mel B met her new husband when they danced together earlier this
year, and he proposed after seven weeks. She is three months
pregnant with their child.
	   Wedding speculation had intensified when it was revealed last
month that Mel was following ``Posh Spice'' into motherhood. She
and her fiance have said they will marry next year, after the birth
of their child.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A small boat with three people aboard capsized off
Russia's Far East coast during a heavy storm, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Sunday.
	   With seas being whipped by gale-force winds and the temperature
of the salt water below freezing, it was considered unlikely that
the missing crew members were alive.
	   The capsized vessel was probably a fishing boat, the NTV
television station reported
	   Staff manning a lighthouse at Cape Alevin, near the Okhotsk Sea
port of Magadan, saw the boat go down on Saturday night. The wind
and three-meter (9-foot) waves prevented rescue helicopters and
boats from being sent to the scene overnight. Three fishing boats
were sent to the area on Sunday, ITAR-Tass said.

 &UR; Baker urges exploring chances of normalizing ties with Iran

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Former U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker said Sunday that the United States should explore the
possibility of normalizing ties with Iran and consider easing U.S.
sanctions against the Islamic republic.
	   He urged his government to hold dialogue with Iranian officials.
	   But these moves would have to ``depend on Iran's international
behavior,'' said Baker, guest speaker at the opening ceremony of a
four-day Petrotech' 98 _ the Middle East Refining and
Petrochemicals Conference and Exhibition.
	   The United States broke off ties with Iran after Iranian
militants stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52
Americans hostage for 444 days. Washington also imposed sanctions
on Tehran.
	   The United States _ which accuses Iran of sponsoring
international terrorism and trying to acquire weapons of mass
destruction _ says Tehran should be isolated.
	   Iran denies the charges and blames the United States for trying
to exert its will on the rest of the world.
	   ``We should be prepared to meet official Iranian representatives
anywhere, anytime to begin a formal dialogue,'' Baker told
petroleum delegates and business leaders.
	   In general, there should be an ongoing ``people to people
contact,'' he added.
	   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami has called for dialogue
between American and Iranian people, but says it is too early to
renew government contacts.
	   Baker also called on the United States to consider easing the
sanctions on Iran _ ``when it becomes clear that Iran is actually
working... to fight terrorism and terrorist groups.''
	   Baker served as secretary of state during the 1990 Gulf War that
ousted Iraqi troops from Kuwait.

Reformers tar new government as Communist; Primakov says it's not
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 18th graf, `The new ...,' to UPDATE with
Primakov to meet with financial officials; ADDS 1 graf to UPDATE

 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two leading advocates of free market reforms
assailed Russia's new government Sunday as a communist revival, but
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov defended his team and insisted it
was dedicated to economic reform.
	   ``The continuity of the course of reforms will be guaranteed,''
Primakov said in a television interview, his first since taking
office Friday. He said Communists in his Cabinet would work for the
government, not their party.
	   Primakov was appointed after the Communist-dominated parliament
turned down President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for prime
minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   The new premier, who is the former foreign minister, was warmly
welcomed by the communists, who will also have an important voice
in his Cabinet.
	   Among the key appointments to his cabinet is a Communist Party
member and former head of the Soviet Union's central planning
agency who will be the new government's top economic official.
	   Also, the new head of the Central Bank is a former Soviet State
Bank chief whose previous response to economic trouble was to print
more money.
	   That has enraged some leading advocates of market-oriented
economic reforms, who say the country is sharply reversing course.
	   ``The Communist Party is the governing party now,'' former
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said in an interview on the
Zerkalo television program.
	   His remarks were echoed by former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar,
considered the architect of Russia's market reforms.
	   Gaidar was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying it was
hard to say how long the ``government of communists'' would take to
``destroy elements of a free market economy in Russia.''
	   ``Unfortunately,'' he added, ``it is clear that it will surely
do that.''
	   Primakov insisted that would not be the case. In his interview
on the influential Itogi television program, he was asked about the
appointment of Yuri Maslyukov, the former central planner, as
deputy prime minister for economic policy.
	   ``The appointment of Maslyukov is quite acceptable,'' Primakov
said. ``It does not mean that in the government he will accomplish
the line that will be dictated by the Communist Party. ... It's
absolutely out of the question.''
	   ``In the government,'' Primakov added, ``there will be people
who will belong to one team, and they will be professionals.''
	   However, Primakov also said the new government would have a
``socially-oriented'' economic policy that would balance market
reforms with the needs of the public.
	   He added, without elaboration, that he would seek to correct
``some of the mistakes made in the past.''
	   The lurching economic reform efforts of previous administrations
have ultimately led to the country's current crisis, in which the
value of the ruble has slid and the government has effectively
defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The new prime minister spent part of his day Sunday meeting with
top military officials. He didn't speak about military matters in
his interview, except to say he was ``categorically against'' a
military solution to Russia's continuing problems with the renegade
region of Chechnya.
	   He is expected to meet Monday with leading financial executives.
	   Meanwhile, Maslyukov told the Echo Moscow radio station that he
intended to submit a draft of a ruble stabilization program to
Primakov on Monday. He didn't describe what it would contain, and
added: ``There is no thoroughly considered economic program to
overcome the crisis in Russia. It will be ready by the end of next
week.''
	   He also said on the Zerkalo program that the new government
would ``protect the reforms,'' while fashioning a program that
offers economic stability to ``that part of the population which is
unable to protect itself.''

Aris, Ionikos draw, share second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Aris Salonica and Ionikos Nikea played to
a 1-1 draw Sunday to share second place of the Greek first division
soccer league.
	   The draw sent the two teams into a four-way tie in second place
of the league. Defending champion Olympiakos and AEK Athens are the
other two clubs sharing the position.
	   They four clubs are two points behind Panathinaikos Athens,
which is at the top of the league with nine points after three
games.
	   In games played Saturday, Panathinaikos beat Ethnikos Asteras
4-1 at home. Olympiakos defeated Verria 3-0 away on goals from
Vassilis Karapialis in the 15th minute, Brazilian midfielder
Luciano de Souza in the 37th and Ghanaian striker Peter Oforiquaye
in the 44th.
	   AEK played to a scoreless draw against newcomer Panelefsiniakos
Elefsina away.
	   Both Aris and Ionikos played rough. As a result, the two teams
ended the match with only nine players each.
	   Scottish striker Graig Brewster gave Ionikos a 1-0 lead with a
blistering shot from outside the area in the 55th.
	   Aris, encouraged by more than 20,000 supporters, reacted and
managed to level with Manolis Mitsopoulos after a melee in front of
the Ionikos goalmouth in the 77th.
	   On Saturday, Polish striker Krzysztof Warzycha scored twice as
Panathinaikos trounced Ethnikos Asteras 4-1.
	   Playing at the Athens Olympic stadium before 10,000 spectators,
Panathinaikos went ahead in the score with Warzycha off a pass from
Costas Kiassos in the 6th. But one minute later, the visitors
levelled with a ground-hugging right-footed free kick by Serbian
striker Davor Jakovlevic.
	   Panathinaikos goaltender Jozef Wandzik made a spectacular save
to a powerful shot by Jakovlevic in the 15th.
	   The hosts besieged Ethnikos Asteras' area the rest of the half,
firing three shots on to Vangelis Hosadas' bars and losing at least
four more scoring chances.
	   Norway's Frank Strandli, installed by Greek coach Vassilis
Daniel as a third striker after the rest period, gave his team the
lead in the 64th minute off a perfect pass from midfielder Erik
Mykland, Panathinaikos' second Norwegian player.
	   In the 79th, Fotis Lagos made things easier for Panathinaikos
when, in his effort to save a weak shot from Kiassos, he sent the
ball into his team's goalmouth.
	   Warzycha sealed the victory in the 80th.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's second post-war
national elections ended peacefully Sunday, with voters turning out
in large numbers and several polling stations allowing people
waiting in line to vote after the official closing time.
	   Robert Barry, the official in charge of organizing the vote,
called it the most successful elections held here since the war
ended in 1995, while the European overseer of Bosnia called it a
``great day for democracy.''
	   ``It proves the maturity of the Bosnian people,'' said Carlos
Westendorp, the chief representative from Europe.
	   Polling stations closed at 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) on the second day
of voting, but people waiting at that time at 62 stations were
permitted to cast their votes, according to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which ran the election.
	   The voting was hindered by computer glitches that caused a few
dozen of the more than 2,600 polling stations to fail to open
Saturday due to missing voter registration lists. All but one
operated on Sunday.
	   Bosnian Serb police arrested one man Sunday after a group
entered a voting station and damaged a ballot box, according to
U.N. police spokesman Andrea Angeli. The incident occurred in
Lokanj, a Bosnian Serb village about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northeast of Sarajevo.
	   In Banja Luka in the Bosnian Serb republic, police detained a
Sarajevo-based television crew for two hours, allegedly for filming
the office of republic President Biljana Plavsic without
permission. Barry called the detention outrageous and said it would
be investigated as a violation of election rules.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for the election considered
crucial to the future of the 1995 Dayton peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also resulted in
some voters going to the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''
	   Turnout nationwide exceeded 70 percent, Barry said, and initial
returns were expected Tuesday.
	   The election, the second for national leaders since the end of a
devastating 3 1-2-year war in the former Yugoslav republic, gave
voters a choice between hard-line ethnic leaders from the war era
and moderates who favor the Western-backed peace plan that halted
the fighting.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two entities _
a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters selected a
three-member presidency _ one from each ethnic group _ along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in each entity.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   ``I think these elections are a good chance to finally change
the situation in which we are living now,'' said Senada Malanovic,
25, a Muslim woman in the southern town of Mostar. ``I'm not quite
sure how much people from these areas will use that chance.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Western allies led by the United States and the European Union,
who effectively run the country now under the Dayton agreement,
hope ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war will lose
support this weekend and eventually fade away.
	   In the first post-war election in 1996 and a local ballot last
year, the ruling hard-line parties saw their backing decrease even
though they still won.
	   But ethnic nationalist sentiments remain strong and the outcome
of major races involving hard-line candidates was uncertain.
	   ``I hope ... it would have been another step in the right
direction of pluralism, of moderation in the country,'' Westendorp
said.
	   A total of 83 parties, coalitions and independent candidates,
were listed on the complicated ballots, with voters choosing only
leaders in the entity in which they registered. More than 2.7
million of Bosnia's 4.3 million people were registered.
	   Individual candidates ran for the three spots on the joint
presidency _ one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat _ while parties
competed for seats in a national parliament and separate
parliaments in each entity. In the Bosnian Serb republic, voters
also chose a republic president.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Angry over the slaying of a popular
opposition leader, crowds stormed the main government building
Sunday, setting fire to the ground floor as Prime Minister Fatos
Nano and his ministers fled in a hail of gunfire.
	   One protester was killed and four of the prime minister's guards
were wounded. The United States and the European Union appealed for
calm, fearful the turmoil could topple Albania's elected government
and spread elsewhere in the Balkans, including the neighboring
Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   Opposition leader Sali Berisha also urged his followers to
remain calm until Monday's funeral of Azem Hajdari, 35, a popular,
charismatic politician fatally wounded Saturday in front of
Democratic Party headquarters.
	   Nobody immediately claimed responsibility.
	   But Berisha blamed Nano's Socialist Party for the killing and
warned him to resign within 24 hours or face ``catastrophic
consequences.'' Berisha's followers, some of them weeping, chanted
``kill, kill, kill Fatos Nano.''
	   Later, Berisha's Democratic Party issued a three-point demand
calling on Nano to resign by noon (1000 gmt) Monday; establishment
of a ``technical government'' to prepare for new elections and to
find Hajdari's killers.
	   Elsewhere, witnesses said Berisha's followers blocked the
national highway with barricades and flaming tires and seized the
police station at Kavaja, 30 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of
here.
	   The Interior Ministry reported ``unlawful developments'' in
``other towns'' but gave no further details. Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga also said the situation in the country's maximum
security prison was ``tense'' but did not elaborate.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Tirana urged Albanians to ``put down their
weapons, cease threatening violence and pursue legitimate
democratic and legal means to deal with the situation.''
	   ``Leaders of all Albania's political parties must behave
responsibly,'' the American statement said. The European Union
expressed concern that the killings ``could lead to further
violence which would make national reconciliation even more
difficult.''
	   The violence raised fears of a repeat of the 1997 nationwide
riots that swept this country after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes that cost many Albanians their life savings.
	   Instability in Albania could also impede U.S. and European
efforts to solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia. The rebels maintain sanctuaries in northern
Albania.
	   After Berisha issued his ultimatum, about 1,500 of his followers
marched Sunday to the Interior Ministry, firing pistols in the air
and pelting the building with stones.
	   The crowd set fire to a ministry vehicle, then continued down
the city's main street to the prime minister's office. Protesters
opened fire at the third floor, which contains Nano's offices.
Troops responded with volleys of gunfire over the protesters heads.
	   But the protesters forced their way into the building, traded
gunfire with the guards and set fire to the ground floor. Nano and
his Cabinet fled out a side exit through the smoke and amid
explosions of gas tanks of seven cars which the protesters had set
on fire.
	   The crowd then returned to Democratic Party headquarters and
dispersed at Berisha's urging.
	   Late Sunday, supporters brought Hajdari's body to the sprawling
Skanderberg Square for an all-night vigil before Monday's funeral.
President Rexhep Meidani called on police to find Hajdari's killers
as quickly as possible.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's
government Sunday started to turn back the pages of yet another
dark chapter of apartheid, vowing to restore 45,000 people of mixed
race to their homes.
	   Officials kicked off an agreement to re-develop District Six, an
established Cape Town neighborhood whose destruction began in 1966
after the white minority government passed the Group Areas Act _
the law that divided up urban land according to the skin color of
its occupants.
	   ``It is our challenge now to channel the creativity and energy
of the people of District Six _ the shared memories and dreams _
into the redevelopment of the area,'' said Land Affairs Minister
Derek Hanekom.
	   From 1966 to 1971, the apartheid government forcibly scattered
District Six residents from the coveted land of their center city
community to new townships on the Cape Flats and Mitchell's Plain,
30 kilometers (18 miles) from Cape Town.
	   The homes were razed and new ones built by whites.
	   The restoration project will be funded by the government and
local and international donors.

<TEXT>
	   LITTLE MARLOW, England (AP) _ In a little church filled with
guests all dressed in white, Spice Girl Mel B married dancer David
Gulzar on Sunday, then celebrated with champagne next door at her
country mansion.
	   A white vintage Cadillac carrying the 23-year-old groom to the
church was was mobbed by photographers and fans, as was a car
carrying Posh Spice Victoria Adams and driven by her fiance David
Beckham.
	   Baby Spice Emma Bunton and Sporty Spice Mel C arrived separately
by car. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell was not thought to be
among the guests.
	   The Rev. Sue Irwin was escorted by police into the 12th century
St. John the Baptist church, where she married the couple in a 40
minute service.
	   The 23-year-old bride _ expecting a baby next year _ wore a
white dress, a blue garter given to her by Baby Spice Emma Bunton,
and antique earrings from her mother. She was given away by her
father.
	   Wedding guests sang Bob Marley's ``One Love'' and two
traditional hymns. There was also music from the London Community
Gospel Choir and an all-female string quartet.
	   On a day of sunshine and showers, the reception was held in a
huge marquee in the mansion's grounds in which a small artificial
lake had been built, 25 miles (40m km) west of central London.
	   The bride went to great lengths to shield her big day from the
public eye.
	   A white canvas tunnel was constructed between the gate in the
mansion garden wall and the church door, completely shielding
guests from view.
	   The secrecy disappointed many fans who had waited outside.
Brittany Stallwood, 7, had waited for hours without seeing a single
Spice Girl.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' she said. ``I didn't see any of them, but
I have still enjoyed the day.''
	   Mel B met her new husband when they danced together earlier this
year, and he proposed after seven weeks. She is three months
pregnant with their child.
	   Wedding speculation had intensified when it was revealed last
month that Mel was following ``Posh Spice'' into motherhood. She
and her fiance have said they will marry next year, after the birth
of their child.

Posters of war criminals avoid election penalty

<TEXT>
	   VITEZ, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ On the main road through this
Bosnian Croat stronghold, campaign posters are plastered with
pictures of indicted war crimes suspects.
	   Top international officials traveling through Vitez during
Bosnia's two-day election this weekend could see them. NATO-led
foreign troops patrolling the town can't miss them.
	   But no one could order them removed, because they were attached
to legitimate campaign posters. The 1995 Dayton peace treaty that
halted Bosnia's war bans indicted war crimes suspects from any role
in public life, including the election Saturday and Sunday for
national leaders.
	   ``These stupid symbolic gestures are offensive and antithetical
to the democratic process,'' said Robert Gelbard, U.S. President
Clinton's representative in the Balkans, on Sunday.
	   He warned that the United States and Western powers in charge of
Bosnia would refuse to deal with groups that openly violated the
Dayton peace plan.
	   War crimes suspects such as former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic symbolize the ethnic-based policies that caused fighting
to erupt in the former Yugoslav republic in 1992.
	   Posters bearing their photos serve as a warning to refugees
against returning to their pre-war homes in territory now belonging
to rival ethnic groups.
	   Karadzic, who is accused of genocide and gross violations of
human rights, remains free and is believed to be hiding in the
Bosnian Serb republic to avoid arrest.
	   Election organizers earlier banned two candidates of the party
Karadzic once led _ the Serb Democratic Party _ for displaying
posters of him at campaign rallies.
	   Further posters of Karadzic have appeared in the Bosnian Serb
republic, but they were plastered to other posters by unknown
people, thereby avoiding penalties for the Serb Democratic Party,
election officials said.
	   That also applied to photos of Bosnian Croat war crimes suspects
Dario Kordic and Tihomir Blaskic attached to posters of Croat
hard-line presidential candidate Ante Jelavic in Vitez, a Bosnian
Croat stronghold 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Sarajevo.
	   Kordic and Blaskic, who are from the Vitez area, are on trial
before the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Netherlands.

Mexican government doubts feasibility of residents voting abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A government report published Sunday cast
doubt on the feasibility of compiling voting rolls in time to allow
Mexicans living abroad to vote in the country's 2000 presidential
elections.
	   New laws approved this year give Mexicans living abroad _ mainly
in the United States _ the right to vote, but logistical problems
could delay registering those expatriates for years.
	   The main problem is that inaccurate birth records needed to
issue personal IDs make it difficult to construct accurate voting
lists, the newspaper Excelsior quoted the secretariat report as
saying.
	   About 10 percent of Mexican's birth certificates are inaccurate
and 5 percent of the population entirely lacks such records, the
report states.
	   Compiling the lists and registering voters abroad would cost as
much as dlrs 1 billion, the report stated.
	   A survey by Mexican consulates estimates that 7.3 million
Mexicans currently live in the United States. The majority, 4.9
million, are considered legal residents, while 2.4 million are
undocumented immigrants.
	   Electoral officials have pledged to forge ahead with studies of
the voting issue, and are expected to issue their own feasibility
report soon
	   Expatriates could constitute a significant voter block in the
2000 presidential elections, accounting for as much as 15 percent
of the electorate, experts say.

Explosion threatens power cuts for three days in Brazil

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A bomb exploded Sunday, destroying an
electricity pylon and threatening to cause power cuts across
southern Brazil for the next three days, officials said.
	   Police were investigating the blast near Ivaipora, 215 miles
(350 kms) southwest of here, said Vera Prado, spokeswoman for
electricity suppliers Furnas. A second bomb was found by another
pylon.
	   ``This appears to be an act of sabotage but we don't know by
who,'' said Prado. Furnas appealed to Brazilians to save
electricity at peak times until the pylon was replaced.

Sosa joins Maris with No. 61
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Before this chase is over, Sammy Sosa still might
take the home run record from Mark McGwire.
	   Sosa became only the third player ever to hit 61 homers, moving
past Babe Ruth, tying Roger Maris and pulling within one of McGwire
when he connected Sunday off Milwaukee's Bronswell Patrick.
	   Sosa, who hit his 60th Saturday, sent an 0-1 pitch 480 feet
(146.30 meters) into the street behind the left-field fence at
Wrigley Field in the fifth inning.
	   Fans raced after the ball as it went down the street. Sosa,
meanwhile, rounded the bases pumping his fists as a sellout crowd
at Wrigley began stamping its feet and shouting ``Sam-mee,
Sam-mee.''
	   Once he reached home plate, Sosa got a 15-second embrace from
teammate Mark Grace. Sosa went into the corner of the dugout
hugging his teammates along the way and then turned to TV cameras
and made his trademark salute _ thumping his heart, blowing kisses
and making a ``V'' sign. He then lipped the words: ``I love you,
mama,'' to a TV camera.
	   The game was being broadcast live back to the Dominican
Republic, Sosa's homeland.
	   Sosa finally emerged from the dugout for a curtain call, tipping
his helmet toward his faithful following in right field and waving
to all sides of the ball park.
	   The ball was retrieved by John Witt of Dixon, Illinois, who
stuffed it in his pocket and promised to negotiate with Sosa after
the game. Witt was sitting in a van off Kenmore Avenue outside the
stadium, watching the game on a small TV when he saw Sosa swing.
The ball bounced a couple of times and landed at his feet.
	   ``I didn't think I had a chance,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable feeling. ... How do you know how much it's worth?''
	   After a five-game drought, Sosa has homered in three straight
games, sending the last two out of Wrigley Field. It was his ninth
this season against Milwaukee pitching, his most against any team.
	   In his next at-bat in the seventh against reliever David
Weathers, Sosa struck out swinging on a 3-2 pitch but still got a
standing ovation from the crowd of 40,846, the largest at Wrigley
this season.

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl, Schroeder quotes; edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
allies won Bavarian state elections Sunday, according to exit
polls, energizing Kohl's flagging campaign for an unprecedented
fifth term in national voting just two weeks away.
	   A jovial Kohl said the results were ``of great importance'' and
bode well for his re-election bid. ``I think it's not just
possible, but rather probable that we'll be ahead of the (Social
Democrats) on election night,'' he said.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, who leads in the polls,
sought to play down his party's weak showing. ``Helmut Kohl wasn't
up for election here,'' he said. ``That'll be different in 14
days.''
	   The vote in tradition-minded Bavaria _ an Alpine state where
leather hiking garb and beer gardens form a folksy counterpoint to
high-tech industry _ was less a test of the long-ruling Christian
Social Union than a gauge of voter mood before the Sept. 27
parliamentary poll.
	   No one expected the CSU to lose in a state they have ruled since
1962. Pundits regardless saw the vote as a measure of Kohl's
future, because the Bavaria-only party is partnered with Kohl's
Christian Democrats in the federal government.
	   The CSU won about 53 percent of the vote _ about the same as
1994. The Social Democrats won 29 percent _ down one point and a
disappointment for Schroeder who, unlike Kohl, campaigned heavily
in Bavaria with local party leaders.
	   State Gov. Edmund Stoiber called the Social Democrat result ``a
huge slap'' for the party's ambitions at the national level. ``I am
certain that Bavaria is sending a signal for an upswing for the
entire CDU/CSU.''
	   The Social Democrats quickly disputed the election's link with
the federal vote, saying the CSU won on Stoiber's immense
popularity _ and not because of Kohl.
	   Stoiber did not even mention the chancellor during his stump
speeches, apparently fearful of being tainted by Kohl's lethargic
campaign.
	   ``The CSU kept its role in the federal government in Bonn under
wraps, it kept the chancellor under wraps,'' said Bavarian SPD
official Franz Maget. ``The conditions are difficult for us in
Bavaria.
	   Pre-election polls showed that about 6 percent of people
planning to vote for Stoiber's party in Bavaria were not going to
vote for Kohl's in the national election. Many voters apparently
feel Kohl is out of fresh ideas after 16 years in office. And
Schroeder _ at 54, 14 years Kohl's junior _ has campaigned as the
voice of change.
	   Armin Vogel, a civil servant who turned out to vote wearing
lederhosen and a woolen sweater, said Stoiber is far more popular
in Bavaria than Kohl, and that Kohl may lose the national vote.
	   His daughter, 27-year-old Alexandra Vogel, agreed.
	   ``I think it'll be close. I hope Kohl can make it,'' she said.
But ``many people can't stand the sight of him anymore. I think the
SPD will get a lot of votes just because of Kohl. People think he's
been there too long.''
	   Despite the focus on this election, Bavaria an unlikely
bellwether of how voters feel across the country.
	   One of the richest of Germany's 16 states, Bavaria is deeply
Catholic and highly independent, with a tiny separatist movement
serving as an indicator of the state's renegade spirit. The
movement was not part of the state vote.
	   Even the SPD candidate, Renata Schmidt, was hard-pressed to
convince voters that they would be better off with a change in
government.
	   Her campaign even tried to put a negative spin on the state's
unemployment rate _ at 6.5 percent the lowest in the nation _
saying it was being reduced less quickly than the rest of the
country. The national unemployment rate is 10.6 percent.
	   In other election results, the liberal Greens party won 5.3
percent. The far-right Republican party won 3.9 percent, under the
5 percent minimum required for gaining seats in parliament.
	   An estimated 8.8 million Bavarians were eligible to vote. State
officials put voter turnout at about 70 percent, despite rain
across most of the Alpine state and snow in the mountains.

Irish leader visits China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern flew to
Beijing on Sunday for the first official visit to China by a Dublin
premier.
	   During the five-day trip, Ahern will see Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, and spend a day in Hong Kong, before
returning to Dublin at the end of the week.
	   A central aim of Ahern's trip will be to improve the balance of
trade between the two countries. Ireland imports almost 10 times

Death toll likely to rise in Chiapas flooding

	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Helicopters fanned out across southern
Chiapas state Sunday as part of what the government has called an
unprecedented rescue-and-aid mission to help flood victims.
	   In Pijijiapan, the town worst-hit by last week's flooding,
police with sniffer dogs patrolled river banks, and 1,000 soldiers
and volunteers were mobilized to try and find survivors.
	   ``We are saving the living. The dead, with all respect, are
dead,'' said civil defense chief Romeo Leon Vidal.
	   Residents buried a 10-year-old girl. Four people, including a
woman paralyzed by injuries, were flown out of Pijijiapan by
medical rescue teams from as far away as Mexico City and Monterrey.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo placed the official death toll in the
flooding at 78 and called it one of the worst natural disasters in
recent Mexican history.
	   Along the state's northern coast, 400,000 people whose villages
were cut off by the floods now face hunger and the threat of
disease due to a lack of potable water.
	   A fleet of 65 helicopters distributed bottled water and donated
food to dozens of towns isolated by downed bridges and washed-out
roads after Chiapas was hit by a week of constant rain.
	   Zedillo said Saturday the rescue operation ``has no precedent in
our history.'' Some aid had to be channeled through neighboring
Guatemala.
	   Government officials had originally estimated the death toll at
more than 100, and Zedillo said he expected the number to rise
above the official count of 78.
	   Meanwhile, volunteers and police recovered more bodies Sunday
and granted them quick burial.
	   Based on the scale of the disaster _ which struck a 100-mile
(160-kiolometer) stretch of coast, making it inaccessible to
everything but helicopters _ the daily newspaper, La Jornada,
estimated that 115 people had been killed and 157 were missing.
	   Zedillo said only the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which killed
10,000 people, was worse. The flooding has created such an enormous
logistics problem that thousands of people are in danger of
starvation.
	   In Tres Picos, on a northern stretch of the coast, residents
prayed over Herman Lara's sheet-wrapped body under the frail light
of the town's only power generator. The town of 10,000 has been
without power since the worst of the flooding hit Tuesday. There is
little water, food or medicine there.
	   Further south on the coast in the settlement of El Arenal, six
policemen wearing bandanas around their faces to ward off the smell
found a young woman's body Saturday wrapped around some tree roots
near a river.
	   They tried to carry the unidentified body to the local cemetery,
but the stench overcame them and they dropped the corpse. She was
finally buried in an unmarked grave, wrapped in a sheet of plastic.
	   More drowning deaths were avoided Saturday when government
helicopters plucked 459 people from rooftops and river islands
across the flooded areas.
	   In the coastal community of Altamira, residents had skin
infections that reached from their feet to their thighs, huge
blisters and blood-red eyes affected by conjunctivitis.
	   Health workers who fanned out across the state say they have not
yet detected any more serious diseases.
	   Adding to the desperation, residents of Tapachula claimed that
storekeepers had boosted prices for food by 100 percent, and that
many products were in short supply.

	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The tourists arrive in Peggy's
Cove by the busload, cameras in hand, to climb on the oceanside
rocks and snap pictures of what locals claim is the most
photographed lighthouse in all of Canada.
	   But there's a pall these days: the death of the 229 people
aboard Swissair Flight 111.
	   Eleven days after the plane crashed into the Atlantic 5 miles (8
kilometers) off the coast, the postcard-pretty fishing village is
starting to return to normal _ sort of.
	   Alongside the tourists are victims' relatives who came here to
mourn. Dozens of police and military personnel still search for
remains and investigate the cause of the crash.
	   Most of the tourists had planned to come here months before the
Geneva-bound McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 plunged into the sea on Sept.
2.
	   Some visitors, like Carol Ambrozy, 59, of Athol, Massachusetts,
had considered skipping this part of their Nova Scotia tour after
the disaster.
	   ``Your first instinct is to avoid it, and that's not right,''
she said, fighting tears. ``There's a need for people to
acknowledge what happened and to pay their respects.''
	   In the days after the crash, the tiny town _ accessible only by
a road off a coastal highway _ was closed off. No tourists allowed.
The locals had to prove residency to get to their seaside cottages.
	   On Tuesday, the town was reopened, and more and more people have
been arriving.
	   Business is usually booming this time of year, said Diane
Waters, the hostess at the Sou'Wester, a local restaurant-cum-gift
shop with a water view from nearly every table. But on Saturday,
only five tour buses stopped in _ less than half of what's typical
for September.
	   ``Slowly, it's getting back to normal,'' she said Sunday as she
rang up customers' breakfast bills. ``It's going to take a while,
but we'll get back.''
	   The signs of the crash are still everywhere. At the base of the
lighthouse is a memorial to the victims _ teddy bears, Bibles,
flowers and notes reading ``God be with you.'' Off the rocks, out
at sea, U.S. and Canadian navy and coast guard vessels were clearly
visible despite the overcast day.
	   From those ships, divers were searching for human remains, and a
salvage vessel was preparing to hoist pieces of wreckage from
180-foot (55 meter) depths.
	   Meanwhile, a Swissair spokesman confirmed reports Sunday that
the plane was carrying a locked box containing possibly millions of
dollars in currency and gold. The airline, which frequently
transports money in and out of Geneva, would not give a dollar
figure or say to whom it belonged or where it was going.
	   Back at Peggy's Cove, as tourists milled about, police escorted
about a dozen adults and children, all relatives of the victims, to
the lighthouse rocks. Locals called it an odd and somber paradox.

World Commission on Dams delays India hearing over controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The World Commission on Dams
postponed its first hearing scheduled for India after officials of
Gujarat state threatened to arrest its members, a commission
official said Sunday.
	   South Africa's Minister of Water Affairs, Kader Asmal, heads the
independent international commission that was set up earlier this
year by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union to
establish guidelines to halt poorly conceived dam projects and
support high quality ventures.
	   With headquarters in Cape Town, the commission was to hold its
first hearing Sept. 21-22 in Bhopal, India.
	   But the Indian state of Gujarat, site of a controversial dam
project involved in a suit before India's Supreme Court, objected
to the airing of dam issues in India, even in another state, WCD
spokeswoman Saneeya Hussain told the Associated Press on Sunday.
	   She said Asmal postponed the hearings to protect the integrity
of the commission after India's national planning commission
informed him of the controversy.
	   The planning commission supported the hearings, Hussain said.
	   WCD's 12 commissioners, who include interntional engineering
company representatives who support dam building and
environmentalists who oppose many dams, were to visit the Gujarat
dam but planned to avoid the case in its hearings, she said.
	   ``We were coming to listen and to learn, with no preconceived
conclusions,'' Asmal said in a statement. ``The Commission wanted
to invoke the democratic traditions of India where public debate
has been upheld as a fundamental principle of a free society.''
	   Between 1950 and the 1980s, some 35,000 large dams have been
built around the world, and more are planned.
	   While developing countries focus on the benefits of their dams,
environmental groups and some development specialists say big dams
destroy communities and wreak havoc on the environment.

Rafter wins first set in U.S. Open men's final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be topped after second set &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter won the opening set 6-3 over
hard-serving Mark Philippoussis as he began defense of his U.S.
Open men's singles title Sunday.
	   Rafter set the tone in the second game. Taking the net at every
chance, he kept pressure on his fellow Australian.
	   After fighting off a break point, Rafter held to begin the
match. Philippoussis couldn't do the same, though not for lack of
trying. He fought off double break point at 15-40, and another
break point when Rafter had an advantage.
	   But the pressure got to Philippoussis the next time Rafter
reached ad point and double-faulted, his second of the game and the
match.
	   The next time he served, Philippoussis finally held, although he
had to fight through four deuces to do it.
	   Meanwhile, Rafter sailed through his service games, facing only
one break point and committing only two unforced errors in the
36-minute set.

German cameraman killed in South Africa elephant attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A German television cameraman
was killed in an elephant attack on the Phinda nature reserve in
northern KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday, Phinda management said.
	   Christian Hohmann, 36, of Kerpen, Germany, was filming elephants
for the German television company, Vox, when the attack occurred,
Phinda chief executive officer Dave Varty said.
	   Hohmann and an associate were under armed escort with a ranger
and tracker viewing elephants about 100 meters (100 yards) away
when a female elephant headed toward the group.
	   Hohmann fled from the group as the animal approached and it
singled him out for attack, Varty said.
	   The ranger shot and killed the elephant after the attack.
	   Police were conducting a full investigation, Varty said.

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Reggie Barlow scored on an 85-yard
punt return and Tavian Banks had a 65-yard kickoff return to set up
another score as the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Kansas City
Chiefs 21-16 Sunday.
	   James Stewart gained 103 yards on 26 carries to become the first
back to record consecutive 100-yard rushing games for the Jaguars
(2-0).
	   The game was built up as a potential preview of the AFC
Championship game, but both teams came in with many injuries, most
notably on the Jaguars' defensive line and with the Chiefs (1-1)
missing Elvis Grbac and Andre Rison.
 &UR; Ravens 24, Jets 10 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Rod Woodson had two
interceptions, returning the second 60 yards for the clinching
touchdown, and Jermaine Lewis went 69 yards on a punt runback to
lead the Baltimore Ravens over the New York Jets.
	   Lewis, who had a 97-yard punt return against the Jets (0-2) in
the preseason, headed down the middle, then quickly cut to the
sideline and sped to the end zone. It was the third score on a punt
runback in Lewis' two-plus pro seasons.
	   Woodson, who joined Baltimore (1-1) as a free agent this season
and was a cornerback on the NFL's all-time team, stepped in front
of Jerald Sowell to pick off Glenn Foley's pass and race to the end
zone with 8:44 remaining.
 &UR; Dolphins 13, Bills 7 &QC; 
	   In Miami, the Dolphins sacked Rob Johnson eight times, limited
Buffalo to 187 yards and won a defensive struggle.
	   Trace Armstrong, Jason Taylor and rookie Lorenzo Bromell had two
sacks apiece to lead the charge for Miami. Their sack total was one
shy of the team record set in 1973.
	   Dan Marino threw for the Dolphins' only touchdown, a 17-yarder
to Lamar Thomas, and Olindo Mare kicked field goals of 33 and 27
yards. Miami improved to 2-0, while Buffalo fell to 0-2.
 &UR; Saints 19, Panthers 14 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Danny Wuerffel, given a chance to start when
Billy Joe Hobert was knocked out for the season last week, shook
off constant pressure and led New Orleans to its first 2-0 start
since 1993.
	   Doug Brien kicked two long field goals to get the Saints close,
and they scored the winning touchdown with 9:15 left on a 15-yard
run by Ray Zellars.
	   Wuerffel, sacked seven times by the Panthers last season in his
NFL debut, found the going almost as rough Sunday. But the pressure
did not rattle the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner as he completed 13 of
18 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 40
yards as he dodged Carolina (0-2) defenders.
 &UR; Steelers 17, Bears 12 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Jerome Bettis bounced back from his worst game
with the Steelers, running for 131 yards and a touchdown to lead
the Steelers (2-0) over the Chicago Bears.
	   The Bears (0-2), 24-23 losers to Jacksonville last week when
they couldn't score from the 1-yard line with four minutes left,
again had a chance to win in the fourth quarter.
	   But Carnell Lake intercepted Erik Kramer's pass on third-and-10
from the Steelers' 16 with 44 seconds left to halt what could have
been a game-winning drive.
 &UR; Bengals 34, Lions 28 (OT) &QC; 
	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Corey Sawyer intercepted Scott Mitchell's
pass to Johnnie Morton on the fourth play of overtime and returned
it 53 yards for a touchdown.
	   The win was a great relief for the Bengals (1-1) who wanted
desperately to get off to a good start. Since 1991, the Bengals
have gone 9-48 in the first half of the season. Last season, they
won their opener but lost their next seven.
	   Barry Sanders, who rushed for 185 yards and three touchdowns for
the Lions (0-2), tied the game at 28 on a 5-yard scamper with 1:52
left in the fourth quarter.
 &UR; Vikings 38, Rams 31 &QC; 
	   In St.Louis, Randall Cunningham, subbing for injured Brad
Johnson, threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter with 2:09
left to lift Minnesota over St. Louis.
	   The Rams (0-2) almost tied it on the final play when quarterback
Tony Banks dived for the end zone following an 8-yard scramble, but
he was stopped less than a yard away.
	   Robert Smith rushed for a career-best 179 yards and two
first-half scores, including a 74-yard dash for the Vikings (2-0),
who led 24-10 at the half and then traded points the rest of the
way.
 &UR; Falcons 17, Eagles 12 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, rebounding from a dismal first half, Atlanta scored
on its first two possessions of the third quarter and improved to
2-0 for the first time since 1986.
	   Chris Chandler threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Brian
Kozlowski, and Jamal Anderson added a 1-yard scoring run for the
Falcons.
	   The Eagles, who opened with a 38-0 home loss to Seattle, are 0-2
for the first time in eight years.
 &UR; Chargers 13, Oilers 7 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Ryan Leaf set up San Diego's only
touchdown with a 20-yard scramble, and John Carney kicked two field
goals as the Chargers spoiled Tennessee's first regular-season game
in their new hometown.
	   Not even a sellout crowd of 41,089 at Vanderbilt Stadium could
lift the Oilers (1-1), whose final drive ended when Steve McNair
overthrew Jackie Harris on fourth-and-5 at midfield with 1:34 left.
	   The Chargers (2-0) sacked McNair three times, and he finished
21-of-35 for 187 yards and one touchdown.
 &UR; Packers 23, Buccaneers 15 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Reggie White got three sacks and led a
pass rush that harassed Trent Dilfer all day as the Green Bay
Packers won their 29th straight home game.
	   Dilfer was sacked six times, losing the ball on three of them,
as the Packers (2-0) put the Bucs (0-2) in an early hole in the NFC
Central.
	   White, who retired briefly in the offseason, increased his
record sacks total to 179 1/2 despite the hot, muggy day that sent
several players to the sidelines with cramps and dehydration.

Puerto Rican parties launch plebiscite campaigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With festive marches and TV ads,
political parties kicked off their campaigns Sunday for a December
plebiscite over Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States.
	   Hundreds of people who want Puerto Rico to become a U.S. state
waved American flags as they weaved through northern Arecibo on a
``Caravan for Equality.''
	   In eastern Caguas, supporters of the current commonwealth
arrangement countered with a ``Commonwealth Crusade'' rally, while
independence advocates took to radio talk shows to sell their
cause.
	   Statehooders are already running television advertisements
assuring Puerto Ricans that they would retain their culture and
Spanish language after joining the union. ``Statehood: your
language, your culture, your future,'' promise the ads.
	   Puerto Rico marks 100 years as a U.S. possession this year, and
the island's pro-statehood governor has been pressuring the U.S.
Congress to hold a vote to resolve the island's ambiguous
relationship with the United States. After the proposal stalled in
the Senate, Rossello called a local, nonbinding plebiscite for Dec.
13.
	   Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and receive limited federal
benefits, but they cannot vote for President, have no vote in
Congress and do not pay federal taxes.
	   The island was ceded to the United States by Spain as part of
the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War in 1898.

Herta finally gets first win, beating nemesis Zanardi
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTEREY, California (AP) _ Bryan Herta finally shed the
reputation of ``best driver never to have won a race'' by beating
nemesis Alex Zanardi in Sunday's Texaco-Havoline 300.
	   Even sweeter, he did it at Laguna Seca Raceway, the same track
where Zanardi embarrassed Herta with a last-lap pass for the win
two years ago in the track's famed Corkscrew turn.
	   The 83-lap race on the 2.24-mile (3.60-kilometer), 11-turn road
course had only one caution through the first 67 laps, but was a
sea of yellow the rest of the way. In the end, Herta had to hold
off Zanardi in a two-lap sprint to the checkered flag.
	   Zanardi, who last week wrapped up the PPG Cup championship for
the second straight year, tried every trick he knew to get past
Herta's Ford-powered Reynard, but Herta was up to the challenge,
driving across the finish line 0.343-seconds (about 3 car-lengths)
ahead of Zanardi's Reynard-Honda.
	   ``I have so many emotions going through me right now,'' said
Herta, 28, whose first victory came in his 71st career start. ``I'm
thrilled to death.
	   ``I really have to take my hat off to Alex Zanardi. Having him
in my mirrors, knowing you beat him means you beat the best. We've
had our run-ins on track ... but I've always had a lot of respect
for him. It was great having him there at the end pushing me.''
	   As for winning at Laguna Seca, where he has started four times
from the front but couldn't find victory until Sunday, ``I always
said I'd take it everywhere, but this one means a lot.
	   Herta led all but two laps, those coming during a round of
green-flag pit stops in the second half of the race.
	   ``Unfortunately, we started in fifth place,'' said Zanardi, who
is expected to announce next week he will move to Formula One in
1999. ``I had a great car today. ... I was hoping for a mistake,
which didn't come. Bryan, I'm happy for you and I'm happy for my
second place.''
	   Until rookie Vincenzo Sospiri, making his first CART start, spun
and brought out a full-course caution flag on lap 68, it appeared
the race would be a fuel economy run. Herta's crew was saying he
was going to be very close, possibly short by less than a gallon of
methanol.
	   But the fuel problem disappeared for Herta and everyone else as
the field drove slowly behind the pace car most of the way to the
end.
	   After Sospiri's off-course adventure, the caution was extended
twice, the first time when Greg Moore stopped at the edge of the
track on lap 71 and again when rookie Alex Barron slid into a tire
wall on lap 72.
	   The green flag finally came out on lap 77 and Herta got a good
jump on Zanardi, but Scott Pruett hit Gil de Ferran, who in turn
slammed into Patrick Carpentier and all three slid into the sand in
turn two.
	   The yellow flag came out immediately and that caution period was
extended all the way through lap 81 as CART officials decided to
send out the track sweeper.
	   Finally, the green flag flew again for the start of lap 82, and
this time Herta's start was not quite as good.
	   Zanardi, who has a series-leading six victories this season,
stayed right on his tail to the end, but never quite caught him.
	   Rookie Tony Kanaan finished third, followed by Dario Franchitti,
who was coming off two straight victories, defending race winner
and Zanardi's teammate, Jimmy Vasser, and Al Unser Jr.
	   We knew that probably over the distance we had a little
advantage over Bryan (on fuel). But that's history,'' Zanardi said,
lamenting the caution flags.
	   The other caution flag in the race came on lap 22 when Dennis
Vitolo spun just in time to allow the leaders to make their first
pit stops under yellow.
	   Zanardi was able to pass Moore for fourth place in the pits. He
then moved past Franchitti to third on the restart on lap 25.
Zanardi chased Vasser until the final round of pits stops, which
came under green and moved Zanardi to second.

Hingis gets consolation prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis got her Grand Slam consolation
prize in doubles.
	   Less than 24 hours after her loss to Lindsay Davenport in the
U.S. Open women's singles final, Hingis beat Davenport in the
doubles final to complete a Grand Slam sweep.
	   Hingis and Wimbledon singles champion Jana Novotna defeated
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 6-3. It took 64 minutes for the
victory and the winners shared dlrs 320,000, compared with the dlrs
400,000 Hingis received as the singles runner-up.
	   ``I was kind of making history today for myself,'' Hingis said.
``It's just nice. ... At least you have a nice trip back home.''
	   Novotna, who lost to Hingis in the singles semifinals, said her
partner showed she was ``more professional'' than Davenport by
playing hard in the doubles final.
	   ``It's pretty obvious that Lindsay was tired and she was
satisfied with her singles victory,'' Novotna said. ``And Martina
was very professional to come back and play like that. It's very
hard.''
	   Hingis and Novotna combined to win the French Open and Wimbledon
before coming to New York. Hingis paired with Mirjana Lucic to win
the Australian Open as a wild-card entrant last January.
	   Although known more for her singles success, Hingis has won more
doubles titles than singles _ 21-19. She has won nine titles this
year with four different partners. In 1997, she won six with five
different partners.
	   Davenport and Zvereva, meanwhile, completed a negative Slam,
losing in all four doubles finals this year.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; HINGIS CONTINUES MARCH: &LR;  Although she doesn't turn 18 until
Sept. 30, Martina Hingis is already into double figures in Grand
Slams. She has won four singles and six doubles titles since
winning the 1996 Wimbledon doubles with Helena Sukova.
	   Hingis has been in the finals of either singles or doubles of
all the Grand Slams the last two years _ winning singles and
doubles at the 1997 and 1998 Australian Opens.
	   She still has a long way to go in overall Grand Slam victories,
though. Margaret Smith Court of Australia won 62 titles _ 24
singles, 19 doubles and 19 mixed doubles crowns. Martina
Navratilova is in second place with 56 Grand Slam tournament
victories.
	   --- &QC; 
	    &UR; LINDSAY CLOSING IN: &LR;  Lindsay Davenport is closing in on the No.
1 ranking in women's tennis. In the new WTA rankings this week,
Davenport will trail Martina Hingis by 146 points _ the closest
Davenport has gotten to the top spot this year.
	   Hingis started the year 2,356 points ahead.
	   If Davenport overtakes Hingis, she will be the first
American-born woman to hold the No. 1 ranking since Chris Evert
last held the top spot Nov. 24, 1985.
	   Davenport will have a chance to overtake Hingis at the beginning
of October in Filderstadt, Germany, a tournament that Hingis won
last year. champion
	   Jelena Dokic of Australia won the girls title, topped Katarina
Srebotnik of Slovenia 6-4, 6-2. The top-seeded Srebotnik had won
the Wimbledon girls crown.
	   On the other end of the age scale, Vijay Amitraj and Jose
Higueras defeated American Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson and Dick
Stockton in the men's legends doubles 6-4, 6-4, while Betsy
Nagelsen and Wendy Turnbull beat Gigi Fernandez and Betty Stove in
the women's legends final 7-6 (7-5), 6-3.
	   Last year, Fernandez was still playing in the main tournament,
losing in the doubles final.

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
allies won Bavarian state elections Sunday, according to exit
polls, energizing Kohl's flagging campaign for an unprecedented
fifth term in national voting just two weeks away.
	   A jovial Kohl said the results were ``of great importance'' and
bode well for his re-election bid. ``I think it's not just
possible, but rather probable that we'll be ahead of the (Social
Democrats) on election night,'' he said.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, who leads in the polls,
sought to play down his party's weak showing. ``Helmut Kohl wasn't
up for election here,'' he said. ``That'll be different in 14
days.''
	   The vote in tradition-minded Bavaria _ an Alpine state where
leather hiking garb and beer gardens form a folksy counterpoint to
high-tech industry _ was less a test of the long-ruling Christian
Social Union than a gauge of voter mood before the Sept. 27
parliamentary poll.
	   No one expected the CSU to lose in a state they have ruled since
1962. Pundits regardless saw the vote as a measure of Kohl's
future, because the Bavaria-only party is partnered with Kohl's
Christian Democrats in the federal government.
	   The CSU won about 53 percent of the vote _ about the same as
1994. The Social Democrats won 29 percent _ down one point and a
disappointment for Schroeder who, unlike Kohl, campaigned heavily
in Bavaria with local party leaders.
	   State Gov. Edmund Stoiber called the Social Democrat result ``a
huge slap'' for the party's ambitions at the national level. ``I am
certain that Bavaria is sending a signal for an upswing for the
entire CDU/CSU.''
	   The Social Democrats quickly disputed the election's link with
the federal vote, saying the CSU won on Stoiber's immense
popularity _ and not because of Kohl.
	   Stoiber did not even mention the chancellor during his stump
speeches, apparently fearful of being tainted by Kohl's lethargic
campaign.
	   ``The CSU kept its role in the federal government in Bonn under
wraps, it kept the chancellor under wraps,'' said Bavarian SPD
official Franz Maget. ``The conditions are difficult for us in
Bavaria.
	   Pre-election polls showed that about 6 percent of people
planning to vote for Stoiber's party in Bavaria were not going to
vote for Kohl's in the national election. Many voters apparently
feel Kohl is out of fresh ideas after 16 years in office. And
Schroeder _ at 54, 14 years Kohl's junior _ has campaigned as the
voice of change.
	   Armin Vogel, a civil servant who turned out to vote wearing
lederhosen and a woolen sweater, said Stoiber is far more popular
in Bavaria than Kohl, and that Kohl may lose the national vote.
	   His daughter, 27-year-old Alexandra Vogel, agreed.
	   ``I think it'll be close. I hope Kohl can make it,'' she said.
But ``many people can't stand the sight of him anymore. I think the
SPD will get a lot of votes just because of Kohl. People think he's
been there too long.''
	   Despite the focus on this election, Bavaria an unlikely
bellwether of how voters feel across the country.
	   One of the richest of Germany's 16 states, Bavaria is deeply
Catholic and highly independent, with a tiny separatist movement
serving as an indicator of the state's renegade spirit. The
movement was not part of the state vote.
	   Even the SPD candidate, Renate Schmidt, was hard-pressed to
convince voters that they would be better off with a change in
government.
	   Her campaign even tried to put a negative spin on the state's
unemployment rate _ at 6.5 percent the lowest in the nation _
saying it was being reduced less quickly than the rest of the
country. The national unemployment rate is 10.6 percent.
	   In other election results, the liberal Greens party won 5.3
percent. The far-right Republican party won 3.9 percent, under the
5 percent minimum required for gaining seats in parliament.
	   An estimated 8.8 million Bavarians were eligible to vote. State
officials put voter turnout at about 70 percent, despite rain
across most of the Alpine state and snow in the mountains.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A third straight day of West Bank
clashes Sunday left five Palestinian youths injured from rubber
bullets or tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants, deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to retaliate against
Israel for its killing Thursday of two top fugitives, members of
the group's military wing who were wanted for alleged involvement
in attacks against Israel and planning others.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge attacks against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Friday and Saturday in several
West Bank cities. Those clashes left a total of 21 Palestinians
injured.
	   On Sunday, at Tekoa village on the outskirts of Bethlehem,
students threw stones at passing by army jeeps, and soldiers
responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring five of the
students.
	   Later in the day, about 100 protesters marched in Bethlehem's
Deheishe refugee camp, burning Israeli and American flags, but no
injuries were reported.
	   Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
peace accords, which set a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the occasion
to point to the continuing threat of terror against Israel.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   In efforts to avert a possible Hamas attack, Israeli security
forces canceled leaves for police and soldiers and troops fanned
out to cities throughout the country to protect shopping areas and
bus stops _ targets of previous suicide bomb attacks.
	   Despite the tensions, American envoy Dennis Ross continued in
his efforts to get Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to agree on a U.S. proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the
peace talks.
	   Under the initiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
work hard to contain anti-Israeli militants.
	   Earlier Sunday, Ross met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
near the port city of Alexandria, Egypt, to update him on his
latest talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   ``I would say at this point that there are still many issues
that have to be worked through on all the parts of our
initiative,'' Ross said at a joint news conference with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa at the Bourg el-Arab air base near
Alexandria.
	   Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, has been
a mediator in Middle East peace negotiations.
	   Ross left later for Jerusalem, where he had more talks set later
Sunday with Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. He was speaking to them together _ a break
from his practice so far of shuttling back and forth in separate
meetings between the two sides.
	   However, the talks, being held at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ned Walker, were centering on secondary issues including
the opening of a Palestinian airport and a so-called safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Although the talks continued for several hours Sunday night, no
reports of any headway were made. Ross was scheduled to meet with
Netanyahu again Monday.
	   Neither side has reported any real progress in Ross' meetings,
which began Wednesday, and Netanyahu told his Cabinet that the
Palestinians were wavering on previously agreed to conditions.
	   ``There was progress in the talks with the Palestinians and we
had almost reached certain understandings but the Palestinians
backed down on these understandings,'' the prime minister said,
according to a Cabinet statement.
	   Netanyahu said in talks with Ross, he had demanded the
Palestinians suppress militant groups like Hamas as a condition for
advancing the peace process.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, have accused Israel as using
security matters as a pretext for delaying West Bank pullbacks it
had already promised to make.

Pakistan level Sahara Cup cricket series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY COZIER

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO, Canada (AP) _ Pakistan put their lackluster performance
in the Sahara Cup opener behind them and beat India by 51 runs in
the second match to level the five-match cricket series 1-1 on
Sunday.
	   Beaten by six wickets in the first match, the Pakistanis turned
things round, scoring 246 for nine off their 50 overs and
restricting India to 195 all out off 46.3 overs.
	   Again batting first after Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin won
the toss, Pakistan was given a strong start by hard-hitting opener
Shahid Afridi, who scored 56 off 49 balls with two sixes and four
fours.
	   He received good support from captain Aamir Sohail, who hit 25
in a second wicket partnership of 55, and Inzamam-ul-Haq whose 35
contributed to a third wicket stand of 37.
	   When the innings threatened to fall part with the loss of three
wickets in the space of 13 runs, wicket-keeper Moin Khan skilfully
ensured that Pakistan would reach a challenging total.
	   He finished unbeaten 69, hitting two of his eight boundaries off
the last two balls of the innings. It was a career-best batting
performance that later earned him the Man of the Match award from
former Pakistan captain, Ramiz Raja.
	   Off-spinner Hrishikesh Kanitkar, with two for 22, fast bowler
Javagal Srinath, with two for 54 from 10 overs, and Ajay Agarkar,
two for 59, were India's best bowlers.
	   Missing key batsman Saurav Ganguly _ who strained a left
hamstring muscle in the opening match, India was always under
pressure against accurate Pakistani bowling. Pakistan's sure-handed
fielding featured eight catches, six in the deep as batsmen tried
in vain to lift the run rate.
	   Wicket-keeper Nayan Mongia, opening the batting in place of
Ganguly, topscored with 41 but no one else passed 30.
	   Captain Mohammad Azharuddin made 25, and Navjot Singh Sidhu and
Hrishikesh Kanitkar made 24 each.
	   Veteran Salim Malik, in his 270th one-day international, was
statistically Pakistan's best bowler with four for 36 from his
gentle medium-pacers.
	   But the most effective bowling was done earlier by pacers Azhar
Mahmood, with two from 38 from 10 overs, and Abdur Razzaq, who had
three for 48 from 10 overs.
	   The third match is at the same venue, the Toronto Cricket,
Skating and Curling Club, on Wednesday.

Rafter wins third set in U.S. Open final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with third set; WILL be TOPPED after fourth set. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter moved one set away from his
second straight U.S. Open men's singles crown Sunday when he won
the third set 6-2 against a discouraged-looking Mark Philippoussis.
	   Playing in his first Grand Slam final, Philippoussis had won the
second set 6-3 after Rafter captured the first by the same score in
the best-of-5 match at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Rafter nearly stumbled again in the fifth game of the third set
when he blew a 40-0 lead. After Philippoussis pulled to deuce,
Rafter slammed his racket to the ground in disgust. Philippoussis
lined up a forehand down the line, but buried the ball in the net.
When Philippoussis netted a backhand service return on the next
point, Rafter had held.
	   The missed opportunity may have been on Philippoussis' mind in
the next game when he dropped serve for only the second time in the
match.
	   It was a long game _ 10 points _ as games on this day went _ but
it included one of the best points of the match.
	   Out of position, Rafter hit a backhand lob, a shot that worked
for him the entire day. Philippoussis backpedaled and hit a smash.
	   Rafter, though, was able to get it back, and Philippoussis
responded with a forehand crosscourt. Again Rafter got there. With
both at the net, they traded forehand volleys before Philippoussis
netted the ball.
	   That gave Rafter the ad, and he closed out the break when
Philippoussis netted a half-volley.
	   Philippoussis seemed discouraged, losing his next service game
at 15 as Rafter closed out the third set.
	   Finally holding his serve with ease, Philippoussis took
advantage of several rare errors by Rafter. After Rafter won the
first point in the fourth game of the second set, he buried a
backhand volley into the net.
	   A forehand volley error gave Philippoussis a 15-30 lead, and he
moved to break point when he ripped a forehand service return down
the line that just ticked the top of the net.
	   ``Sorry, mate,'' Rafter said as he grabbed his service toss to
start the point, which he eventually won. But Philippoussis closed
out the break when he smashed a backhand serve down the line that
Rafter netted.
	   Rafter held easily after that, but the damage was already done.
	   Rafter set the early tone in the second game of the match.
Taking the net at every chance, he kept pressure on his fellow
Australian.
	   After fighting off a break point, Rafter held to begin the
match. Philippoussis couldn't do the same, though not for lack of
trying. He fought off double break point at 15-40, and another
break point when Rafter had an advantage.
	   But the pressure got to Philippoussis the next time Rafter
reached ad point and double-faulted, his second of the game and the
match.
	   The next time he served, Philippoussis finally held, although he
had to fight through four deuces to do it.
	   Meanwhile, Rafter sailed through his service games, facing only
one break point and committing only two unforced errors in the
36-minute set.

Mission accomplished for Davenport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Novotna quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport had been in tennis' waiting
room a long time.
	   Touted as one of America's finest young players after winning
the U.S. Open junior championship in 1992, she was unable to push
past the promise of her potential.
	   Except for a couple of doubles championships, Davenport carried
the label of a Grand Slam also-ran. Then came a dream summer that
ended with a 6-3, 7-5 victory over defending champion Martina
Hingis for the U.S. Open crown, the title she's always craved.
	   ``The sight at the end of the tunnel of winning the Grand Slam
was what kept me going,'' she said.
	   The joy of that accomplishment was hardly diminished Sunday when
Davenport and Natasha Zvereva lost the women's doubles title to
Hingis and Jana Novotna 6-3, 6-3.
	   For Hingis, it completed a doubles Grand Slam. She won with
Mirjana Lucic at Australia, then with Novotna at the French,
Wimbledon and U.S., becoming only the fourth woman in history to
complete the sweep.
	   Novotna took a shot at Davenport after teaming with Hingis for
the doubles crown.
	   ``Martina losing to Lindsay, it's never easy to come back and
play doubles,'' she said. ``She was the more professional. It's
pretty obvious that Lindsay was tired and she was satisfied with
her singles victory. And Martina was very professional to come back
and play like that. It's very hard.''

Rival bid reported for Manchester United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American investment bankers Solomon Smith Barney
has been asked by a mystery client to speak with Manchester
United's financial advisers _ HSBC Holdings _ about the possibility
to a rival bid to take over the English soccer club.
	   Last week Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television made a bid of 623
million pounds (dlrs 1.050 billion) to buy the team. The bid has
the support of the Manchester United board.
	   A spokesman for the bank Sunday declined to name the client and
would not confirm it was ready to top BSkyB's offer.
	   Manchester United's board would be legally bound to consider any
offer of greater value than that from BSkyB.
	   Since last week's bid to take over Manchester United _ England's
best known soccer club _ intense speculation has surrounded the
future of several other top English teams, prompting millions of
pounds (dollars) to be added to their values on the stock exchange.
	   BSkyB said Sunday it was confident that its offer would be
successful.
	   ``We have received undertakings from the directors of Manchester
United who control 17 percent of the shares to sell them to
BSkyB,'' a spokesman said.
	   ``In addition, BSkyB bought nine percent of the shares of United
on Friday.''

Bavarian state vote to indicate Kohl's chances Sept. 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first official results &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
allies won Bavarian state elections Sunday, energizing Kohl's
flagging campaign for an unprecedented fifth term in national
voting just two weeks away.
	   A jovial Kohl said the results were ``of great importance'' and
bode well for his re-election bid. ``I think it's not just
possible, but rather probable that we'll be ahead of the (Social
Democrats) on election night,'' he said.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, who leads in the polls,
sought to play down his party's weak showing. ``Helmut Kohl wasn't
up for election here,'' he said. ``That'll be different in 14
days.''
	   The vote in tradition-minded Bavaria _ an Alpine state where
leather hiking garb and beer gardens form a folksy counterpoint to
high-tech industry _ was less a test of the long-ruling Christian
Social Union than a gauge of voter mood before the Sept. 27
parliamentary poll.
	   No one expected the CSU to lose in a state they have ruled since
1962. Pundits regardless saw the vote as a measure of Kohl's
future, because the Bavaria-only party is partnered with Kohl's
Christian Democrats in the federal government.
	   The CSU won about 53 percent of the vote _ about the same as
1994, according to early official results. The Social Democrats won
29 percent _ down one point and a disappointment for Schroeder who,
unlike Kohl, campaigned heavily in Bavaria with local party
leaders.
	   State Gov. Edmund Stoiber called the Social Democrat result ``a
huge slap'' for the party's ambitions at the national level. ``I am
certain that Bavaria is sending a signal for an upswing for the
entire CDU/CSU.''
	   The Social Democrats quickly disputed the election's link with
the federal vote, saying the CSU won on Stoiber's immense
popularity _ and not because of Kohl.
	   Stoiber did not even mention the chancellor during his stump
speeches, apparently fearful of being tainted by Kohl's lethargic
campaign.
	   ``The CSU kept its role in the federal government in Bonn under
wraps, it kept the chancellor under wraps,'' said Bavarian SPD
official Franz Maget. ``The conditions are difficult for us in
Bavaria.
	   Pre-election polls showed that about 6 percent of people
planning to vote for Stoiber's party in Bavaria were not going to
vote for Kohl's in the national election. Many voters apparently
feel Kohl is out of fresh ideas after 16 years in office. And
Schroeder _ at 54, 14 years Kohl's junior _ has campaigned as the
voice of change.
	   Armin Vogel, a civil servant who turned out to vote wearing
lederhosen and a woolen sweater, said Stoiber is far more popular
in Bavaria than Kohl, and that Kohl may lose the national vote.
	   His daughter, 27-year-old Alexandra Vogel, agreed.
	   ``I think it'll be close. I hope Kohl can make it,'' she said.
But ``many people can't stand the sight of him anymore. I think the
SPD will get a lot of votes just because of Kohl. People think he's
been there too long.''
	   Despite the focus on this election, Bavaria an unlikely
bellwether of how voters feel across the country.
	   One of the richest of Germany's 16 states, Bavaria is deeply
Catholic and highly independent, with a tiny separatist movement
serving as an indicator of the state's renegade spirit. The
movement was not part of the state vote.
	   Even the SPD candidate, Renate Schmidt, was hard-pressed to
convince voters that they would be better off with a change in
government.
	   Her campaign even tried to put a negative spin on the state's
unemployment rate _ at 6.5 percent the lowest in the nation _
saying it was being reduced less quickly than the rest of the
country. The national unemployment rate is 10.6 percent.
	   In other election results, the liberal Greens party won 5.7
percent. The far-right Republican party won 3.6 percent, under the
5 percent minimum required for gaining seats in parliament.
	   An estimated 8.8 million Bavarians were eligible to vote. State
officials put voter turnout at about 70 percent, despite rain
across most of the Alpine state and snow in the mountains.

Netanyahu's cabinet approves 1999 budget, increases defense
</HEADLINE>
spending &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After days of wrangling, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu persuaded his cabinet to approve a budget cuts
program that reduces spending overall but raises defense outlays
for the first time in ten years.
	   Fourteen ministers voted in favor of the proposal, two were
against and one did not vote.
	   The review of the proposed cut began last week, and as many as
11 of 17 ministers were reported to have opposed the program at the
time.
	   Netanyahu and Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman met with budget
opponents over the past week and managed to piece together a
larger-than-expected majority for the plan
	   Neeman and Netanyahu said at a news conference after the vote
that the majority was attained by redistributing budget cuts among
the various ministries, and that overall spending won't be higher
than planned.
	   However, the defense budget will be increased in the coming
year. Netanyahu has been insistent on raising it in 1999 for the
first time in 10 years, citing new threats to Israel's security,
including Iran's Shahab-3 missile.
	   On Sunday, he said defense spending wouldn't rise as much as he
would like, but that the government had agreed on a 10-year plan
meant to increase defense spending incrementally.
	   The 1999 defense budget is 33.3 billion shekels (dlrs 8.6
billion dlrs), an increase of 670 million shekels (dlrs 174
million) over the 1998 budget.

Rafter defeats Philippoussis for U.S. Open title

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was Aussie Rules tennis at the U.S. Open on
Sunday, and Patrick Rafter had by far the bigger, meaner game.
	   Rafter retained his title with an awesome display of speed and
accuracy, winning an all-Australian battle with Mark Philippoussis
in which both players dived to the concrete courts and sent volleys
rocketing across the net.
	   But Rafter had near perfection to go with his power.
	   The third-seeded Rafter had just five unforced errors in his
6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0 win over the unseeded Philippoussis, whose
usually overpowering serve became a liability. He had just five
aces and 13 double faults.
	   Rafter won the final 10 games of the match.
	   Rafter, who had to rally from a two-set deficit in the first
round but never was threatened again in the tournament, won dlrs
700,000 and moved up to No. 2 in the world rankings _ just behind
Pete Sampras, whom he defeated Saturday in the semifinals.
	   The match was tied at one set apiece and 2-2 in the third set
when Rafter took command. After holding serve, Rafter moved to
break point on an incredible point when he raced around the court
to return an overhead, a forehand into the corner and a drop shot.
He broke Philippoussis' serve on the next point.
	   Rafter then won the next eight games to close out the match on
Philippoussis' 13th double fault.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Not so fast, Mark. Slammin' Sammy may win the
race to the home run record after all.
	   Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire for baseball's home run record,
connecting twice Sunday against the Milwaukee Brewers to raise his
total to 62.
	   Sosa homered off Bronswell Patrick in the fifth inning, sending
an 0-1 pitch 480 feet (146.30 meters) into the street behind the
left-field fence at Wrigley Field. Sosa hit another 480-foot
(146.30-meter) homer in the ninth, a solo shot off Eric Plunk.
	   Crying as he sat in the dugout after his triumphant tour around
the bases, Sosa came out for three emotional curtain calls as fans
littered the field while standing and chanting ``Sam-mee!
Sam-mee!'' The delay lasted six minutes.
	   Sosa was carried off the field at the end of the game, an 11-10
win by Chicago that kept the Cubs one game ahead of the New York
Mets in the NL wild-card race. Sosa was on deck when Mark Grace hit
a game-winning homer in the 10th.
	   Sosa, who has four homers in his last three games, was in St.
Louis on Tuesday when McGwire hit his 62nd homer to break the
record Roger Maris set in 1961. McGwire was to play in Houston on
Sunday night.
	   The homers dropped Babe Ruth into fourth place on the
single-season list. Ruth hit 60 homers in 1927, a mark that stood
for 34 years.
	   Both of Sosa's homers cleared the back fence at Wrigley Field,
prompting scrambles for the baseballs. Sosa picked on his favorite
pitching staff. He has 10 homers this year off Milwaukee, his most
against any team.
	   After the first homer, fans raced after the ball as it went down
the street. Sosa, meanwhile, rounded the bases pumping his fists as
a sellout crowd at Wrigley began stamping its feet.
	   By the time Sosa struck out in the seventh, the street was
filled with fans. When he hit in the ninth with the Cubs trailing
10-8, they were chanting ``62! 62!''
	   The ball for No. 61 was retrieved by John Witt of Dixon,
Illinois, who stuffed it in his pocket and promised to negotiate
with Sosa after the game. Witt was sitting in a van off Kenmore
Avenue outside the stadium, watching the game on a small TV when he
saw Sosa swing. The ball bounced a couple of times and landed at
his feet.
	   ``I didn't think I had a chance,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable feeling. ... How do you know how much it's worth?''

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A third straight day of West Bank
clashes Sunday left five Palestinian youths injured from rubber
bullets or tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers.
	   Meanwhile, Israel braced for threatened revenge attacks by
Islamic militants by deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops,
shopping centers and other possible targets.
	   The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed to retaliate against
Israel for its killing Thursday of two top fugitives, members of
the group's military wing who were wanted for alleged involvement
in attacks against Israel.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians called for revenge attacks against
Israel in pro-Hamas demonstrations Friday and Saturday in several
West Bank cities. Those clashes left a total of 21 Palestinians
injured.
	   On Sunday, at Tekoa village on the outskirts of Bethlehem,
students threw stones at passing by army jeeps, and soldiers
responded with tear gas and rubber bullets, injuring five of the
students.
	   Later in the day, about 100 protesters marched in Bethlehem's
Deheishe refugee camp, burning Israeli and American flags, but no
injuries were reported.
	   Sunday marked the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Oslo
peace accords, which set a framework for eventual Palestinian
autonomy, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used the occasion
to point to the continuing threat of terror against Israel.
	   ``The Oslo agreement was supposed to bring peace. This means
that there wouldn't be terror attacks here from the territory
handed over to the Palestinians,'' Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.
	   Despite the tensions, American envoy Dennis Ross continued in
his efforts to get Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to agree on a U.S. proposal to end the 18-month stalemate in the
peace talks.
	   Under the initiative, Israel would withdraw troops from 13
percent of the West Bank in tandem with Palestinian agreement to
work hard to contain anti-Israeli militants.
	   Earlier Sunday, Ross met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
near the port city of Alexandria, Egypt, to update him on his
latest talks with Arafat and Netanyahu.
	   ``I would say at this point that there are still many issues
that have to be worked through on all the parts of our
initiative,'' Ross said at a conference near Alexandria.
	   Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, has been
a mediator in Middle East peace negotiations.
	   Ross left later for Jerusalem, where he had scheduled more talks
with Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. He was speaking to them together _ a break
from his practice of shuttling between separate meetings with the
two sides.
	   However, the talks, being held at the residence of U.S.
Ambassador Ned Walker, were centering on secondary issues including
the opening of a Palestinian airport and a so-called safe passage
between the West Bank and Gaza.
	   Neither side has reported any real progress in Ross' meetings,
which began Wednesday, and Netanyahu told his Cabinet that the
Palestinians were wavering on previously agreed to conditions.
	   ``There was progress in the talks with the Palestinians and we
had almost reached certain understandings but the Palestinians
backed down on these understandings,'' the prime minister said,
according to a Cabinet statement. Ross was scheduled to meet with
Netanyahu again Monday.
	   Netanyahu said in talks with Ross, he had demanded the
Palestinians suppress militant groups like Hamas as a condition for
advancing the peace process.
	   The Palestinians, for their part, have accused Israel as using
security matters as a pretext for delaying West Bank pullbacks it
had already promised to make.

Rival bid reported for Manchester United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American investment bankers Solomon Smith Barney
has been asked by a mystery client to speak with Manchester
United's financial advisers _ HSBC Holdings _ about the possibility
to a rival bid to take over the English soccer club.
	   Last week Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB television made a bid of 623
million pounds (dlrs 1.050 billion) to buy the team. The bid has
the support of the Manchester United board.
	   A spokesman for the bank Sunday declined to name the client and
would not confirm it was ready to top BSkyB's offer.
	   Manchester United's board would be legally bound to consider any
offer of greater value than that from BSkyB.
	   Since last week's bid to take over Manchester United _ England's
best known soccer club _ intense speculation has surrounded the
future of several other top English teams, prompting millions of
pounds (dollars) to be added to their values on the stock exchange.
	   BSkyB said Sunday it was confident that its offer would be
successful.
	   ``We have received undertakings from the directors of Manchester
United who control 17 percent of the shares to sell them to
BSkyB,'' a spokesman said.
	   ``In addition, BSkyB bought nine percent of the shares of United
on Friday.''

Rafter wins second straight U.S. Open singles title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with end of match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Patrick Rafter won his second straight U.S. Open
title Sunday, defeating fellow Australian Mark Philippoussis 6-3,
3-6, 6-2, 6-0.
	   The final point came on Philippoussis's 13th double-fault of the
match. The 6-foot-4 (1.93-meter) right-hander, known for his huge
serve, only had five aces in the two-hour, four-minute battle in
Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Almost matching point for point through the first 2 1/2 sets,
Rafter began his winning run in the fifth game of the third set
when he nearly stumbled by blowing a 40-0 lead.
	   After Philippoussis pulled to deuce, Rafter slammed his racket
to the ground in disgust. Philippoussis lined up a forehand down
the line, but buried the ball in the net. When Philippoussis netted
a backhand service return on the next point, Rafter had held.
	   The missed opportunity may have been on Philippoussis' mind in
the next game when he dropped serve for only the second time in the
match.
	   It was a long game _ 10 points _ as games on this day went _ but
it included one of the best points of the match.
	   Out of position, Rafter hit a backhand lob, a shot that worked
for him the entire day. Philippoussis backpedaled and hit a smash.
	   Rafter, though, was able to get it back, and Philippoussis
responded with a forehand crosscourt. Again Rafter got there. With
both at the net, they traded forehand volleys before Philippoussis
netted the ball.
	   That gave Rafter the ad, and he closed out the break when
Philippoussis netted a half-volley.
	   A discouraged Philippoussis didn't win another game.
	   Playing in his first Grand Slam final, Philippoussis won the
second set 6-3 after Rafter captured the first by the same score in
the best-of-5-sets match at Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Finally holding his serve with ease, Philippoussis took
advantage of several rare errors by Rafter. After Rafter won the
first point in the fourth game of the second set, he buried a
backhand volley into the net.
	   A forehand volley error gave Philippoussis a 15-30 lead, and he
moved to break point when he ripped a forehand service return down
the line that just ticked the top of the net.
	   ``Sorry, mate,'' Rafter said as he grabbed his service toss to
start the point, which he eventually won. But Philippoussis closed
out the break when he smashed a backhand serve down the line that
Rafter netted.
	   Rafter held easily after that, but the damage was already done.
	   Rafter set the early tone in the second game of the match.
Taking the net at every chance, he kept pressure on his fellow
Australian.
	   After fighting off a break point, Rafter held to begin the
match. Philippoussis couldn't do the same, though not for lack of
trying. He fought off double break point at 15-40, and another
break point when Rafter had an advantage.
	   But the pressure got to Philippoussis the next time Rafter
reached ad point and double-faulted, his second of the game and the
match.
	   The next time he served, Philippoussis finally held, although he
had to fight through four deuces to do it.
	   Meanwhile, Rafter sailed through his service games, facing only
one break point and committing only two unforced errors in the
36-minute set.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Three Swedish anti-nuclear protesters have been
arrested trying to break into the shipyard where Britain's fourth
and final Trident nuclear submarine is under construction.
	   The three Swedish nationals were held by security guards at the
VSEL yard in Barrow-in-Furness, northwest England, a spokesman for
the yard said.
	   ``They did not gain access to the submarine or its immediate
vicinity,'' the spokesman, speaking on terms of anonymity, said.
	   Cumbrian police said that two women, aged 29 and 38, and a
33-year-old man were being interviewed about the incident. The
three have not been named.

	   Rafter, looking like a Samurai warrior with a pony tail and a
mangy beard that he grew during the tournament, has a game
tailor-made for the hard, fast courts and hard, fast balls of the
U.S. Open.
	   Philippoussis stayed in the match by saving 13 of 14 break
points until midway through the third set, but Rafter converted
five of his six break points after that.
	   Rafter faced just three break points in the match and lost his
serve only once. His serve was broken only seven times in the seven
rounds of the tournament.
	   It was intense tennis from the start. Late in the first set,
Rafter tumbled to the court for a shot. When a ballboy brought over
a towel, Rafter dried off the court _ not himself. Philippoussis
made a similar dive later in the match.
	   Though the two players are not close and didn't speak to each
other most of the summer because of a feud that began when
Philippoussis declined to play on the Australian Davis Cup team,
there was a gentlemanly air to the match.
	   When Rafter made bad service tosses and caught the ball instead
of hitting it, he yelled, ``Sorry, mate,'' across the net.

	   Rafter's victory gave the Open its second consecutive repeat
champion. Sampras won in 1995-96.
	   As Australian flags flapped in the stands, Rafter captured his
sixth title of the year and improved his record to 25-2 since
Wimbledon.
	   Rafter appeared to be in trouble just before taking command of
the match. In the fifth game of the third set, he was up 40-0 but
lost three straight points _ slamming his racket to the court after
netting a volley to fall to deuce.
	   He came right back to hold his serve, though, beginning his run
of 10 straight games. Included in that run was a streak of 12
unanswered points in the fourth set.
	   Philippoussis was trying to join Andre Agassi as the only
unseeded men's champion in U.S. Open history. Agassi pulled off the
feat in 1994.
	   He swept to the final with power, blowing opponents off the
court with 130-mph (209 kph) serves. His shots even sound different
than those of other players _ they have a full-throated ``THWACK''
that approaches a roar.
	   But Philippoussis' power was no match for the speed of Rafter,
who has won all three of their career matches. The second set was
the first Rafter ever lost in their rivalry.
	   ``I felt I was moving very well on his serve and made him play
tough volleys,'' Rafter said. ``He wasn't getting as many free
points as he's used to.''

Rafter wins U.S. Open

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was Aussie Rules tennis at the U.S. Open on
Sunday and Patrick Rafter had by far the bigger, meaner game.
	   Rafter retained his title with an awesome display of speed and
accuracy, winning an all-Australian battle with Mark Philippoussis
6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0.
	   Both players dived to the concrete courts and sent volleys
rocketing across the net. But Rafter had near perfection to go with
his power.
	   The third-seeded Rafter had just five unforced errors against
the unseeded Philippoussis, whose usually overpowering serve became
a liability. He had just five aces and 13 double faults, the last
on the final point of the match.
	   Rafter won the final 10 games.
	   Rafter, who had to rally from a two-set deficit in the first
round but never was threatened again in the tournament, won dlrs
700,000 and moved up to No. 2 in the world rankings _ just behind
Pete Sampras, whom he defeated Saturday in the semifinals.
	   The match was tied at one set apiece and 2-2 in the third set
when Rafter took command. After holding serve, Rafter moved to
break point on an incredible point when he raced around the court
to return an overhead, a forehand into the corner and a drop shot.
He broke Philippoussis' serve on the next point.
	   Rafter then won the next eight games to close out the match.
	   Rafter, looking like a Samurai warrior with a pony tail and a
beard that he grew during the tournament, has a game tailor-made
for the hard, fast courts and hard, fast balls of the U.S. Open.
	   Philippoussis, in his first Grand Slam final, stayed in the
match by saving 13 of 14 break points until midway through the
third set, but Rafter converted five of his six break points after
that.
	   Rafter faced just three break points in the match and lost his
serve only once. His serve was broken only seven times in the seven
rounds of the tournament.
	   It was intense tennis from the start. Late in the first set,
Rafter tumbled to the court for a shot. When a ballboy brought over
a towel, Rafter dried off the court _ not himself. Philippoussis
made a similar dive later in the match.
	   Though the two players are not close and didn't speak to each
other most of the summer because of a feud that began when
Philippoussis declined to play on the Australian Davis Cup team,
there was a gentlemanly air to the match.
	   When Rafter made bad service tosses and caught the ball instead
of hitting it, he yelled, ``Sorry, mate,'' across the net.
	   Rafter's victory gave the Open its second consecutive repeat
champion. Sampras won in 1995-96.
	   As Australian flags waved in the stands, Rafter captured his
sixth title of the year and improved his record to 25-2 since
Wimbledon.
	   Rafter appeared to be in trouble just before taking command of
the match. In the fifth game of the third set, he was up 40-0 but
lost three straight points _ slamming his racket to the court after
netting a volley to fall to deuce.
	   He came right back to hold his serve, though, beginning his run
of 10 straight games. Included in that run was a streak of 12
unanswered points in the fourth set.
	   Philippoussis was trying to join Andre Agassi as the only
unseeded men's champion in U.S. Open history. Agassi pulled off the
feat in 1994.
	   He swept to the final with power, blowing opponents off the
court with 130-mph (210-kph) serves. His shots even sound different
than those of other players _ they have a full-throated ``THWACK''
that approaches a roar.
	   But Philippoussis' power was no match for the speed of Rafter,
who has won all three of their career matches. The second set was
the first Rafter ever lost in their rivalry.
	   ``I felt I was moving very well on his serve and made him play
tough volleys,'' Rafter said. ``He wasn't getting as many free
points as he's used to.''

Andrade wins Canadian Open in playoff over Friend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKVILLE, Ontario (AP) _ In a duel of bizarre bounces and heroic
putts, Billy Andrade won the Bell Canadian Open on Sunday by
purposely playing into the bunker and saving par to beat Bob Friend
on the first playoff hole.
	   The victory _ which felt more like survival _ ended a seven-year
drought for Andrade. He has won three times on the PGA Tour and has
trailed going into the final round in all three.
	   ``When you don't win for awhile, you don't know if you're ever
going to win again,'' said Andrade, who finished at 13-under 275
and won dlrs 396,000. ``But I had a funny feeling about this
week.''
	   He could have never dreamed how it would finish.
	   Andrade had a one-stroke lead over Friend going to the 508-yard
(465-meters) closing hole at Glen Abbey Golf Club, the same hole
where Andrade hit into the water in the third round for a double
bogey that cost him the lead.
	   Friend, needing at least a birdie for a chance of a playoff,
left his 3-wood short, but it somehow bounced over the bulkhead and
skipped through the green into a back bunker.
	   Andrade, from 237 yards (217 meters), also decided to go for the
green but went in the water for the second straight day. He hit his
fourth shot to 30 feet (9 meters), then holed the putt for par,
leaning over to watch it track to the cup and leaping into the air
when it fell.
	   Friend, who earlier holed out a bunker shot for birdie on No. 9
and chipped from the front of the green to the back on the 17th to
save par and stay in the game, blasted out of the bunker to 6 feet
(1.8 meters) and rolled in the birdie to force the playoff.
	   ``I don't think I ever shook as much as I did over that putt,''
said Friend, who earned dlrs 237,000 for the biggest paycheck of
his career.
	   They returned to the 18th hole for the playoff and took the same
route _ a drive to the fairway, and an approach shot that wound up
in the amphitheater surrounding the 18th. Friend, playing first,
trying to slip a 60-degree sand wedge to get over the bunker, but
it came out hot and rolled through the green into the water.
	   ``Whoa, whoa, whoa,'' Friend said, putting his hand up.
	   Andrade bumped his chip into the bunker, then blasted out to 5
feet (1 1-2 meters) and made the par-saving putt.
	   ``If I had to hit first, I might have tried to drop it on the
green,'' he said. ``But I knew what I had to do, so I chipped it in
the bunker.''
	   Andrade was so shook up by the whirlwind finish that he nearly
forgot to replace his ball mark before making the winning putt.
	   ``That last hole probably aged me 10 years,'' he said.
	   Andrade, two strokes down to start the final round under sunny,
mostly still conditions, closed with a 3-under 69. Friend shot a 71
and had few regrets.
	   ``This was my first time under the gun,'' said the 34-year-old
son of ex-Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Bob Friend. ``I'm not
disappointed in the way I played.''
	   Mike Hulbert had a 68 to finish third and made it interesting
with three straight birdies to finish one stroke out of the
playoff.
	   Friend showed signs of playing in the final pairing on Sunday
for the first time, missing two of the first three greens and
constantly backing off putts. But he never trailed until Andrade
made a 10-footer (3 meters) for birdie on the 17th, and it was a
minor miracle the lead was not any bigger.
	   Friend left his approach to the horseshoe-shaped green on the
front side, some 70 feet (21 meters) from the hole and separated by
rough. He chipped from one end to the other, stopping it 4 feet (1
meter) away and making the par.
	   Earlier, he holed a 50-foot (15 meters) bunker shot on No. 9 to
take a one-stroke lead into the turn. And when his ball hopped out
of the hazard and safely into the back bunker on the regulation
18th, Friend was starting to wonder if this was his day.
	   ``I had no idea how it got out of there,'' he said.
	   But he no such luck in the end. He took his penalty drop out of
the water on the playoff hole, blew his chip 6 feet (1.8 meters) by
and made it for bogey.
	   Andrade ended further suspense with his par, raising his playoff
record to 2-1.
	   ``The whole day, I kept saying I was going to win this
tournament,'' Andrade said. ``I'm thinking about winning the
tournament and kissing that trophy.''
	   One problem. It wasn't the same trophy he saw advertised on the
promotional material. But he'll take it.

New Zealand businessman dies

 &UR; EDS: Adds attribution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Sir Francis Renouf, one of New
Zealand's best-known business personalities and philanthropists,
died Sunday at the age of 80.
	   His death was made public in a death notice published in The
Dominion newspaper. No public comment was made by his family, which
is customary in New Zealand.
	   Renouf was credited with introducing an array of innovations to
the New Zealand commerce during the 1950s, including share
underwriting and the establishment of a national share index in
1957.
	   He received a knighthood in 1987 and was inducted into the
Business Hall of Fame last year.
	   In 1981 he established Frank Renouf and Co., Renouf Corporation
and Renouf Properties and was once listed among New Zealand's 50
richest people with an estimated net worth of at least US dlrs 45
million.
	   However, he lost much of his fortune in the 1987 share market
crash, which also saw Renouf Corporation come close to collapse. He
had earlier resigned as chairman of the company.
	   After a divorce from his first wife, two high-profile marriages
_ to Susan Peacock-Sangster and Countess Michele Griaznoff _ and
acrimonious divorces kept his name in the news during the 1980s and
early 1990s.
	   Three years after his highly publicized split from
Peacock-Sangster, Renouf married Countess Michele in 1991. However
the couple separated after three months.

Ottawa to apply budget bounty to debt, no new spending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dollar amounts are in Canadian dollars
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAINT JOHN, New Brunswick (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean Chretien
sent a signal to international markets and Canadians on Sunday,
promising that tight controls will be kept on spending while debt
reduction will be the priority for any budgetary surplus.
	   Chretien said in a speech to the annual meeting of the Canadian
Chamber of Commerce that the surplus in federal coffers this year
will be applied directly to the debt, and he expects it will be
more than the $3 billion already provided for in a contingency
plan.
	   ``I can say today that whatever the surplus may be this year, we
are not planning any new large expenditures beyond what has already
been budgeted for this year,'' Chretien said.
	   ``And that will enable us to pay down more on the debt this year
than was provided for in the debt reduction plan.''
	   The surplus is expected to be somewhere between $5 billion and
$10 billion by the end of the fiscal year, a difficult amount to
accurately calculate given the vagaries of the world economy and
the turmoil for the Canadian loonie.
	   The surplus is to be applied against Canada's market debt, that
is the money the government has borrowed over the years in domestic
and foreign markets. That debt stands at $456 billion.

 &UR; Jet's salvage could begin today
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ A U.S. navy salvage ship could begin lifting
pieces of Swissair Flight 111 from the ocean floor off Nova Scotia
today.
	   USS Grapple, a vessel capable of winching 300-tonne pieces to
the surface, was moored over the crash site Sunday, preparing for
the lift, which could help investigators determine why the jet
crashed off Peggy's Cove.
	   The 76-metre ship's primary targets are five sections of
fuselage sitting in about 60 metres of water 10 kilometres from
shore.
	   Grapple will anchor to four large concrete blocks placed on the
sea floor for the lift, which will begin as soon as bodies are
recovered from each section and Canadian authorities give their
approval.
	   The Boeing MD-11 widebody plowed into the sea off Peggy's Cove
on Sept. 2, killing all 229 passengers and crew on board.
	   Grapple, which recovered pieces of TWA Flight 800 off Long
Island in 1996, arrived in St. Margaret's Bay late last week and
has been mapping and videotaping the Swissair wreckage to determine
the best way of salvaging it.

 &UR; Economists warn against bank mergers
	   TORONTO (AP) _ In yet another in a flurry of reports on the
proposed mergers of four of Canada's largest banks into two
megabanks, two prominent economists warn of severe job losses if
the deals are approved.
	   Doug Peters, a former federal cabinet minister, and economist
Arthur Donner said that, if permitted, the mergers would result in
a loss of 20,000 to 40,000 jobs, the closing of at least 1,000 bank
branches and increased service costs to consumers.
	   In their report released Saturday at an economics conference at
Laurentian University in Sudbury, the two argue that federal
Finance Minister Paul Martin should not allow the mergers of the
Royal Bank with the Bank of Montreal and the Toronto Dominion Bank
with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
	   Their's is the latest in a series of studies on the proposed
mergers. A report released last week by the Bank of Nova Scotia,
the only one of the big five banks not overtaken by merger fever,
also warned of job losses.
	   The banks have not denied there would be job reductions, but
have said they can be absorbed through attrition. Royal Bank
chairman John Cleghorn has said if his bank merges, there will be
an eventual increase in jobs.

 &UR; Clark goes after anti-free trader in Tory debate
	   BURNABY, British Columbia (AP) _ Former prime minister Joe Clark
attacked fellow leadership candidate David Orchard as a ``tourist''
in the Tory party during an all-candidates' debate Sunday.
	   Orchard, a Saskatchewan farmer and longtime opponent of free
trade, urged Conservatives to re-embrace the legacy of Tory prime
ministers Sir John A. Macdonald and John Diefenbaker, who warned
that free trade would threaten Canada's sovereignty.
	   Clark, a senior minister in Brian Mulroney's government when the
Tories signed free-trade deals with the United States and Mexico,
challenged Orchard on the facts he cited to argue Canada is selling
off its resources at fire-sale prices.
	   He finally lost patience when Orchard criticized a recent
agreement by provincial premiers to form a common front on issues
such as health spending as an attempt to wrest powers from Ottawa.
	   ``David, are you for anything?'' Clark asked sarcastically.
	   ---
 &UR; FAA to announce wiring inspections
	   HALIFAX (AP) _ The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration will
soon expand inspections of wiring in aging aircraft, says an
industry newsletter.
	   The inspections will likely be limited to planes 20 years and
older, says today's edition of Air Safety Week, a technical
publication out of Arlington, Va.
	   ``One aspect of the industry effort will involve sampling the
condition of wiring on 10 to 20 high-time aircraft by the end of
May 1999 to provide initial insights into the overall condition of
the fleet,'' said the newsletter.
	   ``This effort will detail the incidence of chafing, nicks and
cuts.''
	   Electrical problems are believed to have contributed to the
Sept. 2 crash of Swissair Flight 111, whose pilot reported cockpit
smoke before his systems failed and the plane crashed southwest of
Halifax, killing all 229 aboard.
	   Aircraft like the seven-year-old Boeing MD-11 would not have
been subject to the FAA order _ a fault, critics say, with FAA
standards that fail to take into account the accelerated aging
process of some wiring insulation.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House of Representatives is increasingly
likely to vote for a formal impeachment inquiry in the next few
weeks, congressional officials said Sunday, a step that could raise
the already heavy pressure facing President Bill Clinton. Officials
in both political parties, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that if it takes such a step, the House would not necessarily limit
its inquiry to Kenneth Starr's review of Clinton's sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and his attempts to deny it under
oath. Instead, these officials said, the House Judiciary Committee
might be empowered to range over numerous other issues, from the
Whitewater real estate dealings in Arkansas to Clinton's
involvement in questionable campaign fund-raising in 1996.
(US-CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A third straight day of West Bank
clashes Sunday left five Palestinian youths injured from rubber
bullets or tear gas fired by Israeli soldiers. Meanwhile, Israel
braced for threatened revenge attacks by Islamic militants,
deploying troops Sunday to guard bus stops, shopping centers and
other possible targets. The Islamic militant group Hamas has vowed
to retaliate against Israel for its killing Thursday of two top
fugitives, members of the group's military wing who were wanted for
alleged involvement in attacks against Israel and planning others.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency is appealing
to Montenegro to reverse its decision to deny sanctuary to ethnic
Albanians fleeing fighting in Kosovo after the Yugoslav republic
deported 3,200 people to Albania. Sunday's action by Montenegro was
unusual because Kosovo Albanians are _ like Montenegrins _ citizens
of Yugoslavia. But Montenegro said it had no choice because it
could no longer pay for upkeep of the refugees. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro forms all that
remains of Yugoslavia following the breakup of most of the Yugoslav
federation during ethnic wars throughout this decade. The U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees sent a letter Sunday to the president of
Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an earlier promise to
provide refuge for those trying to escape fighting between Serb
forces and the Albanian rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
seeking independence. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Helicopters fanned out across southern
Chiapas state Sunday as part of what the government has called an
unprecedented rescue-and-aid mission to help flood victims. In
Pijijiapan, the town worst-hit by last week's flooding, police with
sniffer dogs patrolled river banks, and 1,000 soldiers and
volunteers were mobilized to try and find survivors. ``We are
saving the living. The dead, with all respect, are dead,'' said
civil defense chief Romeo Leon Vidal. Residents buried a
10-year-old girl. Four people, including a woman paralyzed by
injuries, were flown out of Pijijiapan by medical rescue teams from
as far away as Mexico City and Monterrey. President Ernesto Zedillo
placed the official death toll in the flooding at 78 and called it
one of the worst natural disasters in recent Mexican history.
(MEXICO-FLOODING)
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl's conservative
allies won Bavarian state elections Sunday, according to exit
polls, energizing Kohl's flagging campaign for an unprecedented
fifth term in national voting just two weeks away. A jovial Kohl
said the results were ``of great importance'' and bode well for his
re-election bid. ``I think it's not just possible, but rather
probable that we'll be ahead of the (Social Democrats) on election
night,'' he said. His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, who leads in
the polls, sought to play down his party's weak showing. ``Helmut
Kohl wasn't up for election here,'' he said. ``That'll be different
in 14 days.'' The vote in tradition-minded Bavaria _ an Alpine
state where leather hiking garb and beer gardens form a folksy
counterpoint to high-tech industry _ was less a test of the
long-ruling Christian Social Union than a gauge of voter mood
before the Sept. 27 parliamentary poll. (GERMANY-BAVARIAN ELECTION)

	   LITTLE MARLOW, England (AP) _ In a little church filled with
guests all dressed in white, Spice Girl Mel B married dancer Jimmy
Gulzar on Sunday, then celebrated with champagne next door at her
country mansion.
	   Photographers and fans mobbed both the white vintage Cadillac
carrying the 23-year-old groom to the church and a car carrying
Posh Spice Victoria Adams and driven by her fiance David Beckham.
	   Baby Spice Emma Bunton and Sporty Spice Mel C arrived separately
by car in this village 25 miles (40 kms) west of London. Former
Spice Girl Geri Halliwell was not thought to be among the guests.
	   The 23-year-old bride _ expecting a baby next year _ wore a
white dress, a blue garter given to her by Baby Spice Emma Bunton,
and antique earrings from her mother. She was given away by her
father.
	   Mel B met her new husband when they danced together earlier this
year, and he proposed after seven weeks. She is three months
pregnant with their child.

	   Wearing a see-through blouse and a Hindu facial marking, Madonna
performed her song ``Ray of Light'' at the MTV Music Video Awards
last week.
	   ``Madonna's MTV stage performance, which combined Eastern
mysticism with Western hedonism, did not sit well with sincere
Hindus, Vaishnavas and yoga practitioners around the globe,'' the
World Vaishnava Association said in a statement.
	   During her performance, Madonna wore a ``Vaishnava tilak,'' a
holy facial marking that ``undermined the principles of purity the
markings represent,'' said Tusta Krishnadas, spokesman for the
association, an umbrella group for the Vaishnava branch of
Hinduism.
	   ``By wearing this sacred marking while wearing clothing through
which her nipples were clearly visible and while gyrating in a
sexually suggestive manner with her guitar player, Madonna offended
Hindus and Vaishnavas throughout the world,'' Krishnadas said,
demanding an apology from Madonna and MTV.
	   Madonna received similar criticism from Christians several years
ago over the use of religious symbolism in her ``Like a Prayer''
video.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Before she was a big star, Jennifer Aniston was
a little too big. To lose weight she had to give up her favorite
food: mayonnaise on white bread sandwiches.
	   ``I didn't even know I was overweight until someone told me,''
the ``Friends'' co-star says in the October Redbook magazine. ``I
hate it that your self-worth is metered by how much you weigh.''
	   Giving up her most cherished foods, getting on a diet plan and
exercise helped Aniston drop 30 pounds a few years ago. Now the
5-foot-5-inch 65 (1.65 meters) tall actress is down to 112 pounds
(51 kilos), a weight she maintains without cutting out all fun
foods.
	   ``I don't have a big diet plan anymore,'' Aniston said. ``I
watch what I eat, but I don't not eat a cheeseburger, because life
is no fun living on salads and fruit.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tim Allen is back on the set of ``Home
Improvement,'' clean and sober after a tough court-ordered alcohol
rehabilitation program.
	   ``It was a boot camp,'' Allen says in Sept. 19-25 TV Guide. ``It
was horrible. But (rehab) is the best thing I have ever done.''
	   Allen was arrested last year in Michigan by police who clocked
him driving 70 mph (110kph) in his Ferrari in a 40-mph (65 kph)
zone. He pleaded guilty to drunken driving, was fined dlrs 500 and
got a year's probation. Allen checked into the California rehab
center in April as part of his sentence.
	   ``Home Improvement'' co-star Patricia Richardson has noticed a
dramatic change in Allen's personality on the set. Before, ``he
would fume quietly, and it would come out in a mean streak of
humor,'' Richardson said.
	   Now, he's ``sober in more ways than not drinking. He's more
grounded. He doesn't back off or go away and fume,'' she said.
``The fact he could make such a major life change in the middle of
all this is a miracle.''
	   In 1978, Allen was convicted on drug dealing charges and served
28 months in a federal prison. He went on to become one of the
richest entertainers in America, ranking sixth on Forbes magazine's
latest list with dlrs 77 million in 1998 earnings
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   BAKERSFIELD, California (AP) _ A gunfight erupted outside a
nightclub where basketball star Shaquille O'Neal was promoting his
new rap album. There were no injuries.
	   The 26-year-old Los Angeles Lakers center was inside Aldo's
Night Club on Friday night when gunfire broke out, police Lt.
Archie Scott said Saturday. Seven men were taken into custody.
	   ``Shaq was inside the nightclub doing whatever he does. ...
Units in the area heard multiple shots being fired from the
vicinity just west of the building,'' Scott said.
	   The men, who ranged in age from 19 to 32, were arrested for the
investigation of various charges, including participating in a
criminal street gang and assault with a firearm.
	   Two handguns were found at the scene, but the shots fired may
have come from a passing car.
	   Scott said the incident appeared to be unrelated to O'Neal's
activities.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   DANVILLE, Kentucky (AP) _ Spike Lee remembers the good old days
when he was a struggling filmmaker.
	   ``I can tell you about having my phone and electricity and gas
cut off when I couldn't pay the bills. And that experience was good
for me,'' Lee said at Center College Saturday night.
	   Lee credited his parents for encouraging him to follow his
dream.
	   ``Now I count my blessings every day because I'm making a living
doing what makes me happy,'' he said. ``Ninety-five percent of the
people in this world go to their graves never getting to do what
makes them happy.''
	   Lee's films include ``Do The Right Thing,'' ``Malcolm X'' and
``He Got Game.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said Sunday
that his office continues investigating the U.S. `Casablanca'
moneylaundering sting operation to see if U.S. agents violated
Mexican laws by operating here.
	   Madrazo asked for information from a Los Angeles court hearing
the cases of three Mexican banks and several bank employees
indicted for allegedly laundering drug money through Mexico.
	   ``We need the Los Angeles court to open up (records), because a
lot of valuable information is going to be heard there,'' Madrazo
said.
	   Mexico has pledged to request the extradition of U.S. law
enforcement officials to face charges if they are found to have
conducted investigations here without Mexico's approval. U.S.
authorities say Mexico was notified about the operation.
	   The sting, concluded in May, also resulted in the seizure of
dlrs 110 million.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rican prosecutors are
investigating the death Sunday of a woman who underwent breast
reduction surgery in the Dominican Republic _ the second plastic
surgery patient to die this month.
	   Migdalia Cordero Cabrera, 26, had a breast reduction operation
in Santo Domingo on Sept. 2, prosecutor Antonio Figueroa said.
Cordero returned to Puerto Rico on Thursday suffering from low
blood pressure and a fever, he said.
	   Cordero was hospitalized for an unspecified infection and died
in the Rio Piedras Medical Center early Sunday morning. The Puerto
Rico Forensic Science Institute was to perform an autopsy on
Monday.
	   ``She went there with no (health) problems and when she came
back, she had problems,'' Figueroa said. ``We'll have to wait for
the autopsy to know what happened.''
	   Cordero had her operation one day after the death of 26-year-old
Dhelmalyz Rios Rivera, who underwent plastic surgery on her calves
on Aug. 15. Rios Rivera died from blood poisoning and an embolism
that blocked blood vessels, investigators said. Doctors amputated
her legs in an unsuccessful attempt to save her life.
	   Rios Rivera's death ignited a debate in Puerto Rico over the
growing trade in quick, cheap plastic surgeries in the neighboring
Dominican Republic. Clinics in Santo Domingo often charge half the
rate in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The government Sunday denied reports that a
U.S. activist, expelled for alleged involvement in the rebel
conflict in Chiapas, had permission to return to Mexico.
	   Daily newspaper La Jornada reported that Thomas Hansen, a former
director of the U.S. solidarity group Pastors for Peace, had won a
court appeal after a judge ruled his expulsion illegal.
	   Hansen was expelled for attending public rebel-sponsored events
and donating video equipment to rural groups in Chiapas.
	   Dozens of foreign political activists and observers were
expelled and deported in early 1998 based on claims they had
interfered in the four-year rebel conflict in Chiapas.
	   Leftist Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in 1994
demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's military was secretly
mobilised in May to keep Colombian guerillas out of the country, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   A force of 1,500 soldiers confronted the guerillas who had
crossed the border from Colombia to seek food and refuge but there
was no conflict, said the daily O Globo.
	   Brazilian troops concentrated at five border towns in the Amazon
region, around 2,170 miles (3,500 kms) north-west of Rio, over
three weeks, said the newspaper.
	   Military sources disclosed the information. It could not be
confirmed since it was classified, the daily said. It was not clear
how many guerillas entered the Amazon or how long they stayed.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A bomb exploded Sunday, destroying an
electricity pylon and threatening to cause power cuts across
southern Brazil for the next three days, officials said.
	   Police were investigating the blast near Ivaipora, 215 miles
(350 kms) south-west of here, said Vera Prado, spokeswoman for
electricity suppliers Furnas. A second bomb was found by another
pylon.
	   ``This appears to be an act of sabotage but we don't know by
who,'' said Prado. Furnas appealed to Brazilians to save
electricity at peak times until the pylon was replaced.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Attorney General Jorge Madrazo said Sunday
that his his office wants to question Justo Ceja, the former
secretary to ex-president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, as part of
various criminal investigations.
	   Mexico is currently seeking Ceja _ who is believed to have fled
abroad _ on a warrant for illegally enriching himself while serving
in the government.
	   Ceja was barred from holding government jobs for five years in
May after investigators found he had amassed a fortune of over dlrs
7 million without reporting most of it.
	   Madrazo said Mexico will seek the extradition of Ceja if he is
found abroad, and noted that ``there are lines of investigation''
against Ceja in other matters.
	   Carlos Salinas, who left Mexico in early 1995 soon after his
term ended, has spent most of his self-imposed exile in Dublin,
Ireland, and has not been charged with any crime.

Japan's July current account surplus rises for 16th straight month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Continuing its steady rise, Japan's broadest
measure of trade jumped 53.1 percent in July from a year ago, the
government announced Monday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.351 trillion yen (dlrs 10.3 billion) in July, up 53.1
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, lower than Tokyo-based economists had forecast, marked
the 16th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.

Jones loses for first time this year after 37 wins
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KATHY CHENAULT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Marion Jones was cold, wet and
tired. But she had no excuses after losing for the first time this
year.
	   ``An athlete at this level must be able to compete under any
circumstances,'' Jones said Sunday after finishing second to
Germany's Heike Drechsler in the women's long jump on the third and
final day of the World Cup.
	   Drechsler had a winning leap of 7.07 meters, ending the
22-year-old American's undefeated streak in women's sprints, long
jump and relays at 37 victories. Jones, with a best this year of
7.31, finished second at 7.00.
	   It was the only disappointment of the meet for Jones, who led
the U.S. women's squad to the team title. She turned in the world's
third-fastest women's 200-meter time of 21.62 seconds on Friday and
had the fourth-fastest 100 at 10.65 on Saturday.
	   Jones said the only thing that marred the competition was the
weather, which turned rainy and cold with a temperature of 7
degrees Celsius (45 degrees Fahrenheit). But she quickly added that
wasn't an excuse for her long-jump loss.
	   ``It's the same for all of us. It's not as if it just got cold
just for me.''
	   The rain disappointed athletes and sponsors who had hoped for
more record-setting performances at Johannesburg's high altitude of
1,650 meters (5,410 feet) above sea level.
	   A two-time world champion, Drechsler said going against Jones
gave her added incentive.
	   ``It's not easy to jump in these conditions,'' she said. ``But
it was motivation for me jumping against her.''
	   Jones said now she is looking forward to just one thing: going
home.
	   ``My body's due for some rest,'' she said.
	   Africa repeated as men's champions with 110 points, while Europe
finished second with 109 and Germany was third with 102. The
Americas had 97, the United States 94, Britain 89, Asia 64 and
Oceania 53.
	   The U.S. women won with 96 points, with Europe second at 94 and
Africa third at 88. Russia had 87, the Americas 81, Germany 75,
Asia 45 and Oceania 42.
	   In addition to team honors, athletes won dlrs 3.5 million in
cash prizes.
	   Local favorite Frankie Fredericks of Namibia thrilled the sparse
crowd that braved the chilly weather on Sunday, racing to victory
and a new World Cup record in the men's 200. His winning time of
19.97 seconds broke the record of 20.00 by Brazil's Robson da Silva
in 1989.
	   ``When the fans come out, you have to perform,'' Fredericks
said. ``I am very pleased with the time today.''
	   American Charles Austin won a showdown with world record-holder
Javier Sotomayer of Cuba in the men's high jump, clearing 2.31
meters for the title. Sotomayer was second at 2.28.
	   In the men's 110-meter hurdles, Germany's Falk Balzer upset
world record-holder Colin Jackson of Britain in a close finish.
Balzer clocked 13.10, while Jackson was second in 13.11 and Cuban
Anier Garcia third at 13.14.
	   In other men's events, Germany's Dieter Baumann won the 3,000 in
7 minutes, 56.24 seconds and Britain's Steve Backley won the
javelin with a throw of 88.71 meters. The U.S. 1,600-meter relay
team of Mark Everett, Antonio Pettigrew, Joey Woody and Jerome
Young won with a time of 2:59.28.
	   In women's track events, Nigeria's Falilat Ogunkoya took the 400
in 49.52 and Romania's Gabriela Szabo won the 3,000 at 9:00.54. The
United States won the 400-meter relay, with Cheryl Taplin, Chryste
Gaines, Inger Miller and Carlette Guidry finishing in 42.00
seconds.
	   Germany's Franka Dietzsch claimed the women's discus title at
67.07 meters.

Sosa passes Maris, ties McGwire with his 62nd
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs, UPDATES with quotes, detail on fan who got home
run ball No. 62 &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Not so fast, Mark. Slammin' Sammy may win the
race for the home run record after all.
	   Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire on Sunday, connecting twice against
the Milwaukee Brewers to raise his total to 62.
	   ``It's unbelievable. It was something that even I can't believe
I was doing,'' Sosa said following the Cubs' 11-10, 10-inning
victory. ``It can happen to two people, Mark and I.''
	   Sosa homered off Bronswell Patrick in the fifth inning, sending
an 0-1 pitch 480 feet (145 meters) into the street behind the
left-field fence at Wrigley Field. Sosa hit another 480-foot
(145-meter) homer in the ninth, a solo shot off Eric Plunk.
	   That one dropped Babe Ruth into fourth place on the
single-season list with 60, which he hit in 1927. Roger Maris hit
61 homers in 1961 for a record that McGwire broke Tuesday against
the Cubs in St. Louis.
	   Now, amazingly, a mark that had stood for 37 years has been
passed twice in less than a week.
	   With tears and sweat running down his face as he sat in the
dugout after his second triumphant tour around the bases, Sosa came
out for three emotional curtain calls. Fans littered the field with
paper cups and other debris while chanting ``Sam-mee! Sam-mee!''
causing a delay that lasted six minutes.
	   ``I have to say what I did is for the people of Chicago, for
America, for my mother, for my wife, my kids and the people I have
around me. My team. It was an emotional moment,'' Sosa said.
	   Sosa, who has four homers in his last three games, was carried
off the field after the victory, which kept the Cubs one game ahead
of the New York Mets in the NL wild-card race. He was on deck when
Mark Grace hit the game-winning homer.
	   ``It was chilling when McGwire did it. I was dumbfounded,''
Grace said. ``I thought pretty much the home run race was going to
be McGwire's. But when my buddy gets hot, he can hit them in a
hurry. And he proved that.
	   ``I just hope Sammy gets the attention he deserves. Not only has
he hit 62 homers, but he has carried us. He is without a doubt the
MVP of the National League.''
	   McGwire's Cardinals played in Houston on Sunday night and he
declined comment before the game. He and Sosa have homered 20 times
on the same day this season, feeding off the competition to set the
most hallowed record in baseball.
	   Both of Sosa's homers cleared the back fence at Wrigley Field,
sending fans scrambling for balls worth tens of thousands of
dollars to memorabilia collectors. Sosa has 10 homers this year off
Milwaukee, his most against any team.
	   After the first homer, a parade of fans raced after the ball as
it went down the street. Sosa, meanwhile, rounded the bases pumping
his fists as the sellout crowd began stamping its feet.
	   By the time Sosa struck out in the seventh, the street was
filled with fans. When he hit in the ninth with the Cubs trailing
10-8, they were chanting ``62! 62!'' _ and Sosa didn't disappoint
them.
	   Home run ball No. 62 was caught by a man in his mid-20s whose
identity was not immediately known. Police officers surrounded him
and took him to the closest station for his own protection.
	   ``We got him out of there because we thought he was going to get
his behind kicked,'' Sgt. Mary O'Toole said.
	   The man's plans for the ball were not immediately known. The fan
and groundskeeper in St. Louis who got McGwire's home run balls
Nos. 61 and 62 gave them to the slugger, who gave them to the Hall
of Fame.
	   The ball Sosa hit for No. 61 was retrieved by John Witt of
Dixon, Illinois, who stuffed it in his pocket and promised to
negotiate with him.
	   Witt was sitting in a van off Kenmore Avenue outside the
stadium, watching the game on a small TV when he saw Sosa swing. He
got out of his van and the ball bounced a couple of times and
landed at his feet.
	   ``I didn't think I had a chance,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable feeling. ... How do you know how much it's worth?''

Australians break relay record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Michael Klim was having a
thoroughly miserable time. He lost two events in which he was world
champion and too many people were in face wanting to know why.
	   Klim looked around for inspiration and found it, three laps into
the final leg of the 2x400-meter freestyle relay Sunday to give
Australia a world record at the Commonwealth Games swim meet.
	   ``It was impossible for me to know if I was on world record pace
but on the third 50 I looked up at the crowd and they were really
going for it, so so did I,'' Klim said.
	   He brought home the Australian team in seven minutes, 11.86
seconds, .09 faster than the record set by the Unified Team at the
1992 Barcelona Olympics.
	   Australian coach Don Talbot had little doubt that Klim would
lift despite losing the 200-meter freestyle Saturday and 100-meter
butterfly Sunday.
	   ``Peer group pressure helps to get them up and he wouldn't dare
swim badly at the end, they'd choke him,'' Talbot said.
	   The team of Klim, Ian Thorpe, Daniel Kowalski and Matt Dunn was
mucking about on pool deck before the race, having a few laughs to
lighten the load ahead of their record attempt.
	   ``I know the four of us had the record on our mind for a long
time,'' Dunn said.
	   He was confident that Klim would shake off his deflated form for
the team's good.
	   ``He's one of the toughest swimmers in the world, we were
looking at the clock and we knew if anyone could have done it
Michael could,'' said Dunn.
	   Earlier Klim had angrily stalked around following his butterfly
loss to Australian rival Geoff Huegill. Klim is the world champion
and world record holder and all that happened in the past 10
months. But the Australian swimming machine is ferocious and
regularly casts out 21-year-olds for the next brilliant teenager.
	   Talbot had a veiled warning for Klim after Australia swept all
five medals on offer in the pool Sunday.
	   ``I think (his problems) is the aftermath of the accolades and
fame he gets, as soon as he had a big win like he did at the world
championships, everybody wants a piece of him and he's not able to
do his work like he should be able to do, it changes his
lifestyle,'' Talbot said.
	   Klim has been beaten by someone unburdened by the time
contraints that cashing in on fame demands and by allowing it, his
chances of greater fame decline.
	   ``He is still coming to grips with the old story of handling
success,'' said Talbot. ``I think it's a credit to him that he's
done as well as he has.''
	   Klim was not prepared to talk about his losses to the reporters
who fawned over him when he was winning. But he was happy enough to
talk about the relay.
	   ``I hadn't had the best of meets so far but this was a new one
and I put the others behind me,'' said Klim. ``I knew I was capable
of it and just wanted to go out there and prove it.''
	   The misery was lifted but Talbot's message soaked in.

Blue Jays 5, Yankees 3
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Blue Jays have been spoiling a lot of
people's fun lately, and Sunday they wrecked what David Cone hoped
would be a big day.
	   Cone, bidding for his first 20-win season in 10 years, was
stymied as Toronto rallied for a 5-3 win over the New York Yankees
and moved within three games of Boston in the AL wild-card race.
	   Toronto took three of four from the AL East champion Yankees,
and with their 14th win in 16 games, the Blue Jays are as close to
the Red Sox as they've been since May 30.
	   New York, meanwhile, continued its late-season slide. The
Yankees are 5-8 in their last 13 and 11-14 in their last 25 games.
Derek Jeter drove in two runs for New York.
	   Kelvim Escobar (6-2) allowed three runs and five hits in 5 2-3
innings, and Toronto's bullpen combined for scoreless relief the
rest of the way. Dan Plesac struck out Paul O'Neill with two
runners on in the seventh, and Robert Person, Toronto's fifth
reliever, pitched the ninth for his fourth save, retiring Shane
Spencer on a flyout to end the game with two on.
	   Shannon Stewart and Jose Cruz, Jr. homered for Toronto, which
chased Cone (19-6) with a three-run sixth.
 &UR; Tigers 4, Red Sox 1
	   In Boston, not even Steve Avery's turn in the rotation could end
the Red Sox slide, with Tony Clark's tie-breaking three-run homer
leading Detroit.
	   The loss was Boston's eighth in 10 games, with the only two wins
coming on days Avery has started. The Red Sox were 14-0 in games
that Avery had gone at least five innings.
	   With the score tied 1-1 in the eighth, Brian Hunter reached on
Nomar Garciaparra's fielding error and Juan Encarnacion singled off
Greg Swindell (5-6). Clark followed by driving the next pitch over
the left-field screen for his 32nd homer of the year.
	   During their recent slide, the Red Sox have struggled in one-run
games, going 1-5, and seen their wild-card lead over Toronto cut to
its slimmest margin since May 30.
	   Brian Moehler (13-13) got the win, ending his career-high
six-game losing skid. Todd Jones struck out the side in the ninth
for his 25th save.
 &UR; Indians 6, White Sox 3
	   In Cleveland, Richie Sexson hit a two-out, three-run homer in
the eighth inning as Cleveland avoided a sweep at the hands of
Chicago.
	   Sparked by a second day of brushback wars and a bench-clearing
brawl, the Indians scored two runs in the seventh and three in the
eighth to reduce their magic number for clinching a fourth straight
AL Central title to four.
	   Following former Indians star Albert Belle's standoff with Dave
Burba on Saturday, the Indians responded to a bench-clearing melee
with their division rivals with one of their most dramatic
victories of the season.
	   It was the Indians' 43rd comeback win and 10th in their last
at-bat at home.
	   Cleveland's Omar Vizquel and manager Mike Hargrove were ejected
in the third after Chicago starter Jim Parque threw a pitch over
Vizquel's head, resulting in a 10-minute fracas.
	   After Kenny Lofton grounded out against lefty Bryan Ward (1-2)
in the eighth, Joey Cora doubled. Bill Simas got Travis Fryman on a
groundout and intentionally walked Manny Ramirez, who was 1-for-25.
	   Sexson, the rookie replacing the injured Jim Thome, hit his
ninth homer to dead center on a 3-2 pitch.
	   Paul Shuey (5-2) gave up a hit and an intentional walk in the
eighth, but struck out Frank Thomas, Belle and Wil Cordero. Mike
Jackson pitched the ninth for his 38th save.
	   Ray Durham and Wil Cordero homered for Chicago.
 &UR; Devil Rays 10, Rangers 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Wade Boggs hit his fourth career
grand slam and Tampa Bay again played the spoiler role.
	   The expansion team took two of three games from Texas, which
remained one game behind division-leading Anaheim in the AL West
after the Angels' 12-7 loss to Baltimore.
	   Juan Gonzalez of the Rangers became the first AL player since
1949 to reach 150 RBIs in a season, hitting his 42nd homer, a
two-run shot in the third inning. That raised his total to 151
RBIs, the most since Vern Stephens and Ted Williams each drove in
159 in 1949.
	   Tampa Bay also withstood home runs by Royce Clayton and Rusty
Greer to win a home series for the first time in nearly two months.
	   Boggs hit his seventh homer of the season during a six-run
second-inning against Esteban Loaiza (3-4).
	   Rick White (2-5) got the win in relief.
 &UR; Orioles 12, Angels 7 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Rafael Palmeiro had three hits and drove in the
go-ahead run as Baltimore squandered a six-run lead before
completing a three-game sweep.
	   Despite the loss, the Angels maintained their one-game lead over
Texas in the AL West.
	   The Orioles, who have won five straight, batted around in both
the third and seventh innings. Baltimore used a six-run third and
Brady Anderson's 17th homer to build a 7-1 lead, but the Angels
battled back to tie it in the seventh.
	   Baltimore then scored four runs in the bottom of the inning.
After Jarrod Washburn (5-3) gave up a walk and a single to Harold
Baines, Palmeiro hit an RBI double. After a passed ball let in
another run, Mike Bordick hit a two-run single.
	   Baines went 4-for-4 and scored twice.
	   Anaheim, looking for its first winning September since 1991, is
4-6 this month. Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon homered for the Angels,
who suffered their fourth three-game sweep of the year.
 &UR; Athletics 9, Twins 6, 12 innings
	   In Minneapolis, Ben Grieve hit a three-run homer off Rick
Aguilera (3-8) in the 12th as Oakland finished off a three-game
sweep.
	   After Ryan Christenson struck out, Jason Giambi and Matt Stairs
singled off Aguilera and Grieve followed with his 16th homer, a
shot to right-center field.
	   Mark Holzemer (1-0) pitched one inning for his first win since
1996 with the Angels, and Billy Taylor got three outs for his 31st
save.
 &UR; Mariners-Royals canceled
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Seattle and Kansas City was canceled
because of rain. The game will not be made up since it was the
final contest scheduled between the two.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with afternoon games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Reggie Barlow scored on an 85-yard
punt return and Tavian Banks had a 65-yard kickoff return to set up
another score as the Jacksonville Jaguars beat the Kansas City
Chiefs 21-16 Sunday.
	   James Stewart gained 103 yards on 26 carries to become the first
back to record consecutive 100-yard rushing games for the Jaguars
(2-0).
	   The game was built up as a potential preview of the AFC
Championship game, but both teams came in with many injuries, most
notably on the Jaguars' defensive line and with the Chiefs (1-1)
missing Elvis Grbac and Andre Rison.
 &UR; Ravens 24, Jets 10 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Rod Woodson had two
interceptions, returning the second 60 yards for the clinching
touchdown, and Jermaine Lewis went 69 yards on a punt runback to
lead the Baltimore Ravens over the New York Jets.
	   Lewis, who had a 97-yard punt return against the Jets (0-2) in
the preseason, headed down the middle, then quickly cut to the
sideline and sped to the end zone. It was the third score on a punt
runback in Lewis' two-plus pro seasons.
	   Woodson, who joined Baltimore (1-1) as a free agent this season
and was a cornerback on the NFL's all-time team, stepped in front
of Jerald Sowell to pick off Glenn Foley's pass and race to the end
zone with 8:44 remaining.
 &UR; Dolphins 13, Bills 7 &QC; 
	   In Miami, the Dolphins sacked Rob Johnson eight times, limited
Buffalo to 187 yards and won a defensive struggle.
	   Trace Armstrong, Jason Taylor and rookie Lorenzo Bromell had two
sacks apiece to lead the charge for Miami. Their sack total was one
shy of the team record set in 1973.
	   Dan Marino threw for the Dolphins' only touchdown, a 17-yarder
to Lamar Thomas, and Olindo Mare kicked field goals of 33 and 27
yards. Miami improved to 2-0, while Buffalo fell to 0-2.
 &UR; Saints 19, Panthers 14 &QC; 
	   In New Orleans, Danny Wuerffel, given a chance to start when
Billy Joe Hobert was knocked out for the season last week, shook
off constant pressure and led New Orleans to its first 2-0 start
since 1993.
	   Doug Brien kicked two long field goals to get the Saints close,
and they scored the winning touchdown with 9:15 left on a 15-yard
run by Ray Zellars.
	   Wuerffel, sacked seven times by the Panthers last season in his
NFL debut, found the going almost as rough Sunday. But the pressure
did not rattle the 1996 Heisman Trophy winner as he completed 13 of
18 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown. He also rushed for 40
yards as he dodged Carolina (0-2) defenders.
 &UR; Steelers 17, Bears 12 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Jerome Bettis bounced back from his worst game
with the Steelers, running for 131 yards and a touchdown to lead
the Steelers (2-0) over the Chicago Bears.
	   The Bears (0-2), 24-23 losers to Jacksonville last week when
they couldn't score from the 1-yard line with four minutes left,
again had a chance to win in the fourth quarter.
	   But Carnell Lake intercepted Erik Kramer's pass on third-and-10
from the Steelers' 16 with 44 seconds left to halt what could have
been a game-winning drive.
 &UR; Bengals 34, Lions 28 (OT) &QC; 
	   In Pontiac, Michigan, Corey Sawyer intercepted Scott Mitchell's
pass to Johnnie Morton on the fourth play of overtime and returned
it 53 yards for a touchdown.
	   The win was a great relief for the Bengals (1-1) who wanted
desperately to get off to a good start. Since 1991, the Bengals
have gone 9-48 in the first half of the season. Last season, they
won their opener but lost their next seven.
	   Barry Sanders, who rushed for 185 yards and three touchdowns for
the Lions (0-2), tied the game at 28 on a 5-yard scamper with 1:52
left in the fourth quarter.
 &UR; Vikings 38, Rams 31 &QC; 
	   In St.Louis, Randall Cunningham, subbing for injured Brad
Johnson, threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter with 2:09
left to lift Minnesota over St. Louis.
	   The Rams (0-2) almost tied it on the final play when quarterback
Tony Banks dived for the end zone following an 8-yard scramble, but
he was stopped less than a yard away.
	   Robert Smith rushed for a career-best 179 yards and two
first-half scores, including a 74-yard dash for the Vikings (2-0),
who led 24-10 at the half and then traded points the rest of the
way.
 &UR; Falcons 17, Eagles 12 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, rebounding from a dismal first half, Atlanta scored
on its first two possessions of the third quarter and improved to
2-0 for the first time since 1986.
	   Chris Chandler threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Brian
Kozlowski, and Jamal Anderson added a 1-yard scoring run for the
Falcons.
	   The Eagles, who opened with a 38-0 home loss to Seattle, are 0-2
for the first time in eight years.
 &UR; Chargers 13, Oilers 7 &QC; 
	   In Nashville, Tennessee, Ryan Leaf set up San Diego's only
touchdown with a 20-yard scramble, and John Carney kicked two field
goals as the Chargers spoiled Tennessee's first regular-season game
in their new hometown.
	   Not even a sellout crowd of 41,089 at Vanderbilt Stadium could
lift the Oilers (1-1), whose final drive ended when Steve McNair
overthrew Jackie Harris on fourth-and-5 at midfield with 1:34 left.
	   The Chargers (2-0) sacked McNair three times, and he finished
21-of-35 for 187 yards and one touchdown.
 &UR; Packers 23, Buccaneers 15 &QC; 
	   In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Reggie White got three sacks and led a
pass rush that harassed Trent Dilfer all day as the Green Bay
Packers won their 29th straight home game.
	   Dilfer was sacked six times, losing the ball on three of them,
as the Packers (2-0) put the Bucs (0-2) in an early hole in the NFC
Central.
	   White, who retired briefly in the offseason, increased his
record sacks total to 179 1/2 despite the hot, muggy day that sent
several players to the sidelines with cramps and dehydration.
 &UR; Broncos 42, Cowboys 23 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Terrell Davis ran for 191 yards and three touchdowns
as Denver beat Dallas, which lost quarterback Troy Aikman for 4-8
weeks with a broken left collarbone.
	   John Elway threw for 268 yards and two touchdowns and ran for
another score for the Broncos (2-0) before leaving in the fourth
quarter with an injury to his right hamstring.
	   The Cowboys (1-1) lost Aikman midway through the second quarter
when he scrambled for a 6-yard gain, was hit by three defenders and
left the field holding his left shoulder.
 &UR; Seahawks 33, Cardinals 14 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Willie Williams and Shawn Springs returned
interceptions for touchdowns and Ricky Watters had his first
100-yard rushing game for Seattle.
	   In going 2-0 to open the season for the first time since 1994,
the Seahawks have outscored their first two opponents 71-14.
Seattle won 38-0 in Philadelphia last Sunday.
	   Watters, the former Eagles' running back who was lured to
Seattle by owner Paul Allen's money, gained 105 yards on 22
carries. Williams and Springs sparkled for a defense that sacked
second-year Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer seven times.
 &UR; Raiders 20, Giants 17 &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Greg Davis kicked a 26-yard field goal
with 1:59 remaining as the Oakland Raiders gave new coach Jon
Gruden his first win in a penalty-plagued game.
	   Oakland's Eric Turner sacked Danny Kannell for an 11-yard loss
and then intercepted his fourth-down pass to end the final
possession for the Giants.
	   The Raiders got an 80-yard touchdown run from Napoleon Kaufman
on the first play from scrimmage. Oakland was penalized 16 times
for 113 yards, while New York had 15 penalties for 90 yards.

Northern Ireland's new legislature begins slow road to government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The Protestants and Catholics
of Northern Ireland's new legislative Assembly were starting down
the long road Monday towards governing this long-divided land in
partnership.
	   The 108 members of the fledgling legislature _ elected in June
following April's historic agreement among eight parties on how
Northern Ireland should be governed _ were due to take their seats
inside the brand-new debating chamber of Stormont Parliamentary
Building in east Belfast.
	   The Assembly has met only once before: to elect Ulster Unionist
Party leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labor Party
deputy leader Seamus Mallon to lead an effectively cross-community
government.
	   Trimble's party is chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority. Mallon's is the major vote-getter among
Catholics seeking closer ties with the rest of Ireland.
	   Trimble and Mallon last week began meeting all major parties
about how to allocate seats in a new 12-member administration, to
be called the Executive and be drawn from the Assembly.
	   The IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, which attracts a substantial
minority of Catholic votes and won 18 Assembly seats, has laid
claim to two Executive posts. Trimble insists Sinn Fein nominees
won't get Assembly approval unless the Irish Republican Army starts
disarming as proof that its July 1997 truce is sincere.
	   ``None of us are angels, and we will not create heaven on
earth,'' Mallon said. ``But at least we can end what has been for
many of our people in recent years a hell on Earth.''
	   Appointments to the Executive will require majorities of votes
from both the Protestant and Catholic blocs in the Assembly. Given
the fundamental dispute between Trimble and Sinn Fein, no vote on
forming the administration was likely this week.
	   Trimble faces considerable opposition within the Protestant
benches from the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party,
which withdrew from the negotiations last year once Sinn Fein
gained admission _ and which similarly lays claim to two Executive
seats.
	   Trimble's Ulster Unionists hold 28 seats and have support from
two other Protestant politicians. Paisley leads an anti-agreement
caucus of 28.
	   Trimble and Mallon were expected to lead discussions on plans
for joint policy-making between the new Executive and the
government of the Irish Republic, which won independence from
Britain in 1922.
	   Later, time was set aside to discuss the Aug. 15 car bombing by
IRA dissidents in the market town of Omagh. Northern Ireland's
deadliest terrorist atrocity in three decades of conflict killed 29
people _ 16 Catholics, 11 Protestants and two Spanish visitors _
and wounded more than 330 others.

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Elections hailed as the most
successful since Bosnia's war ended three years ago showed the
former Yugoslav republic has matured politically, international
officials say.
	   The two days of voting that ended Sunday was not without
problems, including polling stations that failed to open the first
day and missing voter registration lists that caused confusion in
some areas.
	   But election organizers and Western powers overseeing Bosnia
called the problems relatively minor and proclaimed the voting a
success. First results were expected Tuesday.
	   ``It's a great day for democracy,'' said Carlos Westendorp, the
European high representative in Bosnia. ``It proves the maturity of
the Bosnian people.''
	   Robert Barry, the official in charge of organizing the vote,
called it ``the most successful elections held here since''
fighting halted under the Western-brokered Dayton peace plan in
1995.
	   Fears of violence, as occurred in the previous national election
in 1996 and local voting last year, proved unfounded.
	   In Banja Luka in the Bosnian Serb republic, police detained a
Sarajevo-based television crew for two hours, allegedly for filming
the office of republic President Biljana Plavsic without
permission. Barry called the detention outrageous and said it would
be investigated as a violation of election rules.
	   Otherwise, general calm prevailed for the election considered
crucial to the future of the peace accord.
	   ``Very clearly these elections were free and fair,'' said Robert
Gelbard, U.S. President Clinton's representative in the Balkans.
Citing the problems involving voters' list, which also resulted in
some voters going to the wrong polling stations, Gelbard said: ``No
election process is perfect.''
	   Turnout nationwide exceeded 70 percent, Barry said, and initial
returns were expected Tuesday.
	   The election gave voters a choice between hard-line ethnic
leaders from the war era and moderates who favor the Western-backed
peace plan.
	   Under the peace agreement, Bosnia is divided into two entities _
a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation. Voters selected a
three-member presidency _ one from each ethnic group _ along with a
national parliament and separate parliaments in each entity.
	   But hard-line politicians on all three sides and ethnic mistrust
have slowed progress. One of the major issues is refugees _ an
estimated 1 million displaced people still cannot go home to areas
controlled by rival ethnic groups.
	   ``I think these elections are a good chance to finally change
the situation in which we are living now,'' said Senada Malanovic,
25, a Muslim woman in the southern town of Mostar. ``I'm not quite
sure how much people from these areas will use that chance.''
	   More than 30,000 NATO-led troops, mostly from the United States
and Europe, impose security in Bosnia as international officials in
charge try to use Dayton to force the country toward European
integration.
	   Western allies led by the United States and the European Union,
who effectively run the country under the Dayton agreement, hope
ethnic-driven political parties that waged the war will lose
support this weekend and eventually fade away.

UN appeals to Montenegro to reverse its ban on Kosovo refugees

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following Montenegro's deportation
of 3,200 ethnic Albanians, the U.N. refugee agency is appealing to
the Yugoslav republic to reverse its decision to deny sanctuary to
refugees fleeing fighting in Kosovo.
	   Montenegro's expulsion Sunday of refugees to neighboring Albania
was unusual because Kosovo Albanians are _ like Montenegrins _
citizens of Yugoslavia. Montenegro said it had no choice because it
could not afford to help the refugees.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which together with Montenegro
forms Yugoslavia following the breakup of most of the Yugoslav
federation during ethnic wars throughout this decade.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees sent a letter Sunday to
the president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, reminding him of an
earlier promise to provide refuge for those trying to escape
fighting between Serb forces and the ethnic Albanian rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is seeking independence.
	   The population of Kosovo, which borders Albania, is
overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian.
	   UNHCR spokesman Fernando del Mundo said about 3,000 more
refugees were en route to Montenegro, although the border with
Kosovo ``is completely sealed.''
	   Del Mundo said he was unsure of the ``legal ramifications'' of
Montenegro's action against Yugoslav citizens.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said at least 14 Kosovo Albanians had been
killed since Friday in ambushes while trying to cross into
Montenegro.
	   The number could not be confirmed. But residents of the border
area village of Drelje said they knew of two refugees killed this
weekend by Yugoslav army snipers.
	   The villagers said all the refugees came from Istinic, about 75
kilometers (45 miles) west of Pristina, where up to 40,000 refugees
camped late last week to flee an advance of Serb security forces.
All refugees left Istinic in recent days, forced out by Serb
police.
	   Those sent to Albania on Sunday had made the treacherous journey
on foot over the mountain gorge dividing Kosovo and Montenegro.
They arrived Friday at the Montenegrin border town of Plav, where
police denied them entry.
	   Having nowhere to turn, the group camped for two days and nights
under open skies, in chilly mountain weather, with only a few
hundred blankets and meager food provided by local relief
officials.
	   On Sunday, Montenegrin police shipped the refugees by bus to the
Albanian border, which was temporarily reopened to allow them to
cross.
	   Montenegrin deputy premier Dragisa Burzan, who visited the site
again Sunday, claimed the refugees welcomed the move.
	   ``The reasons for the deportation are security ones, not
humanitarian,'' Burzan said, referring to reports that there were
gunmen and arms among the refugees.
	   Montenegro had been the safest haven for those trying to escape
fighting between the KLA and Serb security forces, which has killed
hundreds and left more than 265,000 homeless since it began six
months ago.
	   The border with Albania has been mined, and Yugoslav troops
routinely fire at those trying to cross the frontier. But
Montenegro has already taken in more than 40,000 refugees from
Kosovo.
	   They joined about 30,000 others who had fled fighting earlier
this decade in the former Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Bosnia.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Mexico (AP) _ It was 1 a.m. in this farming
village when 4-year-old Suriday Cigarroa awoke to something wet in
his crib. He cried out, ``Daddy, there's water, there's water!''
	   There was a lot of water.
	   Dozens of rivers along the Pacific coast of southern Mexico had
overrun their banks after three days of steady rain. As Buenos
Aires slept early Tuesday morning, the tiny stream through the
village about 35 miles (55 kms) north of the Guatemalan border had
become a raging torrent, filling the streets with more than 10 feet
(3 meters) of water, mud and rocks.
	   Suriday, his parents, his brother and his baby sister were
asleep in their one-room, dirt-floor house. The water was already
knee-deep when Suriday's father, Jose, splashed out of bed.
	   ``I was terrified, and I grabbed the child and ran,'' he said.
``I've never felt so helpless.''
	   Suriday's mother, Norma, yanked her other children from their
sleep and the family ran up a hill, toward a neighbor's house and
to safety.
	   Despite the biting rain and the ever-faster current, Suriday's
parents ran back to their house to try to save their few
belongings: clothes, the television, Jose's carpentry tools. But
the water was already waist-deep, and all they could grab were a
few muddy T-shirts.
	   On Saturday, the family huddled in an elementary school
converted into a shelter for the 80 villagers who lost their homes.
They were sleeping in a classroom and eating from the communal
kitchen tent stocked only with corn gruel, coffee and beans.
	   Suriday's parents credited their son for saving their lives.
Without his warning, they said, they might not have woken up at
all.
	   ``I think God spoke to us through him, making him an angel,
because if we hadn't woke up on time, we all would have died,''
Jose said. ``We all would have been buried in mud, earth and
rocks.''
	   Suriday, sitting on a tree trunk, stared ahead with a blank
expression. Asked what had happened Tuesday morning, he dutifully
recounted the ordeal.
	   ``The water made a sound like boom, boom, boom. It was coming
in, and I woke up. I started crying, and I told my parents to get
out of bed,'' he said. He held a little hand to his waist to show
how high the water had risen.
	   It would rise much higher, tearing off the home's concrete roof
and stuffing five feet (1.5 meters) of mud between its cement-block
walls.
	   The flooding has killed at least 100 people along the coastline
and washed many of their bodies toward the sea. It also left 20,000
people homeless, including Suriday's family, and cut off 400,000
people from the rest of the world by washing out highways and
downing bridges.
	   On Saturday, Suriday's family found little left in their small
house.
	   A wardrobe was almost entirely covered in drying mud and the
stove wasn't visible without digging. The crib where Suriday had
slept was distinguished only by a piece of wood sticking out of the
muck.
	   ``Now we don't have anywhere to live. We were left without
anything,'' Norma said. ``But at the same time, I'm happy because
if it weren't for Suriday, we would have been buried.''

Tension running high in Albania as opposition issues ultimatum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Brushing aside international calls for
restraint, opposition leader Sali Berisha has urged the government
to resign and schedule new elections in the wake of the
assassination of his popular aide.
	   Tensions were running high in this former Communist country as
members of Berisha's Democratic Party prepared to bury Azem
Hajdari, a charismatic former student leader slain Saturday in
front of party headquarters.
	   The funeral service for the 35-year-old Hajdari was to begin
Monday at the sprawling Skanderberg Square.
	   No one has been arrested or claimed responsibility for Hajdari's
assassination. But Berisha, the former president, blames the
Socialist Party of Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
	   Berisha's followers rioted in the capital Sunday, setting fire
to the building housing the prime minister's office. His Cabinet
fled out a side entrance. One protester was killed and four police
were injured.
	   Several cars were set afire.
	   Following Sunday's violence, Berisha met with his party leaders
and afterward demanded that ``the government should resign
unconditionally by noon (1000 GMT) Monday.'' Berisha urged the
creation of a ``technical government'' to prepare for national
elections.
	   President Rexhep Meidani, who broke off a trip to Greece, said
in a nationally televised address that the ``tragic murder'' of
Hajdari ``should not lead to a repetition of last year's chaos, for
which we all paid dearly.''
	   He was referring to nationwide riots which swept the country
after the collapse of pyramid investment schemes which cost many
Albanians their life's savings.
	   More than one million weapons were looted from government
armories, and many of the guns ended up in neighboring Kosovo
province in the hands of ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence from Serbia.
	   Meidani urged all politicians to ``stop the language of hate.''
	   Alarmed over the prospect of further instability, the United
States and the European Union appealed for calm, fearful the
turmoil could topple Albania's elected government and spread
elsewhere in the Balkans, including neighboring Kosovo.
	   Instability in Albania could impede U.S. and European efforts to
solve the crisis in neighboring Kosovo. Berisha has openly
supported Kosovo Albanian rebels, who maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.
	   That message was repeated by the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation Europe. The head of the OSCE mission in
Tirana, Daan Everts of Denmark, told Albanian television that
``there's no justice to be found in violence.''
	   ``There is no excuse to react with violence, burning buildings,
cars and shooting,'' Everts said. ``And I don't believe that anyone
who wants a democratic, peaceful, prosperous Albania, would call
for violence.''

U.S. planes once bombed Cambodia, now seen as hope for rescue

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Every day for the past week,
hundreds of young opposition activists have driven motor-scooters
to the guarded barrier outside the U.S. Embassy and talked about
their hope for American intervention.
	   Every day, riot police with clubs and guns or plainclothes mobs
organized by strongman Hun Sen drove them off. One person has been
killed in the area and scores hurt, including activist Buddhist
monks. At least three other deaths have been confirmed in the
unrest.
	   Yet the protesters keep coming back, convinced that the United
States is their savior in an unequal struggle against Hun Sen, whom
they want ousted following disputed parliamentary elections July
26.
	   ``There are 20 American planes coming right now. They will
arrest Hun Sen and bring him to the international court,'' said Mey
Viasnar, 22, a student, repeating one widely believed account that
resurfaces daily, sometimes in the local press.
	   In one variation, Marines are staging a task force and awaiting
the green light from Congress to invade. Another has U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan trying to fly in but not being allowed
to land.
	   But no planes, no Marines and no U.N. high ranking officials
ever arrive. U.S. officials have offered shelter to a few
protesters, but little have done little else.
	   ``We deplore the use of violence and we've called on all the
parties to resolve their differences peacefully,'' a senior Embassy
official said on condition of anonymity. ``We've stressed to
everyone that the U.S. doesn't support any party or any
individual.''
	   Despite the daily disappointment when no forces arrive and the
embassy's denials that they ever will, the opposition's hopes do
not die easily.
	   Outside, copies circulated of a letter to Clinton from three
U.S. congressmen _ Benjamin Gilman, Dana Rohrabacher and
Christopher Smith _ who have interests in human rights and
Southeast Asia.
	   ``Hun Sen must be told that there will be consequences for his
actions,'' they wrote. ``Given his record of brute force, there
will never be peace or stability in Cambodia as long as he remains
in power.''
	   Few Cambodians understand the distinction between the U.S.
administration, which carries out foreign policy, and congressmen
expressing advice. King Norodom Sihanouk, 75, has survived the
international political arena for half a century and knows better.
	   In an open letter to Rohrabacher, the king pointed out that
opposition politicians were in danger of their lives and there was
little America could do.
	   ``If `accidents' happen to them, you and the United States will
not be able to save them,'' Sihanouk said. ``I have no other choice
but to counsel the weak to choose another policy that avoids sorrow
for the people, the country and themselves.''
	   The last time U.S. forces intervened in Cambodia was during the
Vietnam War, when B-52s rained bombs on the country to smash North
Vietnamese sanctuaries.
	   One opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, has urged America to bomb
again. Speaking to supporters after U.S. cruise missiles were fired
at alleged terrorism facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan, he
encouraged the United States to drop one on Hun Sen's compound.
	   U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Quinn expressed his ``deep
disappointment'' at the statement and assured Cambodians that a
missile would not be launched.
	   Shifts in U.S. policy over the years have been dramatic.
	   In 1970, Washington backed a coup against then-Prince Sihanouk
that escalated a civil war, won five years later by the Khmer
Rouge. The Khmer Rouge then caused the deaths of as many as 2
million people before they were toppled by a Vietnamese invasion in
1979.
	   After the Vietnamese invasion, the United States supported a
guerrilla alliance of Khmer Rouge, royalist and republican factions
to drive out Hanoi's troops, who stayed 10 years.
	   The warring parties agreed to hold U.N.-organized elections in
1993. Washington took a leading role and became regarded by many
Cambodians as a symbol of democracy.
	   Ranariddh, who had led the royalist resistance faction, won but
was forced to share power with the occupation-era leader, Hun Sen,
who toppled him in a coup last year. Pressure from the United
Nations, United States and other countries resulted in new
elections July 26. This time, Hun Sen won, though the opposition
has alleges massive fraud.
	   So once again opposition members dream of U.S. intervention,
even if there is little chance it will ever come.

Ferrari driver caps season-long pursuit at Monza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Two-time world champion Michael Schumacher
capped a seven-month pursuit Sunday by equaling Mika Hakkinen on
points in the world Formula One championship.
	   Leading teammate Eddie Irvine for a 1-2 Ferrari triumph in the
Italian Grand Prix, Schumacher piled up 80 points in 14 races and
annulled a gap from his Finnish rival which had reached as high as
22 points following the Monaco GP, in May.
	   Each victory awards 10 points with 6 points going to the
second-place.
	   With only two championship races left, on circuits that should
fit Ferrari cars more than McLaren-Mercedes, the German driver can
look forward to his third world drivers title in five years _ an
achievement which appeared almost impossible by mid season.
	   Sunday's victory did not come without problems as Schumacher was
off to a slow start from the pole position and slipped to fourth
place in the initial laps.
	   A blown engine, which stopped the leading McLaren-Mercedes of
David Coulthard, and a daring attack by Schumacher on Hakkinen's
other McLaren during the decisive 17th lap vaulted the Ferrari
driver from third to first place among the cheers of 110,000
partisan fans who had fallen silent following the bad start.
	   Hakkinen, who led Schumacher by seven points prior to the
Italian race, definitely compromised his chances to keep a narrow
championship lead by falling from second to fourth place in the
final laps.
	   The Finnish driver, who has been commanding the world standings
since winning the two first season races in Australia and Brazil,
spun off at the Roggia corner while chasing the race leader, only
2.8 seconds behind.
	   Hakkinen avoided to stall in the gravel, roared back into the
track but could not avoid to be overtaken by Irvine for second
place and by Michael's younger brother, Ralf, for third.
	   Ralf Schumacher, who drove a Jordan-Mugen Honda, hugged his
brother on the podium as thousands of Ferrari supporters waved the
red-and-yellow flags with the prancing horse logo.
	   Ralf is expected to join Williams next year and team with
two-time CART champion Alex Zanardi.
	   ``I must thank Eddie and Ralf for helping me to earn
co-leadership,'' Schumacher said. ``I'm looking forward to the next
races, on circuits where Ferrari should be more competitive.''
	   The two last championship races - the GP of Luxembourg at
Nurburgring and the Japanese GP at Suzuka _ are scheduled on Sept.
27 and Nov. 1.
	   The Nurburgring circuit, which already hosted the German GP this
year, is considered Schumacher's home track and one of his favorite
venues.
	   Defending world champion Jacques Villeneuve, who had been as
slow as Schumacher starting in front row, did not finish.
	   The Canadian driver retired during the 37th of the 53-lap race,
while holding fourth place in his Williams.
	   Long out of contention for the title, Villeneuve already
announced he will join the newly-established British American
Racing team next year.

Dollar edges higher, Japanese stock prices rebound moderately
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar edged higher against the yen early
Monday, while Japanese stock prices bounced back in a favorable
reaction to a rally on Wall Street late last week.
	   The dollar bought 131.09 yen in early trading, up 0.31 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
130.82 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 105.95 points,
or 0.76 percent, to 14,022.93 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the Nikkei average closed down 749.05 points,
or 5.12 percent, its largest drop this year in both points and
percentage.
	   Friday's plunge was sparked by fears over Japan's worsening
economy and instability in global financial markets.
	   On the foreign exchange market, traders said the dollar
maintained its strength in New York on Friday, where the U.S.
currency rose after a late rally on Wall Street.
	   New York stocks rose Friday on reports that U.S. President Bill
Clinton had issued an emotional apology at the White House
regarding the Monica Lewinsky scandal _ and the dollar followed
stocks upward.
	   Earlier Friday, U.S. special prosecutor Kenneth Starr released a
report outlining a case for impeaching Clinton over his affair with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
	   In Tokyo, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section was up 5.99 points, or 0.56 percent, to
1,077.47. The TOPIX closed down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, on
Friday.
	   The stock market was buoyed by a 179.96-point gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Friday, in addition to buying following
Friday's sharp fall in Tokyo, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the share price of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan temporarily plunged to 19 yen (15 U.S. cents) per share in
early trading before rebounding to 32 yen (24 cents). It had closed
Friday's trading at 49 yen (37 cents).
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to a record low of 0.770 percent from Friday's
finish of 0.780 percent, driving its price up to 114.80 yen from
114.72 yen. Friday's yield was the previous record low.

Struggling Kohl gets boost from Bavarian state election

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A strong showing by Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Bavarian allies in state elections breathed new life into
his struggling re-election bid just two weeks before the national
vote.
	   With his campaign trailing the opposition Social Democrats and
their charismatic chancellor candidate in the polls, Kohl was
clearly in a good mood Sunday night as the results came in.
	   ``I think it's not just possible, but rather probable that we'll
be ahead of the (Social Democrats) on election night,'' he told
reporters in Bonn.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, sought to play down his
party's disappointing results. ``Helmut Kohl wasn't up for election
here,'' he said in Hanover, the capital of Lower Saxony state which
he governs. ``That'll be different in 14 days.''
	   Preliminary official results released early Monday show the
conservative Christian Social Union, Bavarian sister party to
Kohl's Christian Democrats, easily holding on to the majority they
have enjoyed in Bavaria's statehouse since 1962.
	   Sunday's results were especially sweet for Kohl because the
Social Democrats had sought to focus the Bavarian campaign on
national issues to capitalize on voter discontent with the
chancellor.
	   State Gov. Edmund Stoiber called the results ``a huge slap'' for
the Social Democrats and ``a sure signal for an upswing'' for his
party and Kohl's ahead of the Sept. 27 federal election.
	   It was the first good news from a state election for Kohl all
year; his party performed poorly in Saxony-Anhalt and Lower Saxony
earlier this year.
	   No one expected Stoiber to lose in Bavaria. But for the first
time in years, polls suggested he had to worry about his party
clearing 50 percent.
	   The CSU ended up with about 53 percent, about the same as in
1994. The Social Democrats won 29 percent _ one point less than
four years ago.
	   Unlike Kohl, Schroeder had done a lot of campaigning in the
Alpine state, and his face was on more campaign posters than his
state party leader, Renate Schmidt.
	   CSU party chairman Theo Waigel, who is also Kohl's finance
minister, denied the party tried to ``hide'' its role in Bonn.
	   But the Social Democrats accused Stoiber of doing just that.
	   Kohl was not invited to the party's last convention three weeks
before the election, and Stoiber rarely if ever mentioned him in
stump speeches, apparently fearful of being tainted by Kohl's
lethargic campaign.
	   ``The CSU kept its role in the federal government in Bonn under
wraps, it kept the chancellor under wraps,'' said Bavarian Social
Democratic official Franz Maget.
	   Many Germans blame Kohl for the country's double-digit
unemployment, high taxes and other social ills, and feel he is out
of fresh ideas after 16 years in office. Schroeder _ at 54, 14
years Kohl's junior _ has campaigned as the voice of change.
	   Schmidt said she still believed many CSU voters will vote
differently in two weeks _ as some polls suggest.
	   ``Many people can't stand the sight of (Kohl) anymore,'' said
27-year-old Alexandra Vogel, echoing the comments of many voters
Sunday. ``I think the (Social Democrats) will get a lot of votes
just because of Kohl. People think he's been there too long.''
	   In other election results, the liberal Greens party won 5.7
percent. The far-right Republican party won 3.6 percent, under the
5 percent minimum required for gaining seats in parliament.
	   An estimated 8.8 million Bavarians were eligible to vote. State
officials put voter turnout at about 70 percent, despite rain
across most of the Alpine state and snow in the mountains.

How Israeli commandos took out two top Hamas military leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ It was 4:35 p.m. when police dogs led Israeli
commandos into the limestone summer house where two fugitive
leaders of the Hamas military wing were hiding.
	   The Israelis, members of the elite border police Yamam unit,
fired a volley of shots that killed Adel and Imad Awadallah,
notorious brothers who were sought by both the Israelis and
Palestinians for planning terrorist attacks.
	   That much is known. What remains a mystery is whether simple
luck and happenstance or a complex web of collusion and betrayal
led two violent lives to their violent ends.
	   From officials, news accounts and eyewitnesses emerged a rare
glimpse into a clandestine Israeli operation whose targets may have
been marked men ever since one of them walked away from a
Palestinian jail three weeks ago.
	   Thursday's fatal raid touched off a new round of street clashes
between angry Palestinians and Israeli soldiers at a time when U.S.
envoy Dennis Ross is trying to end a deadlock and bring about a
further Israeli troop withdrawal in the West Bank.
	   The killings were widely viewed by Palestinians as an
assassination _ one in which the Palestinian Authority may have had
a role.
	   The French newspaper Le Journal Le Dimanche said Jibril Rajoub,
head of Palestinian Preventive Security, allowed Imad Awadallah to
escape from a jail in Jericho on Aug. 15.
	   The paper said a monitoring device had been placed on his body
without his knowledge, and an Israeli drone followed him until he
met his brother Adel in the retreat near the West Bank town of
Hebron.
	   While senior military officials scoffed at the claim, the
commander of the operation, Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, said he could
not confirm or deny cooperation with the Palestinians.
	   Yaalon rejected Palestinian allegations that the raid was a
rubout, stressing that the commandos had orders to try to capture
the Awadallah brothers because they had potentially valuable
information about Hamas.
	   ``I preferred to arrest and interrogate them,'' he said.
	   But the brothers were armed _ one with a Russian-designed AK-47
assault rifle and the other with an Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun
_ and the soldiers decided not to take any chances, he said.
	   ``You can't leave them any room to maneuver,'' he said at a
press briefing Sunday.
	   But those who doubt the official Israeli version ask how the
Israelis knew the Awadallahs were in the house.
	   Yaalon said the army suspected the Awadallahs were inside.
Soldiers had been drawn to the area by the sounds of gunfire and
explosions on Wednesday night. Soldiers staked out the house and
saw two men come outside with weapons, including hand grenades. One
resembled a 1993 photo the army had of Adel Awadallah, Yaalon said.
	   The soldiers also arrested a visitor to the house shortly before
the raid _ Akram Mussauda, the man who rented the villa to the
Awadallahs. He told them that the suspects had just finished eating
and would soon be sleeping. Yaalon said he felt he could surprise
the Awadallahs if he moved quickly.
	   Rami Karablieh, a 14-year-old shepherd boy, told reporters that
a truck with its back windows covered with blankets arrived outside
the house Thursday afternoon. Four GMC vans came next. About 40
soldiers in uniform got out, and about a dozen accompanied by a
large dog charged down a driveway to the front door of the house,
which was surrounded by a wall.
	   A half-dozen shots were then heard.
	   Allowed to enter the house on Friday, reporters saw a large
banner on the wall reading Izzedine al-Qassam _ the name of the
Hamas military wing. One brand new, seemingly unused boot was on
the floor along with a pair of bloodstained trousers.
	   The banner seemed inconsistent with two fugitives trying to
conceal their identity. So did the location of their hideout _ in
Israeli-controlled territory near a Jewish settlement.
	   The inconsistencies prompted speculation that the scene of the
raid had been manufactured, which the army denied. Palestinians in
the Hebron area speculated that the brothers were killed elsewhere
and brought to the villa.
	   After the raid, members of the Awadallah family told reporters
that they suspected Imad Awadallah was allowed to escape from jail
on Aug. 15 so that he would lead authorities to his brother. An
aunt who visited Imad in jail said he was too weak from beatings
and too well-guarded to get away on his own initiative.
	   Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief, denied involvement.
``It's not true; the man escaped,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   Israeli officials do not reject assassination as an option in
fighting terrorists. Rubouts of key Islamic militants have been
attributed to Israeli security services in the past, although not
officially confirmed.
	   Several killings, especially the January 1996 death of Hamas'
chief bomb maker, Yehyia Ayyash, in the Gaza Strip, spawned a
series of suicide bomb attacks in 1996 that killed more than 60
Israelis and crippled the peace negotiations.
	   According to the army, both Awadallah brothers were leaders of
the military wing of Hamas.
	   Adel Awadallah was the head of the cell that carried out three
attacks in 1997; the bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe which killed three
Israeli women, the kidnapping death of an Israeli soldier, and the
planting of bombs in the Tel Aviv bus station which injured 14.
	   His brother Imad, was involved in the deaths of five Israelis
and was accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedine Sharif as
part of an internal feud, the army said.

Rafter uses poise and near-perfection to win U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Poise and near-perfection. With an awesome
display of speed and accuracy, Patrick Rafter proved he belongs as
a U.S. Open champion.
	   Rafter made just five unforced errors in the entire match,
retaining his title Sunday by winning an all-Australian battle with
Mark Philippoussis 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-0.
	   The third-seeded Rafter won the final 10 games as Philippoussis'
usually overpowering serve became a liability. The unseeded
Philippoussis had just five aces and 13 double faults, the last on
the final point of the match.
	   Rafter's victory gave the Open its second consecutive repeat
champion. Pete Sampras won in 1995-96.
	   ``Now I feel that last year wasn't such a fluke. Now I can look
at people and say I've done it again,'' Rafter said. ``Having the
experience last year really helped me in this match. I was very
relaxed out there.''
	   It was Aussie Rules tennis in the final, with both players
diving to the concrete courts and sending volleys rocketing across
the net. But Rafter had precision to go with his power.
	   ``I really didn't do anything that much wrong, except for a few
double faults,'' Philippoussis said. ``Pat hit a lot of passing
shots, he made me volley from my shoetops. He was playing great
tennis. The guy's just quick.''
	   Rafter, who had to rally from a two-set deficit in the first
round but never was threatened again in the tournament, won dlrs
700,000 and moved up to No. 2 in the world rankings _ just behind
Sampras, whom he defeated Saturday in the semifinals.
	   The match was tied at one set apiece and 2-2 in the third set
when Rafter took command. After holding serve, Rafter moved to
break point on an incredible point when he raced around the court
to return an overhead, a forehand into the corner and a drop shot.
He broke Philippoussis' serve on the next point.
	   Rafter then won the next eight games to close out the match.
	   During changeovers, Rafter thought back to his five-set victory
over Hicham Arazi in the first round.
	   ``I was thinking to myself, `This is not right, I should be at
home,''' he said. ``I was very lucky and I felt that way the whole
tournament, very lucky to be here.''
	   Rafter, looking like a Samurai warrior with a pony tail and a
mangy beard that he grew during the tournament, has a game
tailor-made for the hard, fast courts and hard, fast balls of the
U.S. Open.
	   Philippoussis, in his first Grand Slam final, stayed in the
match by saving 13 of 14 break points until midway through the
third set, but Rafter converted five of his six break points after
that.
	   Rafter faced just three break points in the match and lost his
serve only once. His serve was broken only seven times in the seven
rounds of the tournament.
	   It was intense tennis from the start. Late in the first set,
Rafter tumbled to the court for a shot. When a ballboy brought over
a towel, Rafter dried off the court _ not himself. Philippoussis
made a similar dive later in the match.
	   Though the two players are not close and didn't speak to each
other most of the summer because of a feud centering on
Philippoussis' decision not to play on the Australian Davis Cup
team, there was a gentlemanly air to the match.
	   When Rafter made bad service tosses and caught the ball instead
of hitting it, he yelled, ``Sorry, mate,'' across the net.
	   As Australian flags waved in the stands, Rafter captured his
sixth title of the year and improved his record to 25-2 since
Wimbledon.
	   Rafter appeared to be in trouble just before taking command of
the match. In the fifth game of the third set, he was up 40-0 but
lost three straight points _ slamming his racket to the court after
netting a volley to fall to deuce.
	   He came right back to hold his serve, though, beginning his run
of 10 straight games. Included in that run was a streak of 12
unanswered points in the fourth set.
	   ``After the 2-all game, I think I just showed a bit of emotion
there, I was a bit frustrated,'' Rafter said. ``I just loosened up,
and from there I just gained more and more confidence.''
	   Philippoussis was trying to join Andre Agassi as the only
unseeded men's champion in U.S. Open history. Agassi pulled off the
feat in 1994.
	   ``This is a start of something in my career. I'm only 21 years
old. I'm hoping and counting on having many more Sundays in Grand
Slams,'' he said. ``This is just a start for me.
	   Philippoussis swept to the final with power, blowing opponents
off the court with 130-mph (210-kph) serves. His shots even sound
different than those of other players _ they have a full-throated
``THWACK'' that approaches a roar.
	   But Philippoussis' power was no match for the speed of Rafter,
who has won all three of their career matches. The second set was
the first Rafter ever lost in their rivalry.
	   ``You've got to hand it to Pat, five unforced errors for the
match,'' Philippoussis said. ``At the moment, he's playing like the
best player in the world.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ With festive marches and TV ads,
political parties kicked off their campaigns Sunday for a December
plebiscite over Puerto Rico's relationship with the United States.
	   Hundreds of people who want Puerto Rico to become a U.S. state
waved American flags as they weaved through northern Arecibo on a
``Caravan for Equality.''
	   In eastern Caguas, supporters of the current commonwealth
arrangement countered with a ``Commonwealth Crusade'' rally, while
independence advocates took to radio talk shows to sell their
cause.
	   Statehooders are already running television advertisements
assuring Puerto Ricans that they would retain their culture and
Spanish language after joining the union. ``Statehood: your
language, your culture, your future,'' promise the ads.
	   Puerto Rico marks 100 years as a U.S. possession this year, and
the island's pro-statehood governor has been pressuring the U.S.
Congress to hold a vote to resolve the island's ambiguous
relationship with the United States. After the proposal stalled in
the Senate, Gov. Pedro Rossello called a local, nonbinding
plebiscite for Dec. 13.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire for the home run
record, connecting twice to raise his total to 62 Sunday in the
Chicago Cubs' 11-10, 10-inning victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Sosa homered off Bronswell Patrick in the fifth inning and Eric
Plunk in the ninth, sending both balls onto the street behind the
left-field fence at Wrigley Field. Sosa has four homers in his last
three games.
	   With Sosa on deck, Mark Grace hit the game-winning homer off Al
Reyes (5-1). Rod Beck (3-2) pitched one inning for the win, which
kept the Cubs one game ahead of the Mets in the NL wild-card race.
 &UR; Mets 1, Expos 0
	   In Montreal, Brian McRae threw out Shane Andrews at home to end
the game and doubled in the only run. Willie Blair (5-16) and two
relievers combined on a four-hitter.
	   Blair (5-16) struck out six and walked two in 7 1-3 innings, and
John Franco got three outs fir his 36th save.
	   Todd Hundley, activated from the disabled list Saturday, played
his first game at catcher since last Sept. 16. Hundley blocked the
plate on McRae's game-saving throw and walked three times in four
plate appearances.
 &UR; Giants 4, Rockies 3
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds erased a 3-1 deficit when he hit a
three-run homer off long-time nemesis Chuck McElroy (6-4) in the
eighth inning. Bonds had been just 1-for-29 against the pitcher.
	   San Francisco, which stopped Colorado's seven-game winning
streak, remained 3{ games behind Chicago in the NL wild-card race.
John Johnstone (4-5) pitched a perfect eighth, and Robb Nen pitched
the ninth for his 36th.
 &UR; Dodgers 5, Padres 4
	   In San Diego, a day after San Diego clinched the NL West, Bobby
Bonilla hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the 10th off Donne Wall
(5-4).
	   Tony Gwynn, who missed the last four games with a sprained
ligament in his right thumb, was the only regular in San Diego's
starting lineup and was 0-for-3.
	   Eric Weber (1-0) pitched the ninth, and Jeff Shaw got three outs
for his 43rd save.
 &UR; Marlins 6, Braves 5
	   In Atlanta, Jesus Sanchez (7-8) struck out a career-high 10 in
seven-plus innings as Florida prevented Atlanta from clinching its
seventh straight division title.
	   The Marlins beat the Braves 6-5 by scoring four runs in the
seventh off Odalis Perez (0-1) and two runs with no hits in the
eighth off Adam Butler.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Reds 0
	   In Cincinnati, Andy Benes' bid to pitch Arizona's first
no-hitter was broken up with one out in the ninth on rookie Sean
Casey's single.
	   Benes (13-13), trying to pitch the first no-hitter for an
expansion team since Montreal's Bill Stoneman against Philadelphia
in 1969, allowed the one hits in 8 1-3 innings, struck out six and
walked five. Gregg Olson got the last two outs for his 28th save.
	   Jason Bere (1-2) allowed four hits in six innings, and struck
out five.
 &UR; Phillies 4, Pirates 1
	   In Philadelphia, Bobby Abreu broke a tie with a two-run,
upper-deck homer to right field and Paul Byrd (4-2) allowed three

Fire 3, Rapids 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Forward Josh Wolff scored two goals and assisted
on a third to lead the Chicago Fire to a 3-1 win over the Colorado
Rapids on Sunday.
	   The victory allowed the Fire (18-11) to clinch second place in
the MLS' Western Conference and home-field advantage in the first
round of the playoffs. Colorado (13-16), the Fire's potential
first-round opponent, was in third place.
	   Wolff opened the scoring in the 12th minute by slamming home a
loose ball after Rapids goalkeeper Marcus Hahnemann stopped the
Fire's Peter Nowak on a breakaway.
	   Ante Razov then scored in his team-record fourth consecutive
game with a cross from Wolff in the 15th minute. Wolff, who has
scored in three straight games, then gave the Fire a 3-0 lead in
the 27th minute with assists from Diego Gutierrez and Nowak.
	   Joey DiGiamarino scored Colorado's lone goal from 25 yards out
in the second half.
 &UR; Clash 3, Burn 1
	   In Dallas, Oscar Draguicevich, a second-half substitute, scored
two goals Sunday to lead the San Jose Clash to a 3-1 victory over
the Dallas Burn.
	   Draguicevich, a defender who grew up in Dallas, came on in the
65th minute with the score tied 1-1. He scored two minutes later,
firing a shot between Burn goalkeeper Mark Dodd and the post.
	   In the 73rd minute, Draguicevich headed a cross from Ronald
Cerritos into the net. Cerritos assisted on all three Clash goals.
	   The victory kept San Jose's slim playoff hopes alive. The Clash
(11-18) must win their remaining three games as well as get help
from other teams.
	   Dallas (14-16) still holds the fourth and last playoff spot in
the MLS Western Conference with two games remaining, but it leads
Kansas City by only two points.
	   Dallas took the lead Sunday on a goal in the 19th minute by Chad
Deering, who headed in a corner kick by Jason Kreis. San Jose tied
the game six minutes later on a goal by defender Wade Barrett, who
was left unmarked near the goal.
 &UR; Mutiny 2, MetroStars 1
	   In Tampa, Florida, Mauricio Ramos scored the game-winning goal
in the 85th minute as Tampa Bay beat the MetroStars 2-1 Sunday.
	   Ramos scored from 18-yards out to keep the Mutiny four points
behind Miami for the final Eastern Conference playoff berth.
	   Brian Kelly's rebound goal put the MetroStars up 1-0 in the 14th
minute. Tampa's Paul Dougherty tied the game in the 55th minute.
	   The MetroStars will be without high-scoring forward Eduardo
Hurtado until at least the playoffs. Hurtado, who has 11 goals and
15 assists, underwent surgery Saturday night after breaking his
nose during a practice session.
	   MetroStars midfielder Tab Ramos (back strain) and Tampa Bay
midfielder Frankie Hejduk (hamstring) sat out the contest and are
day-to-day.
	   The match may have been the last Tampa home game for the Mutiny.
	   Major League Soccer commissioner Doug Logan said he would not
rule out relocating the franchise if lease talks involving Tampa's
new dlrs 168 million Raymond James Stadium are not completed.
	   ``We only want to be treated on a scale of the sport that we
are,'' said Logan, who will meet with local officials on Monday.
	   Rochester in upstate New York is one location that will likely
receive consideration should the league-owned Mutiny franchise,
which Logan said has lost dlrs 6 million over the past three years,
is moved.

Long-Term Credit Bank stock plunges on worries about government

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The shares of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
plunged sharply to an all-time low Monday amid doubts about the
government's ability to rescue the ailing lender.
	   LTCB's stock dropped 61 percent in the first hour of trading to
19 yen (dlrs 0.15). The previous record low for the stock was 37
yen on Aug. 11. The shares quickly rebounded to 38 yen, down from
49 yen on Friday.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest lenders, has been
plagued by speculation it may collapse under the weight of failed
real estate loans made during the late 1980s.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic party
has been trying to draft a plan to use public money to pay off some
of the bank's bad loans and keep it from going under. But progress
on the bill has been slow as Obuchi's party wrangles with
opposition groups which oppose using taxpayers' money to bailout a
private bank.
	   How Japan deals with LTCB's problems is seen as an important
measure of its ability to revive its debt-ridden banking system and
stop problems there from dragging down the whole economy.

Sorenstam wins Safeco Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KENT, Washington (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam won her fourth
tournament of the year and substantially widened her money lead
over Se Ri Pak on Sunday, shooting a 4-under-par 68 for a
five-stroke victory over Patty Sheehan and Laura Davies at the
Safeco Classic.
	   The 27-year-old Swede, gearing up for this week's Solheim Cup,
won dlrs 90,000, pushing her 1998 earnings to dlrs 896,188.
Sorenstam, who also won the Michelob Light Classic, ShopRite LPGA
Classic and JAL Big Apple Classic this year, had led Pak by a mere
dlrs 6,000 entering the tournament.
	   Pak, the rookie from South Korea who has won four tournaments
this year, shot a 75 Sunday and tied for 21st, winning just dlrs
5,624.
	   Sorenstam's 68 gave her a four-day total of 15-under 273.
Sheehan, who led Sorenstam by a stroke entering the final round,
hit only four fairways and shot a 74 for a 278, which slid the Hall
of Famer into a tie with Davies.
	   Davies, who will team with Sorenstam on the European Solheim
team at the Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, shot a 68
Sunday for her best-ever Safeco finish.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, winner of last week's Safeway LPGA Golf
Championship, was just one under after three days but shot an
8-under 64 Sunday and finished at 279. Rosie Jones, who had a
closing 68, and Brandie Burton, 69, finished at 280.
	   Pak, the leader after two rounds, preceded her 75 with a 74 on
Saturday. Pak had three consecutive double bogeys on Saturday, a
career first, then followed that up with her first career triple
bogey on Sunday on the par-4 6th.
	   Sorenstam has always been a contender on the 6,241-yard
(5,705-meter) Meridian Valley Country Club course.
	   She tied for sixth in 1994, her rookie year, did the same in
1995 and tied for 14th in 1996. Last year, she lost to Karrie Webb
by a stroke. Webb, the winner here the last two years, finished
with a 73 and was at 283.
	   Sorenstam's win in the dlrs 600,000 tournament gave her 15
top-10 finishes in 18 events this year.
	   Sheehan began the day with a one-stroke lead and led by two
after making a 30-foot (9- meter) birdie putt on No. 1. Sheehan
bogeyed the next hole and Sorenstam birdied No. 3 to pull even. She
went ahead for good with a birdie on No. 5, and after Sorenstam
birdied 10, Sheehan never got to within three shots.
	   Sheehan is the only three-time Safeco winner, with victories in
1982, 1990 and 1995. She led last year after three rounds before
stumbling to a final-round 75.
	   Dawn Coe-Jones had the round of the tournament with a 9-under 63
Sunday for a 284 total. Coe-Jones' round was one shy of the
tournament record set by Hollis Stacy in 1992.

Half century after Holocaust, Auschwitz still sows bitterness

<TEXT>
	   AUSCHWITZ, Poland (AP) _ Hatred and conflict never stray far
from this dismal complex of barbed wire, brown wood and red brick
that epitomizes 20th century evil.
	   The name alone, Auschwitz, resonates with the terrifying imagery
of Nazi death camps in World War II _ suffocating rail cars
clattering across Europe; shivering prisoners shot and starved, or
gassed and burned to ashes.
	   Visiting leaders who pay respects to the 1.5 million dead utter
the same simple phrase: ``Never again.''
	   But more than a half century after gunfire last echoed off the
Death Wall, the cursed ground continues to sow acrimony, even over
a symbol revered by hundreds of millions _ the cross.
	   The dispute between Roman Catholics and Jews over a eight-meter
(26-foot) cross next door to the death camp dates back a decade, an
unresolved inflammation of the deep emotional scars borne by both
sides from the war.
	   Beneath the political subplots lies a fundamental question: Is
it possible for Jews and Catholics to each honor their mutual
suffering at the most notorious Nazi death camp?
	   Jews regard Auschwitz as emblematic of Hitler's ``final
solution'' to exterminate them. The cross, they say, disturbs the
memory of the more than 1 million Jews killed at the Auschwitz and
nearby Birkenau camps and must be removed.
	   ``For the Jews and everyone outside Poland, Auschwitz is the
symbol of the shoah (Holocaust), and rightly so,'' said Stanislaw
Krajewski, a board member of the Union of Jewish Communities in
Poland and co-chairman of the Polish Council of Christians and
Jews. ``The Jewish view has to be taken into account as a major
view. ... The cross is something that is like an intrusion.''
	   But Polish Catholics don't understand that and have their own
powerful links to Auschwitz, Krajewski said.
	   Next to the destruction of Warsaw when German troops crushed the
uprising of 1944, Auschwitz is Poles' most significant symbol of
suffering under the Nazis. The camp originally was built for Polish
political prisoners, and 100,000 non-Jewish Poles died there.
	   Then there is the cross itself, erected in 1988 to commemorate
152 Poles executed at the site by the Nazis in 1941. It formed the
backdrop to Pope John Paul II's 1979 mass at Birkenau, giving it
extra significance tied to the papal visit credited with inspiring
Poles to unite against communist rule.
	   Social psychologist Zbigniew Zaleski said Poland's countless
memorials to the war dead _ from lofty monuments in town squares to
small candles and bundles of flowers along roadsides _ are solemn
gestures by its overwhelmingly Catholic population.
	   ``The most solemn expression is to put up a cross,'' he said.
``It is kind of intrinsic in the Polish soul.''
	   Passions rose anew this year when Jewish groups cited the papal
cross in refusing to sign a dlrs 93.5 million preservation plan for
Auschwitz-Birkenau negotiated with Polish authorities. They said
the cross violated earlier agreements that prohibited religious
symbols at the camp, an assertion denied by Poles.
	   Fearing the government would give in and move the cross,
conservative activist Kazimierz Switon, an author of anti-Semitic
pamphlets, began a hunger strike in June at a tent he pitched next
to the cross.
	   His campaign inspired Catholic faithful and fringe followers,
including a group of skinheads from Wroclaw, 160 kilometers (100
miles) away, to plant dozens of smaller crosses near the papal
cross. Some of the crosses are plain, while others are made of
birchwood, symbolic of protest in Poland, or hand-carved with
nameplates of supporters.
	   ``Poland has always been faithful to Christ, and that's why we
are so attached to the cross,'' the 67-year-old Switon said,
sitting outside his tent. ``We won't allow anybody to tell us where
our crosses should stay.''
	   But most people hanging around the field of crosses seem less
radical.
	   ``The huge cross should stay. Maybe the smaller ones can go,''
said Marcin Chomentowski, 62, a gap-toothed pensioner.
	   He said Birkenau, nearly 3 kilometers (two miles) down the road,
was where most Jews died.
	   ``In Birkenau, we pray for all nations,'' he said. ``We put this
cross up as a prayer for murdered Poles. We don't want to disturb
anyone's prayers.''
	   As the crosses multiplied, so did protests from Jewish groups
around the world. The Israeli government appealed to Poland's
government to intervene.
	   Polish bishops responded by accusing Jews of haranguing and
trying to dictate how Poles should honor their dead. Jews saw the
church response as Polish insensitivity, or even anti-Semitism, and
the complaints continued.
	   Church leaders softened in late August, calling for the smaller
crosses to be removed but saying the papal cross must remain.
	   ``The cross standing in a place where 152 people were executed
deserves respect as much as religious symbols of those who died in
the camp,'' the bishops said in a policy statement.
	   Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government, weakened by defections
of conservative Solidarity lawmakers over economic policies, has
been reluctant to dictate a solution that differs from the church,
which is a powerful force in Poland.
	   Even President Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former communist and
political foe of Buzek, supports keeping the papal cross.
	   During communist rule, Auschwitz was preserved as a memorial to
Poles and others Nazi victims. No religious symbols were allowed
and no special significance was given to the Jewish victims, who
accounted for the majority of the 1.5 million killed at
Auschwitz-Birkenau.
	   As the communist grip on power loosened in the 1980s, Catholics
and Jews worked separately to commemorate their suffering. Disputes
arose quickly.
	   Carmelite nuns moved next door to Auschwitz in 1984 to pray for
the dead, sparking a confrontation similar to the cross dispute.
Despite agreements with Jewish groups in 1987 and 1989, the nuns
did not leave until 1993, on orders from the Vatican.
	   A year earlier, an international campaign by Jewish groups
succeeded in getting 19 commemorative plaques at Auschwitz changed
to make clear for the first time that most victims were Jews.
	   By then the papal cross was standing at the nunnery, visible
from the Death Wall inside Auschwitz.

	   PANTHAO, Sudan (AP) _ For more than a year, the three children
followed their mother on a meandering trek seeking safety from war
and succor from the famine afflicting southern Sudan.
	   At night, they huddled together on the ground for warmth. But
this somber Thursday, the hungry youngsters woke up to find their
mother, Arak Boldut, dead.
	   She ``was cold and not breathing any more,'' said Nyanuat, at 9
the eldest of Boldut's children.
	   The 35-year-old woman died of diarrhea from months of a poor and
barely sustaining diet.
	   In many parts of the world, the diarrhea would have been easily
treated, said workers at a nearby feeding station run by the aid
group Doctors Without Borders. But 15 years of civil war and
periodic famines have overwhelmed meager medical services in this
impoverished land, and hundreds die each day from illness and
starvation, aid groups say.
	   The Boldut family left their home village of Luanyaker in
mid-1997 after poor harvests and fighting between the government
army and Sudanese rebels made life there unsustainable.
	   They hiked from village to village, helping people work their
fields and increasingly relying on handouts. But most of the people
they met along the way were in equally dire straits. The hunger got
worse.
	   The family spent several weeks sleeping on an airstrip, waiting
for a United Nations aid flight. When it finally arrived, the corn
provided was only enough to sustain mother and children for a few
weeks.
	   They moved on, slowly withering from lack of food. After
covering several hundred miles (kilometers) with her children in
tow, Boldut gave up her search for a better place and decided to go
home.
	   She fell ill near the feeding center at Panthao, about 65 miles
(100 kilometers) from home. Five days later, she was dead.
	   Health workers at the feeding center said her youngest,
18-month-old Nyariak, might be too far gone to survive, but
understaffed and poorly supplied, they could not help.
	   Hungry and confused, the orphans were now in the care of
9-year-old Nyanuat. Even before the earth had filled their mother's
shallow, unmarked grave, they headed off along a dirt track in
search of food.

Report: Millions face food shortages in Indonesia as famine looms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 17 million Indonesian families
face dire food shortages and the government is prescribing special
measures to prevent social unrest ahead of a feared famine, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Food Minister A.M. Saefuddin as saying
millions already could only afford a single daily meal and the
sprawling Southeast Asian nation could face ``paceklik'' _ a term
referring to famine before the rice harvest due in January.
	   He identified parts of the main island of Java as potential
spots for unrest along with poverty-stricken districts in the
capital, Jakarta, where many bankrupt industries have ground to a
halt, resulting in mass unemployment.
	   Rioting and looting have increased in recent weeks and a wave of
new student protests against the government started last week as
demands for lower food prices mount amid Indonesia's worst economic
crisis in 30 years.
	   Market analysts have said the price of rice has trebled for most
consumers in recent months despite market control efforts by the
government.
	   The paper reported the minister as saying that 60 percent of 7.3
million poor families in Central and Eastern Java, or 4.4 million
families, could only afford one meal a day.
	   Millions more were able to afford only two meals daily, but
their numbers were declining fast, he said.
	   ``Urban poor are especially vulnerable,'' Saefuddin said. ``In
many rural areas, people are more used to hardship and can seek
alternative ways to cope. Those who demonstrate or loot are usually
urban poor.''
	   The government has predicted that half of Indonesia's 202
million people could fall into poverty if the economic crisis
continues.
	   Longtime autocratic President Suharto was forced to quit last
May after protests and riots, partly triggered by economic
hardship, killed 1,200 people.
	   Last week his successor President B.J. Habibie was targeted by
several bold student protests. Activists demand he lower food
prices or resign.
	   Responding to such complaints the government last Thursday
announced new measures to control the price of rice under a wider
economic reform plan sponsored by the International Monetary Fund.
	   More poor families would receive rice at cheap, subsidized
prices. The state monopoly on the importation of foreign rice would
be scrapped allowing private traders to bring in supplies for the
first time in three decades.
	   Saefuddin said 400,000 tons of rice would arrive in Indonesia
and would be followed by another 1 million tons in November.
	   He said the government hoped to flood the market with rice to
bring prices down.
	   Taxes on foreign rice would be suspended. It would also offer
market prices for locally grown rice to encourage farmers holding
on to their stocks to sell.
	   Supplies of rice are down following a prolonged drought last
year and part of this year.
	   But some have also blamed hoarding as one reason for shortages
of rice, the staple food for the world's fourth most populous
nation.
	   Others accuse some traders of buying stocks of state subsidized
rice and then smuggling them to neighboring countries for sale at
higher market prices.
	   Two other Cabinet ministers last week suggested that those found
guilty of illegally manipulating rice supplies and distribution be
executed under a 1959 emergency law still on the books.
	   Saefuddin said the government's special measures would probably
be discontinued after January's harvest.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Not so fast, Mark. Slammin' Sammy may win the
race for the home run record after all.
	   Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire on Sunday, connecting twice against
the Milwaukee Brewers to raise his total to 62.
	   ``It's unbelievable. It was something that even I can't believe
I was doing,'' Sosa said following the Cubs' 11-10, 10-inning
victory. ``It can happen to two people, Mark and I.''
	   Sosa homered off Bronswell Patrick in the fifth inning, sending
an 0-1 pitch 480 feet (145 meters) into the street behind the
left-field fence at Wrigley Field. Sosa hit another 480-foot
(145-meter) homer in the ninth, a solo shot off Eric Plunk.
	   That one dropped Babe Ruth into fourth place on the
single-season list with 60, which he hit in 1927. Roger Maris hit
61 homers in 1961 for a record that McGwire broke Tuesday against
the Cubs in St. Louis.
	   Now, amazingly, a mark that had stood for 37 years has been
passed twice in less than a week.
	   With tears and sweat running down his face as he sat in the
dugout after his second triumphant tour around the bases, Sosa came
out for three emotional curtain calls. Fans littered the field with
paper cups and other debris while chanting ``Sam-mee! Sam-mee!''
causing a delay that lasted six minutes.
	   ``I have to say what I did is for the people of Chicago, for
America, for my mother, for my wife, my kids and the people I have
around me. My team. It was an emotional moment,'' Sosa said.
	   Sosa, who has four homers in his last three games, was carried
off the field after the victory, which kept the Cubs one game ahead
of the New York Mets in the NL wild-card race. He was on deck when
Mark Grace hit the game-winning homer.
	   ``It was chilling when McGwire did it. I was dumbfounded,''
Grace said. ``I thought pretty much the home run race was going to
be McGwire's. But when my buddy gets hot, he can hit them in a
hurry. And he proved that.
	   ``I just hope Sammy gets the attention he deserves. Not only has
he hit 62 homers, but he has carried us. He is without a doubt the
MVP of the National League.''
	   McGwire's Cardinals played in Houston on Sunday night and he
declined comment before the game. He and Sosa have homered 20 times
on the same day this season, feeding off the competition to set the
most hallowed record in baseball.
	   Both of Sosa's homers cleared the back fence at Wrigley Field,
sending fans scrambling for balls worth tens of thousands of
dollars to memorabilia collectors. Sosa has 10 homers this year off
Milwaukee, his most against any team.
	   After the first homer, a parade of fans raced after the ball as
it went down the street. Sosa, meanwhile, rounded the bases pumping
his fists as the sellout crowd began stamping its feet.
	   By the time Sosa struck out in the seventh, the street was
filled with fans. When he hit in the ninth with the Cubs trailing
10-8, they were chanting ``62! 62!'' _ and Sosa didn't disappoint
them.
	   Home run ball No. 62 was caught by a man in his mid-20s whose
identity was not immediately known. Police officers surrounded him
and took him to the closest station for his own protection.
	   ``We got him out of there because we thought he was going to get
his behind kicked,'' Sgt. Mary O'Toole said.
	   The man's plans for the ball were not immediately known. The fan
and groundskeeper in St. Louis who got McGwire's home run balls
Nos. 61 and 62 gave them to the slugger, who gave them to the Hall
of Fame.
	   The ball Sosa hit for No. 61 was retrieved by John Witt of
Dixon, Illinois, who stuffed it in his pocket and promised to
negotiate with him.
	   Witt was sitting in a van off Kenmore Avenue outside the
stadium, watching the game on a small TV when he saw Sosa swing. He
got out of his van and the ball bounced a couple of times and
landed at his feet.
	   ``I didn't think I had a chance,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable feeling. ... How do you know how much it's worth?''

Seoul believes North Korea failed to orbit satellite
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea believes that North
Korea's Aug. 31 firing of a rocket was an unsuccessful attempt to
put a satellite in orbit, local media reported Monday.
	   At least four local media said Washington shares Seoul's view,
adding that the United States has not found any object in Earth's
orbit that could have been launched by North Korea.
	   ``Our interim conclusion is that it was a failed attempt to
launch a satellite into orbit,'' the newspaper Dong-A Ilbo quoted
one unidentified government source as saying.
	   U.S. officials initially had said North Korea test-fired a
two-stage Taepo Dong 1 ballistic missile, but North Korea claimed
it launched a scientific satellite into orbit.
	   Dong-A and other media said the Seoul government believes that
the first-stage of the North Korean rocket fell in the Sea of Japan
and the second-stage, which overflew Japan, landed in the Pacific
Ocean.
	   The third-stage booster is believed to have landed somewhere 27
seconds after separating from the the second stage, they said.
North Korea has said the first two stages were liquid fueled, while
the third stage carried a solid propellant.
	   The U.S. intelligence may have lost the track of the third-stage
booster, because it assumed that the North was test-firing a
two-stage ballistic missile, the media quoted the source as saying.
	   Although it failed to put a satellite into orbit, the firing of
a three-stage rocket demonstrated North Korea's capability to
develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), they further
quoted the source as saying.
	   South Korean Foreign Minister Hong Soon-young said in Washington
last week that it appears the North Koreans really did launch a
satellite when they sent a rocket over Japan.
	   After meeting with U.S. congressional leaders, Hong said the
assessment came from unidentified U.S. scientists and had been
shared with South Korean and Japanese authorities.
	   After Hong's statement, Sen. Craig Thomas, a Republican from
Wyoming, offered another view on the launch, saying ``NASA believes
the launch placed a satellite _ albeit apparently a non-functioning
one _ into orbit.''
	   Kenneth Bacon, a spokesman for the Defense Department, said the
U.S. Space Command has not spotted any object that would verify
North Korean claims.

Sosa hits 61st, 62nd homers to tie McGwire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with details, quotes, info on McGwire. No pick
up &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs hit his 61st and
62nd home runs of the season Sunday to pass Roger Maris and pull
into a tie with Mark McGwire for the most homers in a single
baseball season.
	   With his 61st homer, Sosa moved ahead of Babe Ruth, who hit 60
in 1927 for the New York Yankees. Maris had 61 in 1961, also for
the Yankees.
	   The homers gave Sosa four in three games _ bringing the slugger
back into the chase with McGwire to end the season with one of
baseball's most treasured records.
	   Sosa hit No. 62 in the ninth inning off Milwaukee Brewers off
relief pitcher Eric Plunk. The Cubs won the game 11-10 in 10
innings.
	   Crying as he sat in the dugout after his triumphant tour around
the bases, Sosa came out for three emotional curtain calls as fans
littered the field while standing and chanting ``Sam-mee!
Sam-mee!'' The delay lasted six minutes.
	   ``I have to say what I did is for the people of Chicago, for
America, for my mother, for my wife, my kids and the people I have
around me. My team. It was an emotional moment,'' Sosa said.
	   In the fifth inning, Sosa hit No. 61 off reliever Bronswell
Patrick 480 feet (145 meters) into the street behind the left-field
fence at Wrigley Field.
	   Sosa rounded the bases pumping his fists as a sellout crowd at
Wrigley went wild. Once he reached home plate, Sosa got a 15-second
embrace from teammate Mark Grace.
	   Sosa went into the corner of the dugout hugging his teammates
along the way and then turned to TV cameras and made his trademark
salute _ thumping his heart, blowing kisses and making a ``V''
sign. He then mouthed ``I love you, mama,'' to a TV camera.
	   The game was being broadcast live in his native Dominican
Republic.
	   After a mad scramble, home run ball No. 62 ended up in the hands
of a man in his mid-20s whose identity was not immediately known.
Police officers surrounded him and took him to the closest station
for his own protection.
	   ``We got him out of there because we thought he was going to get
his behind kicked,'' Sgt. Mary O'Toole said.
	   The man's plans for the ball were not immediately known. The fan
and groundskeeper in St. Louis who got McGwire's home run balls
Nos. 61 and 62 gave them to the slugger, who gave them to the Hall
of Fame.
	   Sosa's 61st homer was retrieved by John Witt of Dixon, who
stuffed it in his pocket and promised to negotiate with Sosa after
the game. Witt was sitting in a van outside the stadium, watching
the game on a small television when he saw Sosa swing. The ball
landed at his feet.
	   ``I didn't think I had a chance,'' he said. ``It's an
unbelievable feeling. ... How do you know how much it's worth?''
	   McGwire, the first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals, broke
Maris' record Tuesday against the Cubs. McGwire, who had no hits in
two at-bats in the Cardinals' game at Houston, left the game after
four innings because of minor back spasms.

Japan's July current account surplus rises for 16th straight month
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Continuing its steady rise, Japan's broadest
measure of trade jumped 53.1 percent in July from a year ago, the
government announced Monday.
	   The current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal factors,
was at 1.351 trillion yen (dlrs 10.3 billion) in July, up 53.1
percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, lower than Tokyo-based economists had forecast, marked
the 16th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   As the surplus balloons, political tensions with Japan's trade
partners have heated up.
	   The Clinton administration intends to step up pressure on Japan
to open its markets in an effort to trim Japan's growing surplus,
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Friday.
	   Monday's report showed Japan's exports grew 5.9 percent to 4.4
trillion yen (dlrs 33.9 billion) in July while imports decreased
5.6 percent to 2.9 trillion yen (dlrs 22.5 billion).
	   Japan's giant manufacturers are responsible for most of the
surplus. In services trade, by contrast, Japan posted a deficit of
573.3 billion yen (dlrs 4.4 billion), in July compared with a
deficit of 591.1 billion yen (dlrs 4.5 billion) a year before.

Long-Term Credit Bank stock plunges on worries about government

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with report on changes to government rescue plan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The shares of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
plunged sharply to an all-time low Monday following a report the
government may shift more of the burden for rescuing the ailing
lender to its shareholders.
	   LTCB's stock dropped 61 percent in the first hour of trading to
19 yen (15 U.S. cents). The previous record low for the stock was
37 yen on Aug. 11. The shares quickly rebounded to 38 yen, down
from 49 yen on Friday.
	   Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest lenders, has been
plagued by speculation it may collapse under the weight of failed
real estate loans made during the late 1980s.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling Liberal Democratic party
has been trying to draft a plan to use public money to keep the
bank from going under. But progress on the necessary legislation
has been slow as Obuchi's party wrangles with opposition groups
opposed to using taxpayers' money to save a private company.
	   As a compromise, the ruling party may agree to temporarily
nationalize the bank, according to a report Sunday in the
mass-circulation newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun.
	   Under the plan, the bank's capital base would be reduced and
shareholders would bear the cost, the newspaper said.
	   ``I think the market is pricing in the fact that shares could be
worth nothing or only a small amount,'' said Stephen Wood, a senior
salesman in the foreign institutional sales department at ING
Baring Securities.
	   The Yomiuri reported LTCB would be placed temporarily under the
government's management before its healthy operations were
transferred to Sumitomo Trust and Banking, the company that
announced in June plans to take over LTCB.

Penguin guano may hold secrets of human flu, say researchers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Long-frozen samples of Antarctic
penguin guano may help unlock the origins of human flu, New Zealand
scientists said Monday.
	   A team of university researchers will analyze the droppings of
Adelie penguins as part of a project aimed at tracing the origins
of human influenza, said Peter Metcalf, project leader and
associate professor at Auckland University's School of Biological
Sciences.
	   The team will analyze the genetic makeup of a virus found in
penguin guano, Metcalf said.
	   Previous genetic research suggests human flu originated from a
large pool of virus strains in wild bird populations, he said.
	   The research could provide vital clues to potentially lethal
epidemics such as the Hong Kong bird flu outbreak.
	   Gene sequences from flu virus stored since 1933 show that the
virus causing human flu epidemics originated from bird influenza.
	   ``We believe the project will not only help explain the
evolution of influenza but may also prove useful in understanding
the causes of human flu epidemics,'' Metcalf said.
	   The researchers hope the genetic secrets of the flu virus will
be found in dung samples taken from soil beneath Adelie penguin
colonies in Antarctica.
	   ``Penguins are susceptible to influenza and feces of infected
birds are known to contain high concentrations of virus
particles,'' Metcalf said.
	   ``Because the virus is preserved at low temperatures we expect
to be able to recover some genetic information from these
colonies.''
	   As well as taking dung samples from permafrost on the Ross Ice
Shelf, the researchers will analyze throat swabs and blood samples
from live penguins which may contain influenza antibodies.
	   The scientists have been awarded a New Zealand dollars 456,000
(U.S. dlrs 233,000) government grant for the project.

Ruckwood falls in backstroke
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defending champion Adam Ruckwood
of England missed out on the men's 200-meter backstroke final by an
agonizing .01 seconds in Commonwealth Games swimming Monday.
	   Ruckwood, holder of the games record, was expecting to challenge
Canada's Mark Versfeld for the gold. The pair were the only two
Commonwealth swimmers in the event's final at this year's World
Championships in Perth.
	   ``I was an unknown four years ago, but this time I was defending
champion and everyone wanted to knock me off the top, which made it
tough out there,'' Ruckwood said.
	   Versfeld won heat 2 and qualified fastest, in 2 minutes, 1.36
seconds, while Malaysian Alex Lim was a surprising second-fastest
qualifier.
	   But the main action came in the opening heat when the top four
swimmers hit the wall within .25 seconds. Ruckwood was the last of
those, in 2:02.94, and placed ninth overall while compatriot Neil
Willey sneaked into the final with 2:02.93.
	   Michael Klim and Ian Thorpe bounced back after their world
record swims to qualify for Monday's 100-meter freestyle final.
	   ``I'm doing it a bit tough,'' said a tired Thorpe, who is
contesting the event for the first time in an international meet.
	   Klim, the world silver medalist and Commonwealth record holder,
also showed signs of wear after Sunday night's 4x200-meter relay,
where he joined Thorpe, Matt Dunn and Daniel Kowalski to break the
world record.
	   Klim won his heat while Thorpe followed in teammate Chris
Fydler, who qualified fastest in 50.05.
	   Australia's Olympic and world butterfly champion Susie O'Neill
continued her quest to become Australia's most prolific gold medal
winner, winning her 400-meter freestyle heat.
	   O'Neill has won two golds in two nights so far at the games
pool, adding the 200-meter freestyle to a relay gold.
	   She now has six golds and needs one more to equal Hayley Lewis'
record of seven by an Australian woman and three more to match
Michael Wenden's nine golds.
	   O'Neill was third-fastest qualifier after England's Vicki Horner
and Australian rookie Emily Pedrazzini. Another Australian, Julia
Greville, is way ahead of her rivals on times this year, but was
third in heat 2 and qualified fourth fastest overall.
	   Horner has a best time of 4:15.39 to Greville's 4:11.59.
	   ``It was a good heat for me,'' Horner said. ``I want to go 4:13
in the final and if that's good enough for a gold medal I'd be very
happy with that.''
	   Australian Meredith Smith was fastest through to the 100-meter
backstroke final with 1:02.92, well ahead of New Zealand's Nikki
Tanner and Australian Dyana Calub.
	   Australia heads into Monday's finals having won eight of the 10
golds on offer so far as well as four silvers and five bronzes.
England has one gold, four silver and a bronze while Canada has a
gold, two silver and three bronze medals.

Racketeer sentenced to eight months in prison for illegal payoffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese court sentenced a corporate racketeer to
eight months in prison Monday for illegally receiving about 50
million yen (dlrs 381,000) from four companies in the powerful
Mitsubishi group, a court official said.
	   The Tokyo District Court handed down the verdict to Taichiro
Otake, 56, a corporate racketeer, or ``sokaiya,'' said the
official, who spoke on the customary condition of anonymity.
	   Otake had pleaded guilty to charges of accepting the illegal
money from the four companies _ Mitsubishi Estate, Mitsubishi
Electric, Mitsubishi Motors and Asahi Glass. He has worked as a
sokaiya for over 30 years, local news media have reported.
	   Long a fixture in Japanese business circles, sokaiya threaten to
disrupt shareholders' meetings with embarrassing questions unless
company officials pay them off.
	   In February, Otake and his wife, Misao, were arrested on
suspicion they received the money from the four companies between
February 1995 and August 1997, according to the indictment.
	   The money _ in the form of fees for advertisements for
publications issued by Otake's wife _ was paid to make sure annual
shareholders' meetings went smoothly in 1995, 1996 and 1997, the
indictment said. The prosecution suspended its prosecution against
his wife.
	   Last year, dozens of executives from top Japanese finance
companies, including Nomura Securities, were arrested on charges of
providing illegal profits to sokaiya Ryuichi Koike.
	   Dealing with racketeers is illegal, but many companies in
image-conscious Japan continue to funnel large sums to them to buy
their silence.
	   Many companies have since announced they have cut ties with
sokaiya, but analysts say it is not so easy to break off relations
with racketeers.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa tied Mark McGwire for the home run
record, connecting twice to raise his total to 62 Sunday in the
Chicago Cubs' 11-10, 10-inning victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Sosa homered off Bronswell Patrick in the fifth inning and Eric
Plunk in the ninth, sending both balls onto the street behind the

three games.

kept the Cubs one game ahead of the Mets in the NL wild-card race.
 &UR; Mets 1, Expos 0
	   In Montreal, Brian McRae threw out Shane Andrews at home to end
the game and doubled in the only run. Willie Blair (5-16) and two

John Franco got three outs fir his 36th save.

plate appearances.
 &UR; Giants 4, Rockies 3
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds erased a 3-1 deficit when he hit a
three-run homer off long-time nemesis Chuck McElroy (6-4) in the
eighth inning. Bonds had been just 1-for-29 against the pitcher.
	   San Francisco, which stopped Colorado's seven-game winning
streak, remained 3 1/2 games behind Chicago in the NL wild-card
race. John Johnstone (4-5) pitched a perfect eighth, and Robb Nen
pitched the ninth for his 36th.
 &UR; Dodgers 5, Padres 4
	   In San Diego, a day after San Diego clinched the NL West, Bobby
Bonilla hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the 10th off Donne Wall

ligament in his right thumb, was the only regular in San Diego's
starting lineup and was 0-for-3.

for his 43rd save.
 &UR; Marlins 6, Braves 5
	   In Atlanta, Jesus Sanchez (7-8) struck out a career-high 10 in

eighth off Adam Butler.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 5, Reds 0
	   In Cincinnati, Andy Benes' bid to pitch Arizona's first
no-hitter was broken up with one out in the ninth on rookie Sean
Casey's single.
	   Benes (13-13), trying to pitch the first no-hitter for an
expansion team since Montreal's Bill Stoneman against Philadelphia
in 1969, allowed the one hits in 8 1-3 innings, struck out six and
walked five. Gregg Olson got the last two outs for his 28th save.
	   Jason Bere (1-2) allowed four hits in six innings, and struck
out five.
 &UR; Phillies 4, Pirates 1

Dollar edges higher, Japanese stock prices rebound moderately
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late-morning stock, bond and dollar rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rebounded strongly against the yen
Monday morning and Tokyo stocks edged higher following a rally on
Wall Street on Friday.
	   The dollar bought 132.32 yen in midmorning trading, up 1.54 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
130.82 yen Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 30.12 points,
or 0.22 percent, to close the morning session at 13,947.10. On
Friday, the Nikkei average closed down 749.05 points, or 5.12
percent, its largest drop this year in both points and percentage.
	   Friday's plunge was sparked by fears over Japan's worsening
economy and instability in global financial markets.
	   The dollar rose in early Asian trading line with a late rally on
Wall Street on Friday. But the U.S. currency swung in a wide range
Monday morning amid speculation about whether the United States
would abandon its strong dollar policy and worries stocks may
decline on Wall Street when the market opens Monday.
	   New York stocks rose Friday on reports that U.S. President Bill
Clinton had issued an emotional apology at the White House
regarding the Monica Lewinsky scandal _ and the dollar followed
stocks upward.
	   Earlier Friday, U.S. special prosecutor Kenneth Starr released a
report outlining a case for impeaching Clinton over his affair with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
	   In Tokyo, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section rose 2.08 points, or 0.19 percent, to
1,073.56. The TOPIX closed down 38.43 points, or 3.46 percent, on
Friday.
	   The stock market was buoyed by a 179.96-point gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Friday. Some investors were buying
shares they judged to be bargains after Friday's sharp fall in
Tokyo, traders said.
	   The share price of troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
temporarily plunged to a record low of 19 yen (15 U.S. cents) per
share in early trading before rebounding to 37 yen (28 cents). It
had closed Friday's trading at 49 yen (37 cents).
	   Meanwhile, the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond was steady at a yield of 0.780 percent and a price of 114.72
yen. The bond's yield had fallen to a record low 0.770 percent in
earlier trading Monday.

North Korean air force pilots fought in Vietnam War
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ More than 800 North Korean military
pilots flew Soviet-provided MiG jets against U.S. fighters in the
Vietnam War, a North Korean defector said in a published interview
Monday.
	   Lee Chul Soo, a North Korean air force captain who defected to
Seoul in a Soviet-built MiG-19 in 1996, made the claim in the
interview with the Chosun Ilbo newspaper.
	   The major national daily said it was the first confirmation of
North Korea air force pilots' participation in the Vietnam War.
	   Between 1967 and 1972, Lee said 70 North Korean pilots were sent
to Vietnam at a time on a six-month rotation to fly MiG-17 and
Mig-21 jets provided by the former Soviet Union.
	   ``It's known in the North Korean air force that 80 North Korean
pilots were killed in action, in which over 100 U.S. planes were
shot down,'' Lee said in the interview.
	   Lee also said 30 North Korean air force pilots flew MiG jets for
Egypt in the 1973 Middle East War with Israel.
	   ``They were first sent to Moscow, disguised as students going to
school there, and then to Egypt,'' he said in the interview.
	   Following his defection, Lee, 32, was commissioned as a South
Korean air force major and now instructs South Korean pilots on
North Korean fighter jet maneuvers.

Thai Medical Council upset over offensive advertisements
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Medical Council is
considering measures against hospitals using advertising it deems
offensive to promote cosmetic surgery, local media reported Monday.
	   The doctors on the council, which supervises Thailand's medical
profession, were angered over a billboard and newspaper
advertisement placed by a local hospital, the Bangkok Post
reported.
	   The ad showed a doctor holding the breasts of a popular singer
named Chen Chen who has had nine cosmetic operations including
breast implant surgery.
	   The council is expected to meet Monday to decide what action to
take about the ads, the paper said.

China, Japan seek ways to handle Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ High-level Chinese and Japanese officials met
Monday to find constructive ways to deal with the Asian financial
crisis and ease tensions over Tokyo's ailing economy,
	   The daylong talks at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation cap months of acrimony over Tokyo's inability
to turn its economy around.
	   The agenda for the talks was unclear. Chinese trade ministry and
Japanese Embassy officials confirmed the talks had begun Monday
morning, but had no further comment.
	   Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Koichi Haraguchi and Chinese
Vice Foreign Trade Minister Sun Zhenyu headed delegations of senior
trade and finance officials attending the talks.
	   For months, China has harangued Japan, its biggest trading
partner and one of its largest investors, accusing Tokyo of not
doing its part to help ease the Asian crisis.
	   Japan's slack demand for Chinese exports has hit China's economy
just as growth was flagging and state industries lay off millions
of workers to adjust to market-style reforms.
	   China's exports to Japan fell 4.3 percent in the first half of
the year from the same period last year to dlrs 13.7 billion,
according to Chinese customs statistics. Japan's first-half foreign
direct investment in China declined 30.7 percent to dlrs 1.16
billion.
	   China may not reach the government's 8 percent target for
economic growth in 1998, although the rate is robust compared with
Japan, now in an economic recession.
	   While China's and Japan's economies are deeply entwined and
their influence within Asia great, they have not found ways to
cooperate over the regional crisis.
	   President Jiang Zemin's cancellation of an official visit to
Japan last week, because of catastrophic floods in China, has
accentuated the importance of the Beijing meeting.

	   FOXBORO, Massachusetts (AP) _ Peyton Manning threw three
interceptions and fumbled _ giving him seven turnovers for the
season _ and remained winless in his two pro games as New England
rolled past Indianapolis.
	   Manning's four-year football education at Tennessee didn't keep
him from throwing two interceptions to Ty Law, one for a 59-yard
touchdown, and losing a fumble, leading to 13 points as the
Patriots (1-1) led 16-0 at halftime.
	   Any doubt they would falter faded when Drew Bledsoe, the top
pick five years earlier, threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Terry
Glenn on New England's first series of the third quarter.
	   And any inkling Manning could rally the Colts (0-2) ended when
he threw his third interception of the night, to Chris Canty, late
in the third quarter. He also threw three interceptions in his
debut, a 24-15 loss to Miami.

Rioting, looting breaks out in northern Indonesian city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of people rioted and looted
in Medan, Indonesia's third-largest city, after public transport
drivers staged a strike Monday, witnesses said.
	   Shops, mainly owned by the ethnic Chinese minority, were closed
and their owners fled when crowds gathered and threw rocks at the
windows of a shopping mall.
	   One mob broke into the mall and looted goods, mainly clothes,
witnesses.
	   Media reports said two cars were set afire in the city's main
shopping district.
	   Troops and police were deployed to quell the violence.
	   Security officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The trouble is the latest in a series of riots and protests to
flare in Indonesia as it grapples with soaring prices and mass
unemployment resulting from the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   The reason for the drivers' strike was not immediately clear.
However, they have protested before over the rising price of spare
parts for mini buses and other vehicles.
	   Medan, on the northern end of Sumatra island about 1,400
kilometers (870 miles) northwest of Jakarta, has endured several
riots and major protests in recent months.
	   As in other disturbances around the country, ethnic Chinese
shopkeepers have been targeted.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
people. But many Indonesians struggling to make ends meet resent
their success in commerce and industry and blame them for the
economic crisis.

Angry crowd attacks murder suspect in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An angry crowd in Bangkok attacked a
confessed rapist and murderer as police had him reenact his crime,
local papers reported Monday.
	   On Sunday evening, police brought Nui Mongkolchu, 20, to the
street where, according to his confession, he strangled, drowned
then raped 25-year-old Pattaporn Boonchuay two days before.
	   A crowd of more than a thousand of the victim's neighbors became
incensed during the reenactment and, outnumbering the hundred or so
police on the scene, rushed the suspect and began to assault him,
The Nation newspaper reported.
	   The paper said the victim's husband of two months was seen
kicking the suspect in the face as the crowd shouted, ``Kill him!
Kill him!''
	   One policeman suffered a head injury as the officers pulled Nui
from the crowd.
	   Police said Nui confessed he intended to rape the Pattaporn but
decided to kill her when she fought back, the paper said.
	   Thai police routinely have confessed murderers reenact their
crimes at the scene.
	   They have occasionally come under heavy criticism for the
tactic, particularly in a case two years ago where they used the
corpse of a child in the reenactment of his murder as the parents
looked on.
