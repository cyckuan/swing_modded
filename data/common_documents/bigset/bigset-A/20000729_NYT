JAPAN'S PLAN TO WIDEN WHALE HUNT PROVOKES OBJECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to fix tense in lede)  
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite strong objections, Japan plans to send its whaling fleet
into the North Pacific on Saturday to hunt sperm whales and Bryde's
whales, two rare and little-understood species, along with minke
whales, a more common variety.
</P>
<P>
   It is acting under a research program that is opposed by many
countries and by private environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   An international moratorium on commercial whaling took effect in
1986, but under a provision that allowed some killing for
scientific research, Japan began harvesting several hundred minke
whales a year. The meat has been sold to Japanese consumers, for
whom it is a delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   That effort has been criticized by many countries as commercial
whaling by another name, but the annual take of minkes was largely
tolerated by other governments because the species is abundant.
</P>
<P>
   But on Friday, Washington and London reacted with anger after
Japan said it would harvest two species that were nearly hunted to
extinction by fleets of factory ships in recent decades. President
Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain have been
prominent critics of the expanded hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly vexing to the Clinton administration was the
resumption of plans to kill sperm whales, the type immortalized in
``Moby-Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an aggressive move by Japan,'' said Rolland
Schmitten, the deputy assistant secretary of commerce for
international affairs, after a meeting with Japanese officials at
the White House. ``We let them know that we opposed this at the
highest level. These whales do not have to be killed for the
science. We were prepared to work with them on nonlethal ways to
collect the same information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese officials agreed to reduce the total harvest to 100
whales from a planned take of 160, administration officials said.
But the rarer species were not dropped from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton would consider using trade
sanctions to try to dissuade Japan from carrying out its whaling
plan. They said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright planned to
discuss the matter on a visit to Japan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Japanese Embassy in Washington issued a statement
saying the purpose was to study the diet and ecology of the
animals. The statement said sperm and Bryde's whales would be
included ``because their populations are relatively abundant and in
good condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes three weeks after the International Whaling
Commission, a 55-year-old group of former and current whaling
countries, rejected the Japanese plan to expand its scientific
whale hunt to include the new species.
</P>
<P>
   The group's scientific committee said that Japan's research plan
was flawed and that most of the data could be obtained without
killing whales.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council,
said, ``While they are technically allowed under international law
to do this, it's our view that the world is moving in one direction
in terms of conservation and Japan appears to be moving in a
different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Several private environmental groups said that while a few sperm
whales have been hunted sporadically by aboriginal groups around
the world, this would be the first large-scale harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision by Japan is a slap in the face of President
Clinton, Prime Minister Blair and many others around the world who
have been working to persuade Japan to cancel its plans,'' said
Fred O'Regan, president of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, which studies whale populations.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups said they feared that the Japanese
move could unravel a consensus that with a few exceptions had ended
large-scale whaling. Norway hunts minke whales, and Finland and
Iceland have conducted research on whaling in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mott, vice president at the World Wildlife Fund, said,
``This hints at a return to the kind of factory ship whaling that
was responsible for the near-extinction of many species of whales
in the first palce.''

INJURED GOLDSTEIN DEFAULTS TO GIMELSTOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Paul Goldstein pulled out of his quarterfinal
match against Justin Gimelstob because of tendinitis in his left
foot Friday in the Mercedes-Benz Cup at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   The match was called after just 11 minutes and Gimelstob ahead
3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's injury was the latest in a series of bad breaks for
the tournament, plagued by top-seeded Andre Agassi's withdrawal
(back injury), third-seeded Marcelo Rios' default (profanity) and
Davis Cup member Vince Spadea's bewildering withdrawal because of
``overhydration.''
</P>
<P>
   Several others bowed out before the tournament began because of
injuries or scheduling conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob, a former UCLA star, needed the extra rest after
laboring through two hours, 15 minutes and two tiebreakers to knock
off tournament favorite Mark Philippoussis in a match that ended at
10:14 p.m. Thursday. Gimelstob also played a doubles match Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Add Gimelstob: Thursday's victory over Philippoussis wasn't the
first time he's pulled off an important upset in Los Angeles. He
surprised Patrick Rafter in the 1998 quarterfinals and defeated
Agassi in the first round the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob faces Michael Chang in today's semifinal. It's the
first time this year Gimelstob has reached a final four.
</P>
<P>
   Now the name fits: ``Lucky loser'' Lionel Roux, Agassi's
replacement, had a nice run, making it all the way to Thursday's
quarterfinal against France's Arnaud Clement before falling 6-3,
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Roux, ranked 190th in the world last year, enjoyed his best
performance since reaching 1998 Australian Open, when he made the
final 16. This week he beat Taylor Dent in the first round,
followed by a victory over Jan Kroslak.
</P>
<P>
   Point of no return: Philippoussis registered a 136 mph serve
Thursday, the fastest of the tournament. Others include Dent, 135;
Wayne Ferreira 131; Scott Humphries 128 and Kevin Ullyett, 128; Bob
Bryan and Paradorn Srichaphan 127; and Lorenzo Manta, 126.

PRANKSTERS PENETRATE `BIG BROTHER'S' DEFENSES &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   STUDIO CITY, Calif. _ Bored to action by CBS' ``Big Brother,''
two budding screenwriters took matters into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson pierced the hermetically sealed
environment of CBS' reality show by simply walking up to the Studio
City soundstage and lobbing tennis balls filled with bogus
newspaper stories into the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   While the show's producers on Friday dismissed the prank as a
desperate publicity stunt, the 28-year-olds said they did it for a
laugh, to test security on the show and, well, because they were
bored with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it needed a little spice,'' said Allen, adding that
they don't need publicity since one of their scripts is already
under development at New Line Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt caused an immediate splash on the compound, where one
condition of the $500,000 contest is that participants have no
contact with the outside world - no papers, TV, radio, phones or
mail.
</P>
<P>
   The rule held until Thursday afternoon, when two of the seven
tennis balls hit their mark. Friends of the pranksters monitoring
the ``Big Brother'' Web site said one of the contestants said, ``I
think they're trying to help us,'' as the tennis balls landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you hear through a big loudspeaker, `This is
Big Brother. There's been a security breach. Put down the articles.
Tear them up immediately,''' Wilson said Friday, describing how the
scene unfurled on the show's live Internet feed that his friends
were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we felt we could get in trouble was if we hit
someone on the head with a tennis ball,'' said Wilson of Santa
Monica. ``So our friend relayed on the cell phone that they were
out of the way, so go ahead and chuck them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' publicist Diane Ekeblad said the show's
producers were considering what sort of action they could take
against Wilson and Allen. She declined to discuss what security
measures would be taken to prevent a repeat attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two yahoos mocked up what looked like (legitimate news)
articles,'' Ekeblad said, adding that the contestants saw the
articles but did not have much time to read them. ``Big Brother''
producers ``brought the contestants into the Red Room and told them
it was a hoax and took (the tennis balls) away.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mock front page article, President Clinton is said to
have ``spoken out against'' the show and its contestants,
chastising them for abandoning their families to chase fame and
fortune on television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's purported remarks were wholly made up, Wilson and
Allen admitted, as was an article that said banished ``Big
Brother'' contestant William ``Mega'' Collins had cut a rap record
with lyrics lashing out at each of the other contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Allen of Bel Air said the duo were unsure up to the last minute
whether they would toss the tennis balls and articles, which a
graphic artist friend designed to look stunningly real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we saw the articles, we knew we had to try this,'' Allen
said. ``We just thought it would be really funny if we could pull
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   With connections in the industry, Allen said he and Wilson
entered the CBS lot legitimately, using their own names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were wondering, how do they keep these people totally
isolated from information?'' Wilson said. ``If you somehow got a
fake newspaper in there, wouldn't they have to believe anything you
gave them because they have no information?''
</P>
<P>
   With a rough idea of where the yard was, they let loose with the
tennis balls from about 75 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Just for good measure, the pranksters videotaped themselves in
the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that if it didn't succeed, none of our friends
would believe we did it,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The show sealed 10 strangers in a prefabricated house, where
they are monitored around the clock by 28 cameras and 60
microphones, with the feeds carried live on the Internet and edited
down to primetime shows most nights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Every other week, two of the contestants are nominated by their
peers to be removed from the house; viewers calling a 900-telephone
number select the person who must leave.
</P>
<P>
   The last housemate remaining wins a $500,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   Since its big July 5 premiere, the show has struggled in the
ratings, especially compared to CBS' other reality show,
``Survivor,'' a summer hit that reached its all-time ratings high
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said `'Big Brother'' is boring, although its show
Wednesday, which directly followed ``Survivor,'' saw the best
ratings since its premiere.

SPARKS SET FOR BIG TEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The prelude to a possible Western Conference
Finals matchup between the Sparks and the Houston Comets takes
place today at 1 p.m. at the Compaq Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The nationally televised game pits the top two teams in the WNBA
- the Sparks (23-3) and the three-time defending WNBA champion
Comets (22-4). So far, they are the only teams in the league to
clinch a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in four years, the Sparks have the edge over
the most dominant team since the league's inception. They defeated
the Comets 90-84 and 63-58, both in Los Angeles. In the latter
game, though, Houston was without guard Cynthia Cooper, who had a
severe sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks have yet to win in the Compaq Center, where they are
0-8, including two playoff games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will show us where we are at,'' Sparks coach Michael
Cooper said. ``I think we need to compete. I don't care if we win
or lose as long as we compete on that court. We've done that so
far, so I don't know why wouldn't do that (today). We just have to
come and compete and then our play we'll take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston has enjoyed a three-day rest this week, while the Sparks
are playing their fourth game this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the league's best offensive and defensive teams meet in
this matchup. The Comets are explosive behind Sheryl Swoopes, who
leads the league in points (21.2), Cooper (fifth, 18.2) and Tina
Thompson (11th, 16.5, 7.1 rebounds). Lisa Leslie (17.5 points, 9.8
rebounds), Mwadi Mabika (12.9 points, 5.8 rebounds), DeLisha Milton
(11.7 points, 5.8 rebounds) and Tamecka Dixon (10.5) are the
Sparks' leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This is the beginning of a six-road game trip for the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a good test for us,'' Sparks forward DeLisha
Milton said. ``They are definitely going to get us ready for
everyone else we have to play. Playing a team like Houston makes
you get energized right away from the sound of their name. Once you
walk into their arena and you hear everybody say, 'Beat L.A.' that
should energize you right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough if you let it get to you. If you're focused and
focused on what your game plan is, sometimes you can be so focused
you won't hear it. But if you're out there and letting little snide
comments that people make get into your head affect you, then the
outcome of the game is in the air then.''

much larger themes that, far from being dated or quaint, have lost
none of their urgency. Trilling during a news conference as

</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Rep. James Hobson Morrison, a populist Democrat who
represented southeastern Louisiana in Congress from 1943 to 1967,
died on July 20 in his native Hammond, La. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer, he was elected to the House from Louisiana's 6th
District, which included the state capital, Baton Rouge. Within
days of taking the oath of office, he quit his five committee
assignments because they dealt with coinage and war claims rather
than with the agricultural concerns of his district.
</P>
<P>
   He was known for channeling federal highway construction money
to his district. A moderate on racial issues, he was one of the few
Southerners to support the Kennedy administration's effort in 1962
to enlarge the the pivotal House Rules Committee, to dilute the
power of segregationists.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, he supported the Voting Rights Act, intended to
enfranchise blacks in the South. His stance cost him a year later
when he lost the Democratic primary to a segregationist, Judge John
R. Rarick, who went on to win the election.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, a 1934 law graduate of Tulane University, returned to
his practice in Hammond, which he maintained until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison raised money for Southeastern Louisiana University and
steered federal contracts to its campus in Hammond.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his wife of 60 years, Marjorie Abbey
Morrison; two sons, James Jr., of Hammond, and Benjamin, of New
Orleans; and two grandchildren.

 (ATTN: Fla.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred Lawrence Guiles, a biographer of Hollywood movie stars, was
found dead on June 24 at his home in Gainesville, Fla. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Among Guiles' best-selling books was his 1969 ``Norma Jean: The
Life of Marilyn Monroe,'' which was translated into 14 languages.
The book became the center of a dispute in 1973 when its publisher
accused Norman Mailer of having plagiarized portions of it and of
another Monroe biography in writing ``Marilyn,'' his own book about
the actress. Mailer and Guiles jointly refuted the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Guiles' play, ``Song for a Certain Midnight,'' was produced off
Broadway in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the author of ``Marion Davies'' and ``Tyrone Power,
the Last Idol'' and published another version of his Monroe
biography, ``Legend: The Life and Death of Marilyn Monroe,'' in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Guiles is survived by a sister, Nadine G. Jackson of
Quarryville, Pa.

FRANK WHEAT, 79, SECURITIES LAWYER AND ENVIRONMENTALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Wash.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Wheat, a securities lawyer who became a member of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and also a tireless battler
against despoilment of California's deserts, died on July 21 in Los
Angeles. He was 79 and lived in nearby San Marino.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat was a retired senior partner in Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher,
an international law firm based in Los Angeles. His career there
lasted from 1948 to 1989, interrupted twice for leaves, first for
his service on the SEC during the Johnson administration and then
again in the early 1970s, when he helped revamp the rule-making
machinery for public accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat was the author of ``California Desert Miracle: The Fight
for Desert Parks and Wilderness'' (Sunbelt Publications, 1999). It
chronicled 27 years of environmentalists' campaigning to persuade
Congress to pass the California Desert Protection Act. The
legislation, signed into law by President Clinton in 1994, protects
the Mojave Desert as a wilderness and added substantially to the
Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Parks.
</P>
<P>
   The book minced no words in describing the effects that strip
mining, illicit hunting and motorcycle racing had on the desert.
But it also offered some lighter touches, for example the tale of
five baby desert tortoises of a threatened species that were to be
flown to Washington in a box not long before the bill was taken up:
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets cannot be taken on flights,'' an American Airlines
attendant objected.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not pets,'' their keeper told her. ``These are
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the baby lobbyists made their flight and, once in
Washington, secured several new sponsors for the bill. The
airline's president even refunded the extra $200 it had taken to
fly them there.
</P>
<P>
   Long before joining the campaign for the bill, Wheat, a mountain
climber, had written many articles testifying to his love of the
outdoors. Once he did join the campaign, in the 1980s, he raised
money, sat on coordinating committees and used all the influence he
had acquired in Washington. Former Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, a friend and fellow lawyer in Los Angeles, once said
that Wheat ``does not just lend his name to causes, he puts his
shoulder to the wheel and pushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheat was also founding president of the Alliance for Children's
Rights, a founder and trustee of the Earthjustice Legal Defense
Fund, a founder and past co-chairman of the California Commission
on Campaign Financing and an early supporter of the California
Citizens Budget Commission. He was a former board member of the
Center for Law in the Public Interest, which established a
fellowship in his name to train young lawyers in public-interest
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Millspaugh Wheat, a native of Los Angeles, graduated Phi
Beta Kappa from Pomona College in 1942 and cum laude from Harvard
Law School in 1948. In between, he served in the Navy as a
lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the five-member SEC by President Lyndon B.
Johnson in 1964 and remained until 1969. Two years later, at the
request of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
he agreed to head a special panel to study changes in how
accounting standards were set. The resulting Wheat Report of 1972
prompted the institute to replace its unpaid Accounting Principles
Board with a Financial Accounting Standards Board of paid members.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat is survived by his wife of 55 years, Nancy Warner Wheat;
three sons, Douglas L., of Colorado Springs, Colo., Carl I., of
Ventura, Calif., and Gordon W., of Olympia, Wash.; a brother, Dr.
Richard P., of Los Altos, Calif.; and seven grandchildren.

GOOD START, BAD FINISH FOR YANKEES IN 5-4 LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Denny Neagle pitched Friday night in a style with
which the Yankees have grown accustomed. Mariano Rivera did not.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle walked off the field with the Yankees leading, 4-2, in
the eighth, but Rivera allowed back-to-back singles to score the
tying and go-ahead runs with two out, and Minnesota prevailed, 5-4.
David Ortiz tied the game with a two-run single, and Jay Canizaro
drove in the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle allowed just three hits in seven-plus innings. Jorge
Posada and Tino Martinez, both fighting slumps, fueled the offense
before the lead was blown: Posada had two doubles and his 17th
homer, and Martinez had three hits, scored one run and drove in
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led, 4-2, when Midre Cummings pinch-hit to begin the
bottom of the eighth; interestingly, Cummings was traded with
Neagle from Minnesota to Pittsburgh in 1992. Neagle walked Cummings
and walked Denny Hocking, on close pitches. After Neagle was
relieved by the Yankees manager Joe Torre, Neagle stalked off the
mound screaming out of the side of his mouth at the home plate
umpire Chuck Merwether, his head aimed straight ahead at the
dugout, until he shot one withering glance at the ump.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton took over, and Cristian Guzman pushed a ball down
the first base line, where Martinez had a decision: he could either
tag Guzman to get the first out of the inning and concede the
advancement of the runners, or he could let it roll in the hope it
went foul. Martinez opted for the latter, the ball rolled foul, and
Stanton whiffed Guzman and then Matt Lawton.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson relieved Stanton and walked Coomer, after Coomer
fouled three pitches with a full count. Rivera took over, and Ortiz
rolled a two-run single through the middle, two runners scoring to
tie the game, before Canizaro pulled a single to right, driving
home Coomer with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle began his career in the Minnesota organization, making a
handful of major league appearances before he was traded to
Pittsburgh in 1992. But his changeup, his most effective pitch, has
deeper ties to the Twins than he does. While watching the 1987
World Series as a teenager, Neagle saw how Frank Viola gripped his
changeup, with the ball buried deep in his palm and the tips of his
thumb and forefinger touching: A circle change, it is called, and
Neagle was fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   He adapting the pitch for his own use, and a few years later
Neagle was pitching in Double-A when a couple approached him, the
parents of Frank Viola, and Viola's father complimented Neagle and
commented how closely his style resembled that of his son; Neagle
was overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   He overwhelmed the Twins early Friday night, using his typical
pattern, throwing fastballs and changeups, the Minnesota batters
seemingly caught guessing somewhere in between, hitting popups and
easy fly balls. Neagle retired the first nine batters in order, and
Jorge Posada's solo homer in the second gave the Yankees a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Hocking topped a ground single to lead off the fourth
inning. Guzman, who spent part of his afternoon batting practice
trying to direct line drives at a bucket moved around the infield,
reached out and served a line drive into the right-center field
gap, to score Hocking.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle walked Lawton, snapping his glove at the return throw
from Posada after delivering ball four. Two ground balls sent
Guzman home, pushing Minnesota ahead, 2-1. When Canizaro attempted
to bunt with two outs, fouling off the ball, Neagle's temper
appeared to flair. He fired a fastball high and inside, pushing
Canizaro back from the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez opened the sixth inning by smashing a single, and when
Jorge Posada ripped a double, Martinez was waved around third, in
an attempt to score with nobody out. The throw actually beat
Martinez to the plate, but the catcher Chad Moeller fumbled the
ball, and Martinez slid across home safely with the tying run;
Posada took third. Radke retired the next two hitters, holding
Posada at the bag.
</P>
<P>
   But Chuck Knoblauch, who will be booed here forever because he
forced his trade from the Twins after the 1997 season, smacked a
single, and the Yankees moved ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added a run in the top of the seventh, when Martinez
pulled a double into right-center field, pushing across David
Justice.

CHENEY HAD ANSWERS FOR SIMILAR HEALTH QUESTIONS IN PAST
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLA MARINUCCI and JOHN WILDERMUTHc.2000 San Francisco &LR; 
 &UR; Chronicle &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dick Cheney's first congressional campaign in Wyoming, in 1977,
had just about all the drama anybody could want _ the candidate had
the first of three heart attacks in the middle of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Francisco ad man who handled all of Cheney's
congressional races said Bush's choice for vice president decided
to deal with it head-on. Cheney, who was taken off the campaign
trail for a month after the experience _ a lifetime in politics _
agreed to an ad in which he talked face-to-face with voters about
his health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second spot, which shows Cheney sitting cross-legged in a
park with followers, gives more than a clue as to how he will deal
with the attacks on his poor health and his politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having had a mild heart attack really led me to pause and
reflect,'' Cheney said in the ad. But he added that the feeling of
``wanting to do something beyond your own self interest'' drove him
to continue the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then he delivered a history lesson: He was not the first
politician to have a heart attack, he said. And despite theirs,
Eisenhower and LBJ showed their stuff afterward as proven leaders.
``I expect to become one of those,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gardner, who heads the San Francisco ad agency of Gardner,
Geary and Coll, and a friend of the former defense secretary for
more than 20 years, called that evidence of the tough campaigner
Cheney will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is extremely smart, almost intellectual, an avid reader and
thinker _ not a motor mouth,'' said Gardner, whose agency has also
done work for Diamond Walnuts, Delta Dental and The Chronicle.
``Probably the most solid person I've ever met. He inspires
confidence and judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gardner, who also shaped ad campaigns for President Gerald
Ford, says experience assures him that Cheney knows how to weather
the current attacks on his politics and persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very calm, logical guy. People will see that he's not a
hysterical right-winger or a bomb thrower,'' Gardner said. ``Of any
of the politicians I've met, he's the most comfortable in his own
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those qualities are the very ones Cheney sold to voters
in his early races when, fresh from his stint as Ford's chief of
staff, he was tabbed as nothing more than a carpetbagger by some
political opponents. They charged that the young whippersnapper
from inside the Beltway was trying to pretend he was a Wyomingite.
</P>
<P>
   Those first ads in 1978 attempted to answer those criticisms and
sell an earnest (and yes, thinner) Cheney with a heavy dose of
hometown appeal. There was the high school teacher recalling how
Cheney was a first-string football player, and his wife, Lynn, was
homecoming queen. He was depicted proudly as a native son, a man
who achieved much at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after Cheney was elected a few times, the themes changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't much like Washington telling us how to run our
affairs,'' the voice-over intones, as panoramic photographs of the
Grand Tetons hit the screen. Cheney was described as ``a leader who
gets things done _ Wyoming's best.''
</P>
<P>
   But, proving that there is nothing in politics that hasn't been
tried before, a spot called ``Rope Trick'' takes an interesting
tack _ particularly given that the top of the 2000 Republican
ticket, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has been accused of having a
thin resume in areas like foreign policy and military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get the job done, you've got to know the
ropes,'' the announcer intones, as Cheney is seen sitting with his
daughters, entertaining them with rope tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Voters need a political leader, the voice says, ``who's had
experience _ not an amateur getting tied up in on-the-job
training.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nip-and-tuck contest to win Silicon Valley's
congressional seat that Republican Tom Campbell is surrendering.
Democrat Mike Honda and Republican Jim Cunneen have already raised
a combined $1.5 million, which is a good chunk of money to capture
a job that pays $141,300 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But that number is chump change compared with the cash that has
being tossed around in three Southern California races.
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, incumbent Republican Rep. Jim Rogan has raised $4.6
million, while his Democratic opponent, Adam Schiff, has collected
$2.9 million. That combined $7.5 million is just short of the
all-time record for most-expensive race for a House seat, the
nearly $8 million that then-GOP Speaker Newt Gingrich and Michael
Coles spent in Georgia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rogan-Schiff figures are only through June 30, which
leaves plenty of time to take political spending to breathtaking
new heights.
</P>
<P>
   There is also plenty of money being spent a little farther
south, where GOP incumbent Rep. Steve Kuykendall and Democrat Jane
Harman are dueling in the Torrance area. Kuykendall has raised $1.1
million, while Harman, who surrendered the seat to make an
unsuccessful run for governor in 1998, has gathered $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego County features another million-dollar race, where
Republican Rep. Brian Bilbray and Democratic Assemblywoman Susan
Davis have collected about $1.2 million each.
</P>
<P>
   With control of the House up for grabs, Democrats are looking to
pick up most of the seven seats they need right in California,
while Republicans want to hang on to what they have. That means the
campaign money tap is not going to be turned off anytime soon.

APPEALS COURT JUDGE FAVORED AS QUACKENBUSH SUCCESSOR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SACRAMENTO _ Gov. Gray Davis will name a successor to former
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush on Monday, and speculation
is focused on a retired San Francisco Court of Appeals judge.
<P>
   Retired Court of Appeal Justice Harry Low heads San Francisco's
Human Rights Commission, is a close politically ally of Mayor
Willie Brown, and would put an Asian American into a prominent
statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will make up his mind over the weekend and a press
conference is planned for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Low, who has strong ties to San Francisco, received praise
Friday as someone who could return respectability to the tarnished
insurance commissioner post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think he is absolutely what the governor would be
looking for in an interim appointment,'' said Senate President Pro
Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, who said he has known Low for a
long time. ``His reputation is beyond reproach, he is probably not
interested in running for political office, he is highly respected,
and he has tremendous recognition in the Asian community.''
</P>
<P>
   Low did not return phone calls Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned under pressure June 28 and since then Clark
Kelso, a law professor at Sacramento's McGeorge School of Law has
been acting commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' pick will have to be confirmed by both houses of the
Legislature when it returns to Sacramento on August 7. If
confirmed, the successor will serve out the remainder of
Quackenbush's term, which ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said he does not want to appoint someone political to
the office, saying he would prefer to name a person who does not
raise money from the industry.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Supervisor Michael Yaki, who was a clerk for Low
in 1986-87 after graduating from law school, said Low understands
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very politically connected, but at the same time is not
seen as beholden to any one interest group,'' Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
   Yaki also said it would be ``extremely important'' to have an
Asian American in one of the constitutional officer posts.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield said he is worried Low's
legal background will make him less aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want someone who is going to be an aggressive advocate for
consumers, not neutral,'' said Rosenfield, who is president of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``When someone is
neutral, the insurance companies win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield also expressed concern about Low's current work as an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where big litigants so to settle out of court,'' he said.
``We need to know if he's handled any arbitration involving big
insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Low's biography on Judicial Arbitration &AMP; Mediation Services,
Inc. web site says he has handled a wide variety of cases,
including ``mediated insurance coverage cases involving
construction costs, business ventures and tort coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to serving on the Human Rights Commission, Low is
the former president of San Francisco Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Low's involvement in state government dates to the 1950s when he
was a deputy attorney general under Attorney General Edmund ``Pat''
Brown Sr. As governor Brown, a Democrat, named Low to the Municipal
Court in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ronald Reagan, a Republican, named Low to the Superior
Court, and Gov. Jerry Brown elevated him to the state Court of
Appeal in San Francisco in 1982. He retired in 1992.

APPEALS COURT GRANTS NAPSTER A REPRIEVE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ The music will play on for Napster and its
millions of fans following a surprising reprieve by a federal
appeals court in San Francisco Friday.
<P>
   Two U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judges granted a temporary
stay of a lower court's preliminary injunction that would have
silenced the San Mateo startup at midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
   And because court proceedings do not move as fast as the
Internet, the stay gives Napster users until at least mid-September
to download as many free MP3 songs as they want. That's the
earliest a hearing on the appeal can be scheduled, ``We're happy
and we're grateful that the Court of Appeals is going to allow the
company to keep operating,'' said an upbeat Hank Barry, Napster's
interim CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Record industry executives, who earlier this week thought they
had all but vanquished a company they considered a mortal threat to
their businesses, were chagrined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, of course, that the tens of millions of
daily infringements occurring on Napster will be able to continue,
at least temporarily,'' said Hilary Rosen, president of the
Recording Industry Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, since the district court issued its order, the
illegal downloading of copyrighted music openly encouraged by
Napster has probably exceeded all previous records,'' Rosen said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The stay, capped a wild week in the landmark battle pitting the
established entertainment industries, which are trying to protect
their copyrights and profits, and a rapidly growing grassroots
Internet community that claimed Napster and similar technology put
the power of music in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on relaxing to the sweet sounds of my downloaded MP3's
knowing that I, not the government, own what's on my hard drive,''
said Hagop Kaneboughazian.cocq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The 20-year-old Berkeley resident, who goes by the name
``Kane,'' launched a Web site,
 &UR; www.flyingmiko.comsupportnapster.htm,  &LR; to promote a two-week
boycott of record stores. He also posted fliers calling for a
demonstration Saturday outside a Tower Records store, but said the
stay gives him more time to organize the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, meanwhile, called on its supporters to honor a
``buy-cott weekend'' by purchasing CDs made by a list of
Napster-supporting bands and musicians like Chuck D, Limp Bizkit
and The Offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Another Web site that posted an electronic petition to save
Napster registered more than 50,000 signatures, twice as many as a
previous petition to send 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Napster is a computer program originally written by a
19-year-old college student who wanted an easy way to share
MP3-formated songs on his computer with his friends. The program
can search for songs on other Napster members' computer hard
drives, and then link those computers via the Internet so that the
music can be copied.
</P>
<P>
   The company says more than 20 million copies of Napster have
been downloaded since its release in August 1999 as a beta, or
unfinished version. The final version of the program is still in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the RIAA, which include the biggest U.S. record
labels like Sony Music and Warner Music Group, sued Napster last
December, claiming the program allows rampant piracy of
copyright-protected songs. The record companies say Napster has
already cost them $300 million in lost sales and will undermine the
industry if left unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Hall Patel said
there was a strong likelihood the record industry would prove its
case against Napster in a trial. She issued a preliminary
injunction scheduled to take effect at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   She ordered Napster to stop infringing on songs owned by RIAA
members. Napster appealed Patel's order on grounds the injunction
was tantamount to a death sentence because the Napster program
cannot distinguish between legally and illegally copied songs.
</P>
<P>
   The RIAA, meanwhile, protested the Napster's appeal, claiming
the company was overstating the injunction's effect because it
could still maintain its online operations.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page decision, Circuit Court Judges Alex Kozinski and
Barry G. Silverman agreed that Napster ``raised substantial
questions ... going to both the merits and the form of the
injunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no further explanation, the order indicates
the judges believe there are both precedent-setting legal issues to
be resolved as well as questions about whether Patel made her
injunction too broad, said Jim Burger, an intellectual rights
attorney with the Washington, D.C. firm Dow, Lohnes &AMP; Albertson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real setback for the music industry,'' Burger said.
``They were jubilant over Judge Patel's order, but this will set
them back on their heels a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court gave Napster attorneys an Aug. 18 deadline to
file an opening brief to fight Patel's preliminary injunction. The
recording industry's response is due on Sept. 8. Napster would have
until Sept. 12 to file an optional reply.
</P>
<P>
   That means Napster will remain operating until at least Sept. 8,
and more likely until after Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the court is moving faster than normal because such
appeals usually take at least one year to be heard, said Napster
attorney Daniel Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over til the fat lady sings and she hasn't sung
yet,'' wrote a fan with the screen name Merlin 420 on an online
bulletin board at Napstermaina.com. ``The people may be small, but
together we HAVE the power ... Three cheers for Napster.''

 HEARST COMPLETES TRANSFER OF FLAGSHIP NEWSPAPER TO S.F. FAMILY  &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. announced Friday that it has completed the
transfer of the San Francisco Examiner to the Fang family,
publishers of the thrice-weekly Independent, concluding the final
transaction in the company's nerve-racking yearlong attempt to
purchase The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement means that Hearst will continue to operate the
Examiner for a 120-day transition period before turning the
venerable flagship of the once far-flung Hearst newspaper empire
over to the Fangs at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the staffs of both papers _ the Examiner's 217
reporters and editors and the Chronicle's 378 editorial employees _
are expected to merge newsrooms under The Chronicle masthead.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker ruled on Thursday that
Hearst's $660 million purchase of The Chronicle did not violate
antitrust laws, and the Chronicle acquisition was completed with
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst chief executive Frank Bennack Jr. met with the editors of
The Chronicle and Examiner for 45 minutes Friday to tell them that
the two transactions had been effectively completed.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said the Hearst Corp. had a ``binding contract'' to give
the Examiner to the Fangs and said the company intended to honor
that agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He told the assembled news executives that he expected the new
Chronicle, with the combined staffs, to compare favorably to great
U.S. newspapers like the New York Times, the Washington Post, Los
Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   He promised that there would be ``a quantum leap in resources''
to make The Chronicle such a paper.
</P>
<P>
   A publisher of the new Hearst-owned Chronicle would be appointed
shortly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack also indicated that Hearst had reached an agreement with
former political consultant Clint Reilly, the millionaire real
estate investor who had sued to block the sale of The Chronicle.
The agreement included paying Reilly $2.5 million for attorney's
fees and costs and in return Reilly agreed that he would not appeal
Walker's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's attorney, Joseph M. Alioto, explained Friday why Reilly
was willing to end his legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not give Clint any certainty as to how much time an
appeal would take and what the Ninth Circuit (court of appeals)
would do,'' Alioto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in light of that and what Hearst was willing to pay to
cover attorneys' fees and costs,'' he said, ``Clint decided he
would not pursue the case any further.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Examiner transaction could still be sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned with some of the comments in Walker's ruling, Hearst
attorney's and executives pored over the decision Friday and
discussed their options with Fang's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Walker virtually invited a lawsuit by newspaper
competitors or advertisers challenging the Fang transaction on
antitrust grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Walker approved the Hearst purchase of The Chronicle,
he had harsh words for the Fang deal, calling it ``malodorous''
because of the political pressure exerted on the U.S. Justice
Department and Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's $66 million subsidy to the Fangs to operate the
Examiner for three years, the judge said, ``would appear to create
a barrier to entry by nonsubsidized competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker also said ``an artificially strong Examiner ... would
impair the ability of established participants to compete in that
localized market.''
</P>
<P>
   One potential competitor, the SF Weekly, said Friday that the
paper's lawyers and business staff would have to look at the issue
closely over the next few weeks before any decision about a lawsuit
is made.
</P>
<P>
   Editor John Mecklin said that the Fang deal was clearly
anti-competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more, it's insane,'' Mecklin said.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Bay Guardian, another potential Examiner
competitor, said he has no intention of suing. Publisher Bruce
Brugmann said: ``I don't give a damn about the Fang deal. I can
take competition. The crime here is that the judge is allowing
Hearst to kill an afternoon newspaper and impose a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker had savaged the Justice Department in his ruling,
accusing the government lawyers of engaging in ``political
favoritism masquerading as law enforcement '' for caving in to
political pressure in their decision to investigate the Hearst
takeover of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the department called the judge's allegations
``completely unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An experienced team of Department of Justice career attorneys
and economists conducted a thorough investigation of this case,''
said department spokeswomen Gina Talamona. ``The department's
actions were based solely on the facts and the law. Politics played
absolutely no role in this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, who will be the new publisher of the Examiner, said
Friday that his family is ``proud to be the first Asian American
family ever to own a daily newspaper in a major metropolitan
city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department has spoken,'' he said. ``The courts
have ruled. Let the competition begin.''

   William Simon, who influenced the study of human sexuality
through his application of sociological methods and his rejection
of traditional ideas of normal behavior, died on July 21 in
Houston. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who once worked at the Kinsey Institute for Social
Research and wrote numerous books and papers about sexuality,
brought a postmodernist sensibility to a field long bound by
historical assumptions. His view was that there are no fixed points
in the geography of sexuality, merely an ever-changing terrain that
has less to do with biology than with accidents of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important truth about sexuality is that there may be
no important truths about sexuality that are permanent,'' he wrote
in his last book, ``Postmodern Sexualities'' (Routledge, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Simon, a professor of sociology at the
University of Houston, was an advocate for a much broader
acceptance of differing sexual behaviors. He was an early advocate
of gay rights and testified against obscenity laws. He was willing
to defend depictions of the most extreme forms of sexual activity,
as long as they were consensual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed so fundamental to him that the sexual was
quintessentially an area of expressive, meaningful communication,''
said Simon's son Jonathan, a law professor at the University of
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing recurring scenes in romance novels popular with women
in which female characters are forced to have sex, Simon once told
The Houston Chronicle that the power of fantasy lay in the barrier
between it and real life. ``The kinds of things ordinary people
think about while having sexual intercourse are likely to make a
monkey's hair stand up straight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his better-known books was ``Sexual Conduct,'' published
in 1969 and written with his longtime collaborator, John H. Gagnon.
It has been described as the first work to take a rigorous,
procedurally sound sociological look at sex, rather than a
biological or psychological one. He and Gagnon also wrote ``The
Sexual Scene'' and ``Sexual Outlaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Julia A. Ericksen, a sociology professor at Temple University,
said the strength of Simon's work was his use of carefully weighted
research into sexuality, in which he sought out random samples of
people instead of relying on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   If Simon took a decidedly nontraditional approach to his field,
it may have been because he arrived there by such a nontraditional
route.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on July 20, 1930, in New York, the son of Russian
immigrants, Morris and Yetta Simon, and spent his first 10 years in
New York. His father, a supermarket clerk, moved the family to
Detroit in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was in second grade, his teachers were summoning
his parents to complain that the boy would not keep still, and that
he persisted in questioning their authority. By age 13, according
to his family, William Simon was protesting a meeting of the
isolationist America First movement, catching the attention of the
Independent Socialist Alliance, a Trotskyite group, for which he
began organizing young workers in the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   William dropped out of school in the eighth grade and, using
false identification, took a job as an assembly-line worker. At 16,
he went to West Virginia to organize mine workers, said Russell L.
Curtis Jr., a colleague at the University of Houston. At 17, he
married a fellow socialist, Bernice Stark; they were later
divorced, and she died in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would simply run away,'' said Simon's brother Myron, an
English professor at the University of California at Irvine. ``If
he had 5 bucks, he might simply have grabbed a Greyhound and headed
south.'' His family reacted ``mostly with astonishment,'' Myron
Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 19, while he was working as a keypunch operator,
William was provisionally accepted at the University of Michigan at
Ann Arbor with the help of Myron, who was a student there. A year
later, he ran out of money and dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   He later re-entered the university, and although once again he
did not graduate, he so impressed faculty members at the University
of Chicago that they invited him to study sociology in the graduate
program. After earning his doctorate, Simon taught at Southern
Illinois University, the University of Indiana at Bloomington
(where he worked at the Kinsey Institute, and began his first work
in sexuality) and finally, in 1975, at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jonathan and Myron, Simon is survived by his
third wife, Lynn Randolph of Houston, a painter; a son from his
first marriage, Marc David Simon of El Cerrito, Calif.; a son from
his second marriage (to Marlene Bragman, Jonathan's mother, from
whom he was divorced), Adam Simon of Santa Monica, Calif; two
stepsons, Cean Randolph of Olympia, Wash., and Grayson Randolph of
Austin, Texas; another brother, Sidney, of Detroit; and two
sisters, Barbara Hollander of Chicago and Miriam Waren of Hartford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Friends recalled that though Simon managed to earn a doctorate
without having graduated from high school or college, the omissions
weighed on him a bit as he toiled on his Ph.D. thesis in Chicago.
``I've got to finish this degree,'' Gagnon recalled his friend
saying. ``If I don't finish my degree, I've got no diplomas at
all.''

AHMAD SHAMLU, 74, IRANIAN POET AND DISSIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ahmad Shamlu, a noted Iranian poet with a free-flowing style who
was both at odds with the Iranian monarchy and disappointed with
the Islamic movement that ousted it, died on Sunday in a Tehran
hospital. He was 74 and lived near Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   He had long been ill, Iran's official news agency, IRNA,
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Shamlu was a longtime advocate of greater political freedom;
some of his writings were banned both before and after the shah of
Iran was overthrown in 1979 in the Iranian revolution.
</P>
<P>
   As a writer put it in a 1979 volume of the multivolume reference
work ``Contemporary Literary Criticism,'' Shamlu's poetry, ``noted
for its linguistic experimentalism and grand imagery, reveals his
commitment to freedom of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   He was given a Freedom of Expression award by Human Rights
Watch, based in New York, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After his death became known, a radio station in Tehran called
him Iran's greatest poet and began broadcasting poems by him.
</P>
<P>
   He was indeed considered his country's greatest modern poet by
admirers. Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak, a scholar of Persian language and
literature, called him ``the leading Iranian poet'' in an essay
published in 1977, two years before the shah was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Shamlu ``has come more and more to view poetry as a mirror which
the thinking poet, in an uncertain world, holds up to his own
soul,'' Karimi-Hakkak, who now teaches at the University of
Washington, wrote. ``The sweeping energy of the young dreamer has
gradually subsided into the brooding pessimism of the white-haired
poet who knows _ or believes he knows _ that change will come only
if thought accompanies action. His struggle, like that of his
countrymen, now goes on below the surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Karimi-Hakkak quoted these lines from Shamlu's poem ``Poetry
That Is Life'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The subject of poets of yesteryear
</P>
<P>
   was not of life. ...
</P>
<P>
   Today the theme of poetry is a different thing.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry today is the weapon of the masses.
</P>
<P>
   For poets themselves
</P>
<P>
   are branches from the forest of the masses,
</P>
<P>
   not jasmines and hyacinths of someone's
</P>
<P>
   greenhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamlu caused a stir in Iran's literary world in 1956 with his
poem ``The Fairies,'' which contains these lines:
</P>
<P>
   ``The slaves gather, torch in hand
</P>
<P>
   to burn the night off our land,
</P>
<P>
   to force the chain-maker out,
</P>
<P>
   chain him, drag him all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In those lines, Karimi-Hakkak wrote, the poet ``assumes a degree
of historical specificity that no one slightly familiar with the
contemporary history of Iran can fail to interpret as the prophecy
of an imminent revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Iranian revolution, Shamlu's poetry was popular with
young people, but his advocacy of more freedom led to repeated
arrests and jailings, and he departed Iran voluntarily in 1977 for
exile in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He returned in 1979, after the revolution, but he distanced
himself from his disappointment with the new Islamic regime's
authoritarianism (against which he spoke out) by concentrating on
writing love poetry. And he spent his later years mostly in purely
literary pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing poetry, he was also a translator, critic and
author of books for young people, and one of Iran's foremost
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Tehran and earned a literary reputation before
entering his 20s. As a young man he acquired a love of classical
music, but he was too poor to take up a career in music.
</P>
<P>
   He married three times and had four children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his worldly concerns and troubles, he could strike a
lyric note, as he did in these lines:
</P>
<P>
   ``At night,
</P>
<P>
   When the silver moonstream
</P>
<P>
   makes a lake of limitless plain,
</P>
<P>
   I spread the sails of my thoughts
</P>
<P>
   in the path of the wind.''

UTILITY ARGUES FOR RESTARTING NUCLEAR PLANT WITH OLD GENERATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ore.)  By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. _ Despite mounting criticism of its inspection
procedures, Con Ed on Friday renewed its assertions that the Indian
Point 2 power plant could be safely restarted with its existing
steam generators and ran heat and pressure tests in preparation for
the restart.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed engineers elaborately defended their inspection
procedures with charts and numbers during a five-hour public
meeting with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at the plant site,
35 miles north of New York City. Last week, the commission sent a
letter to plant managers requiring further extensive analysis of
the steam generators before it could be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   The commission delivered another blow Friday in a second letter
that cited Con Ed's lax inspection of the steam generators in 1997
as a contributing factor in the Feb. 15 leak of radioactive steam
that shut down the plant. In that leak, a tiny amount of
radioactive steam escaped after a tube carrying superheated
radioactive water cracked from corrosion. No injuries were
reported, but the accident was the worst in the 26-year history of
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Local government officials, advocacy groups and others have
petitioned the nuclear commission to demand that Indian Point 2
remain closed until the new generators are installed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Con Ed officials have promised to replace the plant's
aging steam generators by the end of the year, they want to restart
the existing generators to increase the company's power reserves in
the hot summer months, when energy use rises.
</P>
<P>
   James Baumstark, vice president of nuclear engineering for Con
Ed, said he disagreed with the nuclear commission's findings on the
1997 inspection. He also emphasized that the company had improved
its methods since then to include an electronic probe that is
better able to spot minute cracks in the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made significant improvements in both equipment and
processes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials said Friday that
they would needed more time for study and to review the company's
responses before making a final decision. Still, Jack Strosnider,
director of the division of engineering at the commission, said the
plant could reopen in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, workers raised the temperature of the nuclear reactor
in a routine test to check for leaks or other problems. A few weeks
ago, they performed a similar test after receiving permission from
the nuclear commission, said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con
Ed.
</P>
<P>
   Baumstark said it could take nine months to a year before the
new generators are fully operational because of the detailed
preparations involved. During that period of transition, he said,
the existing generators could supply power that is currently being
bought from other power companies. Since the shutdown, the company
has passed on the cost of that arrangement _ about $600,000 a day _
to its utility customers.
</P>
<P>
   Still others on Friday raised the possibility that the most
economical decision for Con Edison may be to keep the Indian Point
2 plant closed permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Edward A. Smeloff, executive director of the Pace University
Energy Project, said that replacing the plant's four existing steam
generators would cost $150 million to $250 million. He said Con
Edison should undertake a comparative cost analysis to determine
whether it would be cheaper in the long run to keep buying energy
from other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Smeloff said two power plants, one in Oregon and one in Maine,
were closed by their owners in the mid-1990s because it was cheaper
than replacing the costly steam generators. ``So the question
becomes Can that investment be recovered in future operations of
the plant through the market?'' he said. ``If it can't, then the
plant wouldn't be economical and should be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison officials Friday dismissed the idea of shutting down
the plant to save money. The company is in the process of selling
the power plant, which has been licensed by the nuclear commission
to operate until 2013. ``We believe it's less costly to have the
plant running than to have to go purchase power from other
sources,'' Clendenin said.

FUND-RAISER FOUND GUILTY OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn jury convicted a volunteer Republican
fund-raiser Friday of obstruction of justice for covering up his
role in an alleged plot to help three Korean-American families get
their sons out of prison in exchange for over $30,000 in
contributions to Gov. George Pataki's 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But the same jury did not reach a verdict on the question of
whether the fund-raiser, Yung Soo Yoo, actually promised his
assistance in getting the imprisoned men released on parole in
exchange for campaign contributions. The judge who presided over
the two-week trial in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn said that the
deadlocked campaign corruption charges would be heard at a new
trial, to begin on September 18.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Yoo, a prominent New Jersey businessman who was
often tapped to raise money among Korean-Americans in the New York
region, stemmed from a two-and-a-half-year federal inquiry into
accusations that Pataki officials used the promise of early parole
to help fill the governor's campaign coffers. The prosecutors
overseeing the investigation have repeatedly said there is no
evidence that Pataki participated in or had knowledge of the
various crimes alleged.
</P>
<P>
   But from the start, the trial had the veneer of scandal as
several Pataki aides were mentioned in courtroom testimony and
Pataki's own former campaign finance director, Patrick Donohue, was
called to the witness stand, where he underwent a scathing
cross-examination by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, jurors who spoke about their deliberations after
the verdict said no single piece of evidence had proved Yoo's guilt
to them. Instead, some said they were persuaded of Yoo's guilt by a
slow and steady compilation of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the jury did find that the defendant was
guilty of most of the corruption charges,'' said a juror from
Queens who would provide only his first name, Jonathan. ``But we
didn't think there was any really strong evidence there. It was
more cumulative over the two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, who was never charged in the case, presented the most
intriguing testimony. The federal government contended that he was
aware political favors were promised in exchange for campaign
donations _ an allegation that he vehemently denied on the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
   At least two jurors, however, said they were convinced that
Donohue knew more about the alleged parole-for-contribution scheme
than he admitted. ``Yeah, I think Donohue knew what was going on,''
said William, a juror from Brooklyn, who refused to give his last
name.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintained throughout the trial that Yoo, 63,
approached three Korean-American families from Queens at a series
of fund-raising events before the 1994 gubernatorial election and
said he could help get their sons out of prison if they contributed
to Pataki's campaign. The sons _ John Kim, Bo Young Chung and James
Jhang _ were convicted of several violent crimes, including armed
robberies and attempted murder. Kim was released on parole two
years after the donations by his family were made.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury could not decide whether they believed the
government's case on the influencing-peddling charges, they
apparently believed that Yoo tried to conceal his dealings with
Jhang's family. The strongest piece of evidence proving this, some
jurors said, was a tape recording of Yoo telling Jhang's family to
disguise some of the campaign donations as a personal loan to Yoo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Margaret Giordano, an assistant U.S. attorney who tried the
case, said she was disappointed. ``But we're eagerly awaiting the
retrial,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas DeFeis, Yoo's lawyer, said he saw the decision as
something of a victory for his client. ``The jurors seemed to have
rejected the corruption angle in the case entirely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo, who sat throughout the trial with a sour, dispassionate
look on his face, said outside the courtroom: ``They still have the
wrong guy. This is racial.''
</P>
<P>
   He is likely to face less than a year in prison on the
obstruction of justice charge, federal prosecutors said.

COMMENTARY: WHEN JUSTICE LEAVES A BITTER TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask
the family of Amadou Diallo and others who were distraught when a
jury acquitted four New York City police officers in the infamous
case of the 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask ardent
defenders of Charles Schwarz, the former police officer doing
prison time for his role in the brutal assault on Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the millions
who cannot believe that O.J. Simpson was found not guilty at his
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the many who
are still shaking their heads because Bernard Goetz, the subway
shooter, was absolved of the most serious felony charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal justice system doesn't work. Just ask the family
and friends of Patrick Dorismond, shot to death by an undercover
narcotics detective during a curbside brawl in March. They are the
latest who will tell you that justice is an illusion now that a
Manhattan grand jury has decided against indicting the detective,
Anthony Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to be a popular pastime: trashing the system when it
does not produce the results you want. Even City Hall cannot resist
playing this game. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has cited the Diallo
and Dorismond outcomes as proof that the wheels of justice turn
smoothly, has been more than willing to denounce the New York
judiciary as jerky, ideological and (gasp!) Democratic when it does
not rule to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the attackers are unencumbered by certain details,
like evidence. In the Dorismond case, some critics talked
immediately about the system's having failed even though they,
unlike the grand jurors, had no access to the witnesses and
exhibits, no way to evaluate the credibility of the police face to
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who want indictments simply want indictments,'' said
Michael Meyers, executive director of the New York Civil Rights
Coalition. ``They don't care about the evidence. They say, `We want
indictments because we're angry.' That's not the way the criminal
justice system works.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, while they may accept the grand jury's conclusion that
Vasquez committed no crime, many New Yorkers will find it hard to
shake the feeling that this case has not turned out right.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the unarmed Dorismond contributed to his own death, as
the jurors suggested, by letting his short fuse blow when
undercover officers approached him looking to buy crack cocaine.
But he is still the one who is dead _ dead, as his mother said on
Thursday, for saying no to drugs. No way will that sit right with
many people.
</P>
<P>
   The public has a built-in alarm system that enables it _ most of
the time, anyway _ to separate good from bad when police behavior
comes under fire.
</P>
<P>
   That helps explain why there was no outcry a few weeks ago when
two off-duty police officers killed an unarmed man who bizarrely
began punching them on the Grand Central Parkway in Queens. And it
is why, by contrast, the Diallo case continues to cast long shadows
even though the officers who killed the unarmed Diallo were cleared
of murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's death seems likely to keep on reverberating, too.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly or not, problem cases like this one have caused many New
Yorkers to sour on their machinery of criminal justice, Meyers
said. With all respect to District Attorney Robert Morgenthau of
Manhattan, he said, some will wonder how aggressive any district
attorney can be in police-misconduct cases, given how he has to
work closely with the police every day.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers' solution is not the reflexive call for federal
intervention now being heard, but rather the appointment of a
special state prosecutor to handle such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Others have their own issues. Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough
president and candidate for mayor, was among those who said that
the performance of Vasquez and company showed the need for better
police training and supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer and others are also not about to let the mayor off the
hook for disregarding his own advice on Day 1 of the Dorismond
affair, which was to urge ``everyone not to jump to conclusions.''
In nothing flat, Giuliani then embarked on a campaign of
mercilessly tearing the dead man down, even releasing (possibly
unlawfully) Dorismond's sealed record as a juvenile offender.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor would have done well, many say, to bite his tongue and
let the system prove on its own that it can work.

BORCHARD SIGNS WITH WHITE SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATTHEW KREDELL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After a little encouragement from his friends and
teammates at Stanford, former Camarillo High two-sport star Joe
Borchard signed with the Chicago White Sox on Friday for the
largest signing bonus offered to a first-round pick this year.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard, the projected starting quarterback on the Cardinal
football team, gives up football as part of the deal, which
includes a team-record $5.3 million bonus to be paid over 2 years.
Borchard, the 12th overall pick in last month's draft, was
struggling between playing football for Stanford or baseball for
the White Sox while agent Jim McDowell and Chicago worked on a
contract. But when McDowell called Thursday with the latest offer,
Borchard was forced to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Borchard went to the birthday party of
Stanford tight end Darin Naatjess and told his friends and
teammates of the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my call at that point,'' Borchard said during a
conference call Friday. ``So I dropped it on my buddies at the
party and their reaction really helped. They said I would be crazy
to turn that down and they were absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox made the big offer with the condition that the
6-foot-4, 225-pound switch-hitting outfielder not play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want those big guys chasing him around on the
field,'' Chicago general manager Ron Schueler said. ``I wanted the
commitment (to give up football), and that's what we were after. If
he did both of them, it could be a distraction. I would rather him
put his effort completely into baseball right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox are in town playing the Angels over the weekend.
Schueler said he plans to have Borchard at the game Sunday,
possibly to take part in batting practice with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Schueler said he wants Borchard to report to Tucson for rookie
ball in the Arizona League on Monday or Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball summoned clubs to a pre-draft meeting,
where the league discussed curbing escalating bonus payments. No. 1
pick Adrian Gonzalez received a $3 million signing bonus from
Florida, formerly the largest given out this season.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard batted .333 with 21 home runs for Stanford this spring,
as the Cardinal advanced to the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He sat behind current Washington Redskins rookie Todd Husak at
quarterback last season but was expected to be the starter this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to get this done; it had been dragged on long
enough,'' Borchard said. ''It is good to get it done now rather
than two days before (the college football season).''

EDITORIAL: COPYRIGHT IN THE AGE OF NAPSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   The record industry, struggling against rampant unauthorized
downloading of copyrighted music on the Internet, cheered when it
got a preliminary injunction this week against Napster Inc., the
Internet music directory service.
</P>
<P>
   But the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals swiftly stayed the
injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Marilyn Patel. The appeals
court, noting that substantial new legal questions had been raised
in this case, has scheduled oral argument for September. In the
meantime, Napster will continue operating.
</P>
<P>
   This case represents only the beginning of the legal and
technological challenge to maintain the legitimate right of
artists, writers, scholars and corporations to reap economic
benefits from the intellectual property that they create, whether
in real space or cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of copyrights is vital to the health of a free
and creative society. It is not simply an economic issue, though
many enterprises, this newspaper included, rely on copyright
protection. The society at large benefits when the law assures that
the creation of new art, writing or other intellectual property is
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   To defend that principle in cyberspace, the courts, Congress and
information industries must find ways to sustain and adapt
copyright law without stifling the development of new technologies.
This will be no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 million people have downloaded Napster's software
program, which allows users to find and exchange music files
directly with the computers of other users. Napster does not keep
or control the music files, but provides a directory of files that
tells users what is available to be shared by other users who are
online at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of music being downloaded this way is
copyrighted. But the record companies could not in any practical
way sue the millions of Napster users who they say are illegally
copying the music.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs instead sued Napster for contributory copyright
infringement, on the grounds that the service makes it possible for
the wholesale infringement to occur. On Wednesday, Patel agreed and
issued an immediate injunction prohibiting Napster from enabling
its users to download copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   The injunction left Napster free to offer its services for
noncopyrighted works, but Napster's lawyers said that the service
could not distinguish between copyrighted music files and
noncopyrighted files. The appeals court granted it an emergency
stay of that injunction.
</P>
<P>
   Patel's interpretation of copyright protection under existing
law seems reasonable, but she acknowledged in her oral ruling that
it was hard to make a ``neat fit'' in applying copyright law to
cases involving new technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 Sony Betamax case, the Supreme Court ruled that Sony
could not be prohibited from making and selling VCRs because the
machines were ``capable of substantial noninfringing uses'' even
though they could be illegally used. That decision opened the way
to a booming video business that has benefited the movie industry
plaintiffs in the Sony case. Ultimately the courts will have to
determine whether Napster technology has legitimate uses.
</P>
<P>
   Even a legal victory against Napster will not shield the
recording industry from Internet infringement. Newer technology
such as Gnutella and Freenet allow Napster-like
computer-to-computer file sharing without a central list manager.
These programs also enable users to engage in widespread copyright
infringement, but since there is no central server, there is no
company to sue. Yet they offer potential benefits _ such as more
efficient content searches _ that could be extremely important for
the Internet's development.
</P>
<P>
   In the digital era, enforcement of copyrights may depend as much
on new technological answers as on court sanctions. In the next few
years, the recording industry and other content creators may find
that adding anti-copying features to digital material and
developing whole new ways to sell their products and services to
users will become primary to protecting intellectual property
online.

EDITORIAL: A PARK AT BROOKLYN BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, July 29:
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn's ragged waterfront has long taunted civic leaders,
developers and ordinary dreamers with the possibility of a
shoreline park with stunning views of Manhattan and the New York
harbor. Now, for the first time in decades, a reasonable plan has
managed to win the support of various neighborhood and political
groups. The proposal for a 70-acre strip of parkland and commercial
space called Brooklyn Bridge Park has also won approval and a big
piece of the funding from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The next important step is for Gov. George Pataki, who likes the
general idea of a shoreline park, to come stand on a lonely quay,
imagine green walkways instead of Port Authority eyesores and give
the project his weighty stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn park enthusiasts have seen more than a few
disappointments over the years, with one plan dying of political
intrigue and another expiring under the weight of public outcry
about an overbearing waterfront hotel. The development of this
latest plan, financed with seed money from the state, included so
much public participation that the vast majority of community
groups support it enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few opponents with rather narrow concerns, like
residents of one street who want to erect an iron gate barring any
pedestrians trying to walk to the park through their neighborhood.
But there are also more legitimate worries that this park, which
includes a hotel and other commercial ventures, creates a
burdensome new requirement that future urban parks must be
sustained by private or commercial support.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Brooklyn's developers still need to work with the
city and state to create a reasonable administrative structure to
manage this shoreline park with both public and commercial areas.
</P>
<P>
   This is not an impossible task, given the successful creation of
a management structure for the bigger and more ambitious Hudson
River Park. But at this stage the governor needs to publicly commit
the staff, energy and funds necessary to convert 1.3 miles of
rusted shoreline into an open waterfront promenade that he and
Giuliani can claim as a durable part of their legacy.

RAMPART OFFICER FACES 6 CHARGES &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the most serious case yet filed in the LAPD's
Rampart Division scandal, the partner of rogue cop Rafael Perez was
arrested Friday near his home early Friday and charged with
attempted murder, robbery and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Nino Durden, who has been on administrative leave from the Los
Angeles Police Department, is the LAPD officer his partner fingered
to be charged since a plea agreement reached last fall allowed
Perez, the anti-gang officer turned informant, to get a five-year
sentence for stealing cocaine from the department.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge against Durden, who faces up to 46 years
in prison if convicted on all counts, stems from the shooting of an
unarmed man who was left crippled from his injuries and sent to
prison on planted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he's one big fish,'' District Attorney Gil Garcetti
said in an interview. ``Is he the biggest fish? Maybe. Clearly,
he's a main target, if not the main target.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said prosecutors have corroborating evidence or
testimony to back up Perez's allegations against Durden. Perez's
credibility has been strained by his admissions of perjury and
failures to pass lie detector tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have corroboration - we believe we have it,''
Garcetti said, adding the case still poses challenges. ``No case
against a police officer is easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Oaks attorney Darryl Mounger said Durden intends to
plead not guilty to the six-count charge at an arraignment
scheduled for Monday. Durden was taken to Los Angeles County Jail,
where bail was set at $680,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mounger said he hasn't seen the prosecutors' case, but that he
can show Perez to be a liar in other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's told so many stories in his life, he doesn't know what's
true,'' Mounger said.
</P>
<P>
   Mounger accused the LAPD of double-crossing his client after it
originally was agreed Durden could turn himself in as other Rampart
officers did. Instead, police arrested Durden as he and three
passengers were driving near his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They broke their word. I think they showed how this case is a
circus,'' Mounger said.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David Kalish said Durden was arrested only
after police determined he had been tipped off and officers became
afraid he'd flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some actions by him caused concern and required the department
to serve the arrest warrant,'' Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge is the attempted murder of Javier
Francisco Ovando on Oct. 12, 1996. Perez told investigators as part
of his plea deal that he and Durden both fired at the unarmed man,
and that they later planted a semiautomatic, assault-type rifle on
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ovando was sentenced to 23 years and four months in prison but
was released last year. He is suing the city.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript of Perez's testimony, he heard Durden
cursing at someone during a stakeout in an abandoned apartment
building. When he turned around, he saw Durden raise his gun and
fire a shot. Perez then fired three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durden walks out the door for a few minutes, and then he
returns with a gun wrapped in a red, very dirty shirt. Very few
words are said,'' Perez told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh, takes the weapon - holding the rag and the weapon, and
drops it from chest level down to the ground and lets it fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said the .22-caliber rifle had been secured by the
officers a couple of weeks before. They had run the gun on a
computer, and then Durden had filed off the identification numbers
to cover their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Ovando told authorities that Perez grabbed him by the shirt, and
put a gun to his head. While Ovando screamed, ``I don't want to
die,'' Perez pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Perez has denied that.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he and Durden turned dirty in the spring of 1987. He
said he never liked or trusted his partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was cheating me on top of cheating everybody else,'' Perez
told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed Durden led their criminal enterprises, stealing
thousands of dollars in cocaine and other drugs, giving drugs to
informants, selling drugs on the street, taking guns and then
planting them on victims.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those allegations are not contained in the complaint
which charges Durden with second-degree robbery, filing false
reports and perjury under oath.

 FLORIDA REBUFFS HIP's PROPOSAL TO RAISE FUNDS 
By CHRISTOPHER DREW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Regulators in Florida Friday rejected a proposal to
let a troubled subsidiary of the Health Insurance Plan of Greater
New York gradually make up a $4.8 million shortfall in its
financial reserves. The Florida Department of Insurance instead
gave the subsidiary, HIP Health Plan of Florida, until Aug. 15 to
restore the reserve to the legally required level, by either lining
up an investor willing to pump cash into the operation or securing
a joint venture with another health care company.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida company has drained tens of millions of dollars from
HIP's New York operation, which is also in financial trouble. The
regulatory action in Florida adds to the pressure on HIP, a
nonprofit health maintenance organization set up to insure New York
City employees and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Both the New York State Insurance Department and attorney
general's office are investigating allegations of wasteful spending
at HIP. The company was also hurt last year by the collapse of its
operation in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, the regulators placed HIP's subsidiary under special
supervision On July 19 out of concern that its reserves had fallen
too low to cushion against unexpectedly large medical claims.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials then filed a proposal to eliminate the $4.8
million deficit over eight months by laying off 41 workers, cutting
other costs and raising insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter Friday, Susanne K. Murphy, the deputy Florida
insurance commissioner, told HIP officials that their plan would
take too long.
</P>
<P>
   David Abernethy, the executive director of the HIP subsidiary,
said he was disappointed that the plan was rejected. He said
company officials were also negotiating with another health care
company that might want to form a joint venture.

CLINTON, ON ISRAELI TV, PROMISES REWARDS FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 15th graf with quote) 
By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Acting to help shore up Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
shaky political base, President Clinton went on Israeli television
Friday night promising concrete rewards for peace, hinting that he
was ready to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   That move would be a major triumph for Israel and Jews around
the world who have long sought international recognition for
Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state. The United States and
most other nations have kept their embassies in Tel Aviv, on the
argument that the status of the Holy City remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Haaretz reported that Barak, who lost his majority
in Parliament when three parties bolted his coalition to protest
the talks and who faces no-confidence votes on Monday, had
telephoned the White House and asked the president's help with his
political problems.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed for half an hour on Israeli television, Clinton
himself introduced the issue of moving the embassy while answering
a question about the relationship between United States and Israel,
calling it ``very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking about a long-term commitment to help modernize the
Israeli army and provide more security assistance now that Israeli
troops have been withdrawn from Lebanon, the president said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I have always wanted to move our embassy to West
Jerusalem. We have a designated site there. I have not done so
because I didn't want to do anything to undermine our ability to
help broker a secure and fair and lasting peace for Israelis and
for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in light of what has happened, I've taken that decision
under review and I'll make a decision sometime between now and the
end of the year on that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the immediately after Camp David, Clinton spoke
highly of Barak and his efforts at the talks, insisting that the
prime minister ``in no way ever compromised the vital interests of
the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the interview was pegged to the Camp David talks and
Barak's political needs, the issues of Jerusalem and U.S. support
for Israel have also featured strongly in the Senate campaign of
Clinton's wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, especially since she was
accused of once making an anti-Semitic slur. Mrs. Clinton has
declared that Jerusalem should be ``the eternal and indivisible
capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton broached the subject, the Israeli interviewer
asked: ``You mentioned the relocation of the Israeli _ of the
American Embassy and put it in Jerusalem. Would you consider it in
any circumstances, even if there is no agreement?''
</P>
<P>
   The president replied ``Well, I think I should stand on the
words I said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always wanted to do it,'' he continued. ``I've always
thought it was the right thing to do. But I didn't want to do
anything to undermine the peace process, our ability to be an
honest broker, which requires that we be accepted by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's something I've taken under review now because of the
recent events,'' he said. ``And I think that's all I should say
about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate official reaction here because the
interview was broadcast on the 8 p.m. news, after sirens had
sounded the start of the Jewish sabbath, during with the country
largely shuts down.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Clin- ton warned Yasir Arafat, the
Pales- tinian leader, not to carry out his intention to
unilaterally declare a Palestinian state by Sept. 13 even without a
peace agreement. If that happens, the president said, ``there will
inevitably be consequences. Not just here, but throughout the
world. And things will happen. I would re- view our entire
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what Israel could expect to get if it signed a peace
agreement, Clinton replied: ``I will do my best to get the maximum
amount of support. One of the reasons that I wanted very much to
get the agreement this time is that it would give us more time to
pass an aid package through Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to mention an issue often raised by Israelis whenever
the question of compensating Palestinian refugees arises _ that of
also paying compensation to Jews who fled or were evicted from Arab
lands since the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some interest, interestingly enough on both sides, in
also having a fund which compensates the Israelis who were made
refugees by the war which occurred after the birth of Israel,'' he
said. ``Israel is full of people, Jewish people, who lived in
predominantly Arab countries who came to Israel because they were
made refugees in their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's another piece of the good news that I think I can
reveal that came out of the summit,'' he said. ``The Palestinians
thought those people should be eligible for compensation as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there would have to be an ``international fund''
for the refugees, but he did not indicate who would be expected to
contribute.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the idea of such compensation was likely to be of especial
interest to Jews from Arab countries, whose support is crucial to
Barak. Many of them are supporters of Shas, a religious party with
17 seats in Parliament that broke from Barak's coalition just
before the talks began.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Shas, whose central interest is to protect and
expand the government benefits it has accumulated, would be of
major help to Barak in his efforts to regain a comfortable majority
in Parliament. Its withdrawal from the coalition, along with that
of two smaller parties, dropped Barak's support in the 120-seat
legislature from 69 to 42.
</P>
<P>
   Though generally conservative, Shas has been moderate on issues
of peace, and its spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, has issued
a ruling that it would be acceptable to have a Palestinian flag fly
over the Temple Mount in Jerusalem's Old City if the effect was to
save Jewish lives. Giving the Palestinians control over the mount
was one of the possible arrangements reportedly discussed at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's immediate goal is to survive the no-confidence votes on
Monday, after which Parliament adjourns for a three-month vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There was political speculation Friday over Foreign Minister
David Levy, who met with hunger strikers protesting the peace talks
and who met today with Ariel Sharon, the head of the right-wing
Likud party. If Levy takes his three-member Gesher faction out of
Barak's One Israel party and back into Likud, it would reduce One
Israel to 23 seats and raise Likud to 22.

<P>
   WARREN, Mass. _ It is a midsummer mystery: The Case of the
Missing Lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike a good beach read, it has no guarantee of a neat
solution. And the suffering of those who wait, pray and weep at
night is only too real.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27, 16-year-old Molly Ann Bish, a 5-foot-7-inch,
127-pound, honey-blond athlete, reported for her eighth day of work
as a lifeguard at Comins Pond, a serene pool ringed by pines, with
a water slide and a small beach. It is a popular swimming hole,
especially for young children, in this country town about 70 miles
west of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Molly's mother dropped her off as her shift began at 10 a.m.
Molly set up her things for the day: beach chair, flip-flops,
two-way radio, the lunch her mother had packed her.
</P>
<P>
   Then she disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a half-hour later, the first bathers arrived and found
there was no lifeguard, though a first-aid kit lay open by the
chair. Molly has not been seen again, at least not by anyone in
this town that has just about gone wild looking.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in part to a local company that makes ribbons, no village
could ever have been more thoroughly trimmed in yellow _ Molly's
favorite color _ even at the very height of the Gulf War. The
ribbons adorn telephone poles, gateposts, car antennas, trees, even
the white columns of the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of townspeople have attended candle-lit vigils on the
town common, gone out to assist the professional searchers, fed to
the gills the two dozen state detectives working nonstop on the
case and kept up a steady stream of comfort calls on John and Magi
Bish, Molly's parents.
</P>
<P>
   The Bishes have also received more than 700 sympathy cards. They
said the cards help, baskets of them lying at their feet near a
shelf holding a lit candle flickering before Molly's junior prom
picture. The Bishes are also more grateful than they can say for
the police work and the town's outpouring of love, aid and food.
But as the days pass, the ordeal only gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me at nighttime, because that's when
the fears come,'' said Magi Bish, a special-education teacher and
former stay-at-home mother to Molly and her two older siblings. ``I
do a lot of crying and use a rosary.'' Now, at the the one-month
mark, she said, the hope that Molly is still alive is flickering.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the hardest fear,'' she said, ``is if she's out there
somewhere and someone's hurting her. If she's gone to heaven, I can
make peace with it, but the fear is the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   A disappearance like Molly's is relatively unusual, say national
experts on child abductions. Of the 850,000 children who are
reported missing each year, said Jerry Nance, a case manager with
the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, only 3
percent or 4 percent are considered ``missing and endangered,''
that is, neither runaways nor taken by a family member.
</P>
<P>
   According to Department of Justice figures, 300 children each
year are abducted by non-family members and are gone for a long
time or killed.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 4,600 abductions by non-family members nationwide are
reported to the police each year, compared with 354,000 children
taken by family members and 450,700 who run away.
</P>
<P>
   Molly's case has other unusual elements, Nance said: ``She's
older than most. It was daylight. She was at a workplace where
people would have known her. The whole window of opportunity for
the guy to have struck was very small, only 20 minutes. From the
standpoint of how the events happened, it couldn't have happened
any quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   State police refused on Thursday to discuss the investigation,
even as nearly 200 cadets from a nearby police academy set out into
the woods to practice some newly learned search techniques. But the
authorities are considering lowering the level of the pond to
search in marshy areas.
</P>
<P>
   But it appears highly unlikely Molly ran away _ a responsible
teen-ager on a welcome new job, packing nothing, leaving her shoes,
saying not a word to anybody. And police checks into sex offenders
living in the area have apparently yielded no breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bish family, there is one strong lead: a
suspicious-looking fiftyish man with a mustache whom Magi Bish had
observed sitting in a white car in the pond parking lot the day
before Molly disappeared. She fixed him with a ``What are you doing
here?'' look, she said, and eventually he drove off.
</P>
<P>
   Though sketches of the man are plastered next to posters of
Molly on store windows in the town center, ``this individual has
not been found,'' Molly's mother said. ``It would help us immensely
if he came forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bishes are trying to turn their pain into
something positive by talking about Molly, describing her goofy
charm, her honor-roll grades and her kindness to special-needs
children, and warning other parents that this could happen to them,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that children aren't safe,'' Molly's father, a
probation officer, said. ``Now we know we have to redouble our
efforts _ everyone has to. Molly goes to work at a beach known for
its safety and ends up in harm's way _ everyone needs to be
informed about this type of situation to prevent it happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Molly's parents are convinced, they said, that someone lured her
into trouble by pretending to need her help. No matter how parents
teach children to be safe, her father said, they are by nature
trusting, and Molly would have responded to a call for help. There
was no sign of struggle but her parents presume some force may have
been involved.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the abductor was a local resident who could
still be around adds a slight tinge of suspicion to the town's
striking crisis-time solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand how anyone would do something like this, so
you start looking at everyone and wondering who could it be?'' said
Marilyn Coltey, a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some local parents have told Magi Bish that their children,
frightened, have been asking to share beds with each other or their
parents more than usual, and many parents seem to be heeding John
Bish's advice that they cannot be too overprotective.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has a 2-year-old, and she won't let the kid out of
her sight now,'' said Gary Bateman, owner of the Warren Spa and
Package Store.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cards the Bish family has received are two from other
members of the saddest of fraternities: parents whose daughters
were abducted. The remains of one, a 9-year-old, turned up years
later in some woods in the Boston suburb where she disappeared; the
body of the other, a 10-year-old, turned up two months later in a
town just miles from here. Neither crime has been solved.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, Molly Bish will turn _ or would have turned _ 17.
Magi Bish is thinking about inviting some of Molly's friends over
for cake, she said, and asking them to do a good deed or act
extra-safely in Molly's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be Molly's voice until we find her, and we have to
find her,'' Magi Bish said. ``She brings joy to our house. She's
our sunshine-silly goose.''

FOR CHANG, L.A. IS STILL THE PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At 28, Michael Chang is in the September of his
tennis career. He's won 33 ATP titles, amassed almost $20 million
in prize money and been as high as No. 2 in the world, but that
Michael Chang is a lot different from the one we know now.
</P>
<P>
   His slump over the past 2 years has been so severe - he hasn't
won since October 1998 and he's since humbled himself by playing
Challenger matches - that he's openly considered calling it a day.
</P>
<P>
   But performing in Los Angeles always has invigorated Chang, who
won here in 1996 and appeared in three finals from 1989-93.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after beating Wayne Ferreira 6-3, 7-6 (9-7) in Friday's
Mercedes-Benz Cup quarterfinal, Chang suddenly has the inside track
for a long overdue triumph at UCLA's L.A. Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I've felt like I reached the point of brokeness,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chang's first two victories this week, he showed flashes of
that same tenacity and consistency that originally brought him to
the forefront. Against Ferreira, Chang left a lot of us believing
he's all the way back: the crisp ground strokes, the timely
volleys, the extra oomph during key moments.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer has a choice but to look at his career as one match
at a time; he took that same mindset into the Ferreira match,
worrying about one !ital!swing!off! at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely was just trying to hang in there,'' he said.
``The only thing I was concentrating on was the next point. I never
looked at the whole. It was tight and every point was crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Such concentration worked in the tiebreaker. Chang was down 5-3,
two points away from going to a third set against a hungry
adversary who had never beaten Chang in six previous matchups.
Chang won three of the next four points and eventually surged to an
8-7 lead on an ace and a service point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never let me do anything,'' Ferreira said. ``He just kept
getting a lot of balls back. He was solid and consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Any success Chang had over Ferreira in the past had nothing to
do with Friday's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every match is different,'' Chang said. ``If I think it's
gonna be a piece of cake, I'll get steamrolled. We've had some
tough matches and today was no exception. He's a dangerous player
and a shot maker. I think he just got out of his groove.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in Chang's way today is upstart Justin Gimbelstob, the
unseeded former UCLA star who came through with the tournament's
biggest upset, a three-set victory over top-seeded Mark
Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's never played Philippoussis, but considering it's Chang's
chance to return to the limelight, he's not choosy about who he
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played Justin but I've practiced against him often,
and I know it's not going to be easy,'' Chang said. ``He's got a
big serve and he covers the net well. We'll just have to wait and
find out what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang is sniffing a victory, even if he won't admit it. Today
marks the third time he's made it to the semifinals in what is
turning out to be a mini-comeback even without a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would feel great to win. It's been a while,'' he said.
``But there's still a ways to go and they're all tough players. I
can't take anyone lightly.''

MAKESHIFT RANGERS HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Every indication screams that the Texas
Rangers' season is over.
</P>
<P>
   Their best player, 1999 American League MVP Ivan Rodriguez,
watches the games from a luxury suite with a cast on his broken
thumb. General manager Doug Melvin has begun unloading the team's
high-priced talent, trading designated hitter David Segui and his
.336 batting average to Cleveland before Friday night's game. The
pitching staff is dotted with young arms barely out of the minors.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers keep breathing anyway. With the replacements for
Rodriguez and Segui powering an offense that cranked out 14 hits,
the Rangers slammed the Detroit Tigers, 11-5, Friday night at The
Ballpark in Arlington for their fourth consecutive victory since
Rodriguez was injured Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Rangers stayed 81/2 games behind AL
West-leading Seattle and moved within 41/2 games of Oakland,
currently the leader in the wild-card race. And while nobody is
ready to declare them contenders just yet, the Rangers have made it
clear they are not ready to concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of games left,'' said Rick Helling
(12-7), who pitched six innings to earn the victory. ``We're
professional baseball players for a reason. We all have the will to
win and the competitiveness to get the job done. Regardless of the
situation, regardless of who gets traded or who gets hurt, it's
still our job to go out there and win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good enough team right now to go out and win games
and make things interesting at least. There's still 61 games left.
That's a lot of season. It's not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if the Rangers continue hitting the way they did Friday
night, when they buried Tigers starter Brian Moehler (6-7) with an
eight-run third inning that put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   The big blow of the inning was a bases-loaded double off the bat
of Bill Haselman, the veteran backup catcher who has filled in
brilliantly in Rodriguez's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have insurance policies, and that's what he is for
us,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``A family is not excited
about cashing their policy, but they're glad they have it. We're
not happy about losing Pudge, but we're very glad we have Haselman.
This is exactly what we expected from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates also got a lift from Frank Catalanotto, who replaced Segui
at DH at the last minute and bashed a solo home run in the second,
and Gabe Kapler, who added two hits, a run and a run batted in.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive night, the Rangers were victimized
early by their former teammates. This time, Juan Gonzalez was
joined by designated hitter Dean Palmer, who gave the Tigers a 3-0
lead by following Gonzalez's first-inning double with a homer to
center. But the Rangers closed the gap to 3-2 with a run-scoring
double by Rafael Palmeiro and Catalanotto's home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers sent 12 batters to the plate in the third, pounding
out eight hits to tie the season high for an inning. The eight runs
were the most the Rangers had scored in an inning since Sept. 25,
when they scored eight in the second against Oakland. nn

NEW GUARDS CAN BOOST THEIR STOCK ON COWBOYS' THIN OFFENSIVE LINE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ For Jorge Diaz and Kelvin Garmon, the
starters at right and left guard, respectively, against the
Pittsburgh Steelers tomorrow, the Cowboys' preseason opener is all
about perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz is a veteran who was signed as a free agent in the
off-season to be a backup before being thrust into the spotlight by
tackle Erik Williams' holdout/retirement. Diaz, who fills in as
Solomon Page moves to Williams' spot, is looking to prove he can
handle the job after some shaky workouts early in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal was to come here and be a starter anyway,'' Diaz said.
``Whether I was backing up or starting, my approach was going to be
same. The only thing that changes now is the sense of urgency to
get things down pat. We are in game situations now. I can't let no
one touch \Rquarterback Troy Aikman\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmon, the former Haltom High School standout who is starting
in place of the injured Larry Allen, is just happy to be on the
field again. He sat out last season with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' Garmon said. ``It's taken a long time for me
to realize my dream of being able to suit up and play in Texas
Stadium in front of my family. It's what I've been working for.''
</P>
<P>
   Garmon's and Diaz's stories alone are worthy of attention
heading into the Steelers game. But add in the Cowboys' jumbled
guard situation, which has been in flux since the first day of
training camp, and coach Dave Campo said both players and anybody
else who suits up at guard will be under an intense microscope
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural to look at guys who are playing in place of other
people,'' Campo said. ``And that's a position we would look at
anyway. That is an area we are concerned with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' plans of starting Page at right guard have been put
on hold by Williams' absence. Page's move to right tackle left Diaz
battling veteran backup Tony Hutson at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   That battle, however, has been limited by Hutson's recovery from
off-season knee surgery. He participates in only one practice a day
at training camp and will not play against the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   And though the team is confident about Diaz because of his
starting experience in Tampa Bay the past four years, his daily
struggles against Cowboys defensive tackle Alonzo Spellman haven't
helped the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The guard position took another hit this week when rookie free
agent James Tenner (broken hand) and second-year guard/center Chris
Brymer (sprained knee) joined Allen on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said the Cowboys will try to sign a player or two for
depth purposes in the next week. However, he said they will go with
whom they have against Steelers, which means that Diaz, Garmon and
rookie free agents Al Jackson and George Hudson will log a lot of
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   The extra duty is fine with the 6-foot-4, 315-pound Diaz, who
acknowledges being frustrated with his practice performances. While
he partly blames his struggles on Spellman's sheer dominance, he
said differing techniques coached in Dallas compared with Tampa Bay
also is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything here is different, the way we pass-block people and
the timing with the way we run the ball,'' Diaz said. ``It's just
like readjusting yourself and starting over again.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Cowboys are being supportive, pointing to Diaz's
experience and lauding his perseverance. However, considering their
high expectations for the season, the Cowboys are bound to lose
patience if Diaz struggles in games as he does in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz agrees, saying: ``The games are what's important. That's
how you find out if someone can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Just being able to practice, let alone play in game, is a
triumph in itself for Garmon, who was injured as a senior at Baylor
in 1998. The Cowboys selected him in the seventh round of the 1999
draft, though they knew he would not be healthy until this season.
</P>
<P>
   Garmon, still rusty after the layoff, has been one of the
biggest surprises in camp. He has been singled out for praise by
Campo and offensive line coach Hudson Houck.
</P>
<P>
   Garmon said his teammates are also taking notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year everybody just looked at me rehabbing,'' said
Garmon, who knows he has no chance of supplanting the All-Pro Allen
and is just trying to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't know I could play. Now they are talking to me.
They respect me now. It feels good.'' nn

RANGERS DEAL SEGUI FOR LEDEE, MAY KEEP WETTELAND AFTER ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Earlier this week, David Segui said he was
certain that he would be traded. His prediction came true Friday
when the Rangers traded the designated hitter/first baseman to the
Cleveland Indians for one-time top prospect Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, who is expected to join the club Sunday, will replace the
platoon of Dave Martinez and Chad Curtis in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity to get a young player who can be with us
next year,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``With him and Rusty
(Greer) and Gabe (Kapler), we've got a chance to have a good, young
outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal does not necessarily signal the start of the
dismantling of the team. It might be the Rangers' only major trade
before the nonwaivers deadline on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin is listening to offers for closer John Wetteland, who
like Segui can become a free agent at the end of the season, but
it's no longer certain he'll also be leaving town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I'm a little less motivated at this time to move
John,'' Melvin said. ``He's a big part of this ballclub. He does
bring veteran leadership to this ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland still could be traded for the right deal, but although
several clubs have called and expressed interest in the reliever,
that deal isn't currently on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just going to give John Wetteland away,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The GM also said that although next year's outfield appears
overly crowded if Ruben Mateo comes back from his broken leg, he
isn't trying to deal Ledee or any of the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking to turn him around, and I'm not going to trade
Rusty Greer or Gabe Kapler,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Martinez or Curtis, the two veterans who now
become extra players, could be traded, but Melvin said he doesn't
have anything working with either one.
</P>
<P>
   There were two other offers for Segui, but Ledee fit the
description of the type of player Melvin was looking for. He wanted
players on the verge of making it to the majors, or young players
already in the majors, rather than prospects in the low minors.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee fits that description. He's 26 years old, and in his third
season in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee once was considered one of the best outfield prospects in
the game, but has yet to fulfill that promise. He's hitting .254
with 19 homers and 91 RBI in 209 games in his brief career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not established in the big leagues, it's going to
happen,'' Ledee said of the trade.
</P>
<P>
   He had the opportunity to win the Yankees' left-field job in the
spring, but failed to seize it. He batted .241 with seven homers
and 31 RBI in 62 games as a part-timer, and was traded to the
Indians on June 29 in a package for David Justice.
</P>
<P>
   He batted .222 with two homers and eight RBI in 16 games with
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, still like his potential. When Melvin
presented the deal to Oates, the manager urged him to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside of Ricky is very exciting,'' Oates said. ``This is
a guy who has a chance to be an outstanding major-league player for
a lot of years.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee is signed for the remainder of this season, after which he
will be eligible for arbitration. But as a player with less than
six years of major-league service, Ledee's contract is under club
control for the next three years. Segui's contract this year was
for $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto is expected to get most of Segui's at-bats at
DH, perhaps platooning with Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get more at-bats because of it,'' Oates said. ``The
trade opens more opportunities to get Cat into the lineup.''

JUAN GONZALEZ WON'T DECIDE FUTURE UNTIL SEASON ENDS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers general manager Doug Melvin slammed
the door in outfielder Juan Gonzalez's face Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers will not pursue the two-time American League MVP as
a free agent this winter, according to Tigers general manager Randy
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me,'' said Gonzalez, who yesterday spoke
to selected members of the Fort Worth/Dallas media for the first
time since his return to The Ballpark in Arlington. ``I'm here to
play baseball. I'm not here for Doug. I'm not here for other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Gonzalez would not eliminate the possibility of returning
to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All doors are open,'' said Gonzalez, who captured those two
MVP awards with the Rangers before being traded to the Tigers
nearly nine months ago. ``If the Rangers have an interest in me,
I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith spoke with Melvin on Thursday and said the Rangers ``have
no interest in bringing \RGonzalez\S back on a multiyear contract,
and \RMelvin\S said I could say that publicly.'' Melvin
acknowledged his conversation with Smith, but he declined to
divulge its nature.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Gonzalez glowed while describing Thursday's
emotion-filled return to The Ballpark. Gonzalez received a mixed
reaction from the crowd before stepping to the plate for his first
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably one of the best, exciting moments of my career
to this point,'' Gonzalez said. ``It was great. I'll never forget
that moment. I know the fans like me here. The fans understand that
Juan didn't trade himself. The team traded Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade stung Gonzalez, and several players _ including first
baseman Rafael Palmeiro and catcher Ivan Rodriguez _ have suggested
the Rangers attempt to re-sign the outfielder this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt my pride a little bit because when I played for the
Rangers, I did the best I could inside the lines for the great
fans, the organization and for myself,'' Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Gonzalez acknowledged that the trade was a business
decision and praised the Rangers for his 14 years with the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for the great opportunity to play professional
baseball,'' he said. ``Thank you for the opportunity to play in the
big leagues. Thank you for the opportunity to make a lot of money.
Thank you for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So, where will Gonzalez report next spring?
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez rejected a seven-year contract worth $123 million with
an option for an eighth season from the Tigers earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Tigers offered the great contract, I'd never been
there in Detroit,'' said Gonzalez, who likely will not draw that
type of offer this winter. ``I didn't know about the city. You need
to see it before you make the big decision. Money is good, but
money is not everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez called a return to the Tigers his ``No. 1 option,'' but
mainly because the organization is the only one eligible to
negotiate with him until two weeks after the conclusion of the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made the big decision already,'' Gonzalez said.
``I'll make the big decision after the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also defended his friend and confidant, Luis Mayoral,
who has been portrayed by some in the media as his puppet master.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a man,'' Gonzalez said. ``I'm 30 years old, and I have
initiative and my own mind. I don't need a baby sitter. I make my
own decisions, but I have a great relationship with Luis, like
father and son or a brother. Luis never makes my decisions. I make
my decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Smith, the Rangers already have made one for
Gonzalez.

CRABTREE SAYS BRUSH WITH GONZALEZ `NOT PERSONAL'

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right fielder Juan Gonzalez's emotional
return to The Ballpark in Arlington nearly escalated into a brawl
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wait for him anywhere,'' Gonzalez said of Rangers
right-hander Tim Crabtree, whose first pitch of the seventh inning
nearly hit the two-time American League MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Rangers traded me, he made comments in the paper,''
Gonzalez added. ``I don't talk behind anybody. I talk face to face.
A real man talks face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree told reporters this winter that Gonzalez ``was (the
Tigers') problem now,'' but the reliever said he was referring to
the outfielder's contract status.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might think it's personal,'' Crabtree said. ``It's not
personal for me. I'm not trying to hit anyone. I feel if I hit
anyone, I can seriously hurt someone. ... I wasn't trying to hit
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree's first-pitch sinker bore in on Gonzalez, but did not
hit him. Gonzalez approached the mound before being restrained by
Rangers catcher Bill Haselman. Both benches emptied, but no punches
were thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez yelled at Crabtree, and ``and all hell broke loose,''
Crabtree said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I became a man,'' Crabtree said. ``I was in
front of 40,000 people, and he started jawing at me. I guess my ego
took over. Juan is a great player. He's done a lot of great things.
He's also with the Detroit Tigers now, and I need to get him out.
That's all.'' nn

BIG 12 NORTH'S LITTLE THREE HOPE FOR BREAKTHROUGH SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Being upwardly mobile typically requires
talent, hard work and luck. Unless, of course, you're a team in the
lower half of the Big 12 Conference North Division. Then all that
striving turns into surviving.
</P>
<P>
   If preseason predictions are accurate, Nebraska, Kansas State
and Colorado are the North's Big Three. Kansas, Iowa State and
Missouri are the Little Three. With seven bowl slots guaranteed to
Big 12 teams, the race is basically to finish fourth in the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference has done a great job in securing postseason
play for seven teams, so the incentive is here,'' Iowa State coach
Dan McCarney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're good enough to be in the top three,'' Kansas
running back Moran Norris said at this week's Big 12 media
meetings. ``We came close last year and this year we can smell it.
We're trying to do it all this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what the Cyclones and the Tigers believe. Three into
one won't go. Players and coaches for Kansas, Iowa State and
Missouri should be watching ``Survivor'' to gain some tips on how
to stay on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could very well have a better team and our record would not
reflect that,'' Jayhawks coach Terry Allen said. ``We're being
optimistic, but we also have to be realistic. There are no foregone
conclusions and we think we can sneak in to one of those top three
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a darn good football team and finish fourth and
feel pretty good about what you've accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the first pads pop in August, optimism beats realism
like rock beats scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas was 5-7 last season, Iowa State and Missouri were 4-7.
All three figure record reversals are possible. Assuming none of
the Big Three fall, two teams are going to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects to lose right now,'' Missouri junior defensive
end Justin Smith said. ``Somebody's going to be right and
somebody's going to be wrong. We want to wind up being right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of guys on the roster who have been on winning
teams and know it's an attainable goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In four previous Big 12 seasons, only Missouri has broken
through the glass ceiling, finishing third in 1997 and 1998. That
recent success shows that for the North's ``other'' teams, moving
up is possible. However, in the 1990s, Kansas, Iowa State and
Missouri combined for six winning seasons, a 113-182-8 record and
five bowl trips.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Smith is entering his seventh season as Missouri's coach.
McCarney is entering his sixth season at Iowa State. Allen is in
his fourth season. The Tigers' rebuilding was rewarded with bowl
trips in '97 and '98. The Cyclones and the Jayhawks have yet to
have breakthrough seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Little Three, Iowa State gets a break with Missouri and
Kansas coming to Ames, Iowa. Kansas plays both Missouri and Iowa
State on the road. Missouri is at home against Kansas and plays at
Iowa State. The Cyclones' non-conference schedule is the tamest of
the three.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas had a 9-0 halftime lead against Nebraska. Iowa State had
a 28-7 halftime lead on Kansas State before losing. And, while the
Cyclones lost their last five games, three came by a total of 10
points. Close losses to top teams give losing programs hope, even
if it might be false hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can play with \RNebraska\S and we think we can play
with anyone,'' Norris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so close last year,'' Iowa State senior quarterback
Sage Rosenfels said. ``We were right there in some games and should
have won some of those games. We just need to make a few more
plays, get a few bounces go our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches despise relying on fate. But for either Missouri, Kansas
or Iowa State to have a winning season and reach a bowl game, good
luck is a prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has injuries,'' said McCarney, whose team's goal is
the school's first bowl game since 1978. ``But for teams like us,
we can't afford to lose certain players. You need to have some
luck. That can make a difference between a winning and losing
season.''

PITCHING SAVES METS FROM THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The left side of the New York Mets infield will be
overhauled Saturday, when Mike Bordick arrives from Baltimore to
play shortstop and Robin Ventura returns from the disabled list to
reclaim his third-base job.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is a Gold Glover, and Bordick may be the best fielder
who has not won one. Asked what he brings to a team, Bordick said:
``In the field, hopefully just consistency. That's what I've
strived for my whole career _ make the plays when the ball's hit to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets will welcome that, because they know they cannot win
many more games the way they have the last two days. The Mets made
seven errors on Thursday but swept a doubleheader against the
Expos, and they beat the St. Louis Cardinals at Shea Stadium Friday
night, 3-2, despite two more errors in the late innings, one by
third baseman Lenny Harris and the other by shortstop Kurt Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets prevailed because of the pitching of Al Leiter and
three relievers, and one pickoff move. Leiter (11-4) worked seven
innings, striking out eight and allowing a run on three hits. The
bullpen _ which will also get a boost Saturday when the newly
acquired setup man Rick White arrives from Tampa Bay _ secured the
victory, with Armando Benitez earning his 24th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals trailed, 3-1, in the seventh when Eduardo Perez
hit a hard grounder in the hole between third and short. Abbott
ranged to his right and could not come up with the ball; it was
unjustly scored an error, manager Bobby Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded, and Leiter thought back two starts, to a
loss at Toronto. Frustrated with the umpire's ball-strike calls,
Leiter had grooved a pitch with the bases loaded and given up a
grand slam. This time, he stayed tough, striking out Mike Matheney
and inducing the pinch-hitter Craig Paquette to pop out, ending the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had that thought in my mind _ I'm not laying anything in
there,'' Leiter said. ``If I walk him, I walk him, but I'm not
giving in.''
</P>
<P>
   John Franco, who had not allowed a run in his last 13
appearances, relieved Leiter to start the eighth. But Franco was
not sharp, giving up two singles and retiring one hitter. Turk
Wendell came on to face the Cardinals' clean-up hitter, Fernando
Tatis, with runners at the corners. It was the perfect occasion for
Wendell's signature pickoff move, faking to third and then throwing
to first.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell perfected it three springs ago when the former pitching
coach Bob Apodaca told him his third-to-first move was horrible.
Taking the challenge, Wendell spent 20 minutes in the bullpen that
day, working solely on that move. Now, he picks off several runners
a year that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I do it, I chuckle _ there you go, 'Dac,'' Wendell
said. ``I might want to send him a videotape.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell had picked off a Montreal runner doing that on Thursday,
and he did it again Friday night, faking to third and spinning to
first to freeze Jim Edmonds, who crawled right into Todd Zeile's
tag for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis grounded to third, where Harris bobbled the ball, allowing
Fernando Vina to score to cut the Mets' lead to 3-2. But Wendell
blew a fastball by Eric Davis to end the inning, escaping further
harm.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets got all their runs in the second inning. Mike Piazza
hit a leadoff single, and Zeile followed with a walk. Benny
Agbayani then drove a pitch off the wall in right-center field,
scoring Piazza. A Jay Payton groundout brought in Zeile, and Abbott
flied to shallow center field.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds caught it and fired to home plate, where the bulky
Agbayani was bearing down on the catcher, Matheney. Edmonds' throw
took one hop and bounced off Matheney's body; a moment later,
Agbayani barreled into home.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds was credited with an assist, Matheney was charged with
an error and Agbayani's run gave the Mets a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Leiter, who snapped a personal three-start
losing streak and said he has overcome a ``dead-arm'' phase and had
probably his best stuff of the year Friday night. Valentine agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he threw as well as he's thrown all year,''
Valentine said. ``He was determined, free, he threw all his pitches
for strikes. It was a terrific effort by him, as well as by Turk
and Armando.'' &QL;

LESS WORK COULD MEAN MORE FOR TEXAS RUNNING BACK HODGES MITCHELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ In order for Texas tailback Hodges Mitchell
to play a more prominent role during the stretch run this season,
coaches plan to see less of him on a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's carries will be curtailed, coach Mack Brown said
yesterday, to enable the 5-foot-7, 185-pound senior to return punts
and be at his best in November and December. Last season, Mitchell
led the Longhorns in rushing with 1,343 yards on 256 attempts. He
averaged 5.2 yards per carry and scored nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But his two least-productive outings came in the Longhorns'
biggest games: a 22-6 loss to Nebraska in the Big 12 title game and
a 27-6 loss to Arkansas in the Southwestern Bell Cotton Bowl. In
those games, Mitchell combined to rush for 50 yards on 21 carries
(2.4 average). He had no run longer than 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find someone to give Hodges some rest. He had to
play too many plays last season,'' Brown said. ``He's a great back,
but he gave out by the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, Brown plans to create more playing time for
reserve tailbacks Ivan Williams, Kenny Hayter and Victor Ike.
Mitchell said he's on board with the decision, especially because
it means a return to the punt-return team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing too much when I was tired last year,'' said
Mitchell, who has a career average of 7.3 yards as a punt returner
but relinquished that role last season after cracking the starting
lineup. ``I need to be more of a game-breaking back, and you can't
do that when you're not fresh. I know I've got guys behind me who
can get the job done. I learned how to trust my fellow running
backs this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his small stature, Mitchell said his best opportunity
to turn the heads of NFL scouts rests with his skills as a punt
returner. Also, he conceded that Williams (6-1, 236 pounds) and
Hayter (5-11, 215) are better suited for running between the
tackles. Mitchell, meanwhile, operates best on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to enhance his elusiveness, the Dallas native has
lost 5 pounds since last season and hopes to trim to 181 by the
team's Sept. 9 opener against Louisiana-Lafayette. Mitchell said he
does not mind the reduced workload because he knows he's entrenched
as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My carries will go down a little bit. That's not a problem,''
said Mitchell, who also caught 32 passes for 342 yards last season.
``I'll get more touches on special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said he had ``no idea'' about an optimum number of
snaps he'll play each game. His marching orders, he said, are
simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I get tired, I'll come out. If the coaches feel they
need a change of pace, they'll take me out. That's OK,'' Mitchell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who watched his special teams struggle last season, likes
the arrangement as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best teams in the country return kicks and punts,'' Brown
said. ``Last year, I had to tell our punt-return team it wasn't
against the rules to return one farther than six yards. There
seemed to be some confusion about that. I think that's an area
where Hodges can really help us.''

COWBOYS' PLAN FOR PRESEASON OPENER: GO VERY BASIC, AVOID INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ As with any first preseason game, the
Cowboys have their share of mixed feelings about playing the
Pittsburgh Steelers tomorrow night at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In these early preseason games, NFL veteran players are just
trying to come away injury-free while coaches are trying to avoid
tipping their hand too much for when the games really count,
beginning Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is just going in there ``not'' to show anything,
proving once again that preseason is too long,'' quarterback Troy
Aikman said yesterday on the final full practice day of training
camp at Midwestern State University until Aug. 8, because of the
upcoming Tokyo trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to move the football against Pittsburgh _ I mean,
that's the objective _ yet we're doing it with a pretty scaled-back
version,'' Aikman said. ``I'm sure that \Rthe Steelers\S
defensively will scale back some of the things they will be doing
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones is aware that there is always a risk of
injury] in early preseason games because both rosters have an
optimum disparity of 1) highly paid veteran players and 2)
overzealous, young long shots.
</P>
<P>
   With Aikman slated to take 10 snaps, Jones said, ``We should be
thinking about protection ... leaving some \Rblockers\S in, if
there's any question at all. I want to protect Randall Cunningham
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is the Cowboys' highest-paid player at a little more than
$6 million a year. Cunningham will make $1 million this season as
Aikman's backup.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' starting guards are Jorge Diaz and Kelvin Garmon.
Solomon Page gets his first NFL start at right tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have to play some guys a little longer than they'd
normally play because we're banged up there,'' coach Dave Campo
said. ``We're going to be very generic.'' \Nsubheds:Ekuban goes
left Ebenezer Ekuban will make his first NFL start at left
defensive end. He finished last season at right end for the injured
Greg Ellis (broken leg, Dec. 12).
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, everything is backward,'' said Ekuban, who was a
tight end and primarily a right defensive end at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ekuban has added 90 pounds of strength in the weight
room this off-season, his forte is his speed rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``A right offensive tackle is more of a run blocker, so you
learn to get better angles on him because you know he's going to
sit back more,'' Ekuban said. ``He probably doesn't have the
footwork of a left tackle, or else he would be playing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ekuban calls his practice partner, Solomon Page, the exception.
The Cowboys' starting right offensive tackle has good footwork for
a 321-pound man. \Nsubheds:Injury update Barron Wortham, who is
competing for the starting middle linebacker job with Dat Nguyen
and Chris Bordano, went down with a knee injury in morning
practice. Wortham was taken to Dallas where he had arthroscopic
surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage damage. He is expected
to be out three to four weeks. Wortham started in 15 games for the
Tennessee Titans last year, including Super Bowl XXXIV. Running
back Emmitt Smith (big-toe sprain) doesn't have a serious injury,
but Dave Campo emphasized yesterday, ``We're going to be really
cautious on that.'' Smith is a game-time decision for tomorrow
night.

RANGERS' WETTLELAND PLAYING WAITING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ AND ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers closer John Wetteland has begun
clearing out his locker in anticipation of a trade before the
nonwaivers deadline Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His guitar, roller blades and most of his personal items are
gone. The only things remaining are his clothes and his Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can always bring your stuff back if it doesn't happen,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland might want to bring it back. Rangers GM Doug Melvin
said last night that it's less likely that the closer will be
traded. Although several clubs have called and expressed interest
in acquiring the reliever, Melvin said that deal isn't currently on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clubs that have interest, but for a rent-a-player,
clubs aren't as interested in giving up the kind of players I'm
looking for,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland has made no secret of the fact that he'd like to stay
in Texas but is stoic about a possible deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared, but I'm not resigned to it happening,''
Wetteland said. ``I'm not an emotional guy. You prepare for it one
way or another.'' OFF THE BENCH ... FOR GOOD?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto made his 22nd start of the season and his
first as a designated hitter for the Rangers on Friday, replacing
David Segui, who was traded before game time. With Segui traded to
Cleveland, Catalanotto is likely to get a chance to play every day,
something he hasn't had all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't play him at second (every day) when you've got one
of the best second basemen in the league this year (Luis Alicea),''
manager Johnny Oates said before the trade was announced. ``And
I've got a pretty good DH who's hitting about .350. So if you've
got any suggestions, I'm up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Segui deal allows Oates to get an extended look at
Catalanotto, who was hitting .380 in 49 appearances before last
night's game. But it also takes Catalanotto out of his role as the
American League's premier pinch hitter; his .450 pinch-hit average
leads the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty valuable coming off the bench,'' Oates said.
``It's nice to have that one at-bat whenever you want it every
night. It's like playing poker with a joker on the bottom of the
deck and you can pull it out whenever you want it. He's the best
player I've ever had coming off the bench, by far.'' MR.
VERSATILITY
</P>
<P>
   Shane Halter's .255 batting average, like the rest of his
statistics, is unremarkable. But the Tigers' utility man is the
major-league leader in versatility. The former University of Texas
player has played all nine positions in his three-year major-league
career _ eight of them this year. In fact, he has appeared this
season as a defensive replacement at six different positions
(first, second, third, shortstop, right field and catcher).
</P>
<P>
   The only spot Halter hasn't filled in 2000 is pitcher, and he's
already dropped hints to manager Phil Garner that he'd be available
to work an inning in a blowout. The Detroit newspapers have begun
lobbying to let him play all nine spots in a single game, a feat
accomplished only once in big-league history, by Bert Campaneris of
the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' said Halter, who pitched a scoreless

AYALA-TAPIA REMATCH BEING NEGOTIATED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ World Boxing Association bantamweight
champion Paulie Ayala of Fort Worth and his management team are
negotiating a rematch with former champion Johnny Tapia scheduled
for October, Boxing Management Inc. president Lester Bedford said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   An Ayala bout scheduled for Aug. 25 at TCU's Daniel-Meyer
Coliseum was canceled because of problems securing the venue,
Bedford said, but BMI is still targeting a fight for Ayala before
the possible rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tapia rematch is a real possibility,'' Bedford said. BMI
chairman Scott Sherman ``is negotiating with Tapia's manager,
Theresa Tapia, and with Top Rank.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, 30, defeated Tapia with a unanimous decision on June 26,
1999, for the WBA title. The match was voted ``Fight of the Year''
and Ayala earned ``Fighter of the Year'' honors from ``The Ring
Magazine''. Ayala defended his title with a unanimous decision
against former WBA No. 1 contender Saohin Condo on Oct. 23, in Fort
Worth and won by majority decision against Johnny Bredahl on March
4 in his most recent bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's being discussed, but it has not gone past the preliminary
stages,'' Top Rank spokesman Lee Samuels said. ``There is no
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala (30-1, 12 knockouts) said he chose not to risk his title
on an ABC fight card in June because no opponent was named two
weeks before the fight. After being turned down by featherweight
champion Naseem Hamed for a July bout, Ayala said he is eager to
get back in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't holding out,'' Ayala said. ``Things happen and fights
fall through. I'm the world champion, but things still happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the fans want to see me fight Johnny. I'm sure he wants
to fight me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayala made about $120,000 for each of his first two title
defenses. Bedford said a rematch with Tapia will surpass that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   ```This is an opportunity to make more money in a lot more
significant fight,'' Bedford said. ``Paulie could have fought on
August 25th if he wanted to, but we're looking for a major fight.''

CRUISING ROAD TO GOLD NOT WITHOUT POTHOLES FOR TEAM USA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are roving ambassadors. They are on the road from Central
Park to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, they also bring baggage.
</P>
<P>
   But if the lawyers, arbitrators and bitter former players will
kindly cease and desist, the U.S. Olympic softball team has a
mission to conclude.
</P>
<P>
   The women will stop at Gateway Park in Fort Worth, Texas, on
Saturday night on their way from ``Central Park to Sydney'' _ the
golden brick road, or so they dream.
</P>
<P>
   Despite two months of planes, trains and automobiles, Team USA
continues its scorched-earth march to the Games at Sydney. Four
summers ago, on a similar coast-to-coast pre-Olympic campaign, Team
USA outscored its opposition by a combined 449 runs to 3.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Saturday night's doubleheader, the tour's run
differential is a more humane 252-2.
</P>
<P>
   Gosh, ladies. Anything wrong?
</P>
<P>
   I'm only being partly facetious. For some of us, their 1996
performance _ played out on a field of dreams, of sorts, in
Columbus, Ga. _ was one of the feel-good moments of the Atlanta
Olympics. The home team defeated China, 2-1, to win the gold medal
in front of a sweating, standing-room-only crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The victory inspired uncommon spoils, like the night on David
Letterman's show when the host invited shortstop Dot Richardson out
onto the side street to hit a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think about was not breaking a window or putting a
dent in a Mercedes or somebody's limo,'' Richardson recalls.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't. But the four years since Atlanta haven't all been
soft stuff from Dave.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Richardson is a full-fledged surgeon now, but no longer
a shortstop. For 2 1/2 years, in fact, the most familiar face from
the 1996 team was told by Team USA that her services were no longer
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very difficult, feeling unwanted,'' Richardson
remembered. ``I was hurt. But I think everything happens for a
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   There are theories about why Richardson was left off the team.
The most likely is that Dot had been a part of the national team
for so long _ she played in the Pan Am Games as a 17-year-old in
1979 _ it was time to push her from the nest and see if both could
function without the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a sign, too, that maybe I should focus on
medicine more,'' said Dr. Richardson, now a practicing orthopedic
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a funny thing happened while Dr. Dot was off examining
rotator cuffs and kneecaps. Team USA found its veneer of
invincibility shattered, losing to Australia three times.
</P>
<P>
   Something wasn't working. Later, Richardson's teammates would
tell her how much her presence was missed.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson tells a tale from late-1998 about working a 24-hour
shift in the surgical intensive care unit and then having to drive
three hours to San Diego, without sleep, for what could have been
her one last Team USA tryout. If she got sleepy and had to pull
over to the side of the road, Dot decided, it was a sign that it
was time to give up softball.
</P>
<P>
   She made it, wide awake. She's been a part of the team ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been anything but a smooth homecoming. A former
longtime national team player, Julie Smith, was passed over for the
Olympic team and appealed the process that was used to select the
team. Smith reportedly has claimed that she was left off because
coach Ralph Raymond doesn't like her.
</P>
<P>
   When an arbitrator ordered the team re-selected, an alternate
who was dropped from the squad appealed, forcing yet another
arbitrator's ruling that the roster needed to be redrawn again.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, Smith still wasn't on the team. On Thursday
night, in fact, she went 0-for-3 for the professional Ohio Pride in
a 2-0 exhibition loss to the Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Richardson plays in Smith's old position at second
base. Team USA's shortstop is now the power-hitting prodigy Crystyl
Bustos.
</P>
<P>
   The team might not be rapping out the timely singles and doubles
that Raymond would like. But the pitching staff has thrown 35
shutouts in 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   Their so-called ``Central Park to Sydney'' tour has had its
other moments, like the night in Worcester, Mass., when Richardson
was called out of the dugout to assist a fan who had collapsed. The
man, a 70-year-old former softball umpire, had stopped breathing
and showed no pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson gave him CPR and then stayed with the man until the
ambulance drove away. Later, Dot and the team learned that the man
died.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of tour.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, it will be a stern test for the U.S. women to repeat
against the hometown Aussies. But as Richardson said, they like
their chances, and those who go to see them Saturday at Gateway
Park should be similarly impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Now playing shortstop, Crystl Bustos. Park your limos at your
own risk. nn

DOGERS GET VICTORY BY DESIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This is what the Los Angeles Dodgers thought they
had last season, and what they hoped would eventually shine through
this one. Not just a dynamic one-two combo in starting pitching,
but a third wheel as well.
</P>
<P>
   It's also what the Dodgers need after the Arizona Diamondbacks
got Curt Schilling. They need the development of Chan Ho Park and
Darren Dreifort to turn into results if postseason aspirations are
to remain.
</P>
<P>
   And the seven innings of two-hit ball Dreifort (7-7) threw in
Friday's 2-0 Dodgers win against the Philadelphia Phillies is a
continuation of what's been sweet post All-Star success.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was unhittable for five innings, and then battled
through his last two innings before the bullpen worked to design,
with Mike Fetters pitching the eighth and re-crowned Jeff Shaw
closing the ninth for his 16th save.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the second straight outing in which Dreifort allowed
two hits in seven shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we like it Dreif pitching seven, (Fetters)
pitching the eighth and me pitching the ninth,'' Shaw said. ``You
can't write it any better than that, and Dreif, good God! I'll tell
you what. The last two games, he's been unhittable. When he throws
his true slider it just seems to get to the plate and disappear. It
goes straight down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, Brown and Park are 7-0 in their past seven starts, and
that could improve with Brown and Park set to pitch the final two
games of this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (55-47) have won five of six and 10 of 13 and
matched a season-high by being eight games over .500, which they
were May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen (Dreifort) good in spurts before, but his ball was
down all night,'' said Phillies manager Terry Francona. ``We've
seen him good, but tonight, 'Wow.' `'
</P>
<P>
   When Dreifort has problems, as he did during the 10-start
stretch before the All-Star break in which he went 1-6 with a 7.51
ERA, everyone gets so frustrated because of his high ceiling. His
arm is awesome, and overpowering.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Davey Johnson said sometimes Dreifort's mentality
works against him. Yet, there are nights like this one against the
Phillies in which Dreifort pitches wonderfully, rather than
throwing uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about overthrowing,'' Johnson said. ``You've got guys
with good arms, and when they come out there and overthrow, it
takes away from their stuff because they can't locate as well. He
likes dominate people and he likes to strike people out.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning his third straight start, Dreifort extended his
scoreless innings streak to 18, dating back to Pittsburgh's Brian
Giles' third-inning home run on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, who walked two and struck out six, didn't allow a hit
until Mickey Morandini's two-out double in the sixth inning, and
his only jam was the seventh. Scott Rolen led off with a single and
Pat Burrell walked, but pinch-hitter Rico Brogna grounded into a
double play and Brian Jordan grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Catcher) Chad Kreuter did a great job behind the plate again,
calling a game and blocking balls, and we had some real nice
defensive plays out there,'' said Dreifort, who is 3-0 with a 1.29
ERA in his past three starts. ``We had two big ones in the seventh
with (Kevin) Elster and (Mark) Grudzielanek. (Adrian) Beltre made
some nice plays at third. (Eric) Karros made a nice play in the
hole, Shawn Green made a nice catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Omar Daal, a former Dodger who was acquired by
the Phillies in the Schilling deal, wasn't too shabby, but his own
defensive blunder cost him.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded in the third, Karros popped up in front of
the mound. Daal said he called first baseman Pat Burrell off, but
then didn't catch the ball and Mark Grudzielanek scored. Adrian
Beltre added an RBI-single to right field to give the Dodgers a 2-0
lead, but there was also an alarming moment.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star left fielder Gary Sheffield got his left leg
momentarily pinned while catcher Tom Prince allegedly tagged him
out. Sheffield, who leads the Dodgers with a .340 average, 34
homers and 87 RBI, fell and grabbed his left knee. The pain went
away there, but his left ankle was also injured. Sheffield remained
in the game, and afterward said his left ankle was sore, but not
enough to keep him out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be as good as our starting pitching,'' Karros
said. ``Any team (is like that). It's why the Giants have had such
a great run, why went out and got a pitcher. You see all the teams
that are making moves, they're going out and getting a pitcher.''

CUBS WERE READY TO DUMP VALDES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA -- The Los Angeles Dodgers are counting on
right-hander Ismael Valdes to bolster the pitching staff with about
10 quality starts, and the risk is minimal because of how little
the Dodgers gave up to get him.
</P>
<P>
   However, his price tag could've been even smaller. Valdes'
relationship - and his pitching - with the Chicago Cubs was so bad
that several baseball sources said the Cubs would have released the
26-year-old right-hander if he wasn't traded by Monday's 9 p.m.
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the same pitcher he was last season with the
Dodgers,'' one scout said. ``If he was, it would be a steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, acquired Wednesday for Triple-A pitcher Jamie Arnold and
Single-A outfielder Jorge Piedra, finally met up with the Dodgers
on Friday in Philadelphia and was told he would start Monday in
Pittsburgh against right-hander Jose Silva.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes rejected a multi-year deal by the Dodgers before the 1999
season. Then, and after he and Eric Young were traded to the Cubs
after the 1999 season, he signed a one-year deal worth $5.8 million
and was poised to become one of the marquee free agents of the 2000
class if he had a big year in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Valdes fizzled. Injuries have limited him to 12 starts
this season. He's 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA with the Cubs, missing starts
because of a shoulder ailment, a sore hamstring and his
ever-present blister problem. It was so bad the Cubs paid $500,000
of the remaining $2 million on Valdes' contract to move him.
(Valdes said he's conquered his blister problem by exercising it in
a bucket of rice every day.)
</P>
<P>
   That comes on top of the Dodgers' public comments that Valdes
didn't have the toughness and heart to grow into the No.1 or No.2
starter they believed he could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control whether they say you're one thing or
another,'' said Valdes, who was 61-54 with a 3.38 ERA in 176 games
for the Dodgers. ``The only thing you can control is to do your
best on the mound. That's all you can do. Even though it didn't
work out the way I wanted it to, I'm healthy and ready to go. I
believe what happened in the past is already buried in the past.
This is a new life, a new year, a new day. I don't waste my time
thinking in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' agent, Jim Bronner, wouldn't discuss whether the pitcher
was seeking a contract extension from the Dodgers, but it also
doesn't matter. General manager Kevin Malone said contracts won't
be discussed during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't discussed that and we didn't plan on it,'' Malone
said. ``We'll see how he pitches during these final two months.
We'll discuss a contract when the time is proper.''
</P>
<P>
   But since the trade, Valdes has told people close to him he
would consider re-signing with the Dodgers, something unheard of a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mind is set to finish strong,'' Valdes said. ``I'm
not worried about anything else. If I take care of step one, I
think everything else will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies sign UCLA star: Chase Utley, a standout at UCLA and the
15th overall pick by the Phillies in last month's amateur draft,
agreed to a contract that includes a $1.78 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Utley, who will report to short-season Single-A Batavia of the
New York-Penn League on Monday, batted .342 with 53 homers and 174
RBI in 179 games for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to fail,'' Utley said. ``I'm confident in myself.
I wanted to play from day one. We just finally reached a point
where I could get to come out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Catcher Todd Hundley felt the effects of
returning after a 15-game absence Thursday at Colorado, so Chad
Kreuter caught right-hander Darren Dreifort. Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said Hundley would catch Kevin Brown today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't catch for a month and you get back there in Colorado
for three hours ... you feel like you've been run over by a
truck,'' Johnson said. ... Right fielder Shawn Green's problems at
the plate continued. He went 0 for 3 and his average has dropped to
.279.

TRADE TALKS ARE UNSETTLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia doesn't
anticipate the club making a major deal before the Monday trading
deadline, but acknowledges the rumors of who might be traded can
sometimes be unsettling in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have a sense of uneasiness,'' Scioscia said before
Friday night's game against the Chicago White Sox at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, the reality is, it's out of their control, and most
realize it and don't fret about it. They know that this is a
business and, that no matter who you are, you can be traded.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia didn't dismiss the possibility the Angels may make a
lesser deal, just not a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is primarily our group anyway,'' he said. ``This is our
core unit. This team isn't going to be blown up July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to make one deal that will totally redesign
this club. After the (trading) deadline the mental state of this
club won't change one way or another. I don't expect any major
trades.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Hatcher in a halo: The Angels did make one minor-league
deal Friday, swapping right-hander Brett Hinchliffe and infielder
Keith Luuloa to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for outfielder-first
baseman Chris Hatcher, right-hander Mike Heathcott and infielder
Brett King.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the deal as far as the Angels were concerned is the
31- year-old Hatcher, who was hitting .278 with 24 home runs and 71
runs batted in for Triple-A Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good outfielder with a big right-handed bat,'' Scioscia
said of Hatcher, who played briefly in the big leagues in 1998 with
Kansas City and, earlier that year, hit 46 home runs at Triple-A
Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Scioscia added, ``before I agreed to the deal I made
sure he didn't have the same genealogy as Mickey Hatcher.''
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Mickey Hatcher is Scioscia's longtime buddy,
not to mention the Angels' hitting coach.
</P>
<P>
   One of those nights: Catcher Bengie Molina had one of those ...
well, just call it a rough game Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   At the plate Molina was 0 for 3. But it was behind the plate
where he had his darkest moments.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, when Chicago's leadoff hitter, Ray Durham,
stole second Molina's throw was a little off the mark. It hit the
pitcher, Brian Cooper. And in the fourth inning Molina was charged
with a passed ball, which was especially ill-timed: there was a
runner on third base at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, a catcher himself for 13 years in the big leagues,
quickly came to Molina's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a few throws like that,'' Scioscia said. ``But, yeah,
Bengie was a little awkward on that throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, Bengie's been very consistent, so consistent
that when something like happens you stop and say, `Gosh, what
happened?'
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so consistent that he spoils you. He's fine.''

WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As the Southern California Summer Pro
League playoffs kicked off at the Pyramid on Friday afternoon, more
than one interested observer watched from the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   As former Long Beach State players Marcus Johnson and Tommy
Davis led Team West Coast to a win over Nutriola, there was a look
of happiness and agony on the face of Everett Ratleff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's kind of hard to watch. That's why I haven't been
here around too much,'' said Ratleff, who played at Long Beach
Jordan and Long Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   Ratleff was a guard for coach Ron Massey as Jordan won two CIF
Southern Section I-AA titles.
</P>
<P>
   He then decided to attend Long Beach State, where his father,
Ed, was a standout in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ratleff, a 6-foot-2 shooting guard, found himself
caught in a numbers' game, stuck behind All-Big West Conference
pick James Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 49ers coach Seth Greenberg preferred using taller
wing players in his offense and tried to move Ratleff to the point
guard position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a numbers thing. I didn't feel like my game was
developing because I had to switch positions and then I didn't play
a lot. It was really frustrating,'' said Ratleff, who also endured
criticism for having a bad attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it seemed that way to people, and it's true, I wasn't
happy, but I always worked hard and did what the coaching staff
asked me to do. It just wasn't working out. Then, when it looked
like Schea (Cotton) might transfer here, I decided to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he would have to sit out a year if he transferred to
another Division I school, Ratleff took his remaining eligibility
and ended up at Caldwell College in Idaho, a Division II school
near Boise, far away from the Southern California lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caldwell is really nice,'' said Ratleff. ``The area is more
integrated than you might think and the people are really nice. It
was a fun place to play because we ran an uptempo offense and
everyone got a lot of touches. My game really grew there.''
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with the fact he had a young daughter back in Southern
California, Ratleff knew his dreams of a professional basketball
career would probably die out in Idaho. So after receiving his
degree in physical education, he returned to the southland, eager
to jumpstart his career.
</P>
<P>
   He signed up with the sports management group founded by Magic
Johnson and former NFL defensive end Sean Jones. While at Johnson's
camp last year, Ratleff suffered a partial tear of the medial
collateral ligament in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   For Ratleff, who had never endured a serious injury, it was a
humbling experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was, trying to come back and then I got hurt. I wasn't
sure what to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ratleff sits and watches his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am playing, but my knees are not 100 percent. I didn't want
to come here (to the summer league) and not be at my best, so I am
still working on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of his father, friends and a new agent, Ratleff
hopes to land a contract, though most likely it will be overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my buddies - Marcus (Johnson), Eric Brown, Akili (Jackson)
- went overseas and seemed to do well. I know I can play. I'll be
back, and even better than I was before,'' he said. &QL; 
Playoff results
</P>
<P>
   Despite a game-high 39 points from Kendrick Johnson, Nutriola
was upset by Team West Coast in the first quarterfinal game.
</P>
<P>
   Former Long Beach State player Marcus Johnson had 10 points.

HILL TURNS A CLOSE SHAVE IN THE NINTH INTO A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  (This story replaces original story, which was sent in error) 
By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Glenallen Hill came to the Yankees with his hair
styled in short braids, and it was not long before he felt out of
place. The vast majority of the Yankees wear conservative haircuts,
very simple and short _ a reflection, Hill thought, of the team's
serious approach.
</P>
<P>
   So he shaved his head, wanting to make sure he would not draw
attention to himself. In his first game with his new look, he
became the center of attention, blasting a game-winning pinch-hit
grand slam off Minnesota's Bob Wells Friday night as the Yankees
overcame a blown save by Mariano Rivera to beat the Twins, 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada had four hits, including his 17th home run, and
first baseman Tino Martinez had three hits. Rivera improved his
record to 4-3 with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is the latest in a series of additions the Yankees have
made, along with: Denny Neagle, who pitched effectively into the
eighth inning; David Justice, who spurred the ninth-inning rally
with a double; and Jose Vizcaino, who started at second base.
``Their payroll is $150 million,'' said Brad Radke, a Twins pitcher
who was furious. ``What do you expect? They should win every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez said: ``Hopefully, this will propel us on a big
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   They won this game, unexpectedly, after giving away a two-run
lead in the bottom of the eighth. The Yankees led, 4-2, when Midre
Cummings pinch-hit to begin the bottom of the inning;
interestingly, Cummings was traded with Neagle from Minnesota to
Pittsburgh in 1992. Neagle walked Cummings and Denny Hocking on
close pitches. After Neagle was relieved by Yankees manager Joe
Torre, Neagle stalked off the mound screaming out of the side of
his mouth at the home plate umpire Chuck Meriwether, his head aimed
straight ahead at the dugout, until he shot a withering glance at
the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton took over and struck out Cristian Guzman and Matt
Lawton. Jeff Nelson relieved Stanton and walked Ron Coomer, after
Coomer fouled off three pitches with a full count. Rivera took
over, and David Ortiz rolled a two-run single through the middle to
tie the game. Jay Canizaro then pulled a single to right, driving
home Coomer with the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill led off the ninth with a single off the left-hander
Travis Miller, setting off a series of changes by the managers, and
changes to counter the changes. LaTroy Hawkins relieved Miller and
retired Bernie Williams on a fly to center field, and Eddie
Guardado replaced Hawkins to face back-to-back left-handed hitters,
Justice and Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Justice foiled the strategy by ripping a line drive into the gap
and the ball bounced over the fence _ unluckily for the Yankees,
because O'Neill would have probably scored if the ball had stayed
in play.
</P>
<P>
   Guardado fell behind Martinez three balls and no strikes before
he completed the walk intentionally, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Delgado was inserted as a pinch-runner for Martinez at
first, and when Delgado took some time to warm up, Twins manager
Tom Kelly emerged from the dugout to call for Bob Wells to face
Posada. Posada ripped a single through the middle and O'Neill
scored, tying the game. Justice was held at third.
</P>
<P>
   Hill came in as a pinch-hitter for Clay Bellinger and fell
behind no balls and two strikes. Wells threw perhaps the only pitch
Hill would have bashed in that situation, a fastball down the
middle _ and Hill launched a high drive to straightaway center.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle, Nelson and Stanton began yelling happily in the Yankees'
clubhouse, watching on television as Hill dropped his bat and
stared at the ball, knowing it would clear the fence, and swaggered
around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   His new teammates shouted and clapped and rushed to the front of
the visitors' dugout. This was the sort of attention Hill wants to
draw.

ANGELS WIN WITH BIG SIXTH INNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Another rocky start, another wild comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Angels baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time, the Anaheim Angels actually won one,
storming from behind to slow the runaway Chicago White Sox, 10-7,
Friday night before a roaring Edison Field crowd of 40,711.
</P>
<P>
   The win, the result of a rousing seven-run sixth inning - which
was launched with Tim Salmon's leadoff homer and was capped by Mo
Vaughn's thunderous three-run homer on a 3-0 pitch - enabled the
Angels to avert their fourth loss in a row, which would have been
the season's longest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do whatever we have to do to get the win,'' Vaughn said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' 25th come-from-behind win did not, however, ease
concern over their starting pitching, which has been slapped around
freely for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hill was the latest. He had something less than what you'd
call a quality start - seven runs on 11 hits, one of them a home
run, in just 5 innings - but he's hardly been alone.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven games, Angels starters have given up 39 runs
in 33 innings, a much too high earned-run average of 10.43, and
they've been whacked for 66 hits, including 31 the last two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was banged around for five runs in the second inning and
two more in the sixth when the White Sox opened a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' manager Mike Scioscia was quick to point out, ``give
some credit to Hill. He put up some 0's (after the White Sox'
five-run second) and gave us a chance to get close.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Vaughn noted, ``You don't want to keep getting into
those situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 5-0, the Angels got two runs in the bottom of the
second, and Garrett Anderson, who had three of the Angels' 10 hits,
hit his 30th homer to lead off the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels were still trailing, 7-3, entering the bottom of
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon's leadoff homer got the Angels started. Singles by
Anderson, Bengie Molina and Adam Kennedy followed, and the Angels
were within two, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's single knocked out Chicago starter Mike Sirotka, but
reliever Kevin Beirne hit pinch hitter Scott Spiezio with his first
pitch to load the bases for Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad got one run home with a sacrifice fly to center, then
Kevin Stocker singled home Kennedy with the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn quickly untied it, unloading homer No. 26 into the
center-field seats for a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys have the green light on 3-0,'' Scioscia said,
``but Mo's at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' bullpen - Mike Fyhrie, Mike Holtz, Shigetoshi
Hasegawa and Troy Percival - restricted the free-swinging White Sox
to just two hits the final 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz (1-2) benefited from the Angels' seven-run explosion in
the bottom half for his first win. Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth
for his 24th save.
</P>
<P>
   For the second successive night everybody in the Chicago lineup
had at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels, it turned out, got the bigger hits, handing the
White Sox their fifth loss in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's homer gave the Angels two players with 30 or more
homers for only the third time in club history (Troy Glaus also has
30). Don Baylor (36) and Bobby Grich (30) hit 30 or more in 1979,
and Salmon (34) and Jim Edmonds (33) had 30 or more in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have never had three 30-plus homer sluggers the same
season, though after Friday night Vaughn has 26 and Salmon 22.

GARCIA BAGS BLUE JAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM CAPLE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As the July trade deadline approaches and rumors fill
local coffee houses, dot.com offices _ and yes, the Mariners
clubhouse _ consider Seattle's 7-4 victory over the Blue Jays
Friday night a helpful reminder of the good and the bad that can
result from such deals.
</P>
<P>
   There was Jose Cruz Jr., the former first-rounder sent to
Toronto at the trade deadline in 1997 for Mike Timlin and Paul
Spoljaric. He crushed a three-run homer in the third inning, giving
the Blue Jays an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   More pleasantly for Mariners fans, there was Freddy Garcia, who
came to Seattle with Carlos Garcia and John Halama for Randy
Johnson at the deadline in 1998. He pitched his fifth consecutive
solid game to earn his first victory since returning from the
disabled list. And there was Robert Ramsay, who came to the
Mariners for Butch Huskey near last year's deadline, striking out
three of the four batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron, who came to the Mariners in February's Ken Griffey
Jr. trade, scored two runs and drove in two.
</P>
<P>
   The victory ended a mini-crisis _ a whopping three-game losing
streak _ and extended Seattle's lead back to four games. It also
left the clubhouse a little livelier than after previous games.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough anxiety about possible trades in the normally
calm Seattle clubhouse that manager Lou Piniella said after the
Thursday night loss that he might have a talk with his players.
After the victory last night, he said there was no need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked through you guys,'' he said to the reporters
surrounding his desk. ``They read the newspapers. Listen to the
radio. Watch TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit trying time, but at the same time, it's part
of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And always cause for speculation among fans and media.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one I remember is the Mark Langston trade for Randy
Johnson,'' said Ramsay, who grew up in Vancouver, Wash. ``Langston
was their top gun, and everyone was disappointed they got rid of
their ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did, too, but the fans don't understand when there's a trade
like that. They just think, `Oh, you're not getting a guy with much
major league experience.' But these guys know what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners certainly did when they traded Johnson, when
effectively forced to deal the lefty two years ago. Garcia won 17
games last year and seems back in form since returning from the
disabled list just before the break.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia allowed four runs _ all in the third inning _ and struck
out a season-high eight batters for his first victory since April
16, the start before he left the game with a hairline fracture in
his right leg. He has a 2.50 earned-run average since returning
from his long stay on the DL, and said he feels better now than
before the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia shut down the Blue Jays with little trouble in every
inning but the third, when Toronto scored all four of its runs,
three coming on Cruz's 22nd home run, to right field. He recovered
after that, holding Toronto scoreless the next three innings, and
left with two out, two on and Cruz up in the seventh inning. ``I
made adjustments and came back after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay took over and struck out Cruz to end the inning, then
struck out two more in a 1-2-3 eighth, setting up Kazu Sasaki for
his single-season, club-record 15th consecutive save. Sasaki hasn't
blown a save opportunity since June 20.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, which scored only three runs in its previous two games,
didn't exactly put on a hitting display. Trailing 4-3, the Mariners
took a 6-4 lead in the fourth inning with a rally that was more
effective than dramatic, scoring three runs on two singles, an
error, two walks, a hit batter and a fielder's choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' final five runs scored on a sacrifice fly, a walk,
a hit batter, and two groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works. Sometimes,'' Piniella said. ``But there's nothing
wrong with a bases-loaded clearing double, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade deadline is Monday afternoon, which can't come soon
enough for the Mariners. Said Edgar Martinez: ``It's always a
relief when the deadline passes.''

PANEL STAYS FIRM ON ANTIABORTION PLANK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes headline)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican Party platform committee Friday
rejected a proposal to remove the anti-abortion plank, and then
refused to adopt proposed new language saying that the GOP respects
the views of abortion-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The action left embattled abortion rights advocates with only
two options: they can try to muster support for adoption of a
minority report that would call for support of abortion, or they
can try to bring the measure to the convention floor with the
support of six state delegations.
</P>
<P>
   In votes that appeared to confuse some of the 107 members of the
platform committee, the panel briefly adopted language for the
abortion plank that said: ``We welcome people on all sides of a
complex issue.'' But when some abortion opponents said the vote was
confusing and that similar but more general language is already in
the platform, the measure was defeated on a second vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to be welcomed into the party for about 10
minutes,'' said Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice after the two
votes were recorded. Stone, who early in the day all but vowed to
take the matter to the floor, sounded less certain Friday night,
saying a floor fight was an option. She said she would try to round
up support for a minority report, which would require the
signatures of one-fourth of the platform members.
</P>
<P>
   Acting by voice vote, the panel, dominated by conservative
members, overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to have the party
remain silent on abortion. By doing so, the committee was following
the wishes of the nominee-in-waiting, George W. Bush, who has said
the anti-abortion plank's call for a ``Human Life Amendment'' to
the Constitution should remain unchanged. While the Human Life
Amendment is not defined in the platform, most versions of it only
allow abortion when the life of the mother is at stake. Bush, by
contrast, supports exceptions for rape and incest as well as to
save the life of the mother .
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates tried in several ways to win some
measure of support. Earlier in the day, they asked a subcommittee
to approve language that said the party ``recognizes and respects''
the views of those who favor abortion rights. But the measure was
rejected 10-3 by the subcommittee and was later defeated by the
full committee.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of the platform
committee, expressed shock Friday after being informed that the
abortion rights activists might try to take the issue to the floor.
If a majority of the delegates in six states agree, any issue may
be brought to the floor against the wishes of the party leadership.
While such a step would be difficult, abortion rights activists
said they might have enough votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, then I won't have done my job,'' said
Thompson, who is under strict orders from the Bush campaign to
avoid a public fight on abortion, especially one that might erupt
on the floor and interrupt the party's carefully planned unity
message. The Thompson forces might, however, support the issuance
of a minority report in order to avoid a floor fight. The
possibility of such a fight remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee, and the subcommittee that took up the
issue earlier, were designed by GOP leaders to be dominated by
anti-abortion activists, many of whom made clear they would brook
no compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm under the authority of the Creator of the Universe and he
is pro-life and always has been,'' said delegate Meribelle Bolton
of New Mexico. ``I am pro-life and nothing anyone can say will
change that position.''
</P>
<P>
   But Toni Casey of Los Altos Hills, Calif., decided to try
anyway. She proposed deleting the abortion language, urging her
colleagues on the subcommittee to stay silent on an issue ``that
divides us.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey urged the delegates to adopt language recognizing that
some Republicans disagree about abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would any of you object to recognizing there are diverse
views?'' Casey said. ``This platform does not even reflect the
position of our candidate, George W. Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, who is well known for
his anti-abortion views, led the fight against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should affirm that there are no insignificant
members of the human family, even though they are tiny and out of
sight,'' Hyde said during the meeting of the full platform
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee dealt with many other issues as well,
although none appeared as divisive as abortion. While the platform
upholds many of the party's conservative positions, it has a more
muted tone than past recent documents. For example, it deletes a
1996 plank that called for elimination of the Department of
Education. When some delegates tried to restore that plank in a
subcommittee Friday, the effort was quickly defeated by the allies
of Bush, who has said the federal government must play a more
activist role in helping improve the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   The platform is also somewhat more moderate than the 1996
document in removing language calling for English to be declared
the nation's official language, and denying some social services to
immigrants. Left unchanged was the party's official view against
same-sex marriage. A platform panel voted Friday to add language
opposing special civil rights protections for gays.

</P>
<P>
   RE: Selling the '50s and '60s &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Returning to the office after lunch today, I was nearly run down
by a middle-aged guy braying into a cell phone while he rolled down
Lexington Avenue on a kick scooter.
</P>
<P>
   My first thought was that they were filming one of those Comedy
Central commercials that ridicule baby boomers. But I was
astonished to learn that these scooters have become all the rage,
as we used to say back in those odd and ancient days when J. Edgar
Hoover was considered a tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   Seems this latest trendlet started in Japan and spread to the
San Francisco Bay area, where the Internet hyped it eastward. Kick
scooters evidently sell to a bifurcated market: college kids and
adults born roughly between 1946 and 1964 (OK, and small children,
too). The fad is said to be driven by baby boomer nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, excuuuuse me, boys and girls. Please allow a charter baby
boomer (b. 1946) to provide some historical context here. I was
maybe 10 when kick scooters started showing up. I forget whether
this was around the time baseball gloves stopped resembling quilted
oven mitts and developed useful webbing. Incidentally, how did Pee
Wee Reese ever  &UR; catch  &LR;  a grounder with one of those muffins?
Anyway, what was I saying? Oh, right:  &UR; Kick scooters were
considered ridiculous and without practical value even in the
1950s! &LR;  You know what we yelled when some kid scooted by? ``Hey,
pal! Get a bike!''
</P>
<P>
   And do you know what I was really thinking today when I saw that
50-year-old scuffing past on a $200 designer kick scooter?
Geriatric skateboard! I swear, I mulled over the idea of calling
the Hemlock Society for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   We aging baby boomers are constantly hearing advertisers and
marketers babble about our growing irrelevance. At the same time,
we've watched the popular culture that we created, as we bulged our
demographic mass through the '50s, '60s and '0s, devour itself.
Music, television, movies, attitudes, fashion, fads and philosophy
_ marketers have strip-mined the whole baby boom landscape. We're
scraping bottom now, folks. Last month it was capri pants _
remember pedal pushers? And now it's  &UR; kick scooters? &LR;  Give me a
break! This is a culture running on fumes!
</P>
<P>
   But who am I to argue with the pop market? Where there is a
trend, there is a fee. So let's free-associate here and tweak some
other candidates for profitable exhumation from the baby boom
graveyard:
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Betsy Wetsy Meets Depends.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``The Revenge of Winky Dink.'' Remember the 1950's cartoon
program that sold plastic sheets that stuck on the television
screen so you could use crayon on it during the show? Imagine the
fun that a Winky Dink 2000 can offer cranky boomers watching
programs like ``The Capital Gang''!
</P>
<P>
   Try Cinerama computer monitors (three screens, thus tripling
sales).
</P>
<P>
   Flagg Flyers 2000. Remember those 50's men's dress shoes with
the leather-covered metal snap that replaced laces and were popular
for about three weeks? Reposition them as safety shoes: No More
Dangerous Bending Over to Tie Laces.
</P>
<P>
   Or appeal to the active lifestyle market and bring back beverage
cans that have to be pierced with a pointy opener called a church
key? Think aerobic exercise!
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``Mitch Miller Rapz.''
</P>
<P>
   Or cowboy outfits (``Draw your Palm Pilot and cell phone from
them holsters, pardner!'').
</P>
<P>
   How about a Mental Hygiene Classroom Films Festival? Hold it in
Telluride, maybe get the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to
have an awards dinner honoring classics like ``Is This Love?''
(1957); ``Girls Beware'' (1961); ``Highways of Agony'' (1969); and
the ``Citizen Kane'' of the classroom genre, ``Duck and Cover''
(1951).
</P>
<P>
   ``Duck and Cover'' featured Bert, the wise cartoon turtle who
warned, ``Always remember, the flash from the atomic bomb can come
at any time!'' Sporting a tin-pot civil defense helmet, Bert was
serenaded in the film by a jingle that suggested he was going to be
OK in the event of a thermonuclear blast. Bert ``never got hurt,''
the jingle went, because ``he knew just what to do. He'd duck! And
cover!''
</P>
<P>
   I've decided to skip this afternoon's marketing meeting. Just
brainstorm on your own, folks. Afterward, anybody who wants to do
some strategizing, I'll be home, sipping a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon
in my fallout shelter.

<P>
   Not since Anita Bryant has a morality-minded woman been the
target of as much vitriol as Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the
conservative radio talk-show therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Laura,'' whose audience is estimated at 18 million, is
best known just now for having stated her belief that homosexuality
is wrong, to which gay rights groups have responded by lobbying
corporations to pull their advertisements from her radio show and
upcoming television series.
</P>
<P>
   She is a woman of many opinions, however, and has managed to
offend everybody from librarians and psychologists to witches and
vegetarians. In the process, she has spawned a virtual industry of
Web sites devoted to mocking, reviling or simply haranguing her _
often with the same blunt mean-spiritedness they complain of
regarding the good doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Herewith a sampling of online commentary.
</P>
<P>
   _ By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Recently, after nude photos of Dr. Laura
circulated on the Internet, one viewer wrote: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so much interested in what she looks like. I just want
to see that she just might be a human being after all.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``How Could You Do That?! The Abdication
of Character, Courage, and Conscience'' (HarperCollins, 1996), Dr.
Laura writes: ``Acknowledging that you are basically the
perpetrator of your mess of a life is admittedly very upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her therapeutic method, however, consists largely of browbeating
hapless callers into making that admission, or listening to Dr.
Laura make it for them, a phenomenon that seems to hold some
fascination for many Laura haters, or at least those who correspond
with Dr. Laura Watch
(either.or.com/(tilde)chansen/least-fav/dr-laura-watch.html). (END
ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The most amazing thing about this woman is how I find myself
masochistically tuning her in sometimes, wanting to be enraged by
her. Perhaps this is some MORAL FLAW in my liberal personality?
</P>
<P>
   Driving home this afternoon, I heard our local Laura affiliate
(760 AM KFMB) run a promo spot for the Doc's show. It was one of
those spots that takes a small sound bite from the program. Went
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: . . . and you actually let him do that?!?!
</P>
<P>
   Male Caller: Well, we try to encourage him . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: (Abruptly cutting him off in her inimitable style)
ENCOURAGE HIM?!?!? What do you mean encourage him?! There's NO
ENCOURAGEMENT at my house! There are only rules!!
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In the September 1997 issue of Current
Biography, Dr. Laura says: ``I do not see it as my mission to make
anybody feel better, I want them to get better.'' Janice Leber, the
creator of a Web site called The Moral Irresponsibility of ``Dr.''
Laura (www.sonomacountyfreepress.org/liver/dr-laura .html),
describes Dr. Laura's preferred treatment: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   1. What is your moral dilemma? (Your answer is unimportant.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Why are you so stupid as to have created this problem? (Your
response will be disjointed.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Yes, you DID create this problem. Examine your behavior to
this point. (Any sound you utter will be mocked. You will fall
silent.)
</P>
<P>
   4. This behavior marks you as an irresponsible, immoral jerk.
(You will object.)
</P>
<P>
   5. I can't take your whining any more. Next call. (You will be
cut off.)
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) ``Killjoy,'' who wrote this spoof which can
be found on the Dr. Laura Parody Pages
(www.geocities.com/Soho/Studios/7141/laura.htm), took a similar
tack: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Uh, OK . . . Well, my wife and I have been married for
fourtee_
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: You're having marital problems, aren't you, Phil? You
and your wife have been together quite some time, and you're having
problems, aren't you? This is not a healthy relationship right now.
You can't go on like this with your wife.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Um, yeah. You see, we've been having trouble
communicating. When I go to tell her how _
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: Phil, what we don't need is a whole bunch of examples
of your problems. What all this boils down to is that you're having
trouble communicating with your wife, aren't you? You want to find
a solution to this, but you don't know how, do you? You're feeling
guilty about talking to other women, and you're afraid that she
thinks that you're coming on to them. You can't let her go on
feeling this way, Phil.

her. Perhaps this is some MORAL FLAW in my liberal personality?

   Driving home this afternoon, I heard our local Laura affiliate
(760 AM KFMB) run a promo spot for the Doc's show. It was one of
those spots that takes a small sound bite from the program. Went
something like this:
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: . . . and you actually let him do that?!?!
</P>
<P>
   Male Caller: Well, we try to encourage him . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: (Abruptly cutting him off in her inimitable style)
ENCOURAGE HIM?!?!? What do you mean encourage him?! There's NO
ENCOURAGEMENT at my house! There are only rules!!

Biography, Dr. Laura says: ``I do not see it as my mission to make
anybody feel better, I want them to get better.'' Janice Leber, the
creator of a Web site called The Moral Irresponsibility of ``Dr.''
Laura (www.sonomacountyfreepress.org/liver/dr-laura .html),
describes Dr. Laura's preferred treatment: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   1. What is your moral dilemma? (Your answer is unimportant.)
</P>
<P>
   2. Why are you so stupid as to have created this problem? (Your
response will be disjointed.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Yes, you DID create this problem. Examine your behavior to
this point. (Any sound you utter will be mocked. You will fall
silent.)
</P>
<P>
   4. This behavior marks you as an irresponsible, immoral jerk.
(You will object.)

cut off.)

<P>
   Caller: Uh, OK . . . Well, my wife and I have been married for
fourtee_
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: You're having marital problems, aren't you, Phil? You
and your wife have been together quite some time, and you're having
problems, aren't you? This is not a healthy relationship right now.
You can't go on like this with your wife.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Um, yeah. You see, we've been having trouble
communicating. When I go to tell her how _
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laura: Phil, what we don't need is a whole bunch of examples
of your problems. What all this boils down to is that you're having
trouble communicating with your wife, aren't you? You want to find
a solution to this, but you don't know how, do you? You're feeling
guilty about talking to other women, and you're afraid that she
thinks that you're coming on to them. You can't let her go on
feeling this way, Phil.

   This year's most honored young-adult novel, ``Monster,'' grabs
the 12-and-up crowd from the very first sentence: ``The best time
to cry is at night, when the lights are out and someone is being
beaten up and screaming for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Dean Myers' story of a boy in jail, charged with taking
part in a convenience-store killing, was a finalist for the
National Book Award, and the first winner of the American Library
Association's new prize for the burgeoning category of young-adult
fiction, an honor created as a sort of big brother to the group's
prestigious Newbery and Caldecott Medals.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from ``Anne of Green Gables,'' or, for that
matter, Harry Potter _ but, in its grimness, not too far removed
from many of the new young-adult books.
</P>
<P>
   Another National Book Award finalist last year, ``Speak,'' by
Laurie Halse Anderson, concerns a ninth-grade girl who has been an
outcast, and almost mute, since an end-of-summer party where she
got drunk, was raped, and called the police.
</P>
<P>
   This is by no means a brand new genre. Ever since the 1970s,
young-adult novels have featured a parade of America's
dysfunctional. And early on, there was a great hue and cry about
Judy Blume's books, with their frank discussion of sex, and Robert
Cormier's books, which dropped the happy ending. But just in the
last four years, young-adult fiction has moved into ever bleaker
territory. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' Brock Cole's book about a
13-year-old girl whose adult lover is shot, in front of her, by her
mother's boyfriend, who then shoots himself.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Smack,'' Melvin Burgess' story of two British teen-age
runaways who move into a ``squat'' and take up heroin.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Edge,'' Michael Cadnum's tale of a high-school dropout whose
divorced, upper-middle-class father is shot in the neck while
stopped at a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   All fiction needs drama, and many beloved children's classics _
from ``Heidi'' to ``The Secret Garden'' _ feature protagonists who
overcome loneliness and grief.
</P>
<P>
   But in much of today's young-adult fiction, the miseries of life
are not just the backdrop, but the whole point. And while the
situations vary, the books sound pretty much the same, offering
first-person, affectless accounts of a troubled time, with little
description or artfulness. ``The envelope has been pushed and
pushed and pushed,'' said Michael di Capua, a publisher of
children's books at Hyperion. ``You need a bigger and bigger jolt
to keep people's attention. There's a big, fat, wide streak of
sensationalism in there. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt such stories sell. But why they appeal to
adolescents, what their effect is and what they mean about society
are more complicated questions. ``Teen-agers and preteens have
particular curiosity,'' said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a professor of
psychiatry at Harvard Medical Center. ``They want to know about the
world, what's really going on. They're sticklers for honesty and
they don't want to be shielded from reality. These kids are
watching `Jerry Springer' on television, and all kinds of violent
movies, and if they see these kinds of books around, they'll want
to read them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he wonders along with many parents, to what effect? ``Does
it contribute to the increased depression we're seeing among young
people? We don't know, '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Rovenger, a youth services consultant at Westchester
Library Systems in Ardsley, N.Y., sees the gritty reality books as
a healthy, no-consequences way for adolescents to explore intense
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these books are about people surviving at the
extremes, and that's very interesting to adolescents,'' she said.
``Kids who haven't been through any of these horrors still know the
intense feeling of being misunderstood. It's part of adolescence
that every child feels abused.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rovenger has her caveats. ``There's no book that's good
for every kid,'' she said. ``But assuming they're choosing to read
these books, I worry more that, if they're badly written, it will
numb them to good literature. And if gritty books were the only
thing a child was reading, I'd say lighten up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   For some children, books that reflect tough realities may be
helpful. Myers, the author of ``Monster,'' said he saw his books as
a validation for young people who do not find their situations
reflected in literary classics. ``My experience, growing up poor,
in Harlem, was that none of the books I saw had anything to do with
my life at all, so I came to the conclusion that my life was not
valuable,'' he said. ``I think young people have to have some books
that they can pick up and say, this is about me.''

   But a too literal reflection of problems may not be useful, said
Robert Coles, a child psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard.
``Children in difficult situations ask the larger questions, the
kind of questions the Bible asks,'' he said. ``Why does this
happen? Why am I the one? I remember a girl I was treating who had
leukemia. She knew what was happening to her blood. What she was
worried about was what would happen to her mother. A book about a
kid with leukemia wouldn't help her. What would help her was
Tolstoy. A great novelist puts the reader in subjectivity, not
objectivity. This obsession with factuality has its limits and may
actually deprive children of an imaginative response.''
</P>
<P>
   And fact-based books are not the only way to tackle tough
issues. Certainly, fantasies like the Harry Potter books _ like
C.S. Lewis' Narnia series or Madeleine L'Engle's ``A Wrinkle in
Time'' before them _ deal with good and evil, suffering, love and
betrayal, albeit within a magical setting.
</P>
<P>
   L'Engle recalled an Authors Guild program on children's
literature in which New York City teen-agers were asked to bring
their favorite books _ and three out of four were fantasy. ``The
kids,'' she said, ``picked up on the unspoken assumption that they
were interested in reading about problems like neglect and abuse,
and they said, `No, we're living that, why would we want to read
about it?'''

<P>
   A taste of grim reading for young adults from 1898, from ``Paul
and Virginia,'' by Bernardin de Saint-Pierre: ``The body was half
covered with sand, and preserved the attitude in which we had seen
her perish. Her features were not sensibly changed, her eyes were
closed, and her countenance was still serene; but the pale purple
hues of death were blended on her cheek with the blush of virgin
modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of more modern fare:
</P>
<P>
   From ``Speak,'' by Laurie Halse Anderson (Farrar Straus &AMP;
Giroux, 1999), about a ninth-grader who has been raped: ``It is
getting harder to talk. My throat is always sore, my lips raw. When
I wake up in the morning, my jaws are clenched so tight I have a
headache. Sometimes my mouth relaxes around Heather, if we're
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' by Brock Cole (Puffin,
2000): ``The woman policeman says why don't you come in here, and
so I went. It was a little room with a table and some chairs. That
was all. Instead of a window, there was a big mirror. I wouldn't
look at that. I didn't want to see myself. I sat down and folded my
hands. There was still blood under my nails, so after a minute I
put them under the table.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Smack,'' by Melvin Burgess (Avon, 1999): ``I got to
admit, heroin's the best. I mean, THE BEST. The others, well . . .
acid, your thoughts come alive and they start to live a life of
their own. Hash, your senses sort of wake up. But with heroin,
ahhh. You can just sit in a sewer all day and be sooo happy and
feel sooo good.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Monster,'' by Walter Dean Myers (HarperCollins Juvenile
Books, 2000): ``They take away your shoes and your belt so you
can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you
live is part of the punishment.''

covered with sand, and preserved the attitude in which we had seen
her perish. Her features were not sensibly changed, her eyes were
closed, and her countenance was still serene; but the pale purple
hues of death were blended on her cheek with the blush of virgin
modesty.''
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of more modern fare:
</P>
<P>
   From ``Speak,'' by Laurie Halse Anderson (Farrar Straus &AMP;
Giroux, 1999), about a ninth-grader who has been raped: ``It is
getting harder to talk. My throat is always sore, my lips raw. When
I wake up in the morning, my jaws are clenched so tight I have a
headache. Sometimes my mouth relaxes around Heather, if we're
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Facts Speak for Themselves,'' by Brock Cole (Puffin,
2000): ``The woman policeman says why don't you come in here, and
so I went. It was a little room with a table and some chairs. That
was all. Instead of a window, there was a big mirror. I wouldn't
look at that. I didn't want to see myself. I sat down and folded my
hands. There was still blood under my nails, so after a minute I
put them under the table.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Smack,'' by Melvin Burgess (Avon, 1999): ``I got to
admit, heroin's the best. I mean, THE BEST. The others, well . . .
acid, your thoughts come alive and they start to live a life of
their own. Hash, your senses sort of wake up. But with heroin,
ahhh. You can just sit in a sewer all day and be sooo happy and
feel sooo good.''
</P>
<P>
   From ``Monster,'' by Walter Dean Myers (HarperCollins Juvenile
Books, 2000): ``They take away your shoes and your belt so you
can't kill yourself no matter how bad it is. I guess making you
live is part of the punishment.''

   If asked what makes a bowling ball heavy, anyone who remembers a
little high school physics might point to the tightly packed atoms
in the ball's resin or the massive protons and neutrons inside the
atoms. Resourceful as it is, that answer would not satisfy a real
physicist, because it does not explain why the particles have mass
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   For most physicists, there is only one answer to the question of
why matter weighs anything at all. It is called the Higgs boson, a
peculiar particle that laboratories in Europe and the United States
are racing to detect. It would be one of the most sublime
discoveries in the long history of physics.
</P>
<P>
   After scientists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,
near Chicago, announced on July 21 that they had seen a ghostly
particle called the tau neutrino, there remained only one
undetected particle whose existence was predicted by the standard
model of particle physics. Without that final, confirming piece of
the puzzle, however the standard model could still be a castle
built on clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining particle is, of course, the Higgs.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs should manifest itself both as a particle and as a
sort of thick molasses of pure energy permeating space. The
molasses, called the Higgs field, is normally undetectable except
as the source of mass for all ordinary particles drifting through
space, from the quarks that make up protons, neutrons, planets and
bowling balls, to electrons and neutrinos.
</P>
<P>
   According to theory, violent collisions produced in particle
accelerators should jostle the molasses enough to shake loose a
detectable particle _ the Higgs boson. Capturing one would
demonstrate that the molasses indeed filled space.
</P>
<P>
   A Higgs detection on American soil would also involve a certain
amount of scientific crow-eating since, a decade ago, American
scientists told Congress that the nation absolutely had to build a
superconducting supercollider at a cost of about $10 billion, or
forgo being at the cutting edge of particle physics. But since
Congress canceled the project in 1993 amid cost overruns and
charges of mismanagement, scientists' estimates of the Higgs' mass
have fallen so much that far less powerful accelerators might be
adequate to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those accelerators is Fermilab's Tevatron, originally
built in the early 1980s and recently upgraded at a cost of $260
million. In the bitter competition to build the superconducting
supercollider, Fermilab lost out to Waxahachie, Texas, where the
canceled project has left behind only a vast, oddly shaped tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be big revenge,'' said Dr. Franco Bedeschi,
co-spokesman for an experimental team called the collider detector
at Fermilab and a physicist at the National Institute for Nuclear
Physics in Italy. Although Bedeschi spoke jokingly, the scars of
the supercollider fiasco are still painful for particle physicists
_ call it Higgs guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Higgs, a British theorist, and others worked out the
mathematics of the particle in the early 1960s. But it was Sheldon
L. Glashow and Steven Weinberg, two physicists who had been
classmates at the Bronx High School of Science, and Abdus Salam, a
Pakistani theorist, who showed how the Higgs field could produce
mass in a particle theory that described the complexities of matter
in the real world. Glashow, Weinberg and Salaam received the Nobel
Prize for their work in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is based on postulated symmetries of nature.
Physicists use the word symmetry whenever they find that physical
laws remain indifferent to some change. Physical laws are the same
for particles moving to the left or to the right, for example. But
some of the deepest symmetries occur in an abstract space where the
properties of distinct particles _ say, an electron and a neutrino
_ can be interchanged. The most symmetrical and natural state of
this space, however, is one in which all particles have no mass,
meaning weightlessness, meaning no bowling balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Higgs field allows particles to have various masses because
it fills space like molasses, said Dr. Tiziano Camporesi, a
physicist at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva and the
spokesman for a large experimental team there.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance it offers against particles moving through it
amounts to inertia, ``and after all, inertia is the manifestation
of mass,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The molasses is thought to have congealed in space as the
universe cooled in the Big Bang, the giant explosion in which most
scientists believe the universe was born, said Dr. Michael E.
Peskin, a theorist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
</P>
<P>
   Peskin, who warned that advanced theories that made all this
less dependent on the caprice of one particle would predict the
existence of even more particles, said the Higgs field could not be
detected directly. But by producing ordinary massive particles in
accelerators, he said, the molasses could be jostled enough so that
it spawned a Higgs boson, which would decay in a tiny fraction of a
second, making decay products that could be detected.
</P>
<P>
   So now the race is on between physicists at Fermilab and at CERN
to be the first to find the Higgs boson. The two institutions make
little attempt to conceal the stakes involved in the competition,
which could lead to a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be like an adrenaline shot,'' Camporesi said. ``It
would be the achievement of my life, clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The first chance belongs to CERN's Large Electron-Positron
collider, or LEP, which is approaching the end of its planned
lifetime this fall. Scientists there have not seen the Higgs yet,
but they are trying to decide whether to extend their run just a
bit longer to keep hunting.
</P>
<P>
   With a higher energy than the LEP, Fermilab's upgraded Tevatron
will have the next shot at the Higgs when it starts producing data
next spring. After that, the much more powerful Large Hadron
Collider should begin operation at CERN by 2005 or 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists say all the signs point to a great discovery within
the next few years. ``Having hunted for this weird beast for so
long,'' Camporesi said, ``the day it is discovered I would really
be very, very happy. And probably get drunk.''

   They are searching for some evidence of their loved ones,
missing and believed dead in the massacre of Srebrenica, the 1995
murder by the Bosnian Serbs of up to 7,000 men, separated from
their families, who thought they were under the protection of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Since this book was printed on June 12, more than 1,000 families
have seen it in the company of local workers from the Bosnian Red
Cross. The book contains 1,756 photos with short descriptions,
showing the belongings of 354 bodies found near Srebrenica that
forensic experts have been unable to identify.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 92 families have recognized belongings of their loved
ones, said Balthasar Staehelin, head of the International Committee
for the Red Cross in Bosnia-Herzegovina, giving forensic scientists
a very good chance of making positive identifications. More
important, some families are closer to knowing what happened to
their missing men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some families even have difficulty opening the book,''
Staehelin said. ``But for most, not knowing is worse than knowing
the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for this book came from Rifat Kesetovic, the director
of the Podrinje Identification Project, which was established 18
months ago to work exclusively on identifying the missing from
Srebrenica. The Red Cross financed its preparation and publication,
and is providing local teams to take copies to the families of the
missing, and to stand by to provide information and psychological
care.
</P>
<P>
   Srebrenica has become a metaphor for many big topics: the worst
atrocity of the Bosnian war; the empty promises of a West in love
with its own moralizing; the bureaucratic, murderous failure of a
United Nations trying to make peace without fighting; the cowardice
of Dutch troops serving with the United Nations who let Bosnian
Serbs overrun Srebrenica and watched them march the men away.
</P>
<P>
   For these women, Srebrenica is an unfilled hole exploded in
their lives. Of the 20,000 people reported missing in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Red Cross has only been able to resolve the
fate of 3,000, even five years after the Dayton agreement that
ended the Bosnian war.

ULSTER FINDS ITS WAY OUT OF ONE MAZE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Though the Maze prison takes its name from the suburban
village outside Belfast where it is located, it is an apt word for
a place that is so representative of the perverse paths Ulster has
followed in its struggle to find its way from war to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The brutalist fortresslike building ringed by rusted barbed wire
and studded with searchlights and watchtowers has drawn the world's
eye for its hunger strikes, riots, killings, mass escapes,
posturing paramilitary fighters and alumni like Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political party of the Irish Republican
Army. It held more guerrillas than any other prison in the world,
and the ruthlessness and political commitment of its inhabitants
made it a place where guards were often more endangered than
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   It has at once embodied Ulster's most evil instincts and shaped
many of the men now trying to guide its political future. Five
members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly were Maze inmates; in
a society of 1.6 million, nearly 30,000 were prisoners. Behind the
1998 accord that has brought stability to Northern Ireland is a
conviction that these people, once perpetrators of mayhem, can be a
significant constituency for calm.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven guerrillas walked free last week in the last stage
of the pact's early release program, under which more than 400
prisoners have been let out. The Maze prison, which has held as
many as 1,800 inmates, now houses 15 and is to close at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the bombers and killers come out the Maze's turnstile
exit is dreadfully hard for many residents of Northern Ireland,
since most of the crimes were recent, and for victims' families,
the memories are fresh. The released do not express regret or
remorse. Instead, they say they were participating in a war and
trying to protect their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question most longingly asked these days by the
citizens of Northern Ireland is whether the war that has cost 3,600
lives is finally over, and they may find some reassurance in the
shuttering of the Maze and the freeing of inmates who always
insisted on being considered prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Maze began as a prisoner-of-war camp on the site of Long
Kesh Royal Air Force Base to handle the hundreds of people arrested
and interned without trial in the early 1970s. Its Nissen huts and
tents made way several years later for eight stolid H-blocks,
so-called because of their shape, housing 100 cells each and
suitable for keeping members of murderously opposing paramilitary
groups segregated from one another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a decision by the British government to treat inmates
not as prisoners of war but as criminals led to riots and a period
when the distinctive aerial photo of the jail became a norm on
television news. Inmates went ``on the blanket,'' wearing
bedclothes instead of prison uniforms, and started their ``dirty
protest'': refusing to bathe, littering their cells and corridors
with broken furniture and smearing walls with their feces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Bobby Sands, a convicted IRA bomber, started a hunger
strike that cost him his life after 66 days. Nine other inmates
starved themselves to death before the protest was dropped, but
Sands became a republican hero and brought international scrutiny
of ``the troubles,'' as the Catholic-Protestant sectarian violence
is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the Sands case pointed to the future. A month
before his death, Sands was elected a member of the British

Fein might be able to attract widespread political support.
</P>
<P>
   While the Maze _ or Long Kesh, as inmates often still insist on
calling it to emphasize its prisoner-of-war origins _ remained a
chaotic and violent place through the 1980s and 1990s, it also
provided many guerrillas with their first education since grade
school. The men largely studied political and social issues and
emerged from prison with so-called Free University degrees. The
Shankill Road, the principal avenue of Protestant Belfast, and the
Falls Road, the main street through the largest Catholic
neighborhoods, are now home to scores of storefront community
action organizations run by former prisoners who are trying to keep
youths from perpetuating sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Through these years, the Maze developed into prisons within a
prison, with entire H-blocks in the control of the paramilitary
inmates. Prisoners elected their own leaders who negotiated
conditions directly with the prison governor. Prisoners won the
right not to be locked in their cells, and guards were forbidden to
search their quarters without gaining the commanders' approval and
a day's notice. In an unsuccessful prison break three years ago,
IRA men managed to keep undetected the 13 tons of earth they had
dug up while making a tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates showed their growing power in ways ranging from the
cooperative to the menacing. During the last two decades, 22 guards
and a deputy governor of the Maze were killed outside the prison by
guerrillas acting on information from inside. In recent years,
leaders inside the Maze gave the political parties representing
paramilitary groups the necessary go-ahead to participate in the
talks that produced the 1998 settlement.

   Talk has already begun about what to do with the Maze.
Suggestions range from destroying every gray brick of it to
preserving it as a museum, as was done in South Africa with the
Robben Island jail, where Nelson Mandela was held.

<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the closing is a powerful symbol and may
provide a hopeful answer to a question posed at the end of a
popular republican song of the 1970s. ``And will the last
obscenity,'' it concluded, ``be the grim H-block cell?''

<P>
   LONDON _ Though the Maze prison takes its name from the suburban
village outside Belfast where it is located, it is an apt word for
a place that is so representative of the perverse paths Ulster has
followed in its struggle to find its way from war to peace.
</P>
<P>
   The brutalist fortresslike building ringed by rusted barbed wire
and studded with searchlights and watchtowers has drawn the world's
eye for its hunger strikes, riots, killings, mass escapes,
posturing paramilitary fighters and alumni like Gerry Adams,
president of Sinn Fein, the political party of the Irish Republican
Army. It held more guerrillas than any other prison in the world,
and the ruthlessness and political commitment of its inhabitants
made it a place where guards were often more endangered than
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   It has at once embodied Ulster's most evil instincts and shaped
many of the men now trying to guide its political future. Five
members of the new Northern Ireland Assembly were Maze inmates; in
a society of 1.6 million, nearly 30,000 were prisoners. Behind the
1998 accord that has brought stability to Northern Ireland is a
conviction that these people, once perpetrators of mayhem, can be a
significant constituency for calm.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven guerrillas walked free last week in the last stage
of the pact's early release program, under which more than 400
prisoners have been let out. The Maze prison, which has held as
many as 1,800 inmates, now houses 15 and is to close at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the bombers and killers come out the Maze's turnstile
exit is dreadfully hard for many residents of Northern Ireland,
since most of the crimes were recent, and for victims' families,
the memories are fresh. The released do not express regret or
remorse. Instead, they say they were participating in a war and
trying to protect their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question most longingly asked these days by the
citizens of Northern Ireland is whether the war that has cost 3,600
lives is finally over, and they may find some reassurance in the
shuttering of the Maze and the freeing of inmates who always
insisted on being considered prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   The Maze began as a prisoner-of-war camp on the site of Long
Kesh Royal Air Force Base to handle the hundreds of people arrested
and interned without trial in the early 1970s. Its Nissen huts and
tents made way several years later for eight stolid H-blocks,
so-called because of their shape, housing 100 cells each and
suitable for keeping members of murderously opposing paramilitary
groups segregated from one another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, a decision by the British government to treat inmates
not as prisoners of war but as criminals led to riots and a period
when the distinctive aerial photo of the jail became a norm on
television news. Inmates went ``on the blanket,'' wearing
bedclothes instead of prison uniforms, and started their ``dirty
protest'': refusing to bathe, littering their cells and corridors
with broken furniture and smearing walls with their feces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Bobby Sands, a convicted IRA bomber, started a hunger
strike that cost him his life after 66 days. Nine other inmates
starved themselves to death before the protest was dropped, but
Sands became a republican hero and brought international scrutiny
of ``the troubles,'' as the Catholic-Protestant sectarian violence
is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the Sands case pointed to the future. A month
before his death, Sands was elected a member of the British
parliament from Northern Ireland _ the first indication that Sinn
Fein might be able to attract widespread political support.
</P>
<P>
   While the Maze _ or Long Kesh, as inmates often still insist on
calling it to emphasize its prisoner-of-war origins _ remained a
chaotic and violent place through the 1980s and 1990s, it also

EVIDENCE OF INNOCENCE CAN COME TOO LATE FOR FREEDOM

<P>
   Newly discovered evidence may seem like the unjustly convicted's
dream come true, but the reality is that such evidence rarely makes
a difference in the United States. Once a jury has reached a
verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers say, the odds are
overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no matter how compelling
the new information is.
</P>
<P>
   And actual innocence is the least effective argument to make for
a new trial because it is so difficult to prove. Although the
recent use of DNA testing, particularly in rape cases, has produced
incontrovertible evidence of innocence in some cases, and has
forced the release of the unjustly convicted, most crimes do not
involve DNA matching. Most other types of evidence _ like
confessions or new witnesses _ can be argued away or ignored,
lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Judges are loath to reopen cases, and state appeals courts
dislike intervening on anything but procedural issues. Decisions on
who is telling the truth and what the evidence means are best left
to the so-called finders of fact: the actual judge or jurors who
saw the exhibits and heard the witnesses. It has always been
difficult to win by taking an appeal to federal court, known as a
habeas corpus petition; when Congress passed a law sharply limiting
such appeals in 1996, it became even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of any petition are dim,'' said Larry W. Yackle, a
law professor at Boston University. ``It would be a real indictment
of the system if many were successful.'' He added, ``You wouldn't
expect a system that papers over its many flaws to give up the
ghost all of a sudden when it gets to a federal judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar to undoing a conviction should be high, said Nancy E.
Little, a lawyer in the appeals division of the Legal Aid Society
in New York. ``But the way it's applied now, it's incredibly
high,'' she said. The courts ``have a vested interest in their
convictions. I think it's very hard for them to undo their own
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Little is handling an appeal in the case of David Lemus and
Olmado Hidalgo, who were convicted in the 1990 murder of a bouncer
at a Manhattan nightclub. Another man has since confessed to the
murder and implicated a friend, but the original defendants remain
in prison. Despite some corroborating evidence, a state judge in
Manhattan said he did not believe the new confession and refused to
order a new trial. State appeals courts refused to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the odds, Little said, she has some hope of winning a
reversal through a habeas corpus petition. But the burden on the
defendant is high. She must show, for instance, that the decisions
of the state courts were contrary to established law, and that the
state court's decision was not just incorrect, but unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   It is not necessarily the job of the federal court to reexamine
the facts of the case. The federal judge, in this case Jed S.
Rakoff, will be looking to see whether the constitutional rights of
the defendants were violated. One argument, Little said, is that
the defendants' right to due process was violated when the state
judge refused to grant a new trial based on the confession.
</P>
<P>
   Eric M. Freedman, a professor of law at Hofstra University, said
it is highly unlikely that an appeal based on newly discovered
evidence will succeed in federal court. Freedman, who is writing a
book on habeas corpus petitions, said he knows of no recent cases
in which such petitions were granted on the basis of new evidence,
other than possibly a few that involved exculpatory DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finding of facts by the state court judge must be found
unreasonable,'' Freedman said, ``and they must make out a truly
persuasive showing of actual innocence _ and that's tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal system tends to defer to the fact finders, whether
that's a judge or a jury,'' he said. ``There is inertia built into
the legal system favoring the first finder of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The best route for prisoners like Lemus and Hidalgo is to come
up with new evidence that will warrant a reopening of the case in
state court, Freedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lawyers for the two thought they had just that when
they got word of the confession several years ago. Joey Pillot, a
member of a Bronx extortion gang, told a federal prosecutor
investigating the gang that he and his friend, James Rodriguez, had
murdered the bouncer. The prosecutor and a police detective looked
into Pillot's story, grilled him about the details and came to
believe that he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Jay Gold of state Supreme Court in Manhattan, who
had presided over the original trial, thought Pillot had concocted
the story to please the federal prosecutors, and refused to grant a
new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Now, lawyers for Lemus and Hidalgo need to come up with another
substantial piece of new evidence to have a chance at winning a new
hearing. That could be the testimony of Rodriguez, who is in prison
on another charge and is to be released in November. He has said he
will testify only if he gets immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, has been
reluctant to give Rodriguez complete immunity. So, Morgenthau must
decide whether it is preferable to give immunity to a murderer in
order to set free two possibly innocent men, or to refuse immunity
and let them complete their sentences of 25 years to life. Either
way, Rodriguez will walk out of prison in November.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A plume of fire about to consume a marvel of
aviation, a moment of horror frozen forever in a stunning image: To
Prof. W. David Lewis, who studies the history of technology, the
burning Concorde looked like a zeppelin for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's haunting,'' said Lewis, a historian at Auburn University.
``That long fiery path in the sky, it reminds me, not in detail but
in overall symbolic concept, of the Hindenburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just that both had a fiery end, the Air France jet
as it took off near Paris on Tuesday and the giant German zeppelin
as it was being moored in Lakehurst, N.J., on May 6, 1937. Both
supersonic jet and zeppelin, Lewis pointed out, were symbols of
national pride. Each offered luxury service for a wealthy few, and
both operated at times of rapid technological change that made
their futures uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   And both, it seems, are instructive about the difficulties of
predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the accident last week, which killed 114 people including five on
the ground, will kill the supersonic transports the way the
Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible, when it crashed
killing 35 people on board and one on the ground. But progress _
including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both.
</P>
<P>
   In its day, the Concorde was the ne plus ultra of technology,
the edge of the envelope in speed and altitude. Thirty years later,
the envelope has stretched a great deal, but in other directions,
notably toward safety, comfort and reliability. And though the
Concorde still flies twice as fast and twice as high, the question
is whether it has been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting technological change is hard, and the airlines and
plane builders are not good at it. When the Concorde was new,
Boeing was turning out 747s, the world's largest plane, as a
stopgap until supersonics could become the mainstay of commercial
aviation, and Pan Am was talking about carrying passengers to the
moon. The moon is still there but now is unvisited even by
astronauts. Pan Am is gone. The 747 has only grown to carry more
people more miles, and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of
an endangered species: 20 were built; 12 remain. There are more of
every high-profile thing that flies, except maybe for the space
shuttles and the Goodyear blimps.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced in ways almost unimaginable in 1976,
when the Concordes entered commercial service to the United States.
And while expectations may have scaled back in some areas, like
trips to the moon, they have grown in other ways, almost without
our noticing, especially in the ubiquity and safety of air travel.
In 1969, the year the Concorde first broke the sound barrier, the
total number of people carried on planes in the United States was
less than the country's population. This year, the number of
passengers is more than double the population.
</P>
<P>
   New planes carry entertainment screens in every seat-back. The
Concorde's design does not allow even an in-flight movie. Makers of
new planes boast that they will fly almost continuously, day after
day. The typical Concorde, in contrast, flies 3 hours a day or
less.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is one of the few examples in history of a
technology whose successor was slower. It bears a passing
resemblance to the U.S. nuclear power industry, which used a
technology that looked advanced and attractive in the 1960s and
'70s, only to seem, 20 years later, esoteric and not worth the
bother and expense. It is as if the airlines have decided the
tortoise is sexier than the hare.
</P>
<P>
   Flying is now safer than driving, taking the train or walking,
and almost safer than staying home. One reason is that airplanes
are now mass produced, and their failures protect each other. There
are, for example, about 2,600 Boeing 737s in service, and every now
and then, somebody finds something worrisome in one of them, like a
power conduit inside a fuel tank that has short-circuited and is
giving off sparks. But the result is a swift order to inspect the
other thousands for the same problem and fix it. In contrast, if
the cause of the Concorde crash turns out to be a generic flaw, the
population protected will be the remaining 12 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the grand sweep of technological progress, that may not
be a fair way to consider safety, or even a sensible one. ``If you
do take that approach, we'll never have any advances,'' said John
R. Deakin, a veteran Boeing 747 pilot and safety expert. ``Somebody
has to be out there on the bleeding edge.''

   WASHINGTON _ A plume of fire about to consume a marvel of
aviation, a moment of horror frozen forever in a stunning image: To
Prof. W. David Lewis, who studies the history of technology, the
burning Concorde looked like a zeppelin for the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's haunting,'' said Lewis, a historian at Auburn University.
``That long fiery path in the sky, it reminds me, not in detail but
in overall symbolic concept, of the Hindenburg.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just that both had a fiery end, the Air France jet
as it took off near Paris on Tuesday and the giant German zeppelin
as it was being moored in Lakehurst, N.J., on May 6, 1937. Both
supersonic jet and zeppelin, Lewis pointed out, were symbols of
national pride. Each offered luxury service for a wealthy few, and
both operated at times of rapid technological change that made
their futures uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   And both, it seems, are instructive about the difficulties of
predicting technological progress. It remains to be seen whether
the accident last week, which killed 114 people including five on
the ground, will kill the supersonic transports the way the
Hindenburg ended the promise of the dirigible, when it crashed
killing 35 people on board and one on the ground. But progress _
including, perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both.
</P>
<P>
   In its day, the Concorde was the ne plus ultra of technology,
the edge of the envelope in speed and altitude. Thirty years later,
the envelope has stretched a great deal, but in other directions,
notably toward safety, comfort and reliability. And though the
Concorde still flies twice as fast and twice as high, the question
is whether it has been left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting technological change is hard, and the airlines and
plane builders are not good at it. When the Concorde was new,
Boeing was turning out 747s, the world's largest plane, as a
stopgap until supersonics could become the mainstay of commercial
aviation, and Pan Am was talking about carrying passengers to the
moon. The moon is still there but now is unvisited even by
astronauts. Pan Am is gone. The 747 has only grown to carry more
people more miles, and the Concordes are dwindling like the last of
an endangered species: 20 were built; 12 remain. There are more of
every high-profile thing that flies, except maybe for the space
shuttles and the Goodyear blimps.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has advanced in ways almost unimaginable in 1976,
when the Concordes entered commercial service to the United States.
And while expectations may have scaled back in some areas, like
trips to the moon, they have grown in other ways, almost without
our noticing, especially in the ubiquity and safety of air travel.
In 1969, the year the Concorde first broke the sound barrier, the
total number of people carried on planes in the United States was
less than the country's population. This year, the number of
passengers is more than double the population.
</P>
<P>
   New planes carry entertainment screens in every seat-back. The
Concorde's design does not allow even an in-flight movie. Makers of
new planes boast that they will fly almost continuously, day after
day. The typical Concorde, in contrast, flies 3 hours a day or
less.
</P>
<P>
   The Concorde is one of the few examples in history of a
technology whose successor was slower. It bears a passing
resemblance to the U.S. nuclear power industry, which used a
technology that looked advanced and attractive in the 1960s and
'70s, only to seem, 20 years later, esoteric and not worth the
bother and expense. It is as if the airlines have decided the
tortoise is sexier than the hare.
</P>
<P>
   Flying is now safer than driving, taking the train or walking,
and almost safer than staying home. One reason is that airplanes
are now mass produced, and their failures protect each other. There
are, for example, about 2,600 Boeing 737s in service, and every now
and then, somebody finds something worrisome in one of them, like a
power conduit inside a fuel tank that has short-circuited and is
giving off sparks. But the result is a swift order to inspect the
other thousands for the same problem and fix it. In contrast, if
the cause of the Concorde crash turns out to be a generic flaw, the
population protected will be the remaining 12 airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the grand sweep of technological progress, that may not
be a fair way to consider safety, or even a sensible one. ``If you
do take that approach, we'll never have any advances,'' said John
R. Deakin, a veteran Boeing 747 pilot and safety expert. ``Somebody
has to be out there on the bleeding edge.''

<P>
   At this summer's political party gatherings, where the outcomes
are preordained, the hottest activity may be interactivity. For the
Republican National Convention this week, for example, Chris Long
wants to put you in the director's seat. On C-SPAN's Web site, run
by Long, users will be able to click on one of several distinct
video feeds from the convention hall, or even choose to watch the
action from the vantage point of the C-SPAN control booth.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN is one of several operations using similar technology at
the conventions. In each case, their U-pick-em-style camera angles
takes the editor out of the equation and put the accent in media on
the ``me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They allow users to have different experiences of the same
event,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the nation's armchair politicos can now begin to
create their own show.
</P>
<P>
   Customized political conventions are just one example of the
nation's growing, technologically abetted obsession with getting
what you want when you want. From sites that download music onto
personalized players, to digital television services that rearrange
prime-time offerings to fit viewers' schedules, electronic wizardry
is constantly expanding the possibilities for satisfying consumer
demand for individualization.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing, though, to go online to order a pair of jeans
tailored to specifications for ankle width and button color, and
quite another to design one's own idea of a political convention.
The quadrennial events, with their idiosyncratic procedures and
highly scripted programs, are at heart communal exercises for both
the participants and the audience. So what happens to the shared
national experience when no two members of the audience share the
same convention, or, by logical extension, the same election-day
coverage?
</P>
<P>
   Some media observers, like Russell Newman, a researcher on
Internet issues at the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the
University of Pennsylvania, are not convinced customized camera
angles are anything but Webfoolery.
</P>
<P>
   ``My estimate of the audience for a bird's eye view of the top
of the convention dome,'' Newman said, ``is seven people.''
</P>
<P>
   But if this initial stab at a Web-enabled convention doesn't
work, that will hardly spell its death. In fact, the Internet, a
technology that is inherently individualistic and interactive, is
rapidly growing in prominence in the political process. Candidate
Web sites are getting better, Internet fund-raising and voter
communications are growing more sophisticated and effective, and
many people think the advent of voting via the Web is only a matter
of time.
</P>
<P>
   The water cooler has long played a significant role in the
nation's political conversation. Indeed, part of the enjoyment of
watching conventions is the post-mortem critiquing of the
politicians and the anchors and the conventioneers in the silly
hats. But who is going to shoot the breeze with friends if one
spent the night before in a chat room, exploring tobacco policy
with lobbyists from Kentucky, another was transfixed by a camera
trained on the Hawaii delegation, a third was consumed with
e-mailing questions to a Webcast on MSNBC _ and none paid attention
to a word of the vice presidential nominee's address?
</P>
<P>
   With more options, your water-cooler conversations are going to
be many times smaller,'' said Sam Hollander, executive producer of
Pseudopolitics.com, a Web site that will, among other things,
provide a 360-degree view through a series of cameras inside the
First Union Center in Philadelphia and the Staples Center in Los
Angeles, where the Democrats convene in August. ``There will be a
lot of two-person conversations, rather than 20-person
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   This relentless subdividing of common ground, Hollander said, is
akin to the fragmenting of television viewership, thanks to the
multiplicity of choices on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need to do is look at what ratings share a network has
to get today to have a success,'' he said. ``There was a time when
if you didn't get a 30 share, it wasn't that big. Now, if you get a
20, you're a huge hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Where once the country was knit together by the collective
experience of watching the same sitcom on one of the networks, or
having the meaning of a national tragedy interpreted by Walter
Cronkite, the I-can-do-it-myself ethos engendered by technology is
on the verge of assuring that there will be no collective
electronic experience.
</P>
<P>
   TiVo, for example, is a year-old digital service based in
California that allows subscribers to program their televisions to
play only what they want to see at a time of their choosing. Its
recent television commercial depicting network programmers being
tossed out of windows asked , ``When you've got TiVo, who needs
them?'' Some networks refused to run it, say TiVo executives.
</P>
<P>
   No one as yet is confidently predicting just how all this
electronic democracy will affect the democratic process. Paul
Sagan, president of Akamai Technologies, an Internet company
selected by the Democrats to deliver all of their streaming media
convention coverage, says the interactive age is probably too new
in this election cycle to profoundly affect voters' view of events.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cat is out of the bag, and the savviest politicians,
Sagan said, will quickly begin to look for ways to satisfy the
demands for individualized attention from users of the Internet,
who now number more than 115 million in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In interactivity, people expect to control the query and get
back the answer,'' Sagan said, adding his own customized parable:
``I have an odd Swiss watch that requires an authorized dealer to
change the battery. I went to the company's Web site and sent them
a query: how can I get the battery replaced? I got a response from
someone in Switzerland saying thank you for your inquiring and that
the query had been forwarded to their U.S. offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Sagan never heard from the American branch. ``My watch is now
dead in a drawer and they have a disgruntled customer,'' he said.
``They did something that's worse than not trying at all. They
raised expectations and they failed to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about scary scenarios: a political world in which every
voter gets a personalized Internet checklist of promises from the
candidate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The stakes, U.S. officials warned, had never been higher. To
many looking in from the outside, it seemed to be make or break,
peace or war. The brink, they feared, was right there: On the other
side lay chaos, confrontation and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   But the dirty little secret of the 14-day Camp David Middle East
peace summit is that the brink was a myth. The meeting failed; the
two sides went home without agreement. Yet no explosion in Israel
or the Palestinian territories occurred, nor is chaos expected any
time soon. This is because not only was the brink a myth; so, too,
were the fears. In truth, it was never failure of the summit that
brought with it the risk of violence. It was success.
</P>
<P>
   It is sudden compromise that really violates expectations in the
Middle East in a way that brings out the dark, violent forces
there. Now that Yasser Arafat has resisted a deal, he is hailed by
Palestinians as a hero. Now that Ehud Barak did not actually give
anything away, the Israeli government he leads is expected to
survive a no-confidence motion this week. But that does not mean
the two sides are farther apart than before. They have never been
closer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox of Middle East peacemaking. Going slowly
produces impatience and despondence but moving quickly is simply
impossible. Camp David had the trappings of a go-for-broke meeting,
but it was just one more step in a process of mutual recognition
and adjustment begun in Oslo seven years ago. Its failure does not
derail that process. It is part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson from Camp David is that the alternative to
negotiations is not necessarily confrontation and bloodshed but
more negotiations,'' said Daniel Ben-Simon, an analyst with the
liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators scheduled new
meetings on the Israeli-Gaza Strip border. Security chiefs of the
two sides kept in daily contact to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Shikaki, who directs the Palestinian Center for Policy
and Survey Research in Ramallah on the West Bank, agrees that
peacemaking is far from over. He argues that the Oslo process
showed the two sides that a partial deal was feasible and might be
the solution for a longer time than many would like. This means
that no solution is likely to emerge soon on sovereignty over the
holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is going to be in good political shape for some time to
come,'' Shikaki said. ``Even if there is no partial deal, both
sides have an interest in preventing violence from erupting.'' He
added that his polls show that despite the waxing and waning of
Arafat's popularity, the radical Islamic alternative represented by
Hamas and Islamic Jihad has not gained at all in popularity in
recent years. Total support for those groups has been flat at about
20 percent for five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody knows how this balance would shift if there
were concessions on Jerusalem, which stands as the symbol of the
Islamic cause in the Holy Land. Many believe that it is not up to
Arafat but to the broader Arab leadership to make concessions on
Jerusalem and that is unlikely soon. As long as negotiations
continue, that question may not have to be faced in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Shikaki noted that the next deadline is Sept. 13, when Arafat
has warned he will unilaterally announce the existence of a
Palestinian state if negotiations have not yet produced it. But
Shikaki acknowledged that that deadline could also be stretched.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the state is declared, the impact is not clear.
Arafat declared the state's existence once already _ in 1988 _ to
little effect. It is true that Palestinians today have a large,
lightly armed force inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, so the
declaration could have more bite and could, in fact, lead to
violent confrontation. Then again, the intifada of a decade ago is
not reproducible now since the soldiers among the Palestinians
today are Palestinian, not Israeli. A street revolt, unless
actually led by Arafat, would probably have to start as one against
him, and for now that prospect seems remote. Rogue acts of violence
could, of course, lead to sympathetic involvement of Palestinian
police. But, again, the prevalent view is that such violence would
be quelled.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that, given the difficult issues, like Jerusalem
and refugees, that were on the table, Camp David's failure was not
only inevitable but useful. Zev Chafets, a commentator who was head
of the Israeli government press office under Prime Minister
Menachem Begin 20 years ago, even suggests that the general
reaction in the Middle East is relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come down to it, the deal was supposed to be our
giving them all this land in exchange for them saying they forgive
us,'' Chafets said. ``But they don't forgive us. We haven't reached
that stage yet. So we have to continue as is. We have reached quite
a comfortable modus vivendi. The Palestinians still run the Muslim
quarter and we still have sovereignty over Maale Adumim.'' He was
referring to a large Jewish settlement east of Jerusalem in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Dromi, who ran the government press office under Yitzhak
Rabin, compares the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians
to that between a couple going through a divorce while living in
the same house. ``Neither one is going to leave, even if they try
to make life unbearable for each other. So, in the long run, they
adjust and minimize the points of friction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dromi points to the increasing interaction between people on
the two sides as evidence that the process of mutual adjustment is
advancing. He says that his brother, a senior police officer, is in
frequent contact with Palestinian officers and that even when
official relations have been tense, personal ones have been warm.
He notes further that every Saturday there are huge traffic jams as
thousands of Israelis drive to the West Bank cities of Nablus and
Tulkarm to shop. Thousands of others drive to Jericho to gamble.
``These are the same cities where their sons had to chase stone
throwers into the alleys of the casbah,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reality is indeed new. For two generations, the political
divide in Israel was between those on the left who called for ``two
states for two peoples'' and those on the right who swore there
would never be a Palestinian state. Now the whole discussion is
what the contours and powers of that state would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major realignment going on,'' said Yoram Hazony, a
conservative who was an aide to Benjamin Netanyahu when he was
prime minister. ``There is, in effect, a condition of political
independence for the Palestinians. Today, there is no such thing as
a `not-one-inch' position. Now you hear people on the far right
saying that if we are going to trade territory, let's give the
Palestinians as many Arab villages in Israel as possible to
maximize the Jewish majority in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is another useful myth that animated the Camp
David peace process: that only the governments of Barak and Arafat
in their current configurations can make this peace and so a
historic opportunity is at stake. The same was said of Yitzhak
Rabin and Arafat. After Rabin's assassination in 1995 by a Jewish
extremist, the hawkish Netanyahu was elected and the doomsayers
seemed correct. But the peace process did not die, and it is
unlikely to if Barak and Arafat fail to decide how to share
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   All acknowledge that Jerusalem is the most difficult issue
because while land can be divided, it is far less clear how to
divide a symbol that is, in Hazony's words, ``at the heart of what
we think we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a myth that only at Camp David did the issue of
Jerusalem first get an airing. It was certainly the first time it
was broached directly at the very top, but Jerusalem has been under
discussion for quite a while. Yossi Beilin, a senior minister in

   Salameh Nematt, a Jordanian journalist for the Arab newspaper Al

the beginning, they spoke of Gaza first,'' he recalled of Israeli
proposals in the early 1990s. ``Then it was Gaza and Jericho first
and Gaza and Jericho last. Then came Nablus and Tulkarm and then 9
percent of the land and then 13 percent and then talk of maybe 50
percent and now we are hearing about more than 90 percent. Any
Israeli government that moves too fast will be burned but so will
any government that moves too slowly. The final settlement may take
another 10 or 15 years, but it will come. Remember how Israelis who
met with Arafat used to go to jail? Now he's their best friend.'' &QL;

<P>
   The stakes, U.S. officials warned, had never been higher. To
many looking in from the outside, it seemed to be make or break,
peace or war. The brink, they feared, was right there: On the other
side lay chaos, confrontation and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   But the dirty little secret of the 14-day Camp David Middle East
peace summit is that the brink was a myth. The meeting failed; the
two sides went home without agreement. Yet no explosion in Israel
or the Palestinian territories occurred, nor is chaos expected any
time soon. This is because not only was the brink a myth; so, too,
were the fears. In truth, it was never failure of the summit that
brought with it the risk of violence. It was success.
</P>
<P>
   It is sudden compromise that really violates expectations in the
Middle East in a way that brings out the dark, violent forces
there. Now that Yasser Arafat has resisted a deal, he is hailed by
Palestinians as a hero. Now that Ehud Barak did not actually give
anything away, the Israeli government he leads is expected to
survive a no-confidence motion this week. But that does not mean
the two sides are farther apart than before. They have never been
closer.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox of Middle East peacemaking. Going slowly
produces impatience and despondence but moving quickly is simply
impossible. Camp David had the trappings of a go-for-broke meeting,
but it was just one more step in a process of mutual recognition
and adjustment begun in Oslo seven years ago. Its failure does not
derail that process. It is part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson from Camp David is that the alternative to
negotiations is not necessarily confrontation and bloodshed but
more negotiations,'' said Daniel Ben-Simon, an analyst with the
liberal Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators scheduled new
meetings on the Israeli-Gaza Strip border. Security chiefs of the
two sides kept in daily contact to prevent violence.
</P>
<P>
   Khalil Shikaki, who directs the Palestinian Center for Policy
and Survey Research in Ramallah on the West Bank, agrees that
peacemaking is far from over. He argues that the Oslo process
showed the two sides that a partial deal was feasible and might be
the solution for a longer time than many would like. This means
that no solution is likely to emerge soon on sovereignty over the
holy sites in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arafat is going to be in good political shape for some time to
come,'' Shikaki said. ``Even if there is no partial deal, both
sides have an interest in preventing violence from erupting.'' He
added that his polls show that despite the waxing and waning of
Arafat's popularity, the radical Islamic alternative represented by
Hamas and Islamic Jihad has not gained at all in popularity in
recent years. Total support for those groups has been flat at about
20 percent for five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nobody knows how this balance would shift if there
were concessions on Jerusalem, which stands as the symbol of the
Islamic cause in the Holy Land. Many believe that it is not up to
Arafat but to the broader Arab leadership to make concessions on
Jerusalem and that is unlikely soon. As long as negotiations
continue, that question may not have to be faced in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Shikaki noted that the next deadline is Sept. 13, when Arafat
has warned he will unilaterally announce the existence of a
Palestinian state if negotiations have not yet produced it. But
Shikaki acknowledged that that deadline could also be stretched.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the state is declared, the impact is not clear.
Arafat declared the state's existence once already _ in 1988 _ to
little effect. It is true that Palestinians today have a large,
lightly armed force inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip, so the
declaration could have more bite and could, in fact, lead to
violent confrontation. Then again, the intifada of a decade ago is
not reproducible now since the soldiers among the Palestinians
today are Palestinian, not Israeli. A street revolt, unless
actually led by Arafat, would probably have to start as one against
him, and for now that prospect seems remote. Rogue acts of violence
could, of course, lead to sympathetic involvement of Palestinian
police. But, again, the prevalent view is that such violence would
be quelled.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that, given the difficult issues, like Jerusalem
and refugees, that were on the table, Camp David's failure was not
only inevitable but useful. Zev Chafets, a commentator who was head
of the Israeli government press office under Prime Minister
Menachem Begin 20 years ago, even suggests that the general
reaction in the Middle East is relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come down to it, the deal was supposed to be our
giving them all this land in exchange for them saying they forgive
us,'' Chafets said. ``But they don't forgive us. We haven't reached
that stage yet. So we have to continue as is. We have reached quite
a comfortable modus vivendi. The Palestinians still run the Muslim
quarter and we still have sovereignty over Maale Adumim.'' He was
referring to a large Jewish settlement east of Jerusalem in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Dromi, who ran the government press office under Yitzhak
Rabin, compares the relationship between Israelis and Palestinians
to that between a couple going through a divorce while living in
the same house. ``Neither one is going to leave, even if they try
to make life unbearable for each other. So, in the long run, they
adjust and minimize the points of friction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dromi points to the increasing interaction between people on
the two sides as evidence that the process of mutual adjustment is
advancing. He says that his brother, a senior police officer, is in
frequent contact with Palestinian officers and that even when
official relations have been tense, personal ones have been warm.
He notes further that every Saturday there are huge traffic jams as
thousands of Israelis drive to the West Bank cities of Nablus and
Tulkarm to shop. Thousands of others drive to Jericho to gamble.
``These are the same cities where their sons had to chase stone
throwers into the alleys of the casbah,'' he mused.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The reality is indeed new. For two generations, the political
divide in Israel was between those on the left who called for ``two
states for two peoples'' and those on the right who swore there
would never be a Palestinian state. Now the whole discussion is
what the contours and powers of that state would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a major realignment going on,'' said Yoram Hazony, a
conservative who was an aide to Benjamin Netanyahu when he was
prime minister. ``There is, in effect, a condition of political
independence for the Palestinians. Today, there is no such thing as
a `not-one-inch' position. Now you hear people on the far right
saying that if we are going to trade territory, let's give the
Palestinians as many Arab villages in Israel as possible to
maximize the Jewish majority in Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is another useful myth that animated the Camp
David peace process: that only the governments of Barak and Arafat
in their current configurations can make this peace and so a
historic opportunity is at stake. The same was said of Yitzhak
Rabin and Arafat. After Rabin's assassination in 1995 by a Jewish
extremist, the hawkish Netanyahu was elected and the doomsayers
seemed correct. But the peace process did not die, and it is
unlikely to if Barak and Arafat fail to decide how to share
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   All acknowledge that Jerusalem is the most difficult issue
because while land can be divided, it is far less clear how to
divide a symbol that is, in Hazony's words, ``at the heart of what
we think we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a myth that only at Camp David did the issue of
Jerusalem first get an airing. It was certainly the first time it
was broached directly at the very top, but Jerusalem has been under
discussion for quite a while. Yossi Beilin, a senior minister in
Barak's government, negotiated Jerusalem's future with Abu Mazen, a
senior Palestinian official, in 1995. The Rabin assassination in
November of that year ended those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for pessimism over the Israeli-Arab
conflict. There is a huge disparity in culture and income and
numerous bases of resentment. Meron Benvenisti, a leftist former
deputy mayor of Jerusalem and an Israeli expert on the West Bank,
is dismissive of the negotiations over Jerusalem neighborhoods and
sovereignty sharing because he believes the Israelis still do not
take the Palestinians seriously as human beings. That failure, he
believes, will bring the process to a very unhappy end.

A REPUBLICAN TRYOUT FOR CLINTON'S OLD SCRIPT

   PHILADELPHIA _ There are three things you will have to look hard
for as you tune in to the Republican National Convention here this
week: A true-blue conservative icon on center stage. (There may be
a few, but they will be sprinkled in a line-up that resembles a
Benetton commercial.) Any utterance of the word ``abortion.''
(You're more likely to hear the words, ``poor'' or ``underclass.'')
The traditional savaging of the opposition. (Instead, look for
subtle denigrations of the Clinton-Gore years and bipartisan
overtures.)
</P>
<P>
   If the Republicans seem timid about bashing President Clinton
this year, it's only fitting. That's because they've stolen his
political game plan. In fact the Grand Old Party is attempting to
refashion itself entirely, clearly using Clinton as its model.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after Clinton captured the White House by venturing
toward the middle and running against some of the orthodoxies of
his party _ including those on welfare, teacher unions and racial
quotas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush is trying a similar approach.
While Bush is not moving as far as Clinton in forsaking the
principles of his party, he sounds a lot like a Democrat when he
holds forth about protecting Social Security, reaching out to the
dispossessed and lavishing more money on public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush last week startled Democrats and Republicans alike when he
spoke out about prescription drug benefits for the elderly. Bush
has even appropriated Clinton's mantra from 1992, ``a different
kind of Democrat.'' He would be ``a different kind of Republican,''
he reassures audiences.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Republicans are advertising ``a different kind of
convention.'' This is what Americans will see on stage: A single
mom. A grandmother and granddaughter talking about Social Security.
A rank-and-file union member discussing his economic plight. A
teacher chatting about education reform.
</P>
<P>
   But to win the White House, Bush must prove that he is doing
more than muffling the vitriol by yanking the Pat Buchanans,
Marilyn Quayles and Phil Gramms offstage. His challenge is to
assemble a new Republican majority with the help of constituencies
that voted Democratic four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he has to convince voters that he is not beholden to
the right wing. With some success, polls show, Bush is making a
play for the blue-collar Democrats and suburban women who backed
Clinton overwhelmingly four years ago. He is reaching out
aggressively to Latino voters. He even dared to speak before the
NAACP, not because he thought he could convert African American
voters _ among the Democratic Party's most loyal backers _- but
because of the signal it would send to moderates that he is
inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the calculation, too, is that such appeals could at the
very least give minorities less reason to mobilize against
Republicans on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bush can afford to reach out to moderates this year because the
base of his own party, ravenous to reclaim the White House, is
willing to make compromises. Not since the love fest for Ronald
Reagan in 1984 have Republicans appeared so harmonious on the eve
of their convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spend one day of this convention making Republicans
happy, you're wasting your time because they already are,'' said
Rick Davis, a top official at four past Republican conventions.
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign intensifies, though, Vice President Al Gore and
the Democrats will increasingly portray Bush as Newt Gingrich
without the scowl. To this end, they were handed some potent
ammunition last week, when Bush picked Dick Cheney as his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheney pairing suggested that Bush was harkening to his
party's conservative past rather than seeking a partner who could
broaden the ticket's ideological appeal. Clinton, in contrast, won
credibility as a reconfigured Democrat by picking Gore _ assembling
a Southern moderate ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not have to settle on a conservative. He has the
latitude that was denied Bob Dole four years ago when he picked
Jack Kemp as his running mate. Dole, however, needed someone to
rouse the party's conservative faithful, who had not rallied around
him, as they have around Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition, said he
was reassured by the Cheney pick. ``The fact that he's reaching out
to swing voters is not a bad thing,'' he said. ``You can trust the
candidate. You know where he's coming from philosophically. He's
not doing anything to alienate his base. That's the important
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he be as successful at co-opting _ or at least taming _ the
opposition as Clinton? Or will he fail, as did Gov. Michael Dukakis
in 1988? In that year's campaign, the elder George Bush effectively
branded Dukakis a Massachusetts liberal and card-carrying member of
the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Gov. Bush and the Republicans have had it both ways.
It happened this weekend in Philadelphia. The Bush-controlled
Republican Party drafted a platform that cast off several
hard-edged party positions of the past, like abolishing the
Education Department and the National Endowment for the Arts. The
hostile language toward immigration four years ago was substituted
with a tribute to the role of new Americans. But conservatives were
not neglected. The platform contained a reaffirmation of its ban on
abortion _ with no exceptions _ despite a drive on Friday by some
party members to soften the language.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Austin last week. There Bush was, introducing to
the world a running mate who had one of the most conservative
voting records in Congress. But in their oratory, they sounded as
Democratic as Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared that he called upon Cheney to help him
``accomplish some great goals'' for the nation: ``To save and
strengthen Social Security. To improve Medicare and provide
prescription drugs for the elderly. To reform our public schools.''
All but the last point _ ``To rebuild our military to keep the
peace'' _ sounded like they would be more likely to issue from Al
Gore's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, of course, are already working hard not to let
Bush get away with this balancing act. They argue that many of his
proposals for new spending on social projects are modest and
symbolic. And most of these proposals, they note, offer
traditionally Republican solutions that rely heavily on the power
of the private sector, as in his plan to privatize Social Security
or his endorsement of vouchers to allow public money to go to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may recognize that there are some real ideological
divides between Bush and Gore. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last
week showed that the public sees stark differences in how they
would handle taxes, health care, abortion and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's right-down-the-middle tactics may succeed. Both
parties have a history of remaking themselves. In 1952, Dwight
Eisenhower refused to tear down elements of the New Deal and spoke
loftily about retooling the Republican Party. While Bush calls
himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' Eisenhower favored the
term ``dynamic conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, the former education secretary, said the
convention strategy is too middle-of-the-road for his taste, but
defends it as smart politics. ``The convention is not as right-wing
as I am,'' he said. ``They're not taking advice from the old
Washington hands. They're following their own counsel _ and doing
it brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while prominent conservatives are staying silent as their
bread-and-butter issues _ school prayer and opposition to abortion
and homosexual rights _ get short shrift (or no shrift at all),
Bush could be risking his relations with others on the right, who
worry that the party is losing its soul.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union,
warned that Bush had better be careful that his overtures to
moderates do not become more substantive. ``The feel-good stuff and
atmospherics is all fine,'' he said. ``But when push comes to
shove, Republicans win elections in which there is a clear
distinction between their position and the Democratic position on
the issues. If you spend all your time reaching out, you're putting
your base in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bush seems to be having more luck reassuring
conservatives than his father, the former president, who was never
fully trusted on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, for one, is haunted by the elder Bush's speech,
written by Peggy Noonan, at the 1988 Republican convention at which
the nominee uttered his famous anti-tax pledge. ``I just hope and
pray he doesn't have Peggy Noonan write, `Read My Lips,'''
Robertson said. ``We don't need any tax pledge redux!''
</P>
<P>
   So the right is watching. But if the younger Bush has learned
anything from his father, it is that if you try to tack right and
then dance to the center, you can end up falling off the political
stage.

hostile language toward immigration four years ago was substituted
with a tribute to the role of new Americans. But conservatives were
not neglected. The platform contained a reaffirmation of its ban on
abortion _ with no exceptions _ despite a drive on Friday by some
party members to soften the language.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It happened in Austin last week. There Bush was, introducing to
the world a running mate who had one of the most conservative
voting records in Congress. But in their oratory, they sounded as
Democratic as Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush declared that he called upon Cheney to help him
``accomplish some great goals'' for the nation: ``To save and
strengthen Social Security. To improve Medicare and provide
prescription drugs for the elderly. To reform our public schools.''
All but the last point _ ``To rebuild our military to keep the
peace'' _ sounded like they would be more likely to issue from Al
Gore's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, of course, are already working hard not to let
Bush get away with this balancing act. They argue that many of his
proposals for new spending on social projects are modest and
symbolic. And most of these proposals, they note, offer
traditionally Republican solutions that rely heavily on the power
of the private sector, as in his plan to privatize Social Security
or his endorsement of vouchers to allow public money to go to
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Voters may recognize that there are some real ideological
divides between Bush and Gore. A New York Times/CBS News Poll last
week showed that the public sees stark differences in how they
would handle taxes, health care, abortion and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush's right-down-the-middle tactics may succeed. Both
parties have a history of remaking themselves. In 1952, Dwight
Eisenhower refused to tear down elements of the New Deal and spoke
loftily about retooling the Republican Party. While Bush calls
himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' Eisenhower favored the
term ``dynamic conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, the former education secretary, said the
convention strategy is too middle-of-the-road for his taste, but
defends it as smart politics. ``The convention is not as right-wing
as I am,'' he said. ``They're not taking advice from the old
Washington hands. They're following their own counsel _ and doing
it brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while prominent conservatives are staying silent as their
bread-and-butter issues _ school prayer and opposition to abortion
and homosexual rights _ get short shrift (or no shrift at all),
Bush could be risking his relations with others on the right, who
worry that the party is losing its soul.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union,
warned that Bush had better be careful that his overtures to
moderates do not become more substantive. ``The feel-good stuff and
atmospherics is all fine,'' he said. ``But when push comes to
shove, Republicans win elections in which there is a clear
distinction between their position and the Democratic position on
the issues. If you spend all your time reaching out, you're putting
your base in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Bush seems to be having more luck reassuring
conservatives than his father, the former president, who was never
fully trusted on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, for one, is haunted by the elder Bush's speech,
written by Peggy Noonan, at the 1988 Republican convention at which
the nominee uttered his famous anti-tax pledge. ``I just hope and
pray he doesn't have Peggy Noonan write, `Read My Lips,'''
Robertson said. ``We don't need any tax pledge redux!''
</P>
<P>
   So the right is watching. But if the younger Bush has learned
anything from his father, it is that if you try to tack right and
then dance to the center, you can end up falling off the political
stage.

PENTAGON ASSAILED FOR DISPLAY AT PHILADELPHIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans in Congress have long chided their
Democratic colleagues for ignoring shortfalls in the defense
budgets, but the Pentagon's decision to send a display of some of
the military's latest hardware to the Republican National
Convention gave the Democrats a golden opportunity to turn the
tables.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic congressmen sharply criticized the Pentagon's
decision to send an array of weapons and other equipment to the
former Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a three-day exhibition that
begins Saturday, saying the money would be better spent on repairs
or benefits for service members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Pentagon's policy barring the military from
involvement in partisan political activities, Defense Secretary
William Cohen approved a request to ship the weapons _ at
taxpayers' expense _ to the shipyard, where about 100 Republican
members of Congress and their guests are staying during the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they could not yet estimate the cost of
moving all the equipment to Philadelphia, though the Air Force
estimated that its share would be at least $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed letter to Cohen on Friday evening, Rep. Ike Skelton
of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services
Committee, dismissed the Pentagon's arguments that the display did
not represent a partisan event.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I recognize that the department has attempted to make
sure that its activities in Philadelphia will not be interpreted as
associating the department with any partisan political causes,
issues or activities, this will be, frankly, a difficult
distinction for many people to make,'' Skelton wrote. ``There is no
event in American politics more partisan than a national political
convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, echoed by Rep. Neil Abercrombie of Hawaii in an
interview, came too late to have any effect on the display, which
will remain at the shipyard until Monday as a centerpiece of a
series of events there, including a fund-raiser by Rep. Curt
Weldon, a Republican who represents suburban Philadelphia and who
requested the hardware show.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats criticized the decision to send the materiel,
and more than 150 service members, and attacked their Republican
colleagues for ignoring more pressing needs. Their criticisms were
echoed by some service officials, including one senior officer who
referred to the display as ``the Philadelphia fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie said, ``How many soldiers are going to remain on
food stamps while they gather in front of this hardware at the
Republican convention,'' referring to an issue that Republicans
have injected into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen defended his decision to sidestep the Pentagon's strict
policy against military involvement in political activities, saying
that the display was not, literally, at the convention. He also
said the request from Weldon had the support of two Democrats from
Philadelphia, Rep. Robert A. Brady and Mayor John F. Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud of the men and women who are serving us and
the equipment that they use, and we're not hesitant about showing
it to general members of the public, as well as people who are
attending the convention,'' Cohen said on Friday. The display at
the shipyard is not scheduled to be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also extended an invitation to the Democrats to play host
to a similar display at their convention in Los Angeles next month,
but Skelton and Abercrombie dismissed that, saying they would not
support such a request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's open to misinterpretation and gives the appearance of
impropriety,'' said Abercrombie, who also serves on the House Armed
Services Committee. ``This is clearly partisan political activity.
There are going to be fund-raisers there. I certainly would not
want to ask someone to send a B-2 bomber to my next fund-raiser.''

RELISHING NICOTINE, COME WHAT MAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., W.Va., Tenn., Va.)   By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLESBORO, Ky. _ At Cuz's Tobacco Outlet, one peculiar item
looks like a length of brown rope folded into the shape of a large
lollipop. A customer can grip it like a lollipop, and perhaps some
do. Most, however, break off a bit and chew it a while, spit, and
have another bit.
</P>
<P>
   This item is called a twist. A section of wall is packed with
different brands of cellophane-wrapped Red Ox twists, Hornet twists
and Grizzly Sweet twists. Places like Cuz's also sell moist and dry
snuff; plugs, which resemble dense black brownies; Apple Jack,
Trophy and Rough Country chewing tobacco; Red Man totems, which are
wrapped like candy bars; Bugler, Stoker's and Zig-Zag loose-leaf
tobacco for roll-your-own cigarettes; and carton upon carton of
cigarettes that cost as little as half as much as a ``premium''
brand, like Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of indisputable evidence of health hazards, of
multibillion-dollar settlements against the leading cigarette
makers, of declining smoking rates nationwide, the consumers
hustling into Cuz's are a remarkable sight.
</P>
<P>
   The use of tobacco, much of it in smokeless forms like snuff,
plugs and chewing tobacco, remains firmly entrenched in Appalachia
and in parts of the South and the Rocky Mountain States.
</P>
<P>
   Along the main drags of the pillowy, kudzu-sculptured Cumberland
hills of Appalachian Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia and in West
Virginia, shops like Cuz's are rural siblings of the wood-paneled
pipe and cigar emporiums that survive in many cities. These stores,
and the convenience stores that sell wide varieties of cheap
tobacco products, are as common as churches.
</P>
<P>
   They cater to older farmers and coal miners with plugs, twists
and chewing tobacco; to younger customers with moist snuff _ the
one growing segment of the national tobacco market _ and to both
with discount cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the women who buy the cigarettes, the stores'
customers are men. ``Men don't like women to chew tobacco,'' said
Mable Partin, a manager at Cuz's. ``You spit with all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The shops sustain a subculture that still relishes nicotine,
come what may.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace smoking bans? Paying $16.06 for a carton of discount
Maverick cigarettes and $3.06 for a pouch of Tennessee Chew, Earl
Brimm explained that he works in a factory where he cannot smoke.
</P>
<P>
   One chew lasts about an hour and a half, he said, and ``it stops
the craving for cigarettes.'' Spit, unlike smoke, has not been an
issue at work. ``I always have a box with some sawdust in it,''
Brimm said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer, strokes and heart attacks? ``I had a heart attack,''
said Gillis Noe, 70, who was buying some twists and a $17.98 carton
containing 12 three-ounce packs of Taylor's Pride chewing tobacco.
``It destroyed 40 percent of my heart. I've had four bypasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said his health problems plunged him into a funk. ``Smoking
was took away from me,'' he said, ``and everything I like to eat. I
can't get much to enjoy.'' So his cardiologist in Nashville let him
run the risk of mouth cancer. ``He told me to chew all I want to
chew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco consumption nationwide has been dropping for decades.
Smoking per capita plunged from 4,345 cigarettes a year in 1990 to
2,146 last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the number
of adults who smoke has dropped from 42 percent 35 years ago to 25
percent today. Use of chewing tobacco has declined even more.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of smokeless tobacco has been sliding for years,
said Robert Maples, president of the Smokeless Tobacco Council, but
it remains a sizable business, accounting for $2.3 billion a year
in sales because of its strength in communities like Middlesboro.
</P>
<P>
   And one widely used form of smokeless tobacco, the moist
Copenhagen, Skoal and Kodiak snuff that comes in a tin the size and
shape of a hockey puck, is still going strong. From 1990 to 1999,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports, annual snuff production
surged from 46 million pounds to 63 million.
</P>
<P>
   One source of tobacco's perseverance is Kentucky, where 31
percent of the adults smoke, the highest rate in the nation.
Another is West Virginia, which has the highest per capita use of
smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   While 1 percent or less of adult men in New York, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island use it, the CDC says,
nearly 16 percent use it in West Virginia, 9 percent in Tennessee
and 8.5 percent in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most of the rest of the country, the Appalachian
states have also been reluctant to curb an industry that underpins
their economies. Kentucky and Tennessee are the nation's second-
and third-largest tobacco producers, after North Carolina, and the
leading producers of the leaves used for smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   To keep it cheap, Kentucky charges an excise tax of 3 cents on a
pack of cigarettes, Tennessee 13 cents, and West Virginia 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, New York and New Jersey all tax cigarettes at least
50 cents a pack. Alaska's tax is $1.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, Kentucky and West Virginia are also among nine states
that do not tax smokeless tobacco at all. Earlier this year, the
West Virginia Legislature foiled the efforts of Gov. Cecil H.
Underwood, a Republican, to tax snuff and chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Like the industry itself, tobacco users around here no longer
pretend that smoking and chewing tobacco or dipping snuff are
harmless, and any who do are reminded of the dangers with every
item they buy.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-ounce bag of Apple chewing tobacco warns, ``This product
may cause gum disease and tooth loss.'' The wrapping on King B
twist reads, ``This product is not a safe alternative to
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of denying the risks, users defend their habit as an
expression of personal liberty. Partin, 43, said she would like
very much to stop smoking, but she enjoys it. ``I've smoked since I
was 8 years old,'' she said. ``My mother died from emphysema from
smoking. She was 60. That was her choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the national trends, the tobacco stores around here say
they are doing good business.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven miles north of Middlesboro, in Pineville, Glen and
Shannon Sexton have an auto repair shop. Next door was a tobacco
shop where business was slow because, they figured, the owner had
lost interest and kept irregular hours. ``So we bought the place,''
Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and fully stocked, the shop is thriving. But the Sextons
are a little troubled about their new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even smoke,'' Sexton said. ``Or chew,'' Sexton added.
``We don't know if we did a good deed or not,'' Sexton said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a dull overcast helped to hold temperatures in the 70s
across much of the Northeastern States. The summer chill is
symptomatic of the region's weather this July with little change
expected Sunday. The day will dawn with patchy fog near the
Northeast Seaboard while showers and thunderstorms accompany a
front crossing New York and parts of New England. By afternoon,
additional thunderstorms will erupt in the Northeast as peeks of
the sun warm and destabilize the muggy air.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will also form ahead of a front crossing the Ohio
Valley Sunday while the Southeast stays partly sunny with spotty
storms expected mainly in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally hot weather will occupy the interior West.
Brilliant sunshine will boost readings to near 100 degrees in many
places.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: HAWAIIAN HURRICANES
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hawaiians were keeping a wary eye on Hurricane
Daniel about 600 miles east of the island chain. But, as is typical
for tropical storms approaching Hawaii from the east, the once
powerful tempest was steadily weakening. Strong hurricanes are
infrequent visitors to Hawaii, although Hurricane Iniki slammed
into Kauai from the south in 1992. The ocean near the islands is
several degrees cooler than the 80-degree water needed to sustain
hurricanes. Deprived of energy from the warmth of the eastern
Pacific, hurricanes usually dissipate as they approach Hawaii.

<P>
   CHINA-NEW-DESERT (Lagan, China) _ A new desert is forming here
on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a legendary
stretch once known for grasses reaching as high as a horse's belly
and home for centuries to ethnic Tibetan herders. The spread of
wastelands on these 9,000-foot-high steppes, and across the
pastures and farmed hillsides of a broad swath of northern China,
is threatening to rend patterns of life that depend intimately on
the land and to strand millions of herders and farmers who have no
other place to go. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI-DRUGS (Leogane, Haiti) _ The drug planes that circle over
the cornfields have become as common as flies. They swoop down, and
men with machine guns stash their cargo _ cocaine _ into cars.
Impoverished villagers gather in hope of snatching a few bags of
cocaine they can then sell. Recently gunmen kept a mob at bay while
unloading the drugs, then abandoned the plane. The angry crowd tore
it apart in a vain search for drugs. Unwittingly, these mobs have
become perhaps Haiti's only front-line deterrent to the Colombian
cocaine traffickers, who have flocked to impoverished Haiti
bringing cash, crime and corruption. By David Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-ELECTION (Caracas, Venezuela) _ Two months after a
first attempt collapsed in ineptitude and scandal, Venezuela will
try again Sunday to hold the biggest vote in its history, a
``mega-election'' in which thousands of candidates, from President
Hugo Chavez down to state legislators, are competing. By Larry
Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   EVANGELICAL-CONVENTION (Amsterdam, Netherlands) _ The Billy
Graham Evangelistic Association has gathered 10,000 evangelists
from 190 countries in Amsterdam this weekend for a nine-day
conference billed as the largest such event ever held. Amsterdam
2000, as the gathering is called, has turned a rambling convention
center on the city's southern edge into an extraordinary crossroads
of global evangelical Christianity. By Gustav Niebuhr.

   BOSNIA-HOMECOMINGS (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina) _ Five years
after the bloodshed and ethnic cleansing that tore apart Bosnia's
communities of Serbs, Muslims and Croats, the first Muslims are now
heading home to areas of eastern Bosnia that were the scene of some
of the war's worst atrocities. Serbs, too, are returning to
Muslim-dominated Sarajevo, a capital once known for its

   SLAVES-DATABASE (New Orleans) _ Gwendolyn Midlo Hall spent 15
years in the courthouses of Louisiana, as well as in archives in
Spain, France and Texas, seeking all records of slave transactions
and entering them into laptop computers. She eventually amassed
computerized records on more than 100,000 slaves _ the largest
collection of individual slave information ever assembled. For
historians who thought such information could never be collected
and analyzed, the database is a once-unimaginable prize. By David
Firestone.

   DOCS-RENEGE (Undated) _ At least 700 doctors, dentists,
psychologists and other health professionals who have signed up for
two-year stints in poor urban and rural areas to pay back their
student loans are now being told that the money they expected will
not materialize, federal officials say. The National Loan Repayment
Program, a $30 million pool of money to attract health workers to

   CRAB-SANCTUARY (Newport News, Va.) _ In the face of economic and

   ANTITERRORISM-BUDGET (Washington) _ When border police arrested
a man last December for smuggling bomb parts from Canada, the
authorities suspected a plot to turn the millennial New Year's
celebration into a terrorist fiasco and the Customs Bureau
immediately reinforced security along the border. Amid intense
publicity, President Clinton asked Congress to increase spending
for efforts to counter international and domestic terrorism by $300
million. But this summer, as spending bills wind their way through
Congress, the anti-terrorism accounts at Customs and other federal
agencies are coming up short. By Steven A. Holmes.

COMMENTARY: NOT OUR CLASS, DARLING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ It would be fun to see what John O'Hara would
make of the Republicans' restoration convention.
</P>
<P>
   The writer from a small town outside Philadelphia was so fixated
on social mores, on the unspoken rules of class among the Main Line
types, that Ernest Hemingway once cracked, ``Let's start a bloody
fund to send John O'Hara to Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   The novelist of manners called his fictional town outside
Philadelphia Gibbsville, and he wrote about ``the persona gratas of
the inner sanctum,'' as he called the swells of the country club
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any member of the club could come to the dance, but not
everyone who came to the dance was really welcome in the smoking
room,'' he wrote in ``Appointment in Samarra.'' The smoking room
was for ``the spenders and drinkers and socially secure, who could
thumb their noses and not have to answer to anyone except their own
families.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara, who savored the self-destructive streak among the
pampered, would have enjoyed Bushville as much as Gibbsville: a
millennial convention rooting for the goof-off son of the fired
boss to get the big job. It is the old-boy network writ large, a
bunch of mostly rich, white, male, older delegates pouring into the
city of underdog ``Rocky'' to see two overdog oilmen who got to go
to Yale preach about a more democratic Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The writer who always had his nose pressed up against the glass
would have understood perfectly why George Walker Bush did not
scrutinize Dick Cheney's voting record before anointing him _ just
as George Herbert Walker Bush never sat down with J. Danforth
Quayle to have a substantive conversation about issues, principles
or beliefs before anointing him.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been rude. As Bush family icon Henry Stimson,
FDR's secretary of war, put it, ``Gentlemen do not read each
other's mail.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes feel you should trust them to choose trustworthy
seconds from the club.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of Dick Cheney, with his ``Dr. No'' voting record
strafing the little folk, may give Prince Albert more credibility
as a populist.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, the darling of the meritocracy, jumped on the
class issue at a Boston fund-raiser on Friday. W.'s only message,
he mocked, is ``My daddy was president.''
</P>
<P>
   The two George Bushes are engaging and unpretentious. But deep
down in their genes is that elitist sense that the important
decisions should be made by those who are bred to make them. Their
ideology is friendship. They equate integrity with loyalty to them.
They are genuinely surprised when someone accuses them of
callousness _ whether it is the Willie Horton issue with the father
or the relentless Texas death-row executions with the son _ because
their perspective is, ``I know I'm honorable, therefore I'm best
accountable to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The family code is rooted in the noblesse oblige air of Prescott
Bush, a craggy senator and a Wall Street executive who inhabited
the partners' room at Brown Brothers Harriman, a rarefied
wood-paneled universe filled with Skull and Bones men and roll-top
desks and a sense that the fate of the nation was best left in
their hands over cigars and brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek reports this week that W. was always ``somewhat
oblivious to the political power of his family ties.'' Running for
Congress in 1978, he went to a Republican candidates' school.
``David Dreier, now a Republican congressman from California,''
Newsweek says, ``recalls young Bush excitedly telling him, `I've
got the greatest idea of how to raise money for the campaign. Have
your mother send a letter to your family's Christmas card list. I
just did and I got $350,000!' It doesn't seem to have occurred to
Bush that not everyone has Barbara Bush's Rolodex full of senators
and statesmen and GOP fat cats.''
</P>
<P>
   It is disturbing the way W. first ignored and then defended Dick
Cheney's Draconian anti-woman, anti-child, anti-senior, anti-black,
anti-environment, anti-poor voting record in the House in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   W. took full advantage of his unlimited second chances and
family connections. The people hurt by Cheney's reactionary votes
had only one chance, or no chance.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Peter Jennings on Friday if it was politically
advantageous to be George Bush's son, W. replied, ``No.'' Piffle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his political relationship with his father, the son
replied, ``There is no political relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Double piffle.

COMMENTARY: FACING THE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface word in lede graf should be set in italics.) 
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Napster's big mistake, clearly, was basing itself in California.
It should have operated out of Jersey. Not the homeland of Bruce
Springsteen _ I mean  &UR; old &LR;  Jersey, the island in the middle of the
English Channel. Or maybe the Isle of Man.
</P>
<P>
   Napster, of course, is the company that made it easy for
techno-savvy music fans to download free copies of their favorite
tracks. Last week Judge Marilyn Patel ruled that this was piracy
pure and simple, and ordered Napster to cease operations. To the
surprise of most observers, a higher court has stayed that order;
but Napster's future still looks very questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey story has not been equally big news on this side of
the Atlantic. But recently Jersey, neighboring Guernsey and the
Isle of Man (in the Irish Sea) have come under fire as troublesome
``tax havens.'' All three islands have a peculiar legal status:
they owe allegiance to the queen but are not subject to the laws
and taxes of Britain proper, and they have taken advantage of that
special status to become places where money can be earned, stored
and passed on to heirs free of tax. And thanks to the digital
revolution, it has become much easier for companies and individuals
to arrange their lives in such a way that the taxable bits _ in
both senses _ show up where the tax bite (taxed byte?) is lowest.
The result is that the islands average about $13 million in bank
deposits for every inhabitant.
</P>
<P>
   What unites these two stories? Both are about how technology is
erasing boundaries _ the boundaries that we use to define
intellectual property, the boundaries that we use to define tax
jurisdictions. And in both cases the loss of effective boundaries,
though it brings some direct advantages, threatens something
important: the ability of creators to profit from their creations,
the ability of governments to collect revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the surprising thing about these developments is that
they took so long to reach the front page. John Perry Barlow, the
Grateful Dead lyricist turned cyberprophet, published his famous
Wired essay ``The Economy of Ideas'' _ about how the digital
revolution will eliminate intellectual property as we know it _
back in 1994. That's generations ago in Internet time. But digital
events tend to be critical-mass phenomena: they build slowly and
inconspicuously at first, then abruptly explode. Now, suddenly,
both digital tax avoidance and digital theft have become major
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it theft? Some enthusiasts for file-swapping like to claim
that it isn't, that one person's decision to listen to a bootleg
copy of Metallica's latest doesn't take the music away from anyone
else. But of course it does. If a substantial fraction of buyers
avoids paying for books, or music, or movies, it becomes that much
less likely that the products will be created in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Patel's ruling is eventually upheld, it won't make
much difference. Napster was a soft target, a centralized operation
in which the pirated music resided on servers conveniently located
where the short arm of the law could reach them. Ready to take up
the slack if Napster shuts down are decentralized, ``distributed''
systems in which the music resides on the computers of many
different people. And there is always the option of using servers
located not in San Mateo, Calif., but in more accommodating
jurisdictions. Indeed, both Jersey Telecom and Manx Telecom are
investing large sums in high-speed connections, with the hope that
their islands will become homes to vast ``server farms.'' Right now
the selling point is tax avoidance, but I'm surely not the only
person to notice that the same infrastructure would facilitate
copyright avoidance as well.
</P>
<P>
   Barlow has urged creators to follow the example of the Grateful
Dead _ let the fans tape the music, and make it up on ticket sales.
Somehow, I think that's a special case. He also talks cheerfully
about how the 19th-century frontier was governed by the ``unwritten
Code of the West,'' which had the ``fluidity of etiquette rather
than the rigidity of law.'' Unfortunately, that etiquette didn't
save the buffalo _ or give any consideration to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that this story is much bigger than music, or even
intellectual property. Something serious, and troubling, is
happening _ and I haven't heard any good ideas about what to do
about it.

   Smile When You Downsize the Name, Partner
</P>
<P>
   Before signing on to the Republican Party ticket with Gov.
George W. Bush, Dick Cheney should have read the small print _ it's
his own name.
</P>
<P>
   On the new campaign placard unveiled at the candidates' first
appearance in Wyoming, Cheney's name was two-thirds the size of
Bush's _ on a second, lower line.
</P>
<P>
   Though running mates, they are not co-stars, at least in
Hollywood terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got co-stars, you've got them on the same line,

at International Creative Management, and Julia Robert's agent.
``What's the message? Cheney needs a new agent. They're not sharing
the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   What's true for Harrison and Michelle in this summer's ``What
Lies Beneath'' _ co-stars, pica for pica _ was also true for
Ike-Dick, McKinley-Roosevelt, Clinton-Gore, Lincoln-Johnson and
Reagan-Bush.
</P>

there is a collective responsibility for perpetuating the office of

   Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said there was
no intention in the official campaign image beyond the solution of

   A Creeping Tale for $1 a Chapter
</P>
<P>
   The horror writer Stephen King became the first major author to
self-publish over the Internet when he released the first chapter
of a serial novel called ``The Plant,'' about a vine that
terrorizes a publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   King's previous electronic book, the novella ``Riding the
Bullet,'' drew 400,000 orders in the first 24 hours after Simon &AMP;
Schuster published it in March. This time King is cutting out his
publisher, hoping to break new ground for less commercially
successful authors. Using a honor system, he is asking $1 for the
first chapter and for each monthly installment. He will stop
writing unless 75 percent of the downloaders pay, leaving fans in
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   So far 41,000 copies of chapter one were downloaded the first
day it appeared. That is far less than the initial demand for his
novella, which had Simon &AMP; Schuster's advance marketing behind it.
But it is still more than most titles sell in a year. King will
post another tally this weekend. So far more than 75 percent of the
readers are paying; Amazon.com is collecting. An envelope
mistakenly arriving at King's office was addressed only: ``Stephen
King, Rich Writer, Bangor, Maine.'' Inside was a check for $5. The
return address: ``Satisfied Downloader.''

oil. Ford Motor changed course, vowing to increase the average

miles a gallon from 18, by 2005. Ford will also improve the fuel

   A Creeping Tale for $1 a Chapter
</P>
<P>
   The horror writer Stephen King became the first major author to
self-publish over the Internet when he released the first chapter
of a serial novel called ``The Plant,'' about a vine that
terrorizes a publishing house.
</P>
<P>
   King's previous electronic book, the novella ``Riding the
Bullet,'' drew 400,000 orders in the first 24 hours after Simon &AMP;
Schuster published it in March. This time King is cutting out his
publisher, hoping to break new ground for less commercially
successful authors. Using a honor system, he is asking $1 for the
first chapter and for each monthly installment. He will stop
writing unless 75 percent of the downloaders pay, leaving fans in
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   So far 41,000 copies of chapter one were downloaded the first
day it appeared. That is far less than the initial demand for his
novella, which had Simon &AMP; Schuster's advance marketing behind it.
But it is still more than most titles sell in a year. King will
post another tally this weekend. So far more than 75 percent of the
readers are paying; Amazon.com is collecting. An envelope
mistakenly arriving at King's office was addressed only: ``Stephen
King, Rich Writer, Bangor, Maine.'' Inside was a check for $5. The
return address: ``Satisfied Downloader.''

   North Korea Finds Softer Stances in the West
</P>
<P>
   North Korea does indeed seem to be coming out of its shell. In
the highest-level talks between the United States and North Korea
since the Korean War, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met
with Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun. New Zealand and Canada said
they were normalizing relations with North Korea.

   A 19-Under Wonder
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods looks as comfortable making history as he does
holding a golf club. By winning the British Open last Sunday, he
became the youngest player to complete the career Grand Slam,
winning all four major championships by age 24. If Woods wins the
PGA Championship in August, he will become the first player since
Ben Hogan (1953) to win three consecutive majors. Stay tuned.

   Spraying for a Deadly Virus
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus has returned to the New York region, if not
moved farther afield. Health officials had hoped that the
mosquito-borne disease _ never detected in the Western Hemisphere
prior to last year, when it caused seven deaths in the New York
area _ might be wiped out by cool weather. After finding infected
mosquitoes, New York City sprayed. So far, no human infections have
been confirmed. At least one dead infected crow was found in
Boston.

   Economies of Scale at Ford
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, automakers have made small fuel-economy
gains on some models only to make other vehicles larger and more
powerful, with poorer mileage. The result has been ever-increasing
emissions of global warming gases and more dependence on foreign
oil. Ford Motor changed course, vowing to increase the average
mileage of all its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent, to 23
miles a gallon from 18, by 2005. Ford will also improve the fuel
economy of its other models.

   A Link for SIDS
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in Italy discovered a genetic link between some
cases of sudden infant death syndrome and a rare heart disorder,
long-QT syndrome. Their report, published in The New England
Journal of Medicine, said all newborns should be given
electrocardiograms to detect the treatable heart problem, which may
account for 10 to 30 percent of the 2,800 sudden infant deaths a
year. But most American experts oppose routine electrocardiograms,
saying they would not save enough lives to justify the expense.

   Music Industry and Napster
</P>
<P>
   First, it was a victory for the recording industry. Then it was
a defeat, when an appeals court granted a stay of the preliminary
injunction issued a day earlier by a U.S. District Court judge that
would have shut down Napster, the Internet music-swapping service
that the major record labels have charged with contributing to
widespread music piracy. Either way, as millions of Internet users
stampeded to Napster and alternatives, the legal wrangling raised
the question of whether enforcing copyright law in a digital age
might take more than winning in court.

   A Delicate Senate Balance
</P>
<P>
   There can be opportunity even in tragedy, and Georgia's
Democratic governor, Roy Barnes, seized it by appointing his
immensely popular predecessor, Zell Miller, to fill the Senate seat
vacated by the recent death of Paul Coverdell, a Republican. Miller
will run in a special election in November to fill the remaining
four years of Coverdell's term. The appointment brought the
Democrats one seat closer to regaining control of the Senate, where
the Republicans now hold 54 of 100 seats.

   A Strain of Mad Cow
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, mad cow disease is scarier than ever. Fourteen
people have died of it already this year and five more are dying,
compared to 14 in all of last year. Experts say the rising death
toll might presage an even higher death rate.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. Department of Agriculture is acting zealously to
combat any chance of mad cow disease entering the country. It has
condemned two flocks of imported Belgian dairy sheep because four
sheep related to the 355 animals tested positive for an
undetermined disease in the mad cow family. Fighting back in
federal court, the owners of the sheep have challenged the science
behind the tests.

   Taxpayers who spent $2.65 extra for certified mail when they
sent their money to the IRS and other tax agencies may have noticed
that their checks went uncashed for weeks. The reason? The U.S.
Postal Service delayed using new technology and lacked workers,
causing tens of thousands of certified letters, with hundreds of
millions of dollars of checks, to languish. To add insult to
injury, New York City tax officials dunned hundreds of property
owners on the assumption that they had failed to pay.

   GOP-OUTLOOK-REVIEW (Philadelphia) _ There are three things you
will have to look hard for at the Republican National Convention: A
true-blue conservative icon on center stage. Any utterance of the
word ``abortion.'' The standard savaging of the opposition. It is
only fitting that Republicans are somewhat sheepish about taking on
President Clinton because their political game plan comes directly
from him. Clinton, in fact, is the model for the GOP as it tries to
refashion itself entirely. By Richard L. Berke. (Moved in `a'

</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-SUMMIT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The dirty little secret of the
``high stakes'' Camp David peace summit is that ``the brink'' was a
myth. No explosion in Israel or the Palestinian territories
occurred when the talks collapsed, nor is chaos expected any time
soon. This is because not only was ``the brink'' a myth, so were
the descriptions of what lay on the other side. It was never
failure of the summit that brought with it the risk of violence. It
was success. By Ethan Bronner. (Moved in `i' category)

   POLITICS-INTERNET-REVIEW (Undated) _ At this summer's political
conventions, with the outcomes are preordained, the hottest
activity may be interactivity. On C-SPAN's Web site, for instance,
users will be able to click on one of several distinct video feeds
from the convention hall, or even choose to watch the action from
the vantage point of the C-SPAN control booth. Customized political
conventions are just one example of the nation's growing,
technologically-abetted, obsession with getting what you want when
you want. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   CONCORDE-TECH-REVIEW (Washington) _ Two air disasters involving
symbols of national pride _ the Concorde in 2000 and the Hindenburg
in 1937 _ are instructive about the difficulties of predicting
technological progress. It remains to be seen whether the Concorde
accident will kill the supersonic transports the way the Hindenburg
ended the promise of the dirigible. But progress _ including,
perhaps, progress in safety _ has bypassed both. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   CONVICTION-REVERSALS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Newly discovered
evidence may seem like a convict's dream come true, but the reality
of American courts is that such evidence rarely makes a difference.
Once a jury has reached a verdict or a judge has ruled, lawyers
say, the odds are overwhelmingly against reopening a case, no
matter how compelling the new information might seem. By Jane
Fritsch.
</P>
<P>
   DR-LAURA-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the
conservative radio talk-show therapist, is a woman of a many
opinions who has spawned a virtual industry of web sites devoted to
mocking, reviling or opposing her on any number of counts. They
attack her credentials, manner and her stock phrases (`Now, go take
on the day,' `I'm my kid's mom'). Herewith a sampling of online
commentary about the good doctor.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNGADULT-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since the 1970s, young-adult
novels have featured a parade of America's dysfunctional. And early
on, there was great hue and cry about Judy Blume's books, with
their frank discussion of sex, and Robert Cormier's books, which
dropped the happy ending. But just in the last four years,
young-adult fiction has moved into ever bleaker territory. By Tamar
Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   ATOMIC-PARTICLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ For most physicists, there
is only one answer to the question of why matter weighs anything at
all. It is called the Higgs boson, a strange and special particle
that laboratories in Europe and the United States are racing to
detect. It would be one of the most sublime discoveries in the
history of physics. By James Glanz.

STUDY FINDS PARAMEDIC STRESS, OVERWORK HAMPERS DECISIONS &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early data from a Los Angeles Fire Department
study suggests paramedics are critically overworked and stressed,
raising questions about their safety and the public's, the Daily
News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an ongoing stress evaluation conducted by the Fire
Department's psychologist, nearly 32 percent of paramedics surveyed
showed stress levels of ``serious concern,'' officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about their bedside manner, but their ability to
make decisions, provide services and even drive well,'' said Dr.
Mark Eckstein, department medical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very serious concerns about the impacts on the
paramedics, their burnout and their ability to perform
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief William Bamattre and other top Fire Department
officials declined to comment or did not return repeated calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Scott, the psychologist who administered the 200
anonymous self-evaluations this spring, said preliminary data from
the incomplete study raise serious concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The workload is heavy and high, causing individuals not to
recuperate,'' Scott said. ``The sample was more than adequate to
represent the entire paramedic force. It gives us a sense of where
we are at.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need control groups to make sure that our concern is
appropriate and accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the early findings, union officials said the department
has not pulled paramedics out of service because the department is
so short-staffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem has reached real crisis proportions,'' said
Councilwoman Laura Chick, former chairwoman of the public safety
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disturbed and concerned for the people being pushed over
the limit and the people whose lives depend on them. The leadership
of this city, in the Fire Department and in the city's
administration, have allowed this to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The study comes as the department scrambles to hire 51 more
paramedics, with as many as 150 needed for a full staff. Without
enough staffers, paramedics are required to fill shifts with as
much as 100 hours of overtime a week.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics and union officials said nearly 350 medics must be
hired to reduce overtime and stress to safe levels, as well as to
improve the quality of service to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Officials agreed more paramedics are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the hiring freeze and the workload got heavier while
the work force got lighter,'' said Fire Commission President David
Fleming. ``It's going to take a long time to make up for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities, including San Francisco and San Diego, take
immediate steps when they recognize that paramedics are dangerously
stressed or overworked. And both cities have more paramedics per
capita than Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We instituted a deferral program where after a certain number
of calls, we don't send the same paramedics to nonurgent calls,''
said San Francisco Emergency Medical Services Chief Richard
Shortall. ``That way, we can be sure they get some rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said a similar program could be implemented
here, but that the department doesn't want to acknowledge publicly
the extent of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't just discovered yesterday. Management has known
about this but there's been no discussion of it,'' said Ken
Buzzell, president of United Firefighters of Los Angeles City.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics who took the psychological exam said they were not
surprised by the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``They act like they don't know this exists. They know what it
is, but they ignore it,'' said one paramedic, who asked not to be
identified for fear of retaliation. ``The thing that hurts us the
most is the arrogance and the denial. It's a very cavalier attitude
and a very bad combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he will continue more formalized evaluations that
take into account the paramedic's background and individual working
environment.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wants to test another control group - possibly
another department that is not facing the staffing shortages of the
Fire Department - to see how stress levels compare.
</P>
<P>
   The study is expected to be completed within two months.

LEGAL CHANGE WOULD ALLOW WINEMAKING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY &HT;    (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before Prohibition began in 1920, the Santa Monica
Mountains were ripe with vineyards and wineries, giving the world
its first taste of California's famous wine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Los Angeles County is poised to take back its reputation as
a maker of premium wine.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since Prohibition, momentum has built to
allow vineyard owners to open small, boutique wineries.
</P>
<P>
   And vintners said they couldn't be happier to get rid of the
1920s-vintage law, which allows winemaking only in industrial parts
of the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles used to be the wine capital of the state,'' said
Don MacAdam, owner of Sweet Water Vineyards in Saugus. ``It doesn't
make sense that we have the majority of the population in the state
and consume the majority of the wine and are not taking advantage
of growing and processing wine here.''
</P>
<P>
   The county Regional Planning Commission voted unanimously
recently to allow vintners to produce 5,000 gallons a year in
agriculturally zoned parts of the county.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will vote again in the next few weeks, clearing
the way for supervisors to decide whether to give final approval
after a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Vineyard owners in the Santa Monica Mountains and Antelope
Valley are excited about the prospect of being able to make wine on
their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old ordinance is a relic of the Prohibition era when they
wanted to keep people from possessing alcohol,'' said Juan Alonso,
owner of the Le Chene French Cuisine restaurant and a five-acre
vineyard in Saugus.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ordinance, vineyard owners ship their grapes to
other counties, where the bulk of winemaking is allowed. Some small
vineyard owners make wine but only for personal consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Now they hope to contribute to Los Angeles County's rich history
of vintners.
</P>
<P>
   The region's early settlers, led by Spanish missionaries,
planted grapes as they built missions along the California coast in
the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   Mission San Gabriel, east of Los Angeles, had the largest
winemaking operation. After the Spanish missionary period ended in
about 1833, winegrowing continued to be centered in the Greater Los
Angeles area and Southern California dominated California
winemaking for the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Winemaking mostly came to a stop in Los Angeles County in 1920
with the passage of Prohibition, but it wasn't because of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``A large number of acres were planted and a disease eradicated
many of the grape vines,'' said Annie Lin, acting senior regional
planning associate for the county Department of Regional Planning.
``Then there were development pressures and much of the land was
taken out of agricultural use and developed.''
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of the proposed change was when Malibu Hills
Vineyard owner George Rosenthal asked Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
several years ago whether he could build a winery.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky discovered the current law would not allow a winery,
so he and Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich proposed the new
ordinance. The board voted in July 1999 to ask the Regional
Planning Commission to revise the old ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic ordinance,'' Yaroslavsky said. ``Grapes are
currently grown for wines in the Santa Monica Mountains. The
(Malibu Hills and Moraga vineyards) are two well-known vineyards
that have gotten the wine community's attention. These are very
good wines. They sell very well. But they are limited because they
are small vineyards.''
</P>
<P>
   If the law is eliminated, it would clear the way for so-called
boutique wineries, which run a small crushing operation, a limited
bottling facility and a small tasting sales room located on the
property.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, who owns a 23-acre vineyard in Newton Canyon in the
Malibu Hills, said he wants to build a boutique winery that would
produce about 5,000 gallons a year. He currently ships his grapes
to San Luis Obispo to be made into wine.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ordinance change could save his business. The state
could force him to stop shipping his grapes outside the county
because of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, a pest threatening
vineyards throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has devastated some of the vineyards in Temecula,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Peterson, who owns a five-acre vineyard at his home in the
Santa Monica Mountains, said he put in his vineyard as a fire break
in 1989. Now he wants to expand it to 19 acres, if the ordinance
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest goal is to make wine and sell it to restaurants.
It is romantic to come up here to a boutique winery where people
can taste wine.''

<P>
   MIDDLESBORO, Ky. _ At Cuz's Tobacco Outlet, one peculiar item
looks like a length of brown rope folded into the shape of a large
lollipop. A customer can grip it like a lollipop, and perhaps some
do. Most, however, break off a bit and chew it a while, spit, and
have another bit.
</P>
<P>
   This item is called a twist. A section of wall is packed with
different brands of cellophane-wrapped Red Ox twists, Hornet twists
and Grizzly Sweet twists. Places like Cuz's also sell moist and dry
snuff; plugs, which resemble dense black brownies; Apple Jack,
Trophy and Rough Country chewing tobacco; Red Man totems, which are
wrapped like candy bars; Bugler, Stoker's and Zig-Zag loose-leaf
tobacco for roll-your-own cigarettes; and carton upon carton of
cigarettes that cost as little as half as much as a ``premium''
brand, like Marlboro.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of indisputable evidence of health hazards, of
multibillion-dollar settlements against the leading cigarette
makers, of declining smoking rates nationwide, the consumers
hustling into Cuz's are a remarkable sight.
</P>
<P>
   The use of tobacco, much of it in smokeless forms like snuff,
plugs and chewing tobacco, remains firmly entrenched in Appalachia
and in parts of the South and the Rocky Mountain States.
</P>
<P>
   Along the main drags of the pillowy, kudzu-sculptured Cumberland
hills of Appalachian Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia and in West
Virginia, shops like Cuz's are rural siblings of the wood-paneled
pipe and cigar emporiums that survive in many cities. These stores,
and the convenience stores that sell wide varieties of cheap
tobacco products, are as common as churches.
</P>
<P>
   They cater to older farmers and coal miners with plugs, twists
and chewing tobacco; to younger customers with moist snuff _ the
one growing segment of the national tobacco market _ and to both
with discount cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the women who buy the cigarettes, the stores'
customers are men. ``Men don't like women to chew tobacco,'' said
Mable Partin, a manager at Cuz's. ``You spit with all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The shops sustain a subculture that still relishes nicotine,
come what may.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace smoking bans? Paying $16.06 for a carton of discount
Maverick cigarettes and $3.06 for a pouch of Tennessee Chew, Earl
Brimm explained that he works in a factory where he cannot smoke.
</P>
<P>
   One chew lasts about an hour and a half, he said, and ``it stops
the craving for cigarettes.'' Spit, unlike smoke, has not been an
issue at work. ``I always have a box with some sawdust in it,''
Brimm said.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer, strokes and heart attacks? ``I had a heart attack,''
said Gillis Noe, 70, who was buying some twists and a $17.98 carton
containing 12 three-ounce packs of Taylor's Pride chewing tobacco.
``It destroyed 40 percent of my heart. I've had four bypasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said his health problems plunged him into a funk. ``Smoking
was took away from me,'' he said, ``and everything I like to eat. I
can't get much to enjoy.'' So his cardiologist in Nashville let him
run the risk of mouth cancer. ``He told me to chew all I want to
chew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco consumption nationwide has been dropping for decades.
Smoking per capita plunged from 4,345 cigarettes a year in 1990 to
2,146 last year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the number
of adults who smoke has dropped from 42 percent 35 years ago to 25
percent today. Use of chewing tobacco has declined even more.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption of smokeless tobacco has been sliding for years,
said Robert Maples, president of the Smokeless Tobacco Council, but
it remains a sizable business, accounting for $2.3 billion a year
in sales because of its strength in communities like Middlesboro.
</P>
<P>
   And one widely used form of smokeless tobacco, the moist
Copenhagen, Skoal and Kodiak snuff that comes in a tin the size and
shape of a hockey puck, is still going strong. From 1990 to 1999,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture reports, annual snuff production
surged from 46 million pounds to 63 million.
</P>
<P>
   One source of tobacco's perseverance is Kentucky, where 31
percent of the adults smoke, the highest rate in the nation.
Another is West Virginia, which has the highest per capita use of
smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   While 1 percent or less of adult men in New York, Connecticut,
New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island use it, the CDC says,
nearly 16 percent use it in West Virginia, 9 percent in Tennessee
and 8.5 percent in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most of the rest of the country, the Appalachian
states have also been reluctant to curb an industry that underpins
their economies. Kentucky and Tennessee are the nation's second-
and third-largest tobacco producers, after North Carolina, and the
leading producers of the leaves used for smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   To keep it cheap, Kentucky charges an excise tax of 3 cents on a
pack of cigarettes, Tennessee 13 cents, and West Virginia 17 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, New York and New Jersey all tax cigarettes at least
50 cents a pack. Alaska's tax is $1.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, Kentucky and West Virginia are also among nine states
that do not tax smokeless tobacco at all. Earlier this year, the
West Virginia Legislature foiled the efforts of Gov. Cecil H.
Underwood, a Republican, to tax snuff and chewing tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Like the industry itself, tobacco users around here no longer
pretend that smoking and chewing tobacco or dipping snuff are
harmless, and any who do are reminded of the dangers with every
item they buy.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-ounce bag of Apple chewing tobacco warns, ``This product
may cause gum disease and tooth loss.'' The wrapping on King B
twist reads, ``This product is not a safe alternative to
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of denying the risks, users defend their habit as an
expression of personal liberty. Partin, 43, said she would like
very much to stop smoking, but she enjoys it. ``I've smoked since I
was 8 years old,'' she said. ``My mother died from emphysema from
smoking. She was 60. That was her choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the national trends, the tobacco stores around here say
they are doing good business.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven miles north of Middlesboro, in Pineville, Glen and
Shannon Sexton have an auto repair shop. Next door was a tobacco
shop where business was slow because, they figured, the owner had
lost interest and kept irregular hours. ``So we bought the place,''
Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and fully stocked, the shop is thriving. But the Sextons
are a little troubled about their new venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even smoke,'' Sexton said. ``Or chew,'' Sexton added.
``We don't know if we did a good deed or not,'' Sexton said.

LAW ENFORCEMENT LACKS MONEY TO FIGHT TERRORISM, WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When border police arrested a man last December for
smuggling bomb parts from Canada, the authorities suspected a plot
to turn the millennial New Year's celebration into a terrorist
fiasco and the Customs Bureau immediately reinforced security along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Amid intense publicity, President Clinton asked Congress to
increase spending for efforts to counter international and domestic
terrorism by $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer, as spending bills wind their way through
Congress, administration officials say the anti-terrorism accounts
at U.S. Customs and other federal agencies are coming up short.
</P>
<P>
   A spending bill passed by the House of Representatives on July
21 provides no money for bolstering Customs operations on the
Canadian border, which has many remote crossing points like the
ferry landing at Port Angeles, Wash., where Ahmed Ressam, a
32-year-old Algerian, was arrested as he brought his car in from
British Columbia. And while the budget process has not run its
course, administration officials are complaining that the Senate is
considering providing only about one-third of the $50 million the
Customs Service requested for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials cited many instances in which
Congress had not allocated any money to what the White House
considers critical counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each of the last two years we have made a set of
concentrated proposals involving counterterrorism and threats to
critical infrastructure, and Congress has just plain not caught
up,'' said a senior administration official who requested his name
not be used. ``In a couple of cases which we think are really
important, they really haven't put their money where their mouths
are.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, officials said the lawmakers had failed to provide
any of the $24 million it requested to expand the number of Joint
Terrorism Task Force offices, at which agents from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, the Customs Service and local law enforcement agencies
work together.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also declined the administration's request for $31
million for the Department of Justice to train local police, fire
and emergency agencies in how to respond to attacks using nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons. And the Senate is considering only
$10 million _ after the House approved no funds _ to protect
computers in agencies like the Social Security Administration and
the Federal Aviation Administration from hackers. The
administration had requested $95 million.
</P>
<P>
   A staff member of the Commerce, Justice and State Subcommittee
of the House Appropriations Committee, which has jurisdiction over
several agencies with anti-terrorism duties, said Saturday that the
administration made its requests in May, too late in the budget
cycle to be considered for the next fiscal year's budget.
Typically, the administration's budget plans are developed in the
fall and presented officially in the winter; Congress considers the
legislation during the spring and tries to enact the bills during
the summer for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say delays are exacerbated because the job of
fighting terrorism is assigned to a myriad of federal agencies,
whose spending is controlled by a variety of committees and laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now one of those cross-cutting issues that has an
international component, a domestic component, a law enforcement
component, an intelligence component, a medical response component
and a military component,'' said John Parachini, executive director
of the Washington office of the Monterey Institute of International
Studies. ``These are very difficult things to coordinate in the
current structure we have both in the executive branch and in
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing last week of a subcommittee of the House Government
Reform Committee, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., complained that
there needed to be better coordination between the administration
and Congress to determine antiterrorist spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``For reasons of bureaucratic Balkanization, program
proliferation and a tendency to skew threat assessments toward
worst-case scenarios, we still lack those important elements of a
mature, effective policy to combat terrorism,'' he said.

ARMS PLANT WORKERS CONTEND ARMY COVERED UP GAS LEAKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore.)   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of workers who were overcome by fumes at a
chemical weapons plant in Oregon last year is now accusing the Army
of covering up leaks of highly toxic nerve agents and mustard gas
on the day of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the workers at the Umatilla Chemical Depot charge
that investigators from the Army and Raytheon, a defense
contractor, concealed four leaks of sarin and mustard gas that
occurred just hours after 34 workers became ill on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, citing Army documents obtained under the Freedom of
Information Act, also said chemical agents had leaked at the site
22 times during a six-day period, including the day the workers
were sickened. The depot is near Hermiston, in eastern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Army denies that any of the workers stricken at the depot
were exposed to leaks from the chemical weapons, although it has
failed to identify the specific source of their illness. Inquiries
by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration and
the state of Oregon backed up the Army's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either the Army and Raytheon have engaged in a deliberate
attempt to hide the truth about the Umatilla poisonings or they
conducted an investigation that was bungled beyond belief,'' said
James E. McCandlish, a lawyer who is representing 18 of the
workers. They plan to file a federal lawsuit on Monday against the
Army and Washington Group International, Raytheon's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the Umatilla depot, Lt. Col. Tom Woloszyn, said
McCandlish was misinterpreting the data collected by a highly
sensitive system designed to detect the presence of chemical
agents. The readings McClandish is citing are below the levels of
accurate detection, the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had agent detected outside of the igloos
themselves,'' he said, referring to the structures that house 3,317
tons of nerve and mustard agent, about 12 percent of the nation's
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The stricken workers were building an incinerator to destroy the
weapons, as mandated by a 1995 treaty banning chemical arms. Most
of the weapons stored at Umatilla were built in the 1960s,
including more than 100,000 M55 rockets, and some leak due to
corrosion. Since 1984, 127 rockets have been reported leaking.
</P>
<P>
   The Army insists that the dangerous agents have always been
swiftly detected and contained on site. But lawyers for the workers
say the open ventilation systems of the storage igloos could allow
for toxins to leak into the environment, which is what they assert
happened on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the workers were rushed to a local hospital, the
Army and Raytheon ruled out exposure to the deadly agents. Three
weeks after that, officials at the facility said preliminary tests
indicated that fumes from construction materials _ including
fiberglass floorboards, paint or wall panels _ were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been able to identify specifically what caused
the workers to become ill,'' said Mary Alice Binder, a spokeswoman,
on Friday. ``However, we can say it's not the chemical agents
stored at the depot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the workers said the Army and Raytheon investigators
had made no mention of rashes and skin irritations found on their
clients, which are important indicators of exposure to mustard gas.
</P>
<P>
   McCandlish said his clients had since been found to have
disorders that include reactive airway disease, which he said
causes patients to gag in response to certain fumes or aromas,
pulmonary problems and chronic fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Group International declined to comment on behalf of
Raytheon.

<P>
   LAGAN, China _ Tse Rangji fitfully tries shoveling away the
waves of sand that menace her home, half engulfing it like some
artifact of a lost civilization. Then she gives up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pasture here used to be so green and rich,'' said Tse, 46,
waving out toward a tattered landscape of anemic grasses, weeds and
bare dirt among which dunes have erupted like a pox. ``But now the
grass is disappearing and the sand is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband and seven children have already moved into a
tent for fear that their house will buckle under.
</P>
<P>
   The rising sands are part of a new desert forming here on the
eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a legendary stretch once
known for grasses reaching as high as a horse's belly and home for
centuries to ethnic Tibetan herders.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of wastelands on these 9,000-foot-high steppes, and
across the pastures and farmed hillsides of a broad swath of
northern China, is threatening to rend patterns of life that depend
intimately on the land and to strand millions of herders and
farmers who have no other place to go in a country with virtually
no decent, unused land.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people around Lagan have proposed moving elsewhere,'' said
Lu Yuanru, chief of forestry for the surrounding prefecture. ``But
we don't know where to put them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the desert is the combined result of severe
overgrazing that has destroyed the thin topsoil, and a decade of
hotter, drier weather, including three straight years of extreme
drought.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure whether these climate changes are
temporary or part of a human-induced global warming that many
scientists in China and abroad believe has already begun. But Tse
and her neighbors are watching their livelihoods erode before their
eyes, with some of the land damaged beyond all repair.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's drought has thrust a long-building land-use crisis
into the public eye, and the government has stepped up
countermeasures like curbs on the size of herds and restrictions on
farming of steep slopes. But the destruction of semi-arid lands is
still accelerating, said Dr. Song Yuqin, an environmental scientist
at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Song described a ``freckled pattern of expanding barren areas''
in pastures and farmlands stretching from Qinghai Province through
Inner Mongolia and areas to the north of Beijing, which this spring
experienced some of its worst dust storms in decades.
</P>
<P>
   More than 900 square miles of land degrade into useless desert
each year, he said, while much larger areas are losing their
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the process gets started, it tends to expand
exponentially,'' said Song. ``And the people are pushed into a
poverty trap from which it's hard to escape.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Song argues that misuse of the land, spurred by the rising
population of people and livestock, is the overriding cause of
damage in most areas and that there is no proof of a general drying
of the climate. But officials and scientists in Qinghai Province
say they have documented rising temperatures there since the 1970s,
along with lower rainfall and stronger winds.
</P>
<P>
   In battered grasslands to the west of Lagan, in central Qinghai
near the headwaters of the Yellow River, numerous small rivers and
lakes have dried up, pastures have been laid waste by infestations
of rats and sandstorms are billowing.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Tibetan herders in Maduo and Dari counties,
among others, have been forced to become ``guerrilla grazers,'' in
the words of a Chinese newspaper report, taking their animals to
invade the pastures of distant counties already heavily used by
others.
</P>
<P>
   Tse's family has not quite reached that stage. In better times,
she said, the skins and meat from their herd of 250 sheep and goats
earned the family more than $1,000 a year. If they never had
electricity, seldom tasted fruits or vegetables and always relied
on dried dung for cooking fuel, at least they earned enough to buy
the small tractor they still drive to collect drinking water from a
faraway spring.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, with the range increasingly depleted,
they have had to roam farther afield with their animals to find
edible grass, and now they have to buy extra hay to sustain the
animals through the winter. Their income has dropped sharply, Tse
said.
</P>
<P>
   To the east of Lagan, near Qinghai's border with the province of
Gansu, is a large mountainous zone that shows another face of
environmental stress.
</P>
<P>
   In Minhe and neighboring counties, the steep slopes are entirely
carved up into fields, wherever enormous gullies have not already
made farming impossible.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with only one decent rainfall since the spring
planting, large emergency shipments of grain have been necessary to
prevent famine in the mountain villages, which are mainly populated
by Hui Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   But food aid has been necessary for years in these hills, say
officials who have concluded that these slopes simply cannot
support the resident population.
</P>
<P>
   ``More or less every year we have to bring in relief grain,''
said Yang Yingzhong, head of a hillside township. ``Many families
are in dire straits,'' he said, noting that per capita income on
local hillsides was previously no more than $100 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, declining rainfall appears to have helped bring on
the crisis. Annual precipitation in Minhe County averaged 18 inches
in the period from 1956 to 1979, but averaged just 13 inches in the
period from 1980 to 1999, according to the county water bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In these hills and also in the higher-altitude pastures to the
west, the problem is not simply the annual rainfall, but its
changing pattern, agricultural officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, longer dry spells have been punctuated by
brief, concentrated bursts of rain that can wash away soil and run
off without soaking into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the valleys, where irrigation is possible, crops are fine.
But up the hillsides, disaster is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years in a row now our crops have failed,'' said Bei
Yueling, a 35-year-old Hui Muslim farmer and father of three in the
hilltop village of Dakutu. In the terraces Bei planted with wheat,
a few spindly stalks protrude, bearing undersized grains. His
potato fields are mostly barren.
</P>
<P>
   With relief aid, he said, his family eats bread and potatoes,
though during the winter they may also slaughter one of the handful
of sheep they let wander through the hills.
</P>
<P>
   The crops rely on the whims of rainfall, but Bei's family and
the many others crowding these slopes must rely on their own energy
to get water for drinking and washing.
</P>
<P>
   Until the single hard rain this summer, which miraculously
regenerated a mountain spring, Bei was taking his mule on a
four-hour trip every morning to fill two containers of water in a
distant valley. Now, with the spring yielding, he travels one hour
a day fetching water.
</P>
<P>
   Bei's 65-year-old mother-in-law, Ma Lu Gaoya, said: ``I've been
living here for 40 years and I still can't get used to it. The
shortage of water makes life so difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   With aid from the local government, the villagers are installing
ingeniously designed underground cisterns, to collect runoff that
can be used at least to water small plots, and to wash clothes.
This is part of a government strategy to help people survive while
they are forced to restore the steepest slopes to grasses or
forest.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, families who give up farmland will be
given small subsidies of money and grain for five years. The hope
is that, eventually, production of fruits and medical herbs and
controlled herding can restore some income. But there is little
prospect, officials here admit, for other livelihoods to support
the growing hillside population.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, officials say, a share of the people must be moved
elsewhere, though this will require large sums of money and a place
for them to go.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrating the obstacles, a plan to relocate 58,000 people
from eroded hillsides not far from Dakutu provoked a global
controversy when pro-Tibetan activists abroad argued that the plan
would further dilute Tibetan culture and was conceived in haste.
</P>
<P>
   The furor caused the World Bank to withdraw from a plan to
provide money for the project, which involves building an
irrigation system in an arid, sparsely populated area of central
Qinghai that is traditionally Tibetan. China says it will proceed
with the resettlement anyway, using its own resources.
</P>
<P>
   Overcrowding with no easy solution is also a challenge on
Qinghai's pasturelands, mainly inhabited by Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, when the communes created under Mao
Tse-tung were disbanded and families were given title to their own
livestock, the herds have grown precipitously, causing a classic
``tragedy of the commons'' on the range.
</P>
<P>
   In Gonghe County, for example, which includes Lagan, experts say
the grasslands can safely carry 3.7 million sheep. But by the end
of 1998 the land was trampled and nibbled by 5.5 million sheep. For
a while, this brought higher incomes to herders, but now it is the
making of an ecological catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to salvage the depleted pastures, the authorities are
fencing off the range and giving each family its own parcel, in
hopes that this will give herders a direct incentive to nurture the
grass and control the size of herds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the plan works for now, a provincial grazing official
said, the new range allotments cannot be subdivided again as the
numerous children of today's herders come of age. So what will the
next generation do?
</P>
<P>
   The only hope, the official said, is to develop alternatives in
livestock processing or in service industries. But such industries
do not exist right now, he said, and in this remote region, the
economic possibilities remain unclear.

<P>
   LEOGANE, Haiti _ For Del Lydes, the drug planes that circle over
the cornfields have become as common as the flies that buzz around
his cows. They swoop down past the trees and roll to a stop along
the two-lane road that slices through the fields. Then men with
machine guns stash their cargo _ cocaine _ into cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here it is a cocaine area,'' Lydes said. ``A lot of
people have moved. But others come at night to wait for the
planes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``others'' are his impoverished neighbors, who gather in
hope of snatching a few bags of cocaine they can then sell for a
fraction of the drug's street value in the United States. Recently
gunmen kept a mob at bay while unloading the drugs, then abandoned
the plane. The angry crowd tore it apart in a vain search for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they are going to get rich from cocaine,'' Lydes
said. ``When they see a plane they gather around, but when the
pilots see them they scare off the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly, these mobs have become perhaps Haiti's only
front-line deterrent to the Colombian cocaine traffickers, who,
ever adept at finding a weak spot in the Caribbean through which to
funnel their drugs northward, have flocked to impoverished Haiti
bringing cash, crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's inexperienced, understaffed and underpaid police force
and courts have proved irresistible to smugglers who ferry cocaine
aboard speedboats and small planes before hiding it in ships bound
for Miami and Puerto Rico, or just trucking it into the neighboring
Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only broad-gauge assessment is that Haiti is a disaster,''
said Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the U.S. anti-drug
effort. ``We've got weak to nonexistent democratic institutions, a
police force that is on the verge of collapse from internal
corruption and an eroding infrastructure that is creating a path of
very little resistance. We are watching an alarming increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Since October, U.S. Customs officials have confiscated almost
7,000 pounds of cocaine _ three times the total for the previous
year _ in Haitian ships docked in the Miami River. U.S. law
enforcement officials estimate that about 67 tons, or 14 percent,
of the cocaine that enters the United States now comes through
Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   In general, more than half of the cocaine headed for the United
States flows through the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, U.S. anti-drug agents have tried to focus more
on Haiti, but have been hampered by a political paralysis that has
left the country without a functioning legislature for the last
year and therefore prevented passage of money-laundering laws. In
addition, Haitian law enforcement officials say, the Americans are
wary of sharing information.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no drugs are confiscated in Haiti, which is woefully
under-equipped to wage the war on narcotics. There is a
three-year-old anti-drug police squad with just 25 members. Local
authorities have no radar or helicopters to monitor Haiti's
airspace and fewer than 10 boats to patrol the coastline. Some 250
police officers have been dismissed for drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the riches trafficking has brought can be seen in
Belvil, a sprawling gated community of luxury homes that has boomed
conspicuously in an otherwise desperate economy. New construction
is everywhere, and new gas stations dot the Port-au-Prince area,
some offering to wire money in $1,000 installments to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the country, the coasts are littered with the
burned shells of speedboats and the roads with the wrecks of small
planes that have skidded into steep embankments. No one knows how
many make it through unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian police have seized some cocaine shipments in recent
months, including 550 pounds inside a Belvil home. Local crowds
have stolen parts of other shipments; in the town of Grand-Goave in
May, the police recovered only 323 pounds of a suspected
4,400-pound shipment. Among those who tried to steal drugs was the
town's deputy mayor, who was shot dead by his bodyguard in a
dispute over his share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the volume is progressively increasing,'' said Pierre
Denize, the director of the Haitian National Police. ``The
Colombians went from fast boats to more and more airdrops and
clandestine landings. They have this world-renowned capacity to
stay one step ahead of the repression.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitian law enforcement officials said that drug pilots had free
run of the skies once the international airport and its radar
closed in the early evening. Even when U.S. surveillance planes
spot a drug plane entering Haitian airspace, limited manpower and
rough roads mean there is often little authorities can do to
intercept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We follow planes and boats into Haiti, but there is no
endgame,'' said Raymond Kelley, the Customs Service commissioner.
``There is no entity on the ground that can respond quickly. We
need help. They need help.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even searching sitting targets can be daunting to the few
inspectors assigned to outlying areas, like the busy port of
Gonaives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to any harbor outside of Port-au-Prince and try to
find a law enforcement person, it's like finding Waldo in those
kid's books,'' said a U.S. Embassy official. ``Very few take the
initiative to search the boats because they have no way out. Twice
in the past year, the Haitian Coast Guard had to go to Gonaives to
take personnel off the pier because they were being threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration has eight agents stationed
in Haiti, where they train the local anti-narcotics squad, which in
the last 12 months has confiscated $4 million in drug profits that
were being smuggled out of the country. The U.S. Coast Guard also
has permission to patrol Haitian waters, and it is helping the
Haitian government open several new ports, which would allow
Haitian anti-drug officers to spread out from Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian officials said they have asked banks to collect
information on people depositing more than $10,000 in cash. But
money-laundering laws that would allow closer investigations have
been stalled in Parliament. Immigration authorities require visas
for visitors from Colombia, and the airport police routinely
question arriving Colombians and keep their passports until they
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian law enforcement officials, for their part, complain that
cooperation with the United States has been disappointing. ``Given
how much cocaine the United States says comes through here, you'd
think they'd be as good at catching drug boats as they are with
stopping refugee boats, which they excel at,'' said a high-ranking
Haitian official. ``They say this is a war, but is it?''
</P>
<P>
   Several high-ranking Haitian law enforcement officials said they
almost never got advance word about suspicious incoming planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States sits where it sits and says we are not doing
anything about this,'' Denize, the police chief, said. ``Hey, I'm
willing. But I can't initiate the interception, or the radar, or
the boats or the intelligence sharing. I can't go bust someone if I
don't know who or where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials are worried that drug-related corruption has
penetrated the police force and even the government. Earlier this
year, the police inspector general was transferred to a diplomatic
post when he investigated several police supervisors on suspicion
of helping the drug smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been constant talk that several recently elected
senators of the Family Lavalas party, which is headed by former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, are involved in the drug trade.
Party spokesmen deny this charge, saying it is misinformation
spread by political opponents to discredit the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect there are officials who are involved,'' an
American diplomat said. ``We have some evidence of that. The
question is how high it goes up. We have no corroboration of any
kind suggesting that it is at the highest levels of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials admit that they are careful when sharing
information with Haitian counterparts. ``The fact is we factor in
corruption as part of our strategy when we are dealing with Haitian
smuggling,'' a Customs official said.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that given the ``collapsing'' relationship with
Haitian law enforcement agencies, the United States was focusing on
the drugs after they leave Haiti and reach the Dominican Republic,
Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of the noncorrupt Haitian law enforcement and
customs authorities to combat this is diminishing rapidly,''
McCaffrey said. ``The political will to support them isn't there.''

EXILES RETURN TO BOSNIA, SHARING A SCARRED LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Five years after the bloodshed
and ethnic cleansing that tore apart Bosnia's communities of Serbs,
Muslims and Croats, the first Muslims are now heading home to areas
of eastern Bosnia that were the scene of some of the war's worst
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, too, are returning to Muslim-dominated Sarajevo, a
capital once known for its multiethnicity but subjected to 3 and a
half years of Serbian siege and shelling in the war, from 1992 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The homecomings _ largely spontaneous but helped by
international officials who run Bosnia, enforcing laws on returning
property to original owners _ are beginning to remedy a cardinal
failure of the uneasy peace: the inability of those officials to
overcome local hatreds and fears, or to return refugees to areas
dominated by ethnic foes.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Bosnians remain refugees, and foreign
officials have not dented the vivid hatreds that continue to feed
murder and expulsion not far away in Kosovo. But each refugee who
comes home to Bosnia without major mishap _ particularly to the
strongholds of hard-core Serbian nationalists in eastern Bosnia _
can help persuade others to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Visnja Trkulja, a Serbian schoolteacher, has been back in
Sarajevo for nearly a year, living quietly in her apartment house
in the suburb called Ilidza. As she greets visitors, she explains
that her wing is almost back to its prewar makeup: six Serbian
families, two Muslim families and two more Serbian families
expected back soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one likes refugees,'' she said. ``I knew I wanted to go
home when I realized no one wanted me.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was where my friends were, my first loves, my parents'
graves,'' she went on. ``This is my Mount Igman, my sky,'' she said
in a gesture to the Sarajevo landscape.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Ilidza was under Serbian control and Muslims had
to flee. Then, when the 1995 Dayton peace accords ended the
fighting, it was the Serbs' turn to run.
</P>
<P>
   In an exodus that was partly orchestrated by the Serbian
leadership and partly panic, 100,000 Serbs abandoned their homes in
the suburbs of Sarajevo. The peace deal gave the Muslim-Croat
Federation jurisdiction over the whole city, including the Serbian
suburbs, and all but a few thousand Serbs moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they are filtering back, reclaiming their houses from
Muslims who have occupied them and returning to the capital some of
its former multiethnic atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   About 15,000 Serbs have returned to the Sarajevo area in the
last 18 months, nudging displaced people to return to other regions
around the country. In the first five months of this year, 15,665
people registered after returning home across Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The change is largely due to property laws introduced in 1998,
which international officials at the Office of the High
Representative _ the all-powerful civilian authority in Bosnia _
are using to bulldoze local obstructions. Using law alone, they
want to reverse the ethnic polarization that makes Bosnia barely
workable as a country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is ruthless implementation so that all property is
returned to its owner. We are using the law to subvert ethnic
territorialism,'' said David Stewart-Howitt, a former British Army
officer who coordinates the property returns at the Office of the
High Representative. ``What we have to ensure is a blending that
can allow this country to knit together.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities are evicting people from homes so owners can
reclaim their property. There are 25 to 45 evictions every week in
Sarajevo, Stewart-Howitt said. ``Muslims are being evicted here,
the local police are dragging people out, war veterans get
involved, then we have street protests,'' he said. ``It's happening
all over the country. It's a very difficult process but it's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the multiethnic presidency of Bosnia, Alija
Izetbegovic, originally opposed the idea and his adviser, Mirza
Hajric, blames the evictions for the recent fall in the popularity
of Izetbegovic's Muslim party, the Party of Democratic Action. The
paucity of returns of Muslims to Serbian areas, while Sarajevo has
welcomed so many Serbs, is one reason that Izetbegovic, 75, says he
will resign from office in October, Hajric said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in the Serbian half of Bosnia have long blocked returns
but have grown more compliant since Wolfgang Petritsch, the high
representative, began firing local officials, 22 on one occasion
last fall, for obstructing the Dayton peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   Fear and intimidation also hamper movement. Trkulja said she was
the only Serb in a refugee center in the eastern town of Foca brave
enough to return. ``Many said they did not want to be the first,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of 750,000 people displaced in Bosnia, about 220,000 have made
claims for the return of their homes under the property laws. To
date, 17 percent of those claims in the Muslim-Croat federation
have been settled and 7 percent so far in the Serbian entity, known
as Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
   Although few Muslims are returning to Serb-dominated areas,
officials say that even there the trend is upward and the flow will
increase rapidly over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officials in Pale, the former ski resort outside
Sarajevo that Serbian leaders proclaimed their capital during the
war, and in Foca and Rogatica in eastern Bosnia, where Muslims were
ruthlessly murdered and expelled, have freed up dozens of
apartments belonging to Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint news conference this month with his Muslim
counterpart from Sarajevo, the Serb who is mayor of Pale guaranteed
security for all returning Muslims. Fifty families are being taken
back to Pale, Foca and Rogatica in coming weeks, said
Stewart-Howitt. ``I find that pretty revolutionary. It would have
been unthinkable even last year.''

<P>
   The Croat-run areas of Bosnia are showing the least movement,
and seven of the 10 municipalities with the worst record on returns
are Croat, he said. Despite the new mood of cooperation in Croatia
itself since President Franjo Tudjman died and was replaced by more
moderate leaders, foreigners have yet to observe much change among
Bosnian Croat nationalists on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   House burnings and intimidation still occur every week in every
region across Bosnia, although officials insist that violence is
declining.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, refugees are on the move. Villagers all over are
traveling back to their homes to test the atmosphere and negotiate
for their houses.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, 400 families have gone back to villages around Foca
and over 100 Serbs have returned to their nearby village of
Ustikolina in the Muslim-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian police have freed up 36 apartments in Foca, handing over
the keys to returnees, and other families are back in the Muslim
quarter rebuilding destroyed homes.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Sarajevo, always renowned for its tolerance and
diversity _ its ancient mosques jostle with Orthodox and Catholic
churches in the old part of the city _ that has led the way. The
scars of war are still evident. Smashed buildings and bullet-pocked
walls still mark the old front line. ``Sarajevo roses,'' the shell
craters etched in the sidewalks and now filled with red rubber, are
reminders of the years under siege and fire from Serbian artillery.
Today Serbs walk freely downtown and eat in Muslim-run restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In exile, Trkulja said, she realized she was a Sarajevan first
and had little in common with the Serbian nationalists who
dominated Foca. ``We here have the same sense of humor,'' she said.
``We do the same things. I do not have to explain to someone who I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   It is mostly older people and those without children who are
returning, and the women come back first to test the water, says
Bozidar Stanojevic of the Democratic Initiative for Sarajevo's
Serbs, an organization that helps Serbs return.
</P>
<P>
   There are few jobs for Serbs and continuing discrimination, and
some just reclaim a house in order to sell it, he said. Young
Serbs, especially those who served in the army, remain scared to
return, he added. ``But it is not an objective fear,'' he said.
``We have received threats but nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven Serbs have been killed in the last 18 months, but appear
to have been victims of personal score settling, rather than
attacks aimed at deterring Serb returns.
</P>
<P>
   Sretko Tambur, 60, is a Serbian laborer who returned with his
wife, Joka, in January to Blazuj, on the edge of Sarajevo. Pausing
from chopping wood with a young Muslim worker in his front yard,
Tambur said: ``I've never had any trouble since I came back. It's
the best thing, living at home.''
</P>
<P>
   His village was once all Serbian, but now Muslims, refugees from
other parts of Bosnia, live in his neighbors' homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first days the women next door, refugees, provoked me,
saying they would blow my house up. But nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbs had tried to deter him from going home too. ``I did not
listen to anyone,'' he said. ``People from both sides are scared.''
</P>
<P>
   The local police checked on them regularly, his wife said. And
the local Muslim shopkeeper offered credit for months until their
pensions came through, Tambur said. He praised Petritsch for
pushing the returns. ``We had Yugoslavia before and it was great,''
he said. Banging his fist on the table, he went on: ``Someone has
to say, `You all have to live together.' ''

VENEZUELA TRIES ELECTIONS AGAIN SUNDAY: NO VOTE-FIXING, CARTER
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Two months after a first attempt collapsed
in ineptitude and scandal, Venezuela will try again Sunday to hold
the biggest vote in its history, a ``mega-election'' in which
thousands of candidates are vying for office, from President Hugo
Chavez down to state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez himself is the only real issue in the vote, which he
called in hopes of winning a new, six-year term in office. Despite
an economy that shrank by more than 7 percent last year, record
unemployment and a big jump in crime, public opinion polls are
unanimous in predicting a Chavez romp by a margin of 15 percentage
points or more.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for 23 governorships and 165 seats in a new one-house
National Assembly is expected to be somewhat closer, with most
opinion surveys predicting Chavez will fall short of the two-thirds
majority he will need in the new chamber to gain quick approval of
his radical social and economic reform program. Such a result could
force him to pursue a more moderate course and negotiate with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Those races are expected to be particularly close in areas where
the multiparty coalition supporting Chavez was unable to unite
behind a common candidate, possibly splitting the pro-Chavez vote
and allowing his opponents to squeak through to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since he was first elected in December 1998, Chavez has blamed a
``rancid oligarchy'' of political and business interests for the
country's troubles. In a typically fiery speech Wednesday ending
his campaign, he asked his followers for a landslide victory Sunday
to ``liquidate our adversaries from the field of battle'' once and
for all and allow him finally to carry out the ``peaceful social
revolution'' he has long promised.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's main challenger is Francisco Arias, who, like Chavez,
is a former army colonel who took part in a coup attempt in 1992.
The men then spent two years in jail together and were friends and
political allies until early this year, when Arias angrily accused
the president of concentrating all power in his own hands,
alienating the United States and falling under the spell of Fidel
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela has become ``a de facto dictatorship,'' Arias charged
at a news conference here on Friday. ``Corruption, poverty and
unemployment are accelerating,'' he said, because the Chavez
administration has ``violated all the norms and protocols'' of good
government and pursued economic policies that were hostile to free
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a third candidate, the former Caracas mayor,
Claudio Fermin. He has no chance of winning, and has come under
pressure from the Arias camp to withdraw, but chose to remain in
the race because, he said, he did not think the choices available
to voters should be limited to two military officers who have tried
to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Venezuela's sixth vote in less than two years,
including three to draft and ratify a new constitution expanding
presidential powers, and voters are showing signs of boredom and
impatience. At a breakfast with reporters on Friday, Foreign
Minister Jose Vicente Rangel predicted that half of the 11.8
million eligible voters would stay home due to ``voter fatigue''
and a lack of suspense about the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I'm getting tired of having to cast a ballot every
few months or so,'' said Zoila Chacon, a sales clerk in a
department store here. ``Democracy is great, but what we really
need is for somebody to do something about the economy, and the
quicker the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote was originally scheduled for May 28. But when the
National Electoral Council, dominated by inexperienced Chavez
loyalists, proved unable to provide the ballot information needed
for new computerized voting machines, Chavez reluctantly urged a
postponement rather than running the risk of seeing the legitimacy
of his anticipated landslide victory tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Council members at first sought to blame an American company
hired to supply the technology for the vote, but that explanation
convinced no one here, and a public furor forced the entire
commission to resign.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the country's chief prosecutor filed corruption
charges against five former members of the council.
</P>
<P>
   Arias and other opposition figures have complained of
irregularities in the new council's organization, saying that
oversight measures that ``would have generated confidence have been
eliminated.'' But international observers maintain that, though
some technical flaws remain, they can find no evidence of a
government effort to steal votes or alter results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no concern that the integrity of the election has been
endangered at all,'' former President Carter, leading a 48-member
observer delegation, said at a news conference here Friday. Ruben
Perina, head of an Organization of American States observer team,
added: ``We see this vote very differently from the May process.''
He attributed the accusations to a growing ``polarization and
mistrust in the political culture here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ From the darkness of history they emerge out of a
silver spinning disc: two black slaves sold by a sugar plantation
owner named Levi Foster on Feb. 11, 1818, to his in-laws. The first
slave, named Kit, was 28, and was sold for $975. The other, named
Alick, was 9, and was possibly Kit's son. He was sold for $400.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two centuries, the names of those two slaves were
lost in time, along with the names of tens of thousands of others
who worked the sugar and cotton fields of Louisiana and made
fortunes for their owners. Their identities, scratched with quill
pens on transaction records of human property, have moldered in the
basements of parish courthouses for more than 150 years, virtually
untouched by researchers who were usually put off by the difficult
French and Spanish script.
</P>
<P>
   Black families often lacked the resources for the extensive
detective work required to find their original African forebears,
and many white families simply did not want to know about
slaveholding ancestors. Levi Foster, in fact, is the
great-great-grandfather of Gov. Mike Foster of Louisiana, who said
recently on a radio program that it would be ``news to me'' if
anyone in his family had owned slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the identities and backgrounds of Louisiana slaves
are beginning to emerge from centuries of anonymity, infusing
property once sold like livestock with names like Kit and Alick.
Thanks to years of painstaking work by a 71-year-old historian who
lives in a small house here surrounded by plantain trees, an
enormous amount of information is suddenly coming to light about
the captives who were brought to Louisiana in huge numbers in the
18th and 19th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, a New Orleans native who has devoted much
of her life to the study of slavery, spent 15 years in the
courthouses of Louisiana, as well as in archives in Spain, France
and Texas, seeking all records of slave transactions and entering
them into laptop computers. Aided by several research assistants,
she eventually amassed computerized records on more than 100,000
slaves _ the largest collection of individual slave information
ever assembled _ and in March the Louisiana State University Press
published the documents as a searchable database on a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   The disc has amazed historians and genealogists with the breadth
of its information about the slaves. Because the French and Spanish
proprietors of Louisiana kept far more detailed records than their
British counterparts at slave ports on the Atlantic coast, the
records show not only the names of the slaves, but also their
birthplaces in Africa, their skills, their health, and in many
cases descriptions of their personalities and degree of
rebelliousness. For historians who thought such information was
lost or could never be collected and analyzed, the database is a
once-unimaginable prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is groundbreaking work,'' said Ibrahim K. Sundiata,
chairman of the history department at Howard University and a
scholar of African history. ``Americans have tended to think of the
slaves as simply being Africans, but now we can begin to understand
where these Africans came from and who they were. For the first
time, this takes us beyond the guestimates, and it's very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has a great deal of unpublished information about who
owned the slaves, which many prominent white families have never
been particularly eager to research. Marsanne Golsby, a spokeswoman
for Foster, said he learned about his family's ownership of slaves
after The New York Times looked up his ancestors on the disc and
found transactions involving eight slaves, three of them children.
Unrelated documents on file in the Tulane University library show
that his great-grandfather, Thomas J. Foster, owned 50 slaves in
1860, three years before emancipation. (The governor was not
particularly happy about the disclosure; Golsby said the newspaper
should not have singled out his family from the many others that
owned slaves.)
</P>
<P>
   Hall's database is the latest example of a recent explosion of
popular and scholarly interest in the African diaspora, the
scattering of African people after they left or were removed from
their home continent. The field has grown in part because of the
availability of computerized tools that make research a less
tedious task than tracking down crumbling documents, often in
foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   Another CD-ROM, compiled at Harvard University and published in
December by Cambridge University Press, documented more than 27,000
trans-Atlantic slave ship voyages, describing their human cargo,
their points of origin and destination, and the outcome of the
voyages. A popular Web site, www.afrigeneas.com, has collected and
published large amounts of slave data and encourages those tracing
their roots to share their information with others on the Internet.
Genetic researchers have been assembling a DNA database that may
someday allow African-Americans to trace their origins to specific
regions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Burroughs, an African-American genealogist who lectures
widely on the subject, said the Louisiana database is as
significant as the publication of Alex Haley's ``Roots'' in 1976,
in part because the demand is even greater now for accessible
information. It also provides hope to those who believed they could
never trace their origins back more than a few generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all these baby boomers now who want to learn about
their families' past, and they want to use a computer,'' said
Burroughs, who teaches genealogy at Chicago State University and
was a consultant on the PBS ``Ancestors'' series. ``They can't go
around and find all the old documents and do the translations, but
now we're starting to get these amazing databases like Gwen Hall's,
and people can use them. If you have ancestors from Louisiana, it's
like a treasure chest.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hall's odyssey through the whispered history of her state shows
how daunting such research can be. She had taught Caribbean and
African-Latin history for many years at Rutgers University when she
began researching a book on the development of Creole culture in
Louisiana in 1984. In the courthouse at New Roads, the seat of
Pointe Coupee Parish, she discovered a cache of documents set down
by French-speaking notaries in the 1770s that showed the ethnicity
of hundreds of slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astounded at how much information there was in the
records,'' said Hall, whose eventual book ``Africans in Colonial
Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the 18th
Century,'' won several history prizes in 1992. ``In the English
colonies, there was almost no information like this. The French
just seemed more interested in the origins of people, who they were
and where they came from. Maybe it's because they had a much longer
history of slave trading posts in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   After deciding to pursue the potential of such records around
Louisiana, she won a research grant from the National Endowment for
the Humanities and began a lengthy trek through every courthouse
and archives depot in the state, where slave transactions were
recorded as carefully as exchanges of real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Clerks would frequently tell her that the documents were
unusable because they were in French or Spanish, although she is
fluent in both languages. Often, she and her assistants would find
old record books on a shelf next to a heater, or in a damp
basement. In one courthouse, she said, someone had tried to burn
the records, apparently afraid they would expose a black family
that had been passing for white for several generations.
</P>
<P>
   The years of staring at documents and computer screens took a
toll on Hall's eyesight, which deteriorated to the point that she
could barely make out black ink on a white page. A pair of
specially designed eyeglasses has since improved her ability to see
contrasting colors.
</P>
<P>
   She also had to familiarize herself with the design of computer
databases, working to make the collection of information as
flexible as possible to answer any conceivable question a
researcher might ask. Using the disc requires a separate database
program, but with a little experience it is possible to enter a
first or last name and find out a great deal about a matching slave
or owner. The disc is available from major Internet book sellers
for $45.
</P>
<P>
   An entry for a slave named Hector is typical: Born in the Congo,
he was sold by St. Pierre Etier on Jan. 1, 1797, for 400 piastre
gourdes (about $700) to Francois Prevost, in St. Martin Parish. But
the bill of sale went on to note that Hector was a chronic runaway
who was at large at the time of sale. The buyer ``will be
responsible for his care if he is found and is suffering from any
illnesses or wounds,'' the document says in French.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the records were originally produced for trials or other
legal actions regarding slaves. One describes an accusation against
two slaves, Pierrot, of the Bamana ethnic group from Senegambia,
and Nicolas, a Louisiana Creole, for killing and eating their
owner's cow in 1764 in the New Orleans region. Both were publicly
flogged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally we're going to be able to recover these workers as
people with pasts, with names and families,'' said Michael Gomez, a
professor of history at New York University and a leader of the
growing movement to study the African diaspora. ``These records
humanize people who were thought of as a kind of undifferentiated
mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the light that the collection has strewn on individuals,
it has also illuminated many larger cultural questions. Hall and
other experts in the field say the data have conclusively proved
that two-thirds of African captives brought to Louisiana in the
early part of the slave trade, before 1730, were from the
Senegambia area of West Africa, as opposed to other ethnic groups
that went to the East Coast. The culture they brought with them _
music, language, food, folklore _ became the foundation of
Louisiana's distinctive Creole culture, a way of life for both
whites and blacks for hundreds of years to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the Uncle Remus stories were originally Wolof folktales
which were first written down in Louisiana,'' Hall said, referring
to one of the Senegambian ethnic groups. ``For so long there was
this tendency, even in the most prestigious academic circles, to
see Africans as an abstraction, coming from a simple single place.
But now we're starting to see it as a place of great complexity,
and the different ethnicities greatly affected the development
African-American culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is white, has never hesitated to buck academic or
social conventions. The daughter of Herman Midlo, a labor and civil
rights lawyer in New Orleans who defended many black clients in the
1930s and '40s when other white lawyers would not, she became
radicalized as a young woman by the segregation she had observed
growing up. After a brief flirtation with the Communist Party in
the 1950s, she married Harry Haywood, an outspoken black Communist,
who died in 1985. She championed the study of African ethnicities
at a time when mainstream scholarly opinion was not interested, and
she says she is delighted that the field has finally caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping this database will help smooth the path for others
to make Africans concrete as human beings,'' she said. ``Some day,
people will be asking this database questions that I can't even
imagine right now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When she finished her residency last year, Dr. Regan Andrade
received a flurry of job offers near her New York City home.
Saddled with $250,000 in student loans, however, she rejected them
all. Instead, she signed up for a federal government program that
offered a $50,000 bonus to practice in poor communities where
doctors are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   So, last fall, Andrade packed up her three children and took a
lower-paying job as a family practitioner in Newport, Wash., a
rural logging town of roughly 2,000 people, where the unemployment
rate is more than twice the national average. Her new employer was
the only hospital in the county _ in fact, the only one for 30
miles around. It had 24 beds.
</P>
<P>
   About six months later, settled and working, Andrade learned
that she would not get her grant after all. Without any warning,
the government program had run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any inkling that my loan repayment wasn't going to
come through, I wouldn't have come. I couldn't have,'' Andrade
said. ``I'm disgusted. It feels like they're filling these needy
areas without having to pay anyone to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiply her frustration by 700. At least that many doctors,
dentists, psychologists and other health professionals have signed
up for two-year stints in poor urban and rural areas with the aim
of paying back part of their student loans and, like Andrade, they
are being told that the money they expected will not materialize,
federal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The National Loan Repayment Program, a $30 million pool of money
to attract health workers to remote towns and poor neighborhoods,
has exhausted its funds after making only a few dozen grants to new
applicants this year, threatening the government's ability to get
medical professionals where they are needed most.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: The Department of Health and Human Services, which
runs the program, cut its budget sharply this year to meet other
spending requirements set by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With the remaining money, the department for the first time gave
grants to people who were still waiting for awards from the
previous year. It also gave additional funds to health care
providers who had put in their required two years of service,
hoping the money would be an incentive for them to stay put, rather
than abandon poor communities as soon as their contracts ran out.
</P>
<P>
   That left newcomers to the program like Andrade in a financing
limbo _ but few said they were ever told. The agency had no policy
to warn them that there were prior claims on the money. Officials
in Washington said they thought their field offices, scattered
around the country, would take on that responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   With a record number of professionals vying for the smallest
amount of money in years, the budgetary shortfall is the worst in
the program's 11-year history. And it is not likely to improve. The
1989 law authorizing the grants is scheduled to expire on Sept. 30
_ and agency officials fear it will not be reauthorized. Few
members of Congress are familiar with the program because it has
rarely come up in hearings since its creation and because many
other health care programs have more effective lobbyists arguing
for them.
</P>
<P>
   In a year dominated by high-profile health care debates,
including a patients' ``bill of rights'' and Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs, the program has received scant attention in
Washington. As yet, no member of Congress has stepped forward to
sponsor legislation to renew it, and with the end of the year fast
approaching, officials wonder if there is still time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We desperately need a reauthorization,'' said Dr. Claude Earl
Fox, who oversees the program for the department. Fox said the loan
repayment program would still be eligible for one-year extensions
at current spending levels, even without explicit reauthorization.
But with a growing backlog of applicants, grants under the program
will be even harder to obtain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the professionals who were denied financing are already
working in overburdened clinics, where they have logged thousands
of hours treating indigent and uninsured patients. Some have been
on duty for more than a year, expecting their grants would arrive
at any time. Most say they did not learn that the money would not
come through until several months after they had accepted positions
that typically pay less than jobs in private practice or at health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Some have still not been told, despite calling repeatedly to ask
when their money will arrive, since the department has missed many
of its own deadlines for letting providers know their status.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what really upsets me,'' said Dr. Roxanne Collins, a
dentist who has worked at Las Clinicas del Norte El Rito in rural
New Mexico since March of last year. ``They didn't even bother to
tell me that they didn't have the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Goldman School of Dental Medicine at
Boston University in 1998 with $150,000 in student debt, Collins
says she passed up positions paying $40,000 more than what she now
earns in favor of loan repayment. It seemed like a good idea at the
time, she says, since her preference has always been to work with
Spanish-speaking immigrants. But she says her salary alone is
barely enough to make her $2,000 monthly loan payments. ``If I had
known I wouldn't get a grant, I wouldn't even have bothered,'' she
said.

</P>
<P>
   A few of the doctors have begun investigating whether they have
any legal recourse to force the government to come up with the
money for the loan payments. But government officials say they have
not reneged on any written commitment, since the medical
professionals signed employment contracts with the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with the budget shortage, the department saved its new
grants for areas with the greatest need. And so it unexpectedly
eliminated more than 100 clinics that had long been approved for
loan repayment from its list of eligible sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm playing a game, but they keep changing the
rules on me,'' said Mary Joan L. Murphy, a nurse practitioner in
New York who says her clinic was deemed ineligible after she had
worked there for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictability of the process has alarmed officials of
community health centers, which are the only primary health care
option for many of the nation's poor and uninsured, a population
with particularly acute medical needs. Recruiting trained
specialists is a daunting task for the centers, and many worry that
the scarcity of new grants will greatly worsen staffing shortages,
especially at clinics in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use loan repayment as our primary recruiting tool,'' said
Stephen D. Wilhide, chairman of the National Rural Health
Association committee that is leading the effort to lobby Congress
for reauthorization. ``We could simply not get enough doctors
without it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for many inner-city clinics that have recently
hired doctors with the promise of loan repayment, unaware that a
mere handful would be approved. Unless grants are virtually
guaranteed in the coming years, many clinics fear they will no
longer be able to bring new medical professionals on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has definitely affected our credibility,'' said Vicki L.
Marie, a recruiter for Northeast Ohio Neighborhood Services, a
chain of clinics serving Cleveland's African-American population.
Last year, the health service hired two physicians with the
expectation that they would get their loans repaid, just as it has
in past years before grants were in such short supply. ``Now, we're
just sitting here hoping that these providers don't leave and go to
a more lucrative practice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, compelled to pay off their loans, and in some cases
feeling betrayed, some clinic staffers say they are already looking
for better-paying jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Colleen Wall-Hoeben, a clinical psychologist,
moved to the windy buttes of Wyoming in order to get money to repay
loans. The job she accepted, she said, paid roughly half the salary
of $75,000 to $100,000 that awaited her at a Salt Lake City private
practice, but it would enable her to erase her debt.
</P>
<P>
   Or so she thought. In May, Wall-Hoeben received a letter
informing her that the program had run out of money, a formal
notice that many have yet to receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to stay, earning at that low of a level,
with the hope of someday getting the loan repayment,'' Wall-Hoeben
said. ``It's a lot of hard work, and there's more money to be made
at other places.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the prospect of losing some of their most qualified
staff members, some health centers are scrambling to raise money to
compensate them for the loss in federal subsidies. But community
clinics' fund-raising capabilities are limited, since most rely on
government grants to keep their doors open.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can most clinics tap into patient fees to pay for higher
salaries. Required by law to serve anyone in need of treatment,
most government-financed health centers see a disproportionate
number of uninsured patients who are asked to pay what they can.
Other patients are mostly covered by Medicare and Medicaid, two
programs that had their reimbursement rates cut under the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by calls from cash-short clinics, the National
Association of Community Health Centers began lobbying members of
Congress this spring, pushing for an expansion of the loan
repayment program. After meeting with representatives from both
parties, the association secured a $4 million increase in the House
budget for the program, but no growth in the levels proposed by the
Clinton administration or by the Senate. Association officials are
fairly confident that the increase in the House, though small, will
make it into the final budget for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's peanuts; that's not enough,'' said Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, D-N.Y., who began looking into the program last month,
</P>
<P>
   Maloney said it was unlikely Congress would consider releasing
additional money through an emergency measure, as it did in June to
support troops in Kosovo, combat drugs in Colombia and provide
relief for wildfire and flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, community health centers began an effort to
get the program's legislation reauthorized, a rare opportunity to
showcase the importance of loan repayment and press for more money.
</P>
<P>
   But the coalition was riddled with internal conflicts, and it
quickly disbanded after dividing over how much money should be
designated for different medial specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``These squabbles have frozen any action on the Hill,'' lamented
Dan Hawkins, policy director of the National Association of
Community Health Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Health department officials are equally frustrated that the
reauthorization effort appears to have been shelved. Under current
law, all cash awards to health workers are taxable, a disincentive
the program has overcome by adding money to each grant. For years,
department officials have sought to rewrite the law to make the
grants tax-free, a change that would free money to pay for 200 more
clinicians each year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the department says it would have to place at least
20,000 clinicians, compared with the 1,900 it now supports, to
assure poor communities adequate access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, the need is appalling in comparison to the
resources available,'' Fox said.

GOP PLATFORM REAFFIRMS STAND AGAINST GAYS IN THE MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN TONER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican platform committee reasserted
Saturday that ``homosexuality is incompatible with military
service,'' overwhelmingly rejecting efforts to remove that plank as
it pushed toward completing its work.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief debate Saturday morning, conservatives prevailed
easily on the issue of gays in the military on a voice vote. Ari
Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, noted that, ``The
governor believes `don't ask, don't tell' is the appropriate policy
and he supports that.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform will come before the full convention on Monday. In
two days of marathon sessions, Bush's allies have tried hard to
find a balance between his ``compassionate conservative''
philosophy and the core conservatism of the party's base. Those
tensions were fully visible Saturday morning in a roiling debate
over education.
</P>
<P>
   Midpoint in the process, the document did not call for the
abolition of any federal agencies _ four years ago, it called for
several _ but it still reflected a party deeply suspicious of the
federal government and the courts. Bush's allies were fighting hard
to keep his education program in the document, which envisions a
federal role in schools that seemed deeply troublesome to many
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The platform reiterates one of the guiding principles of modern
conservatism _ that more and more power should be shifted to the
states: ``The dramatic success of welfare reform _ once states were
allowed to manage their programs _ is a stellar example of what
happens when we give power back to the people,'' the platform
declares. ``We must acknowledge as a general matter of course that
the federal government's role should be to set high standards and
expectations in policies, then get out of the way and let the
states implement and operate those policies as they best know
how.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of conservatives was perhaps most clear on the issue
of abortion and gay rights. Abortion rights supporters tried on
several occasions to remove the abortion plank or add a provision
recognizing and expressing respect for Republicans who hold
different views on the issue, but they were decisively beaten each
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is are we a pro-life party or are we a
pro-abortion rights party,'' declared Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a
staunch opponent of abortion. ``It's left to the Republicans, the
heartless Republicans, to care about the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   With a graphic description of what opponents call partial birth
abortion, Hyde declared, ``If this party stands for nothing else,
it ought to stand for violent objection to that butchery.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of that struggle were pre-ordained; Bush and top
Republican leaders had announced early on that they wanted the
abortion plank left alone. Democrats and abortion rights supporters
see it as an important vulnerability in the fall election, because
it calls for a blanket ban on abortion and the appointment of
judges who reflect the party's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   On gay rights, conservatives declared repeatedly that the party
needed to put itself wholeheartedly on record against recognizing
civil unions between homosexuals, and added a provision to the
platform defining marriage as ``the legal union of one man and one
woman.'' They also added language declaring, ``We do not believe
sexual preference should be given special legal protection or
standing in law.'' And the platform reiterates its contention that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a leading conservative, said in an interview that he
was pleased with the platform. ``On the sanctity of life, it's
solid and consistent with the past,'' he said. ``I think it's a
strong conservative platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, another veteran conservative activist, said:
``I think it's wordier and not as good as '96. Of course, we kept
the pro-life plank, but I thought the '96 platform was better.''

EDITORIAL: IMAGE STRUGGLE IN PHILADELPHIA  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   The accepted wisdom nowadays is that the national political
conventions are little more than expensive relics, and it is true
that the major events of the Republican jamboree that begins Monday
in Philadelphia are largely foreordained. Gov. George W. Bush's
nomination is secure, his vice president chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is a supremely important and surprisingly suspenseful
time for Bush. The image of the man who promised a future based on
``compassionate conservatism'' is murkier than it was a few weeks
ago, as is the very meaning of his trademark term. The Philadelphia
convention will be an exercise in political packaging whose
decisive moments will be Bush's acceptance speech, the final
drafting of the GOP platform, and Richard Cheney's reintroduction
to the national audience.
</P>
<P>
   All these, in turn, will determine whether Bush puts his stamp
on the Republican Party or the party's right wing draws a
hard-edged, highly ideological template for his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the political world will be watching to see if Bush
can pull his campaign back to the moderate middle from which he
governed in Texas. Clearly, Cheney's selection did more to muddle
Bush's message than he ever expected, even though he insists he was
not ``blindsided'' by the autopilot conservatism of Cheney's voting
record in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a conservative, too,'' Bush said, but it is hard to
believe that the governor's conservatism would have encompassed
Cheney's votes against Head Start and the equal rights amendment,
his hard-line stance on every gun control measure that came his
way, or his opposition to a resolution in 1986 that called on South
Africa to release Nelson Mandela from prison.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush wishes to persuade voters that his GOP will not
resurrect the inflexible attitudes and stark policies of the
Gingrich era, he must dominate the convention stage.
</P>
<P>
   That is still a big stage, despite the decision by the main
broadcast networks to limit their coverage to one hour in prime
time. There will be a huge audience in those peak periods and a
continuing audience of great sophistication for the other media to
which the networks are passing the torch of political
communications _ cable, C-Span, the 24-hour news shows and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush must use his acceptance speech to reassert his control of
his candidacy and establish his primacy within the party. Nobody
knows this better than he does. His father used his brilliantly
conceived ``kinder, gentler nation'' speech in New Orleans in 1988
to establish his independence and to distance himself from the
social callousness of Reaganism. Not coincidentally, the speech
helped give him a lead over Michael Dukakis that he never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the same George Bush damaged himself badly
with a pallid speech that left him looking like a helpless
bystander as Pat Buchanan hijacked the party's philosophical bank
account with his scary rant about cultural warfare.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush cannot afford to look like a bystander at his
convention. He needs a speech proving that his vision rather than
Cheney's crabbed ideology will define Republican ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Another place where Bush can put his brand on the party is the
platform. A draft released last week showed some movement away from
the sheer venom of the 1996 platform. But the new document offered
no evidence of any sustained effort or desire by Bush to move his
party to more sensible ground on two key issues. He left in place a
harsh abortion plank, even though he uses a more conciliatory tone
in speeches. On gun control, the platform repeats the proven
formula for failure through stronger enforcement of existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when conventions no longer decide nominations, they
still provide a testing place where candidacies can either soar or
flop. In the primaries, Bush showed that he could take a punch from
a strong opponent. In Philadelphia, he will have his chance to show
that he can stand up to his party's fiercest factions and sketch a
picture of America that will attract, rather than frighten,
middle-of-the-road voters.

EDITORIAL: REGAINING MIDEAST MOMENTUM  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   Israelis and Palestinians are trying to pick up where they left
off at the unsuccessful Camp David summit meeting and continue
moving toward a final peace agreement. It is now critically
important to sustain some of the positive momentum established
there.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, senior negotiators from both sides are to resume
discussions on a range of unsettled issues. The negotiators were
close to the Camp David discussions and are aware of the
path-breaking compromises discussed there on security and border
issues, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   America stands ready to remain involved, with Washington's
Mideast mediator, Dennis Ross, and perhaps Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, prepared to re-enter the discussions if
sufficient progress can be made.
</P>
<P>
   But progress is far from assured, especially with Yasser Arafat
talking about proclaiming a Palestinian state if no agreement is
reached by Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   With that possibility in mind, President Clinton suggested last
week that he might consider relocating America's Embassy in Israel
from Tel Aviv to West Jerusalem. Like most other countries, the
United States resists treating Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Such
a move would be particularly sensitive now, with East Jerusalem the
central issue of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Israel was prepared to consider an American
compromise plan that would have given Arafat a presidential office
in the Old City of Jerusalem. It would also have joined some Arab
areas of East Jerusalem to Arab suburbs now outside the city to
form, in effect, a new, Palestinian-ruled city of Arab Jerusalem. A
bridge would have linked these Palestinian-ruled areas to Muslim
holy sites in the Old City, guaranteeing unimpeded access to these
shrines.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, regrettably, showed no interest in this proposal,
holding out for full control of all areas of the city formerly
under Jordanian rule. Talks on Jerusalem cannot usefully resume
until Arafat shows a greater willingness to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat seems to feel he cannot do so. His rigidity reflects his
failure to prepare Palestinian opinion for anything less than full
sovereignty over East Jerusalem. But it also reflects the vocal
opposition of Arab countries like Saudi Arabia to recognizing any
Israeli sovereignty there. This Arab opposition must be defused in
the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Barak faces fresh challenges to his government. But
polls taken since Camp David show strong support for continued
peace efforts. Longstanding taboos in Israeli politics were broken
at Camp David. The possible compromises discussed there by Barak
are now being digested by the Israeli public. Equally bold moves
are needed from the Palestinians, especially on Jerusalem.

HUD'S GUN BUY-BACK PROGRAM UNAUTHORIZED, CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Defying congressional Republicans, the Clinton
administration says that it will continue paying local governments
to buy back guns from private owners despite orders from House
budget appropriators to end the program.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Buyback America, the $15 million program is intended to
reduce gun violence in cities, particularly around public housing
projects, by helping the police and housing authorities purchase
firearms for about $50 each, with no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton unveiled the program last September, 70
cities, including San Francisco, Hartford, Conn., Atlanta,
Baltimore, Md., Newark, N.J., and Houston, have spent $3.5 million
to buy more than 17,300 guns, most of which have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But from its inception, the program has been sharply criticized
by the National Rifle Association and by opponents of gun control
in Congress, as a waste of money that leaves guns in the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, told the agency's secretary, Andrew Cuomo,
to stop financing the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cuomo, Walsh said that existing law did not
authorize such spending, a position supported by the General
Accounting Office, a nonpartisan congressional research agency.
Programs in at least 30 cities have been put on hold because of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement President Clinton planned to release Sunday,
he asserts that the housing department has clear legal authority to
finance the program, which he contends will help prevent ``an
untold number of gun accidents, suicides and crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite HUD's clear authority to carry out this important
program, the gun lobby and other opponents of common-sense gun
safety measures continue to challenge this initiative,'' Clinton
says in the statement. ``Congress should put the public safety
interests of American families above those of the gun lobby and
support these efforts instead of working to undermine them.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Buyback America comes at a time when gun control
is playing an increasingly prominent role in the fall elections.
The NRA and the gun industry, as well as gun control groups, are
promising to spend record amounts helping to elect their respective
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also say they expect to use the issue to
underscore sharp ideological differences between Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Gore, the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee, supports an array of tougher gun laws, while
Bush, the likely Republican candidate, opposes most new gun
restrictions and has been a strong ally of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Walsh said he had been pressured by
the NRA or its allies in Congress. The Republican whip, Rep. Tom
DeLay of Texas, a leading supporter of the association, is a member
of Walsh's subcommittee. And its ranking Democrat, Rep. Allan
Mollohan of West Virginia, who co-signed the letter to Cuomo, is
considered a loyal ally of the rifle association by gun-control
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he acted on his own because he believed that federal
money was being spent inappropriately, draining money from a
program to fight drugs in public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has found the gun lobby to be an
excellent whipping boy,'' he said. ``But I have not consistently
supported or opposed the gun lobby. This is just an appropriators'
responsibility to make sure that funds are spent appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo disputed that, saying in an interview, ``I have no
doubt the NRA and like groups are behind many of these anti-gun
safety maneuvers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen if the buyback program continued, Walsh
said that housing officials could be fined or even jailed. But he
said he was not sure he was prepared to seek such penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The buyback program has proven popular in many cities. In Corpus
Christi, Texas, officials spent their entire grant of $19,500 to
buy 260 guns in just one day, turning away more than 100 people the
next morning. In Davenport, Iowa, a $21,000 grant was spent in
under three hours to buy 420 guns.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the program said each gun purchased removed a
serious hazard. But the NRA contends most of the guns bought back
are old, cheap weapons that are unlikely to be used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun control advocates agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not getting street crime guns,'' said Kristen Rand,
staff counsel for the Violence Policy Center, which lobbies for gun
control.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The Republican convention opening here on Monday
is really two conventions, one for the delegates in the hall and
another for the party's biggest contributors, who will be treated
to a panoply of perks, from yacht rides to skyboxes high above the
convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   With a record $137.4 million in large contributions already
collected, the Republican Party is flush with soft money, the
unrestricted party checks. But one of the central purposes of the
gathering is to motivate the party's most generous supporters to
raise and give still more.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party is poised to collect a post-convention
windfall from corporate interests. A core group of business donors
_ oil, tobacco, guns, real estate and software _ now form the
financial backbone of the modern Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney is generating even
greater enthusiasm in the business world, and corporate donors have
helped put the Republican Party in the best financial shape it has
ever enjoyed going into a general election.
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on the popularity of Bush, the second-term Texas
governor, the party has created a new level of top givers _ the
Regents, individuals and companies who have given the party at
least $250,000 since January 1999. As of July 1, the Republican
Party had more than 100 such donors, who will be rewarded at the
convention with skybox seats, private dinners with party leaders,
champagne receptions and deluxe hotel accommodations (most of the
Regents are staying at the Four Seasons). A few will be going on a
fishing trip with House Speaker Dennis Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, political conventions have revolved around the
drama of delegates selecting a presidential and vice-presidential
nominee or fights over platform issues. With these issues largely
decided before the convention, entertaining donors and pushing them
to contribute more for the general election have become central
parts of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-day convention, television cameras will focus on
the stage where Bush will accept his party's presidential
nomination and other party figures will speak. But much of the
convention's real business will take place off-camera in hotel
suites, hospitality tents, restaurants and country clubs where
donors will be rewarded for past generosity and asked to give
again.
</P>
<P>
   For the party's top underwriters, there will be an array of
gold-plated events in Philadelphia, including cocktails with Gen.
Colin Powell and an evening cruise on the Delaware River aboard the
``Enterprise,'' the yacht owned by Richard M. DeVos, the Amway
founder, who is a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of two distinctly different conventions, one a
televised coronation of the Republican ticket, the other a
behind-the-scenes parade of big donor events, is a striking
development, said historian Richard F. Fenno Jr. of the University
of Rochester. ``I'm not sure those two conventions even meet,''
Fenno said.

   Bush has excited the corporate world more than any recent
Republican presidential nominee, party leaders say. His running
mate, Cheney _ a former congressman and defense secretary who until
his selection was the chief executive of Halliburton Co., the
world's largest oil field services company _ also generates
enthusiasm in corporate boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It excites the business community when they see people on the
ticket who know what it takes to meet a payroll, fill out
regulatory forms and pay taxes,'' said Thomas J. Donohue, president
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Bush's campaign has collected a record $90 million in
federally restricted, individual donations of $1,000 or less;
nearly one-quarter of that amount was raised by a national network
of 212 business executives and wealthy individuals who call
themselves the Pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with many of the top 25 soft-money donors to the
Republican National Committee reveal that they are united by their
opposition to what they describe as intrusive government
regulation, their desire for much lower taxes and their loathing of
lawmaking by litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal for a deep tax cut and his record of passing
legislation to limit civil lawsuits in Texas are extremely
appealing to the Republican Party's major underwriters. Meanwhile,
Vice President Al Gore's environmental views, among other issues,
make some donors in the business community nervous.
</P>
<P>
   According to David B. Magleby, director of the Center for the
Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University, many
of those who write six-figure checks to a political party do so for
calculated business reasons. ``This is money coming from interested
companies and interested individuals who have agendas,'' Magleby
said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes for these donors are large: government appointments,
from the Supreme Court to the Environmental Protection Agency;
antitrust enforcement; tax policy; land use decisions; oil drilling
permits; regulatory decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the stakes they have, the investment they have made in
this convention in Philadelphia is very modest, given the potential
rate of return,'' Magleby added.

<P>
   The Democrats, of course, will be giving royal treatment to
their largest donors at their convention in Los Angeles, too, with
labor unions, trial lawyers and Hollywood executives among the
biggest underwriters of the Democratic ticket. But the Democratic
Party is struggling to compete with Bush and the Republican Party
in America's corporate suites.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Pascoe, the Republican Party press secretary, emphasized
that the party gets the bulk of its financial support from 570,000
small donors, including 140,000 people who contributed to the party
for the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fund-raising success is a measure of the broad and deep
support that our party, its principles and our nominee _ Gov.
George W. Bush _ have across this great land,'' Pascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Republican National Committee's 10 largest donors,
Philip Morris, the National Rifle Association and Microsoft, have
contributed record sums to the Republican Party this year at a time
when they face legal and legislative assaults led by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Enron Corp., the Republican National Committee's second-largest
donor, strongly favors the party's economic policies, particularly
its preference for free trade and a hands-off approach to the
regulation of business, including enterprises as different as
derivatives trading and Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The companies and the individuals who make up the list of top
contributors to the Republican National Committee say they are
delighted by Bush's rhetoric and his record.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Bush supports limits on damages in
product liability lawsuits and on fees for trial lawyers and
opposes federal anti-tobacco litigation. In Texas, he was also
responsible for a $1.7 billion property tax break and environmental
waivers for the oil and energy industries and has opposed most gun
control legislation and government lawsuits against gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sympathetic to lawsuits,'' Bush said at a campaign
stop in Washington state in February. ``Write that down. I worry
about lawsuits on job creation. If you are looking for the kind of
president I will be, I will be slow to litigate.''
</P>
<P>
   This is music to the ears of most business executives.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Philip Morris, the Republican committee's
largest single donor at $619,000 as of June 30, said that the
company supports Republicans because they are ``people who share
similar views on issues that are important,'' including the
regulation of tobacco. Another industry official said he expected
that Bush would treat cigarette companies fairly, while President
Clinton has used the industry as a whipping boy.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have as much at stake in November's election as
Enron, the giant Houston energy and trading concern that, over the
years, has been Bush's largest corporate sponsor as well as a
generous soft-money donor to the Republican Party. Enron and its
chairman and chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, have been the top
patrons of Bush's political career since his first campaign for
Congress in 1978. Since January 1999, Enron and its executives have
donated $615,550 to the Republican National Committee, the
second-highest amount of any individual or corporation in that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tenure in Texas has been beneficial to Enron: He backed
several of the company's most important legislative initiatives,
including electric utility deregulation and limits on civil
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Enron is even more explicit about why it wants to see Bush and
other Republicans elected in November. A June 15 internal
memorandum to executives soliciting contributions to the company's
political action committee lays out the reasons: Enron faces
numerous legal and regulatory challenges, the memorandum says,
including taxation of electronic commerce, restructuring of the
electric industry, international trade legislation, regulation of
power plants and oil pipelines and a variety of environmental and
tax issues.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum, which cites a $1 million fund-raising goal,
details suggested ``voluntary'' contributions for Enron executives,
from $500 a year for a low-level manager to $5,000 a year for a
member of the executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic Enron employee who received the letter said some
employees found the solicitation objectionable. The employee also
said that some employees have begun to complain that too many
corporate resources are being spent to support Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wholehearted endorsement of Governor Bush, and the brazen
use of the corporate machinery to ensure his election, seems
distasteful,'' said the employee, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Palmer, a vice president at Enron, said the political
action committee is intended to improve Enron's name recognition.
``We are one of the few companies in this industry that has
advocated 100 percent for open markets and for taking away the
monopoly protection that this industry has enjoyed for so long,''
Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association is the fifth-largest donor to the
Republican committee, with contributions totaling $508,000 since
the beginning of 1999. The group has given other Republican
committees an additional $250,000, while donating nothing to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush opposed state and federal lawsuits against gun makers and
supported the NRA's version of a bill to require background checks
at gun shows. In the House, Cheney was a staunch ally of gun
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly and his brother, Charles J. Wyly Jr., longtime friends
of Bush, are among the most generous individual underwriters of the
Republican Party. They have supported Bush not only with $500,000
in donations to the party but also with a $2.5 million television
advertising campaign against his rival in the Republican primaries,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Wyly's businesses have fared well during Bush's tenure as
Texas governor. Two years ago, one of the Wyly firms, Maverick
Capital, won a state contract to manage $96 million of the
University of Texas endowment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Wyly said that he supported Republican economic policies, but
that he hoped to make the party more broad-minded on social policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a long history working for minorities,'' Wyly said,
``and I think our efforts make it easier for people of similar
persuasions to feel more comfortable with the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Fox, the chairman and chief executive officer of Harbour
Group, a manufacturing company in Missouri, is the individual who
has contributed the most to the Republican National Committee _
$575,000. But in an interview last week, he insisted that he gives
a lot to the party because it shares his goal of ``good government
and no debts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we part with $250,000 of after-tax money that is not
deductible, we have to believe in the cause,'' Fox said, adding
that he is motivated by a desire ``to see honor and dignity
restored to the White House.''

IN AMSTERDAM, BILLY GRAHAM TORCH WILL PASS TO MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ The Rev. Jack Ruimb, senior pastor of a
congregation in the western highlands of Papua New Guinea, has by
his own count founded 321 churches in that South Pacific nation
since 1978. When he visits villages to speak about Jesus, Ruimb
said, he sometimes shows movies of another evangelist preaching.
``I use most of Billy's films,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Billy, he meant the Rev. Billy Graham, whose organization,
the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, has gathered Ruimb and
10,000 other evangelists from 190 countries in Amsterdam this
weekend for a nine-day conference billed as the largest such event
ever held.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam 2000, as the gathering is called, has turned a
rambling convention center on the city's southern edge into an
extraordinary crossroads of global evangelical Christianity. In the
space of a few minutes, a visitor can encounter the head of a
Protestant seminary in Pakistan, a Presbyterian pastor from Sudan
and a married couple of Salvation Army majors from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the largely male group of participants reflects
the trend now marking global Christianity: the faith's shift toward
the Southern Hemisphere as the number of Christians expands rapidly
in Asia and Africa while remaining little changed or even declining
in northern countries. Lutherans in southern Africa, for example,
now outnumber those in North America.
</P>
<P>
   This trend accelerated sharply with the demise of colonialism
four decades ago. Churches, like governments, passed into local
hands, and the Scriptures were translated into native languages,
noted the Rev. Ian T. Douglas, associate professor of world mission
and global Christianity at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shift from being a church of the Western, industrialized
nations to being a church of Asia, Africa and the Pacific has
happened within the lifetime of most Christians,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He called it as significant a development within Christianity as
the faith's earlier and much more gradual shift in its center of
gravity from the Mediterranean to northern Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have come here partly to learn about what is
happening in the rest of the world. Samuel Bartholomew, 26, a
student at Dallas Theological Seminary in Texas, said he wanted to
gain ``a greater global awareness of how God's moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference is symbolic in a personal way, for Graham. In
material distributed beforehand, the event is being described as a
``passing of the torch'' from the 81-year-old evangelist to a new
generation of preachers. (However, Graham has given no indication
that he will retire, and indeed plans to preach in Jacksonville,
Fla., in November.)
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected and poignant turn of events, Graham was forced
to cancel plans to speak at the opening session Saturday night. He
is staying in the United States on doctors' orders, after
undergoing recent surgery to relieve a buildup of fluid on the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   A close observer of the Graham organization, William Martin, a
professor of sociology at Rice University in Houston, said the
conference seemed a fitting place to speak of passing the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the true successor to Billy Graham is not going to
be any single person,'' said Martin, the author of a biography of
Billy Graham, ``A Prophet With Honor'' (Morrow, 1991). ``The
circumstances are not likely to permit it or encourage it. He sees
his own legacy not as one person, but as these tens of thousands of
evangelists preaching all over the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham's absence has heightened the role here of his eldest son,
Franklin, who is first vice chairman of the Graham association and
his father's designated successor as that organization's head.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the younger Graham, 48, president of a
Christian relief organization called Samaritan's Purse, said his
father ``took a nose dive, healthwise,'' after he finished a public
preaching event in Nashville, Tenn., last month. ``It was a
dangerous situation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Admitted to the Mayo Clinic, Billy Graham had two shunts
implanted to drain off the fluid and relieve the pressure on his
brain. His condition has improved markedly, and he is being treated
on an outpatient basis. He will watch the conference by satellite,
his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham will be among the speakers here _ but not until
after he has flown for one day to Philadelphia to offer a prayer at
the Republican convention when it opens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of the global reach of the conference, its
proceedings will be simultaneously translated into 28 languages,
from Arabic to Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In its 50 years, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has
built ties to churches and other Christian organizations throughout
the world. It relied on them, a spokesman said, to screen the
28,000 applicants who wanted to come to Amsterdam, selecting the
10,000 due to arrive here.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Southwell, an official of the association, said the
conference was intended particularly to bring in people under 45,
who were ``significantly involved'' in evangelism but rarely, if
ever, had attended a big religious conference.
</P>
<P>
   Two west African preachers who were among Friday's arrivals said
they hoped to learn more about carrying the Christian message into
their countries' communities.
</P>
<P>
   Appollos Nuhu Jabho, a Nigerian, serves as a missionary with
evangelical and Pentecostal churches in his own country, and said
he was seeking ``spiritual refreshment, spiritual revitalization.''
The Rev. Edem J. Anthony, said he came from Togo to learn new
evangelistic strategies. ``I am working with young people in the
schools,'' he said. ``We are getting to the rural villages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Solomon Kendagor, a Kenyan, and his wife, Ruby, a
Canadian citizen born in Trinidad, illustrate the crosscultural
trends of modern Christianity. They work as missionaries in St.
Louis, training Americans to reach out to international students
studying in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students we work with, not all of them will become
Christians,'' Ruby Kendagor said, ``but they will go back to their
native countries and say: `Yes, Christianity is true. People showed
kindness to me.'''

EDITORIAL: EMPLOYMENT'S NEW AGE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, July 30:
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, American businesses have begun to discover the
value of hiring or retraining older workers. In some cases, those
placements have been for specialized, high-income jobs _ as in the
financial services sector, where companies like New York Life and
Salomon Brothers Asset Management have begun hiring more
salespeople over 50, in part because their age may give them an
edge in a world where two-thirds of the money in the stock market
is controlled by managers over 50.
</P>
<P>
   Other placements have been for specialized, low-income jobs,
like the 100 women, average age 71, hired by Bonnie Bell to package
lip gloss. They replaced a group of younger, less reliable
temporary workers.
</P>
<P>
   It is so far a tiny trend. But the reasons for it are big and
growing, and the nation's employers need to learn from them. The
unemployment rate has been hovering around 4 percent in recent
months. The tight labor market, which has created intense
competition for qualified employees at every level, may not be a
fluke but a new reality. That is because it stems not just from a
growing economy, and an older work force that has been retiring at
progressively younger ages, but from a shrinking number of young
workers, too.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to lower birth rates, there are simply fewer young people
available to fill new jobs. Within four years, for the first time
in American history, there will be fewer people aged 20 to 29 in
the population than people 55 to 69. The gap will grow. By 2020,
the younger group may be 40 percent smaller than the older one.
</P>
<P>
   By then, about half the boomer generation _ those 76 million
people born between 1946 and 1964 _ will have passed the age of 65.
They are healthier than their parents. They will live longer, and
two surveys in the last two years, by Fortune magazine and AARP,
found that 74 percent to 80 percent of them expect to still be
working in retirement. A recent Harris poll estimated that there
are 4 million people over 65 who would like to be working
</P>
<P>
   In the past, traditional biases against older workers _ that
they are slow, less motivated than younger people and
technologically inept _ have closed that door. But the changing
demographics led William Zinke, head of a private human resources
company, to commission a survey by Harris last fall of the human
resource directors at almost 800 American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty percent of them agreed that there was less turnover among
older workers than younger ones, 74 percent said they were more
reliable, and 71 percent said they had as much ability to acquire
new skills. Sixty-two percent agreed that younger workers were
actually less creative and innovative than older workers, and 80
percent said they had more absenteeism.
</P>
<P>
   It seems a striking vote of confidence by the nation's corporate
gatekeepers in the qualities of older workers. But their actions
have not been the equal of their words. Those gatekeepers have been
doing their best to push older workers out for years, because they
are paid more than younger ones. As the boomer generation begins
turning 55 next year, corporate America should be finding ways to
retain, retrain or rehire old workers.

CLINTON SPOKE OF EMBASSY TO HELP BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In raising the prospect of moving the U.S. Embassy
in Israel to Jerusalem, President Clinton was responding to an
unusual request from Prime Minister Ehud Barak as he left the
failed Camp David peace talks to help shore up his political
position back home, administration officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said
Saturday that Clinton had decided to use an interview on Israeli
television Friday as a platform to support Barak, who had explained
to Clinton the difficulties he was in during a parting conversation
at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said that the United States would stand by those
who took risks for peace,'' Berger said. He acknowledged that
Clinton's statement on Jerusalem was more ``forward leaning'' than
in the past and closer to a readiness to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly spontaneous remark from the president, who said
unprompted that he had ``always wanted'' to move the embassy to
Jerusalem, was actually carefully vetted before hand by U.S.
negotiators who had accompanied Clinton to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official acknowledged Saturday that Clinton had
raised the issue as a way of trying to help Barak survive a
no-confidence vote scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of preparing for Monday's vote in Parliament,
Barak also called a number of congressmen on Thursday asking them
to introduce a resolution on moving the embassy to Jerusalem,
according to officials familiar with the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Among those Barak telephoned was the Senate majority leader,
Trent Lott, and Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who is chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who returned home to raucous criticism in Parliament, for
the concessions he was prepared to make to the Palestinians _
including on the status of Jerusalem _ is considered an absolutely
vital ingredient by the administration for any chance of continuing
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been monitoring on an almost hourly basis
political developments in Israel as Barak faces the no-confidence
vote. By some calculations, if he loses the votes of only two
legislators who supported him on the last no-confidence vote, he
will be forced to call new elections. Barak lost his parliamentary
majority on the eve of coming to the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Clinton's public proclamation on the embassy and
Jerusalem was considered extraordinary because in the past, this
administration has been careful to tamp down any enthusiasm in
Congress for moving the embassy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some Israeli prime ministers, including Yitzhak Rabin, have also
been careful not to encourage too much eagerness for the embassy
move, on the grounds that it would unnecessarily inflame the
Palestinians and set back peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Saturday whether Clinton's statement would also serve to
help his wife, Hillary, who is running for the U.S. Senate in New
York, a senior administration official said: ``It had nothing to do
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said, however, that it was known that as
Clinton prepared for the interview that the relocation of the
embassy to Jerusalem would come up and that a positive answer would
not ``hurt'' Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Clinton himself said that he had refrained
from pushing for the embassy to be relocated before because he was
concerned that such a move would interfere with peace talks between
Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he would ``review'' the idea and make a
decision between now and the end of the year. The president said
that it would be done in ``the light of what has happened'' at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   By making such a pledge, Clinton was also warning the
Palestinians that if they did not come to an agreement, the United
States would consider recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the
Jewish state. The United States and most other nations have kept
their embassies in Tel Aviv, arguing that the status of the Holy
City remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing the parameters of what Clinton would say in the
interview, U.S. negotiators weighed his position on the embassy as
a six on a scale of 10.
</P>
<P>
   On the lowest end of the scale, Clinton could have said _ as the
White House has in the past _ that it did not want to jeopardize
the peace efforts by advocating a move. Or Clinton could have gone
all-out and said he wanted to move the embassy, a position that the
Whited House ultimately decided was too forward.

TO SAVE BLUE CRAB, MUCH OF CHESAPEAKE IS OFF LIMITS TO FISHING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT NEWS, Va. _ In the face of economic and environmental
warning signs, state fishery authorities have taken the drastic
step of declaring a vast 665-square-mile fishermen-free sanctuary
through the heart of the lower Chesapeake Bay to provide safe
passage for the millions of female blue crabs now on the southward
trek to their high-salt spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The marine police are on the prowl by boat and airplane to keep
poachers from the female crabs that are the key to maintaining what
has been the Chesapeake region's most lucrative fishery yield. The
no-harvest sanctuary was ordered because authorities say there has
been a one-third drop in productivity and, of even greater concern,
a 70 percent drop in the number of females of spawning age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rather alarming,'' said Jack G. Travelstead, director
of fisheries for the Marine Resources Commission of Virginia. The
commission oversees the region's major spawning grounds for the
blue crab, which has long been one of the most fecund and resilient
of bay creatures.
</P>
<P>
   But marine scientists, mindful of the Chesapeake's disastrous
loss of its once vast oyster crop, say the female blue crab
population has not suffered so much since it was devastated by
Hurricane Agnes in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our real concern is that if there's a natural disturbance on
top of the current problems, we might teeter on the edge of the
collapse of the blue crab,'' said Rom Lipcius, a professor at the
College of William and Mary who is the crab expert for the state's
Institute of Marine Science.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 55-mile-long, 10-mile-wide sanctuary for the
migrating females is intended to serve as a deep-water corridor off
limits to the watermen now plying the bay and its tributaries for
the succulent catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pre-emptive strike against the increased numbers of
crabbers in the bay and their shift to deeper and deeper waters in
going after blue crab,'' said Lipcius. He noted that a much smaller
spawning-ground sanctuary had been maintained for decades but that
something far more drastic proved necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A range of contributing factors to the blue crab problem are
under study by scientists in Maryland and Virginia. They include
overfishing by watermen setting more crab pots, the erosion of bay
grasses vital for young crabs' survival and the prodigious revival
of striped bass, croakers and the other natural predators that
savor crabs as much as humans do.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the study is completed next year, fishing
authorities decided in June that the threat to the bay's signature
blue crab industry had grown serious enough to require an immediate
declaration of the sanctuary. Crabbers were caught short as it was
ordered to be in effect annually during the spawning season, from
June 1 to Sept. 15. It covers the primary spawning corridor and
grounds south from the Maryland border to the lower bay's mouth to
the ocean.

<P>
   ``There's a question of whether this is good or not,'' said Dale
Taylor, president of the Virginia Watermen's Association,
summarizing various complaints of his 100-member organization that
their livelihood could be seriously affected. ``But I say let's try
it and see what it does. We'd all like to build our stock up
more,'' said Taylor, who worked for three decades as a marine
patrol enforcement officer, then decided seven years ago to become
a waterman and go after blue crab.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the bay, crabbers heading home after predawn trips seemed
to have assorted complaints and suspicions about the skein of
underlying problems as they questioned whether the sanctuary would
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time will tell,'' said Captain Kenny Oliver of the Virginia
Marine Patrol, cruising the bay and praising most watermen so far
for respecting the sanctuary as a way to bolster the blue crab
industry in the long run. The catch in recent years, says Lipcius,
has fallen off to about 60 million pounds of crab meat in Virginia
and Maryland waters, as opposed to the 80 million to 100 million
pounds taken in richer days in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's take a look here,'' Oliver said, pulling alongside the
Evie J and hopping aboard to check out the catch of Mike Mahoney, a
waterman for 18 years who has the muscular arms and weathered face
to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem for me,'' Mahoney said of the sanctuary, noting
that he usually set his pots in shallower waters than the standard
of 35 feet and deeper decreed for the sanctuary. He noted that some
pregnant females could be legally kept if they were from shallower
depths.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver and his partner, Officer Paul Newman, who are part of the
state's 65-member sanctuary patrol, decide in spot checks whether
the complexities of the crabbing regulations are being violated.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver intently studied the barrels of crabs Mahoney said he had
caught outside the new sanctuary. He zeroed in on pregnant females,
called sponge crabs because of the look of the bulky accretion on
their undersides containing the millions of fertilized eggs they
carry as they scuttle south to spawn. Outside the sanctuary,
regulations say females with orange sponge can be kept; those
further along to spawning, however, have dark-colored sponge and
must be returned to the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Such regulations are studded with loopholes in the eyes of
critics. They complain that economic pressures have meant the
government has shied from effectively controlling watermen and the
number of crab pots they are permitted to set. Taylor, president of
one of the dozen watermen's associations, said he was so tired of
the disputes over precisely what was ailing the blue crab that he
wanted to see an extended ban on the harvesting of all females
anywhere in the bay as a loophole-free test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crabs go through good years and bad,'' Taylor said. ``But
let's not take any females at all anywhere for three years and see
how well that builds the stock,'' he said, upping the debate ante
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, state regulators will stick with the sweeping
sanctuary as the most telling signal yet of their determination to
protect the blue crab stock and ward off another catastrophe on the
order of the demise of the bay's oyster fishery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of its effectiveness depends on peer pressure by the
watermen themselves,'' said Travelstead, the state fisheries
director. ``The public has to buy it, or otherwise it won't work.
We can't put an officer on every crabbing boat out there.''

DISGRUNTLED ARAFAT SEEKS SUPPORT ON TOUR, ACCUSING ISRAEL OF
LYING 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A deeply disgruntled Yasser Arafat left his base in
the Gaza Strip on Saturday on a diplomatic tour aimed at
solidifying Palestinian support in the wake of the Camp David
talks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Palestinian leader departed for Paris, where he was to
meet President Jacques Chirac before visits to Russia and several
key Arab nations, he gave vent to some of the frustration and anger
that has built up among Palestinians since the Camp David talks
broke up on Tuesday over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks since the talks, President Clinton and Ehud Barak,
the Israeli prime minister, have represented Arafat as the spoiler
who wrecked the possibility of a wide-ranging peace agreement by
rejecting U.S. proposals for the future of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian anger was compounded on Friday when Clinton, seeking
to bolster Barak's political standing in Israel ahead of a crucial
parliamentary no-confidence vote on Monday, gave an interview to
Israeli television saying that Israel's flexible stance at Camp
David had pushed him toward a decision to move the U.S. Embassy in
Israel to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   By raising the possibility of a presidential order for the
embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv, and saying he would make the
decision before the end of the year, Clinton delighted the Jews,
and enraged the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Although largely symbolic when measured against the financial
and diplomatic support the United States has given Israel since
1948, the fact that the U.S. Embassy, along with those of most
other nations, has remained in Tel Aviv has always been taken as a
signal that Washington has not prejudged the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gaza airport, Arafat avoided direct criticism of Clinton,
and of the president's remarks about the embassy issue, masking the
deep dismay that aides said he had expressed privately about
Clinton's remarks since the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arafat focused on the Israelis, saying that his
diplomatic tour would seek to counter ``the big lies'' that had
characterized Israeli accounts of Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put our friends and our brothers, the Arabs and the
Europeans, far away from the Israeli propaganda and big lies that
they are trying to put out about what happened at Camp David,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem were broadcast just as
the Sabbath began on Friday evening, there was little formal
reaction from Israeli politicians. Privately, many were delighted,
although some right-wingers were critical of Clinton for speaking
at a juncture that seemed directly linked to the series of
no-confidence votes that Barak's shaky government faces in Israel's
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli news reports on Friday said that Clinton made the
remarks as a direct result of a telephone call from Barak asking
for a gesture that would bolster his support with the Israeli
public, and in particular with right-wing and religious groups that
will determine whether the government survives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the interview to reiterate his praise of Barak
after the Camp David talks, describing him as ``more creative and
more courageous'' than Arafat in his readiness to accept painful
compromises over Jerusalem. He said Barak had ``done everything he
could to reach agreement while backing the vital interests of
Israel,'' and chided Arafat for saying that the Palestinians would
go ahead with a formal declaration of Palestinian statehood after
Sept. 13. Clinton said that the proclamation of statehood could
have ``consequences,'' including a review of American relations
with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any direct response from Arafat, the
Palestinians made their views known through Hanan Ashrawi, who
frequently acts as a spokesman for the Palestinian cause. In
remarks to Agence France-Presse, Ashwrawi said that Clinton's
remarks exposed the ``underlying American bias'' in the peace
process, and added, ``It sounds like blatant political blackmail,
all in the interest of Barak.'' At another point, she said that the
television interview amounted to ``pandering to Barak and Clinton's
domestic needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The mention of Clinton's political needs at home appeared to be
a veiled reference to an allegation that has frequently been made
in the Palestinian media in recent months, that Clinton has tilted
increasingly toward the Israelis in the peace talks in an attempt
to help Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Senate election campaign in
New York. The suggestion is one that the White House has ridiculed,
saying Clinton is acting in what he regards as the best interests
of peace, not in support of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   What was still more strident was the reaction of Hamas, the
militant Islamic movement that has vigorously opposed Arafat's
engagement in the peace effort. Commenting on Clinton's remarks
about moving the embassy, Mahmoud al-Zahhar, a senior Hamas aide,
hinted that the group could attack U.S. installations in the Middle
East if the move went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamas will be the first to fight against this issue, and it's
not only Hamas,'' he said in an interview with Reuters. ``The
entire interests of the United States will be in danger in all
Islamic states. Moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would
be regarded as American recognition of Israel's occupation of
Jerusalem, which is a flagrant challenge to Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   On his tour of Europe and Arab nations, which his aides said
would include Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, and possibly other,
non-Arab Muslim states, Arafat will in effect be countering a U.S.
diplomatic offensive in support of Clinton's peace proposals, and
in particular the U.S. plan for Jerusalem. That proposal would give
the Palestinians limited authority in parts of east Jerusalem in
return for giving up their claim to all the eastern half of the
city, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's first stop on his way home on Wednesday was in Egypt,
where he met with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat will be trying to blunt the impact of a tour beginning
this week by Edward Walker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state
for Near Eastern affairs, who is a former ambassador to Israel and
Egypt. The State Department announced on Friday that Walker would
visit 14 countries over the next several weeks, including Egypt,
Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia, apparently in a bid to
change Arab thinking on Jerusalem. Most of the Arab reaction since
Camp David, from governments and in the media, has been strongly
supportive of Arafat's demand that ``all of Jerusalem'' be returned
to the Palestinians in a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Arafat were at pains not to depict the Palestinian
leader as opening a political battle with Clinton. At Gaza airport,
reporters were told that Arafat had received a private letter of
``encouragement and praise'' from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian officials urged Clinton to remain impartial.
``We hope he will remain fair in all issues relating to us,'' said
Nabil Shaath, who was an adviser to Arafat at Camp David. Speaking
in the West Bank town of Ramallah, he added, ``We hope that
President Clinton remains as the knight of peace, who continues
what he started at Camp David until we reach a just peace that goes
in line with international legitimacy.''

12-YEAR-OLD SOCCER STAR FROM ITALY ON VERGE OF CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE HANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vincenzo Sarno, the ``little Maradona,'' was bored.
The 12-year-old Italian is on the verge of signing away his
professional rights to A.S. Roma, one of the top teams in Italy,
but sitting still for an interview is not his idea of fun.
</P>
<P>
   He leaned over to Gaetano Mosca, the man who runs the soccer
academy that Vincenzo attends in his hometown of Naples, and in
Italian asked a simple question in an exasperated voice:
</P>
<P>
   ``How many pages is he going to write?''
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo is clearly tired of talking about his gift _ or rather,
tired of hearing adults talk about it. He had already spent
Saturday morning waiting for a quick appearance on CBS' ``Early
Show,'' whose set was teeming with adults: Mosca; a publicist from
F.A.O. Schwarz, which sponsored his trip to New York and a shopping
spree at the store; the television crew filming a special about him
for the Italian television show ``Zoom''; tourists; and Bryant
Gumbel.
</P>
<P>
   For all that standing around, he got only a few minutes on the
air, right before the weather. On the outdoor set on the corner of
59th and Fifth, a small aluminum goal had been erected on a mat of
plastic grass. The cameras rolled, and he juggled the ball a few
times with his feet with his back to the goal before turning and
shooting. After that, the weatherman tried to engage him and
Vincenzo halfheartedly shot one into the left side of the goal
before the segment ended. All together, not too much more than a
lot of 12-year-olds on your block could have done.
</P>
<P>
   Then the camera stopped. Vincenzo suddenly had a huge grin on
his face, and the ball seemed agreeable to whatever he wanted it to
do. The boy whose talents are reminiscent of the former Argentinian
star Diego Maradona used his feet, thighs, chest, shoulders and
head, and it seemed the ball would never hit the ground again. As
professional scouts all over Italy would be happy to tell you,
nobody on your block can do anything close to what Vincenzo can do.
</P>
<P>
   That is why his professional playing rights are the focus of
serious negotiations _ and have been since he was 10. While it is
fairly common for professional teams to pay large sums for the
playing rights of 15-year-olds, Vincenzo's age has made his case
controversial. When his first prospective deal, with Torino, hit
the Italian press, cries of exploitation were sounded. That deal
has since been abandoned, but at the ripe age of 12 he appears on
the verge of signing with Roma.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I don't see anything wrong with it,'' said Mosca, who
owns the rights to Vincenzo's image for advertising purposes until
the boy turns 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid wants to play soccer, he should be able to. Vincenzo
is a different case. He is naturally gifted, and right now he plays
like he is 14 or 15. It feels like it is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo shrugs and looks sheepish when talking about committing
to a pro team at such an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a difference,'' he said in Italian. ``It is
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the controversy, Roma is very close to completing
a deal that would pay the boy's family around $200,000, with
millions more to come for Vincenzo when he turns 14, the age at
which amateur players can be signed by pro teams. Then, at 16, he
would begin playing for Roma's senior team unless another squad
pays a transfer fee for his rights.
</P>
<P>
   If he does sign with Roma, the club plans to move Vincenzo,
whose family lives in a poor section of Naples, to an exclusive
boarding school in Rome and to supply an apartment for his three
siblings and his parents. The team will also arrange a job for his
father and pay for special care of Vincenzo's 5-year-old brother,
who has Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   For Vincenzo, however, the game still seems to be the thing, not
the press or the money or the things his skill might allow him to
do for his family. He is hard-pressed to come up with other
hobbies: television (on which he watches soccer), school (where he
gets to play soccer), and Play Station (on which he devotes most of
his time to soccer games) were the only answers he could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Those around him seem intent on turning that love of the game
into a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is talent out there, regardless of age, it should be
helped,'' Mosca said as the television crew and public relations
people headed out to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Vincenzo was lagging behind, kicking a ball around the F.A.O.
Schwarz lobby, faking out the cameraman from ``Zoom'' with a wide
array of moves. Earlier, fleeing the conference room, Vincenzo
offered his take on the day's events: ``Playing soccer is more fun
than sitting in a room and talking about it.''

   CVN-BUSH (Louisville, Ky.) _ George W. Bush challenges Al Gore
to ``pick up the phone'' and urge President Clinton to sign
GOP-backed legislation that would end the penalty paid by many
married couples on their income tax. Clinton has vowed to veto the
bill because, he said, it would drain too much money from the U.S.
treasury. By STEWART M. POWELL.

<P>
   CVN-GOP-EDUCATION (Philadelphia) _ George W. Bush's campaign
aides force the R epublican Platform Committee to withdraw its
efforts to undercut much of Bush's plan to aid and improve
education. The Bush aides also turn back a committee effort to
retain the party's 1996 plank calling for the abolition of the
Department of Education. By DAN FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   CVN-GOP-GAYS (Philadelphia) _ Despite strong anti-gay language
in the party platform expected to be approved Monday, Republican
National Chairman Jim Nicholson says the GOP is ``steadfastly
against discrimination of any kind _ against anybody regardless of
their race, sex, creed and any other preferences that they choose
to follow.'' By SUSANNA McBEE.

   COLOMBIA-INTRO _ With the highest murder and kidnapping rates in
the world, a raging civil war, the worst recession in memory and
plummeting public confidence in the army and the government,
Colombia is facing the most dire crisis in its history. Thousands
of people are fleeing the country, while human rights activists
estimate another 1 to 2 million have been displaced internally by
repeated attacks by leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary
groups. We profile two groups _ kidnap victims and displaced people
_ as a window into everyday life in Colombia. (Williams, Cox News

<P>
   COLOMBIA-KIDNAP _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families come to the
national radio station each week, clutching hand-written notes they
hope will somehow reach their kidnapped relatives. With an average
of 8 kidnappings a day, Colombia is a nation living in fear.
Leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups have turned kidnapping
into a big business _ some 3,000 victims were snatched last year _
to raise money for their armies. We profile a few families of
kidnap victims who hope against hope they will somehow see their
loved ones again. (Williams, Cox News Service).

<P>
   COLOMBIA-DISPLACED _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona watched
warring leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries battle in
her remote village for months, dodging bullets and hiding with her
five children. Finally, she fled, abandoning her small store and
restaurant, eventually making her way to Bogota, where she is now
homeless. Barahona is one more victim in the tidal wave of 1 to 2
million Colombians - mostly rural peasants - displaced by the
country's civil war. Human rights activists fear the US aid package
may only increase the flow of refugees as poor campesinos are
forced out of the countryside by crop eradication programs and the
escalating war between guerrillas and the Colombian army.

   MEXICO-MIGRATION _ SAN FELIPE TORRES MOCHAS, Mexico _ Like
millions of other young Mexicans, Eusebio de Haro set out for the
United States in May, confident he'd find work like he did before.
Instead De Haro was shot to death, allegedly, by an elderly Texas
rancher after he and another young man knocked on his door to ask
for water in a remote area near the Rio Grande. The option to the
United States for work is as deeply ingrained in De Haro's home
state as the Virgin of Guadalupe. But it is an option that appears
to be getting more deadly every day for those who choose to cross
the border illegally. Migration is probably the toughest of all
issues between these two countries. And Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox, who is from De Haro's home state, has heightened the
profile even more, suggesting more visas for Mexican workers and
working toward an open border for the free flow of labor in as
little as 10 years. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

<P>
   MIGRATION-SIDE _ GUANAJUATO, Mexico _ Migration has affected
some towns in Fox's Guanajuato state where state social workers
attend to abandoned families and other problems. They're also
encouraging successful migrants to invest in communities to create
jobs there. These are towns that send construction workers to
Arkansas, laborers and harvesters to Texas and Georgia and others
states. We tell it from the perspective of a young social worker we
watched in action. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

<P>
   WESTERNER-CHENEY _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ George W. Bush's
selection of a Westerner to be his running mate suggests greater
national involvement in parochial, Western issues, say political
observers. The presence of Dick Cheney, who spent 12 years in
Washington, D.C., as Wyoming's lone congressman, on the national
Republican ticket might mean ``some Western issues will get a
little more air time,'' said Pete Kolbenschlag, Western Slope
director for the Colorado Environmental Coalition. What happens
after that, though, depends on the speaker. (Harmon, Grand Junction

</P>
<P>
   WESTERN-ISSUES _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Never underestimate the
importance of the West to presidential candidates on the stump,
especially when reaching out to voters outside the West. Protecting
wilderness, for instance, ``plays well in California,'' said
Michael Gizzi, a professor of political science at Mesa State
College, even if it might not win Colorado. That kind of
directional drilling for electoral votes _ sink a drill in the
red-rock side of flyover country and hope to strike gold in
California or New York _ is a staple of national campaigning. In
some cases this year, though, the direction gets reversed. (Harmon,
Grand Junction Daily Sentinel) MOVED.

<P>
   BUSH-YEARS _ PHILADELPHIA _ The George W. Bush presidential
campaign, which tried to navigate below the political radar screens
for months, maybe years, hit the TV screens with a wooden speech by
a governor not acclaimed as a great orator. ``Tomorrow,'' Bush said
in March 1999 at the Austin Convention Center, ``I will file papers
forming an exploratory committee so I can take the next step in
considering a campaign for president of the United States. This
will allow my friends to begin assessing the level of support for
my candidacy and to begin raising funds.'' Support turned out to be
good. Fund raising turned out even better. (Austin

<P>
   BUSH _ DAYTON _ George W. Bush and the rest of the Republicans
may hate Bill Clinton's presidency but they don't mind stealing
Clinton's good ideas. That's one reason why Bush begins traveling
through Ohio today as part of the ``Renewing America's Purpose
Tour,'' said political scientist Robert Adams. The tour, by plane
and bus, will get Bush to Philadelphia and the Republican National
Convention on Wednesday. (Dayton Daily News) MOVED Friday.

   COXNET FOCUS 0729: GOP CONVENTION _ The thought of Republicans

a Philadelphia building with banners and a 2-column photo Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and VP running mate Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TELEVISION CONVENTION _ This year's plan for network
convention coverage is not new. Gavel-to-gavel coverage disappeared
from the Big Three in the 1970s, when the primary process sapped
the suspense from the conventions. Why, the networks wondered,
should we scrap our popular programming to put on convention
coverage that Americans won't watch? The cable networks don't seem
to mind. (Holloway, Austin American-Statesman) Art includes a

   ``The people who are in charge of explaining American politics
to the American people don't understand American politics. They
think it's largely about imagery, but it's really about reality.
The national conventions are the occasions when the swing voters
finally pause to take note of the real national circumstances that
will determine their votes.'' This excerpt is from Dayton Daily

needs to tackle what seems like a nerve-racking project in this
tight U.S. labor market. Atlanta-based Home Depot plans to open
about 900 stores over the next three years, and it will have to
hire more than 200,000 workers to do that. Currently, new stores
open on the average of one every 43 hours. No problem, says Home
Depot. Thanks to a new automated procedure, the retailer has turned
the hiring process into a near-science. (Bond, Atlanta

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of
naval history, the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley has been
buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor _ lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time _ one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will
direct the excavation of the submarine in a state-of-the-art
laboratory at the old Charleston Navy Yard. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    Diet? Exercise? We set our own rules
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a nation that just seems to keep getting fatter,
the South is claiming an ever-larger piece of the pie. And the
reasons may be rooted as much in the attitudes Southerners have
about being overweight as in their diets and exercise patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll conducted for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found
that, while Southerners are significantly more likely than other
Americans to acknowledge that they themselves are overweight, they
are less likely to agree with national guidelines defining what
being overweight means _ and they certainly don't listen to most
government recommendations on eating healthfully and staying fit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll:
</P>
<P>
   Southerners are unlikely to exercise on most days.
</P>
<P>
   They do not eat enough of the right kinds of foods to meet
federal dietary standards.
</P>
<P>
   They believe overweight people face discrimination in daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   They are significantly more likely than other Americans to blame
their own bad habits for being overweight, rather than genetics or
other factors they can't control.
</P>
<P>
   The poll responses help explain why, when it comes to weight and
diet, the South is on the leading edge of a negative trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that there are regional patterns in the
prevalence of obesity,'' said Deborah Galuska, an epidemiologist in
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of
nutrition and physical activity. ``And there is higher prevalence,
in general, in the South and Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Overweight is a national problem. In a special issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association published last October,
the CDC reported that more than half of all Americans over 18 _ 63
percent of men and 55 percent of women _ could be considered
overweight and, therefore, at risk for heart disease, high blood
pressure, diabetes, gall bladder disease and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of obesity also was rising: In 1998, 18 percent
of the population qualified as obese. In Georgia, the obesity rate
doubled between 1991 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners are noticing our weight problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have really seen a difference since I moved here,'' said
Rashida Coleman, who is originally from California. ``In fact,
people tell me I should put on weight.'' The 23-year-old, who
participated in the survey, considers herself slightly underweight
and works out only occasionally ``for fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 46 percent of Southerners who were
interviewed felt they were ``slightly overweight'' or ``moderately
to seriously overweight''; in other regions, only 39 percent of
respondents felt the same. And those numbers may be under-reporting
the problem because Southerners, in contrast to the rest of the
country, have a looser definition of what overweight means.
</P>
<P>
   The poll asked how much extra weight an average person would
have to carry to be considered unhealthfully fat. Those outside the
South put the upper limit at 33 pounds for women and 36 pounds for
men; Southerners allowed 36 pounds for women and 40 pounds for men.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the extra weight coming from?
</P>
<P>
   Southerners who participated in the poll agree that eating well
is a challenge. Jodi Lynn Cash, 33, of Dallas, Ga., owner of
Dallas/Millennium Metal Inc., a construction company, watches his
diet carefully to keep trim enough for work. On the road, that can
be a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover probably half the U.S., and when you go into some
towns, you find they've rolled up the sidewalks at 8:30 p.m.,'' he
said. ``Then you're stuck with a Waffle House, or some late night
fast food chain. When you have a chance to get a home-cooked meal,
or some type of vegetable meal, on the road, you have to take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra King, a 38-year-old mother of two who works full time,
fights her schedule to be sure she eats well. Recently divorced,
she has recruited her 17-year-old daughter to help cook wholesome
meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do try to think about eating in a healthy way, because there
are health issues in my family,'' she said. ``But I eat out at
lunch, I get home at 6 or 7 p.m., so I'm eating late in the
evening, and then I don't have time to exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Southerners may be heftier than other Americans, but they're
clear about why their weight is rising: Fifty-six percent of poll
respondents in the South agreed that overweight comes from ``bad
diet and exercise habits,'' compared with 49 percent of those
elsewhere. And 80 percent of Southerners felt that fat people
``should take responsibility for their own health and lose
weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to see someone who's overweight. It seems like a
shame that they are shortening their life,'' said Jim Stricklin,
54, of Marietta, Ga. His family hails from rural Alabama; he was
raised in New York, but returned south 25 years ago. Summers spent
on his grandparents' farm kept him acquainted with the Southern way
of eating _ ``There wasn't a meal I can think of that didn't have
something deep-fried,'' he said _ but he and his wife, Laura, have
evolved a healthier style instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical breakfast for me is two fruits and a bagel, and
lunch is soup and a salad,'' he said. ``I work out five days a week
in a health club. I am in better shape now than I was in the Air
Force 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Among respondents to the Southern Poll, the Stricklins _ who
work out together on the weekends, often riding their bikes on a
trail near their house _ are extraordinary. According to the
findings, Southerners do not exercise often, and compared with
residents of other regions, Southerners are less likely to eat
dairy products or significant amounts of fruits and vegetables.
Despite those differences, Southerners are as likely as most
Americans to consider themselves to be in excellent or very good
health.
</P>
<P>
   But three out of every 10 Southerners polled said they never
exercise; another two out of 10 exercise one to two days a week.
All told, half the Southern poll respondents do not meet the
minimum goal established by health authorities of 30 minutes of
exercise at least three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners who were asked to estimate what they eat in an
average day came up similarly short of national recommendations.
Almost half the Southerners _ 46 percent _ said they eat no dairy
products or had one serving at most. In the rest of the country,
the proportion of those eating very little dairy-based food was 29
percent. The federal dietary recommendation is two to three
servings of low-fat dairy products a day.
</P>
<P>
   And although the vegetable plate is a Southern icon, almost
one-third of Southerners said they ate no fruit or vegetables on an
average day or consumed one serving at best. In the rest of the
country, only one of every five people eat one or fewer servings
per day. At the other end of the spectrum, one of every four
Southerners said they ate four or more vegetable servings on
average, compared with one-third of other Americans. The national
recommendation is five servings of fruit or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners and non-Southerners scored roughly the same in the
amount of meat, fish or eggs they eat: Nine of 10 eat up to three
servings of animal protein a day, one more than is called for in
national dietary goals.
</P>
<P>
   In one area, Southern health practices outshine the rest of the
country: Southerners are much less likely to drink unhealthy
amounts of alcohol. According to the poll, 63 percent of those in
the South never drink at all, compared with 51 percent of those
outside the South. Only 15 percent of Southerners drink on more
than two days of an average week; outside the South, it's 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners think overweight people carry a social stigma _ but
still want them to take responsibility for their health. More than
three-fourths agreed that obese people face discrimination, and 68
percent thought that wider seats in airplanes and theaters would be
a helpful gesture.
</P>
<P>
   But Southerners aren't willing to be too helpful: Asked whether
obese people should be allowed to park in handicapped spaces or be
given other ``special accommodations,'' 73 percent said no.
</P>
<P>
   With overweight so prevalent, Southerners are likely to have
friends or family members who have struggled with extra poundage.
Combine that with compassion for personal failings, and with
Southern rituals of hospitality, and the reasons for our weight
problem become clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have family members who are larger, and so when you
have people close to you who are like that, you will tend to be
more accepting of other people that you see,'' King said. ``It goes
back to that sense that, if you were overweight, it meant you ate
well, and that meant you had enough money to provide for your
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we like to eat,'' she added, chuckling. ``That may be one
of the main reasons why we have this problem: We just enjoy food.''

BUSH VOWS TO APPEAL TO DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS IN CONVENTION
SPEECH 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Gov. George W. Bush said Saturday that in his
speech to the Republican National Convention he would go out of his
way to break through party lines and make a direct appeal to
Democrats and independents.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bush said he was determined for the country to
see that he is inclusive. Mindful, perhaps, that this pitch beyond
his party could be unsettling to conservatives, Bush said his
remarks would be subtle _ but unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a sentence in the speech that looks in the camera
and says, `I want you!''' said Bush, speaking from Joplin, Mo.,
where he was wending his way through key states that voted for
President Clinton four years ago. ``But the speech itself should do
that. The speech, if it's done right, and I think it will be, will
send a broadened message.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he said, he would tell the nation about the late Bob
Bullock, a Democrat who was his former lieutenant governor in Texas
with whom he had forged such a close working relationship that
Bullock endorsed him for re-election. He also said he had no
intention of criticizing Hillary Rodham Clinton, a favorite target
at Republican gatherings, saying that the convention was not the
proper forum for attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans gathered here Saturday for the convention's
opening on Monday, Bush said he realized that the usual suspense
may be gone because he has already announced that Dick Cheney is
his running mate. He also said that he had instilled an ``iron-fist
rule'' to make sure there is a harmonious show for the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Bush defended his decision to keep some
hard-edged conservatives off stage, saying there were ``no slights
intended.'' He explained that he was determined to avoid a
repetition of the scene at the Houston convention in 1992, which is
remembered not for his father's re-election drive but for the
divisive speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people said the '92 convention set a negative tone
and that it set a divisive message for the country,'' Bush said.
``I didn't see it that way at the time. People felt it was part of
a dismal political year. This is a different time, a different
approach, in the sense that we are trying to limit the amount of
time that elected officials are speaking relative to the amount of
time that we spell out policy.'' He added: ``This is not a divisive
moment. This is a uniting moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush acknowledged that all the happy talk could limit the
drama _ and the public's interest in the convention. Asked about
the possible lack of excitement, he laughed and said: ``That's a
pretty legitimate question. I hope, I think, if there is any
suspense it will be in the rollout of ideas. Hopefully, people will
be interested in what I have to say. I hope we can get enough
people to pay attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican presidential candidates have sought to reach
beyond their own party; in fact, they have needed to win over
independents to capture the White House. Bob Dole four years ago
declared in his acceptance speech, ``The Republican Party is broad
and inclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush advisers made clear that the governor intends to go
much further than Republicans have in the past, especially in
appealing to Democrats. To drive that message home, Bush will be
introduced at the convention by Bullock's widow, Jan.
</P>
<P>
   And all week long, the stage will be filled with women and
minorities, faces that are not usually highlighted at Republican
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's effort is reminiscent of what Bill Clinton did in his
acceptance speech in 1992. ``The choice we offer is not
conservative or liberal,'' Clinton said. ``In many ways it's not
even Republican or Democratic. It is different. It is new. And it
will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said in the interview that he would emphasize how he had
worked with Democrats. ``One of the things that people don't really
know about me is that I've been good about bringing people together
to get things accomplished in Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would not speak directly about how important it was in his
speech on Thursday night to convey to the American people that he
is ready to be president. ``It's hard for me to answer because I
literally don't pay attention to a lot of these polls and focus
groups,'' he said. ``But to the extent that people wonder whether I
can speak before a national audience and speak from my heart _
hopefully the speech will answer that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said his ability to impose an ``iron-fist
rule'' on who can speak and who cannot and limit dissension was
``an indication of the Republican Party's desire to win.'' Taking
issue with conservatives and many members of Congress who were not
invited to speak, he said: ``Not everybody's going to be given a
speaking role because of the limitation in time. There's room for
many voices in our party.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: It's a dog, dog, dog, dog world
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ This past week, I broke my long-standing rule.
To wit:
</P>
<P>
   You have to take all the dogs God sends you.
</P>
<P>
   I still believe, as I have for some years, that dogs are our
guardian angels. Of course, dogs go to heaven. That's where they
come from, sent down to Earth to watch over us.
</P>
<P>
   As best as I can figure, God must think I need a whole lot of
watching.
</P>
<P>
   We have eight dogs, all of which came from either the side of
the road or the pound. They are:
</P>
<P>
   _ John the Dog, named for John the Baptist, due to his
propensity early on to go wandering in the wilderness, boy dogs
being boy dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut Patty, a cocker-sheltie mix, who joined our family after
retiring as the Humane Society's pet-therapy pooch that visited in
nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buster Black, a Jack Russell terrier that looks more like a
Jack Rabbit terrier, what with the Chihuahua ancestry of his ears.
I found Buster under the overpass. I whistled and he came right to
me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maggie Baxter, a shaggy dog right out of a Disney movie. My
wife found her on Thanksgiving night during a sleet storm, sitting
forlornly beside a for-sale sign in the front yard of an empty
house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jag Wire, a small Schnauzer that's our only dog with a
recorded pedigree, complete with official papers when we adopted
her from the animal shelter _ deeply grieved at the time because
her owners had given her up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beauty, a Catahoula cow dog that came to us as a tiny puppy
from a poor family that couldn't afford to care for her. It's not
for nothing she's called a cow dog. That's about the size she's
grown to.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lily, a red-bone hound that's even bigger than Beauty. My wife
found her on the steps of the church house _ thus her name, Lily of
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last and least in size, Lamp Chop, my laptop miniature poodle,
that was little more than a giant-size hair ball matted with grass
burrs when we spotted her lost and alone on a downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   And then, briefly, there was Roscoe, who turned up last week,
crying in the night like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   So much like a baby, in fact, that one of my daughters and her
husband, visiting here with their six-month-old son, went out
before dawn to investigate, thinking someone had abandoned a child.
</P>
<P>
   They found, instead, a tiny beagle-terrier mix about 12 weeks
old, hollering its heart out for someone to help him.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter decided to call him Roscoe, a name that she picked
for no particular reason, but it seemed to fit him just fine, thank
you.
</P>
<P>
   She shampooed him clean of fleas, fed him puppy chow and warm
milk and took him to the vet for a check-up.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no way she could keep him. She already responsible
for a baby, a dog, a cat and a husband, pretty much in that order.
That's enough, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I have no ambition to field a baseball team of dogs.
Eight is enough.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that Roscoe has gone to live with my friend Ricky. He
was an easy sell.
</P>
<P>
   Roscoe looked at Ricky. Ricky looked at Roscoe. Roscoe's eyes
brightened up. Ricky's misted over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of the little dog I had as a boy,'' Ricky
sniffed. Roscoe sniffed, too, at Ricky's leg.
</P>
<P>
   They went home together, the two of them meant for each other.
</P>
<P>
   As best as I can figure, maybe God got the address wrong. It
could happen to Anybody.

 PHILADELPHIA: our party.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush brushed aside criticism from some moderates that his choice
of Cheney underscores that he is more concerned with burnishing his
credentials on the right. ``To the extent that there's people out
there carping,'' he said, ``that's just normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was not worried that in picking a running mate
with far more government service he would draw a contrast to his
own lack of national experience. ``I'm a secure enough fellow to
understand that picking a very strong candidate like Dick Cheney is
the right thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to say how serious he had been about turning to a
running mate who backed abortion rights, like Gov. Tom Ridge of
Pennsylvania or Gov. George Pataki of New York. ``I considered a
lot of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was not worried about advisers who have warned that
the campaign is missing a prime opportunity by not sharply
attacking Democrats on stage. ``I will needle my opponent but we
don't have a let's-tear-down night or a slash-and-burn night, or a
night that subjects the other side to public ridicule,'' he said.
``And I'm not going to talk about Mrs. Clinton. She is running for
the United States Senate and has her hands full in the great state
of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also sounded defiant about the criticisms that he has
relied on his father, the former president, for guidance in picking
Cheney and in making other decisions. Bush is clearly taking the
offensive on that count, and said that in his acceptance speech he
planned ``to say how much I love my family _ how much I respect my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush can afford to be so upbeat because many Republicans said
they had not seen such a united party since President Ronald
Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen since '84 this degree of unity and enthusiasm
through the ranks left and right of our party,'' said Sen. Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky. ``We're hungry for victory like the
Democrats were in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock, executive director of the Missouri Republican
Party, said the tone of this convention was strikingly different
from ones of the past. ``The goal for the past ones was to come out
unified,'' he said. ``And now we already have that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign and the convention planners took great care to
make sure that when viewers tune in they will see only harmony on
stage _ and a message of moderation and inclusion. People familiar
with the discussions said that while there was no choice but to let
Sen. John McCain speak, given that he emerged from his losing
primary fight with a considerable following, the Bush campaign did
not want its message delivered by more conservative, and perhaps,
outspoken party members, like Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in an interview, insisted that he was not offended. ``In
terms of speaking, realistically, how many people are going to
listen unless you're William Jennings Bryan?'' He said Bush's
acceptance speech ``towers over everything else'' and any other
speech delivered this week. Moreover, Forbes said he was reassured
by Bush's decision to pick a conservative as his running mate.
``His choosing Cheney speaks volumes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans inside and outside the campaign said that since
there is no longer any suspense about a running mate, but far the
most attention will be on Bush's speech. It will be the first time
for millions of Americans to get a close look at Bush _ and for him
to appeal beyond the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Michael K. Deaver, who was President Ronald Reagan's image
consultant, said Bush has much the same challenge that his boss had
in 1980 at the convention in Detroit, when he used his speech to
reassure the public that he had the breadth and command to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan was a likable guy, people genuinely had a positive
impression of him through Hollywood and through his governor's
days,'' Deaver said. ``But they really weren't sure this guy had
any depth or any original thoughts. That impression began to change
with the speech he gave. Bush is in a similar position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers have sought to play down how much of a
political lift they will get from the convention. They note that
polls show that Republican voters are already much more
enthusiastic about their candidate than Democrats are about Gore _
so they have less room to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, said of
Gore: ``I think he'll get a bigger bounce out of the convention
than we will. There's very little more we can gain by consolidating
our base.'' Asked how much Bush might gain in the polls, he said:
``You can pick up 4 or 5 points. Our view is that he's going to
essentially get twice the bounce out of the convention than we're
going to. We're going to find ourselves in a very tight race after
Labor Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rove said he did not see any one particular issue defining the
contest. ``We're in an environment where several issues matter,''
he said. ``Reducing Social Security, national defense _ we're not
in an election where the race is dominated by one overriding
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not worried about Pat Buchanan, the conservative
who is expected to run as the Reform Party nominee, drawing votes
from Bush. ``He's something always to watch, but he is
diminished,'' Rove said. ``He's not grown in stature or grown in
impact as the years have gone on. Why? Because he's Pat Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign and Bush's supporters do not seem worried that
McCain will try to upstage the nominee when he speaks at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he looks like he's a spoiler in some fashion against George
Bush,'' said Pat Robertson, the founder of the Christian Coalition
and a foe of McCain's, ``it will destroy him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is clearly delighting in this opportunity to be glorified
all week by his party. Asked what will be the convention's best
moment, he referred to his speech, saying, ``It's when, from my
selfish perspective, it's walking out on that stage.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TRADES ARE SYMPTOM OF BASEBALL'S INEQUITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a little general manager in every sports fan. If you
don't think so, check out the ravers and the ranters, the schemers
and the dreamers, on talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   While weaving through traffic, these people call up and propose
the most outrageous trades. Someday soon I fully expect to hear a
collision live on WFAN radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawg, what about Clay Bellinger and Wilson Delgado for Edgar
Martinez? That seems fair to me. I mean, the Yankees need a better
DH. (sounds of shearing metal and shattering glass). Oops, Dawg,
gotta go. I just rear-ended a Beamer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with both hands on the wheel and both eyes on the road,
fans love trades, except when their own favorite player is exiled.
Then it gets personal.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget the morose sound of our third child,
muttering, ``It stinks, it just stinks'' when the Mets traded his
scuzzy idol, Lenny Dykstra, for a mope named Juan Samuel. It turned
out to be the third-worst trade in Mets history (right behind the
ones that ditched Nolan Ryan and Amos Otis), and it is a safe bet
the Mets are not promoting that blatant miscalculation among the 10
greatest moments in history on Old-Timers Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, when old-timers lumber back for their reunions,
most of them feel withdrawal pangs from the way they left in the
first place _ some sheepish clubbie sidling over to them and
whispering, ``Hey, could you see the GM out in the hallway?''
</P>
<P>
   There have always been trades, so try as I might I cannot work
up severe bombast about the assorted comings and goings the past
few days.
</P>
<P>
   When players like Curt Schilling and Mike Bordick start flying
around in the closing hours of the baseball trading period, it just
seems like business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The rich get richer; what else is new? The Arizona Diamondbacks
now go into the postseason throwing Randy Johnson and Schilling in
every series. Schilling won his first start Friday night and
chortled more about his double than his pitching.
</P>
<P>
   It seems downright unfair for a first-place team to be able to
afford a horse like Schilling. However, the real inequity in
baseball stems from the division of local television revenue,
according to a recent so-called blue-ribbon panel. (Just what is a
blue-ribbon panel? Is that like the first prize in the breeder pig
category at the county fair?)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, these blue-ribbon experts determined that baseball was
operating with a tilted table because the Yankees realized $175.94
million in so-called local revenues while the Expos were pulling in
only $11.97 million in local revenue.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Yankees were twirling their gold chain like a
latter-day Sportin' Life in ``Porgy and Bess,'' crooning, ``There's
a jet that's leaving soon for New York,'' trying to lure Rondell
White from the destitute denizens of La Belle Provence.
</P>
<P>
   Weak teams cough up expensive players this time of year. Get
used to it. Then there is the sad drama of useful players caught in
the crossfire. No doubt Mets fans are mourning the exile of Melvin
Mora, the soulful utility man who was shuttled off to barren
Baltimore in the rent-a-shortstop move for Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Mora. He loves New York, loves Bobby Valentine, loves the
Mets, and now he has been dealt to the latter-day 25-man, 25-cabs
ice age of the Orioles, the most sour and solipsistic rich team on
the face of the earth, in the last decade or two of the Cal Ripken
era.
</P>
<P>
   But as the man said in the movie, there's no crying in baseball
_ and no loyalty in sports. Certainly not at those prices.
Disloyalty runs both ways. Players bolt teams. Teams discard
players. And the fans would trade anybody, too. Just listen to
them.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like a sharp elbow in the nose of Phillies fans to
unload Schilling with more than two months left in a season, but
where were the Phillies going, anyway? Besides, teams have come
back from the bitterness of these late-July discount sales.
</P>
<P>
   It was only three years ago that the Chicago White Sox divested
themselves of just about their entire pitching staff. Words like
``travesty'' and ``contempt'' were bandied about, some of them in
this very space. The White Sox management was spitting in the face
of its fans, cutting the payroll, cheating the ticket-holders. All
of the above. Yet these are the very same White Sox who are so far
ahead of Cleveland that the Indians themselves were making deals
just to prove they exist.
</P>
<P>
   Or, what about the Seattle Mariners? They have survived twin
disasters. This is the second anniversary of the vanishing of Randy
Johnson, a spectral presence in the Mariners' dugout one inning, on
a jet to the National League the next inning.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Ken Griffey Jr. left the Mariners in midseason,
although his uniform remained active until the final day of the
season. This year Junior is presiding over the downfall of the
Reds. Meanwhile, the Mariners are once again in first place, using
good young players obtained in the Johnson deal, and hoarding money
from Junior's departure that they will try to use to retain Alex
Rodriguez, probably in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the moment, Seattle is competitive. This year is all
that matters. In the long run, local revenue separates winners from
losers (except for the Orioles, of course). Lack of money does
indeed guarantee failure. We already knew that, long before the
blue-ribbon panel told us.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a typically foggy morning recently in Bodega Bay, a
fishing village along Highway 1 on the Northern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   The water was 52 degrees, and you could see your breath. A sign
at the Bodega Dunes Campground beach warned of dangerous undertow,
rocks and sharks. ``Surfing Unsafe,'' it read. ``No Lifeguard On
Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ones in the water were the seals and the sea lions _
and, of course, Dale Webster. Wearing a wetsuit with hood, boots
and gloves, he had been riding waves for a good two hours and now
sat straddling his board, surveying the swells rolling steadily
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was his wave. He leaned back and deftly pivoted his
board around. He gave a couple of quick paddles and sprang to his
feet. Sliding down the face of the glassy 4-foot wave, he began
dancing on it with the grace of Fred Astaire and rode it smack onto
the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Some beachcombers in jeans and windbreakers stared, but it was
just another day of surfing for Webster _ actually, his 9,067th
consecutive day of surfing, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, 51, has surfed every day since Sept. 2, 1975. It all
started, he said, when Bodega Bay was pounded with 15-foot waves
for a week straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surfed all seven days,'' he said, ``and then I thought, `Let
me see if I can keep this going.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And 25 years later, he's still going. As of Saturday, the streak
had reached 9,097. Webster intends to continue the streak until he
completes a 28-year lunar cycle, surfing the tides caused by the
moon in all its calendar phases. He will not be happy, he said,
until he can reuse his original 1976 tide chart book in February
2004, when the days of the week will fall on the same calendar
dates as they did in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Other quirky personal goals and theories help fuel his streak.
For example, 1976 was a leap year in which February had five
Sundays. He surfed each of them and hung five _ draped five toes
over the front of the board's nose _ on the final Sunday, Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on hanging five again on Feb. 29, 2004,'' he said.
``That's called hanging 10 the hard way. Then I'll be the hyperbole
Sunday surfer.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as daily surfing streaks go, Webster is in a class of his
own, said Drew Kampion, a former editor at both Surfer and Surfing
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Webster _ actually, we call him Daily Wavester _ has a
whole different concept of longevity,'' said Kampion, the author of
``Stoked: A History of Surf Culture'' (General Publishing Group,
1997). ``I mean, surfing for a lunar cycle, no one's ever even come
close to that. It's just so far out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Local surfers here wear wet suits 5 millimeters thick
year-round. At the beginning of his streak, Webster bought an
O'Neill wet suit with a one-year warranty. Thereafter, every Sept.
2, he traded in his suit, worn out from daily use, for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of this, the company decided to give Webster wet
suits free, because he was such an advertisement for their
durability.
</P>
<P>
   And Webster caused the company to add a ``10,000-wave clause''
to its warranty, a maximum-use caveat prohibiting exchanges for all
suits subjected to unusually intense use. Dozens of shredded wet
suits hang in Webster's shed at home, a testament in tattered
neoprene to his streak.
</P>
<P>
   Webster himself, however, is anything but worn out. He has a
broad back, long stringy blond hair and piercing blue eyes that
focus on the horizon when he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up surfing in San Diego, and in 1973 he moved to Bodega
Bay, which is 75 minutes north of San Francisco (Alfred Hitchcock
filmed most of ``The Birds'' there). He now lives in Valley Ford
(population, 126), a dairy community near Bodega Bay. He works as a
custodian at Bodega Bay Elementary School, with a clear view of the
ocean from the parking lot where he parks his 1981 Toyota Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 10 years of his streak, Webster would ask
witnesses _ surfers, beachgoers, park rangers _ to sign his log
book to verify that they saw him surfing. His wife, Kaye, his
frequent surfing partner until she injured her knee in 1995, also
kept a diary. But often elements like storms or fog made witnesses
scarce. Sometimes people refused to sign, bewildered by the
request.
</P>
<P>
   His requirement for a daily surf session means riding at least
three waves regardless of height. His norm is about 20 waves in
roughly two hours. But some days, the weather can be brutal or the
waves almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Deterrents include the water temperature, which ranges from 48
to 58 degrees. Surfers have been killed by waves and sharks in the
area, and Webster said he once crossed paths with a 20-foot great
white.
</P>
<P>
   He has paddled out in hurricane force winds and surfed with
illnesses of all kinds, including the flu, sprains, cuts and
earaches. Once a kidney stone attack left him barely able to walk.
His wife carried his board, he surfed three waves and was then
taken to the hospital directly afterward. ``I had to crawl on the
beach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The surfing part was difficult enough, said Webster, who for
years had little money and no car. He relied on his wife, friends,
or else his thumb, to get to the beach. He supported his surfing
addiction with dozens of different menial jobs, quitting them when
they interfered with his surf sessions.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing interferes with his surf sessions. Not family. Not
geography. Not travel or vacations or dark of night.
</P>
<P>
   Since he cannot take vacations inland, he has never visited the
in-laws in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   When flying, he insists upon surfing beforehand. Once, on a trip
to Hawaii, he arrived on the Big Island of Hawaii in late afternoon
and found the water completely flat on the Kona coast. So he raced
back to the east coast and found some waves just before dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of all the things I'll have missed in life because of
this,'' he said. ``The only thing I'll have is the memory of riding
all those waves. When I'm out there watching the seals and sea
lions, and 30-inch salmon jumping, and I have all those waves to
myself, it's like my own personal Disneyland.''
</P>
<P>
   For surfers, Bodega Bay is Disneyland. The coastline there gets
consistent surf because it is exposed to ocean swells from all
directions, said Kampion, the editor and author who speaks of
Webster like a zen figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's this passionate, inspired guy who was looking for an aim
and a goal in his life and struck upon this,'' Kampion said. Then,
quoting the poet William Blake, he added: ``If a fool persists in
his folly, he can become wise. And this is making him a wise man.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, his consistency inspires others around him. Margo, his
daughter, 13, is entering the ninth grade and has never missed a
day of school.
</P>
<P>
   She has been surfing since she was 3, she said, standing next to
her dad recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``But not every day,'' she added looking down sheepishly at her
sneakers.

 &HT;    What plays well in Peoria might not play well here
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Never underestimate the importance of
the West to presidential candidates on the stump, especially when
reaching out to voters outside the West.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting wilderness, for instance, ``plays well in
California,'' said Michael Gizzi, a professor of political science
at Mesa State College, even if it might not win Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of directional drilling for electoral votes _ sink a
drill in the red-rock side of flyover country and hope to strike
gold in California or New York _ is a staple of national
campaigning. In some cases this year, though, the direction gets
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates often broach regional issues as
spin-offs of major national issues. Republican candidate George W.
Bush, for instance, says on his website that he favors elimination
of the estate tax ``to make it easier for private landowners to
pass their land, intact, from one generation to the next'' _ an
approach tailor-made for ranchers and farmers in the West and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has a horde of proposals aimed at
improving rural transportation and economies, all available on his
website, algore2000.com. Gore even pitches a program to put a kiosk
at every rest stop along interstate highways directing motorists to
interesting places off the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   As they hone their pitches, particularly on the Internet, the
major presidential candidates appeal to narrow constituencies while
trying to preserve their broad demographic attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore administration would move to increase the number of parks
and boost protections for threatened land while balancing the
environment and the economy, said Jano Cabrera from Gore
headquarters in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under a Gore administration,'' said Cabrera, ``American
families would have easy access to parks and open spaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's site, georgewbush.com, is less detailed than Gore's,
which might reflect differences over activist government.
</P>
<P>
   On urban sprawl, Bush says the challenges of land management are
best handled by state and local governments. Still, he advocates
putting $900 million into the Land and Water Conservation Fund,
with 50 percent of the money earmarked for state and local
programs. Bush also proposes a $50 million program for the states
to tap into encourage landowner protection of rare species.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, couldn't be reached on what
Bush's campaign would promise to western Colorado and the West in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tip-toes around the West's unique perspective of being a
major potential supplier of energy resources with his energy
policy, which calls for tax breaks for natural-gas production. The
proposal is weighed heavily toward other measures, such as tax
credits for the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says nothing on the subject of a national energy policy on
his site, but does attack Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., said a Bush
administration would pursue a different course than those of his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bush would come in with the idea that immigration
is not inherently evil,'' McInnis said, predicting that immigration
will be a campaign issue that strikes chords with Grand Valley
farmers, ranchers and fruitgrowers.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis praised Bush's proposal to separate the enforcement and
processing functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Under the current organization, ``People tend to get into a law
enforcement mode and be suspicious of everybody who comes in the
door,'' McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the subject of immigration, Gore spokesman Cabrera
referred to Gore's urging that Congress approve the judicial
nomination of Enrique Moreno of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has no position on Western water issues and for that
matter, neither does Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, though, ``is pretty well-known on his approach to these
types of ians support monument establishment and land-preservation
efforts, ``but a lot of people aren't comfortable with the process
that created it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such nuance tends to get lost in the polarizing influence of
presidential campaigns. McInnis, while eager to portray Gore as a
distant federal figure, concedes that the vice president ``has
espoused the right kinds of things some times.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether a candidate can strike the right chords remains to be
seen, Gizzi said.
</P>
<P>
   The election ``is a long way away, three and half months,'' he
said. ``It doesn't take a lot for a candidate to raise an issue at
some point.''

<P>
   It was a typically foggy morning recently in Bodega Bay, a
fishing village along Highway 1 on the Northern California coast.
</P>
<P>
   The water was 52 degrees, and you could see your breath. A sign
at the Bodega Dunes Campground beach warned of dangerous undertow,
rocks and sharks. ``Surfing Unsafe,'' it read. ``No Lifeguard On
Duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ones in the water were the seals and the sea lions _
and, of course, Dale Webster. Wearing a wetsuit with hood, boots
and gloves, he had been riding waves for a good two hours and now
sat straddling his board, surveying the swells rolling steadily
toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was his wave. He leaned back and deftly pivoted his
board around. He gave a couple of quick paddles and sprang to his
feet. Sliding down the face of the glassy 4-foot wave, he began
dancing on it with the grace of Fred Astaire and rode it smack onto
the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Some beachcombers in jeans and windbreakers stared, but it was
just another day of surfing for Webster _ actually, his 9,067th
consecutive day of surfing, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, 51, has surfed every day since Sept. 2, 1975. It all
started, he said, when Bodega Bay was pounded with 15-foot waves
for a week straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surfed all seven days,'' he said, ``and then I thought, `Let
me see if I can keep this going.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And 25 years later, he's still going. As of Saturday, the streak
had reached 9,097. Webster intends to continue the streak until he
completes a 28-year lunar cycle, surfing the tides caused by the
moon in all its calendar phases. He will not be happy, he said,
until he can reuse his original 1976 tide chart book in February
2004, when the days of the week will fall on the same calendar
dates as they did in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Other quirky personal goals and theories help fuel his streak.
For example, 1976 was a leap year in which February had five
Sundays. He surfed each of them and hung five _ draped five toes
over the front of the board's nose _ on the final Sunday, Feb. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on hanging five again on Feb. 29, 2004,'' he said.
``That's called hanging 10 the hard way. Then I'll be the hyperbole
Sunday surfer.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as daily surfing streaks go, Webster is in a class of his
own, said Drew Kampion, a former editor at both Surfer and Surfing
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale Webster _ actually, we call him Daily Wavester _ has a
whole different concept of longevity,'' said Kampion, the author of
``Stoked: A History of Surf Culture'' (General Publishing Group,
1997). ``I mean, surfing for a lunar cycle, no one's ever even come
close to that. It's just so far out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Local surfers here wear wet suits 5 millimeters thick
year-round. At the beginning of his streak, Webster bought an
O'Neill wet suit with a one-year warranty. Thereafter, every Sept.
2, he traded in his suit, worn out from daily use, for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years of this, the company decided to give Webster wet
suits free, because he was such an advertisement for their
durability.
</P>
<P>
   And Webster caused the company to add a ``10,000-wave clause''
to its warranty, a maximum-use caveat prohibiting exchanges for all
suits subjected to unusually intense use. Dozens of shredded wet
suits hang in Webster's shed at home, a testament in tattered
neoprene to his streak.
</P>
<P>
   Webster himself, however, is anything but worn out. He has a
broad back, long stringy blond hair and piercing blue eyes that
focus on the horizon when he speaks.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up surfing in San Diego, and in 1973 he moved to Bodega
Bay, which is 75 minutes north of San Francisco (Alfred Hitchcock
filmed most of ``The Birds'' there). He now lives in Valley Ford
(population, 126), a dairy community near Bodega Bay. He works as a
custodian at Bodega Bay Elementary School, with a clear view of the
ocean from the parking lot where he parks his 1981 Toyota Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 10 years of his streak, Webster would ask
witnesses _ surfers, beachgoers, park rangers _ to sign his log
book to verify that they saw him surfing. His wife, Kaye, his
frequent surfing partner until she injured her knee in 1995, also
kept a diary. But often elements like storms or fog made witnesses
scarce. Sometimes people refused to sign, bewildered by the
request.
</P>
<P>
   His requirement for a daily surf session means riding at least
three waves regardless of height. His norm is about 20 waves in
roughly two hours. But some days, the weather can be brutal or the
waves almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Deterrents include the water temperature, which ranges from 48
to 58 degrees. Surfers have been killed by waves and sharks in the
area, and Webster said he once crossed paths with a 20-foot great
white.
</P>

earaches. Once a kidney stone attack left him barely able to walk.

taken to the hospital directly afterward. ``I had to crawl on the

they interfered with his surf sessions.
</P>

DODGERS MAY CASH IN ON HEAVY PAYROLL INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-NOTEBOOK)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the days of a $100 million payroll, in other words last
season, seven of the nine teams with the highest payrolls reached
the playoffs. The Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles Dodgers
stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the way through this season, it is obvious that
the Orioles will again stay home, where they will languish for the
third successive season despite spending more money on their
payroll ($229 million) in that period than any team except the
Yankees ($246.5 million). For all of their lavish expenditures, the
Orioles have fizzled faster than a July 4 fireworks show in the
rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, on the other hand, present the appearance of a
contender and may finally gain some reward for their payroll
proclivities, which have made them No. 3 ($221.4 million) behind
the Yankees and the Orioles in this three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're in position to make a good run,'' General
Manager Kevin Malone said. ``We control our own destiny. We're
right where we need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers began play Saturday 2 1/2 games from first place in
the National League West and 2 1/2 games from the wild-card lead.
Since the end of the interleague portion of the schedule, they had
won 10 of 13 games and all four series they had played.
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of that stretch, they weathered news media
reports that if the Dodgers did not get to the playoffs this year
they would fire Davey Johnson as manager and try to replace him
with the San Francisco Giants' Dusty Baker, the manager of one of
the two teams ahead of them in the division race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a big payroll, you need to win,'' Johnson said.
``Anything else doesn't matter. I've dealt with that before.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson recently also had to deal with an incidence of
arrhythmia, which put him in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to make this work,'' he said of the team and
its chances of winning. ``I'm going to try not to let it kill me. I
don't want to be looking up; I want to be looking down.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to his position in life, but he could just as well
have meant the Dodgers' position in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are not generally viewed as strong a contender as
Arizona and San Francisco, but when given a decent team to work
with, Johnson has produced impressive results. His first team in
Los Angeles did not meet that criterion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year's team was basically a right-handed ballclub,'' said
Johnson, who was the Orioles' manager in their last two playoff
appearances. ``The bench was very weak. The bullpen was very weak.
And there was no depth or flexibility in any area. There were a lot
of middle infielders on the 40-man roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone made improvements in those areas during the off-season,
and some of the moves paid off in helping the Dodgers overcome a
raft of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had the kind of injuries last year that we've had
this year, I'd hate to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley, the power-hitting catcher, returned last week from
his second spell on the disabled list, this one for a fractured
thumb. Center fielder Devon White recently came back after missing
2 1/2 months with a partially torn rotator cuff. Third baseman
Adrian Beltre missed three weeks earlier in the season with a
strained hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, the No. 1 starter, and Jeff Shaw, the closer,
headed a long list of pitchers who have served time on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   The team's most important hitters, however, Gary Sheffield, Eric
Karros and Shawn Green, have remained healthy. Sheffield's bat, in
fact, has been especially healthy. Possibly headed for the best
season of his 12-year career, Sheffield went into Saturday's
schedule leading the major leagues with 34 home runs and had driven
in 87 runs with a .340 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's comfortable; he's at peace with himself,'' Malone said of
the outfielder who has often been an angry player. ``His wife has
had a positive impact on him, and he's grown spiritually.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said he has been impressed with Sheffield's versatility
as a hitter. ``He hits home runs, but when he needs a base hit, he
gets it,'' the general manager said. ``He can hit the ball the
opposite way. For a guy with his power he has tremendous bat
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield and friends have provided sufficient run production,
and the relief corps have given the Dodgers a sterling effort. As
with so many contenders, the team's playoff chances will most
likely fall on their starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has performed as a No. 1 starter should, compiling a 10-3
record with a 2.31 earned run average. Chan Ho Park, with an 11-7
record, seems to have straightened himself out after having gone a
month (June 18 to July 20) without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers need consistently effective work from Darren
Dreifort (3-0, 1.29 ERA last three starts) and Carlos Perez, as
well as Ismael Valdes, whom they reacquired from the Cubs last week
after having traded him to Chicago last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreifort has been brilliant at times and mediocre or bad at
times,'' Johnson said. ``Perez has been OK, kept us in some ball
games. You've got to get three out of five well-pitched games,
sometimes four out of five. That's what the good clubs do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have two months to show they belong in that
category. The Orioles have already proved they do not.

ANGELS' FIVE-MAN INFIELD; 3 FORMER METS IN TRADES; MAKING DEALS TO
CONTEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-DODGERS)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The box score suggested an image that simply didn't compute: Mo
Vaughn playing center field.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, next to Vaughn's name in the box of Anaheim's game in
Texas last Wednesday night was the position designation
``1b-cf-1b.'' And just two names later, it said ``G. Anderson
cf-1b-cf.'' That combination indicated that sometime during the
game Vaughn and Anderson switched positions.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, as it turned out. Several times this season, Mike
Scioscia, the Angels' manager, has brought in an outfielder to
serve as a fifth infielder in obvious sacrifice situations. In this
instance, Frank Catalanotto lashed a pinch-hit triple with one out
in the ninth inning of a 5-5 game. With Luis Alicea the next
batter, Scioscia called for his five-man infield.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson came in from center and assumed the first baseman's
position. Vaughn moved to his right, stationing himself near where
the second baseman usually plays. Adam Kennedy, the second baseman,
played up the middle. The shift turned out to be unnecessary;
Alicea hit a fly to left. Anderson went back to center, Vaughn to
first, but Rusty Greer singled to left, ending the game.
</P>
<P>
   3 FORMER METS IN TRADES
</P>
<P>
   They are all gone now, Jason Isringhausen, Bill Pulsipher, Paul
Wilson. At one time they were the future nucleus of the New York
Mets' starting pitching rotation. But injuries undermined that
plan, leaving the trio as prime examples why some contending teams
are not reluctant to trade top prospects for established
major-league players when they have a chance to get to the
playoffs. Prospects don't come with guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets sent Isringhausen to Oakland at the trading deadline
last year. They traded Pulsipher, for the second time, to Arizona
two months ago after having reacquired him from Milwaukee last
January. Wilson, who seemingly has been on perpetual rehab, was the
last to go, leaving the organization Friday in a trade to Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING DEALS TO CONTEND
</P>
<P>
   Teams are no longer considered set. They are works in progress,
contending teams every bit as much as less talented, less
experienced clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians came into this season with a string of
five division titles, but stuck 10{ games from No. 6, they
reconfigured 20 percent of their roster in a matter of hours
Friday. In a series of three trades, they added two starting
pitchers (Jason Bere and Steve Woodard), changed their closer (from
Steve Karsay to Bob Wickman) and acquired a first baseman (David
Segui) and a designated hitter (Wil Cordero).
</P>
<P>
   In a frenzy of trade activity, the Indians and two other playoff
contenders executed six trades involving 25 players Friday, and the
deadline for trades without waivers isn't until 4 p.m. tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Six other contenders had previously made moves to bolster their
chances. Prime among them were the Yankees, who have not been
satisfied to rest on the laurels of their World Series success in
recent seasons. Their acquisitions changed 16 percent of their
roster.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent newcomer, Glenallen Hill, won a game for them
Friday night with a pinch-hit grand slam. Another of their
reinforcements, Denny Neagle, has pitched two victories and would
have had three if the bullpen had held his lead Friday. Andy Ashby
has pitched three victories for Atlanta. Curt Schilling won his
first start for Arizona on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona, the defending champ, went out and got arguably the
best pitcher available,'' Davey Johnson, the Los Angeles manager,
said. ``I like Neagle and I like Ashby, but when healthy, Schilling
is the pick of the litter.''
</P>
<P>
   The most untimely trade of those made so far was the one between
the Indians and Milwaukee on Friday. In going to Cleveland, Wickman
left behind 30,000 posters of himself. They were to be given to
fans at the Brewers game Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mentioned it to Dean _ jokingly,'' Jon Greenberg, the
team's media relations director, said, referring to General Manager
Dean Taylor. ``But naturally baseball takes precedence.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, however, was undaunted. ``We'll give them away
anyway,'' he said. ``He was our All-Star.''

OUTDOORS: ATLANTIC SALMON IN NEW BRUNSWICK 
</HEADLINE>
   By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was early evening when my guide, Gerry Thomas, and I arrived
at Humbug Pool on the Upsalquitch River in New Brunswick. The river
was fairly low, low enough for wading. I eased myself over the side
of the canoe, not motivated by caution but by a desire to savor my
first Atlantic salmon fishing trip in the new century. It was also
hot and muggy, a day that courted languor.
</P>
<P>
   I had already tied on one of my favorite wet flies for salmon,
the venerable Blue Charm. I asked Gerry where he wanted me to
start, a ritualistic query because over the years we have fished
Humbug many times together. Then I waded halfway across the river,
enjoying the pressure of the cool water, 64 degrees, against my
legs. I had worked out about 70 feet of line when Gerry said,
``That's far enough, Nelson.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving downstream three or four feet after every cast, I was
soon rewarded with a solid hit. The take had been invisible, no
flash of a silver side, no burst of spray. The spray came later as
the grilse _ a precocious salmon, usually a male, that returns to
its natal stream after only one year at sea _ hurled itself into
the air three times as it surged up and down the pool.
</P>
<P>
   I am always surprised anew at the strength of a fish that
usually weighs no more than five pounds and startled by its
throbbing energy when I remove the fly from its jaw. We set it
free.
</P>
<P>
   Deep shadows covered most of the pool when I resumed fishing
with the Blue Charm, and I soon caught another grilse, which was
also released. In happier days, I would have kept both grilse, but
the Atlantic salmon is in trouble and one hesitates to diminish its
numbers. New Brunswick's current limits for the species allow an
angler to kill two grilse a day. The larger salmon, those that have
spent more than one year in the Atlantic, must be released.
</P>
<P>
   Back at our base at Two Brook camp, I discovered that my fishing
companion Peter Maas, who had gone downriver with the camp manager
and guide, Lee Marshall, had already returned. He was settled in
his favorite Two Brook armchair, drink in hand and looking
fulfilled, perhaps even gleeful. ``Two hits, two grilse,'' I said.
``How about you?''
</P>
<P>
   He rattled the ice in his glass and responded nonchalantly,
``Four grilse.''
</P>
<P>
   I congratulated him. I was sincere, but also slightly irked. We
both write for a living, but my realm is hunting and fishing, and
his books probe other thickets and other waters. Not discounting
his uncanny knack for being in the right place at the right time, I
should have at least a slight edge when salmon are the quarry. On
our previous visit to Two Brook, he had come behind me, fishing
pools where I had struck out a few hours before, catching salmon
and grilse with disconcerting consistency.
</P>
<P>
   I have never liked angling competitions, but Peter and I have
somehow become engaged in an informal and ongoing salmon fishing
contest.
</P>
<P>
   We were at Two Brook as the guests of Joseph Cullman III of
Manhattan. Cullman and his other guests _ Marian Heiskell and
Murray Bring of Manhattan and Joan Wulff of Lew Beach, N.Y. _ were
at Cullman's Runnymeade Lodge on the Restigouche River, into which
the Upsalquitch flows.
</P>
<P>
   Peter and I were back on the Upsalquitch early the following
morning. On our way upriver, Gerry Thomas and I passed a single hen
merganser with 21 ducklings, about double the normal brood for one
hen. She was at the rear of the frantic flotilla, which was
swimming and half-flying ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   We found a pool with several grilse in it and in less than an
hour I had hooked four of them, losing two and landing two, all
save one on the Blue Charm. That one, which I kept, had made three
passes at the Blue Charm, missing it each time, so I switched to a
dry, a Gray Wulff, and he was mine.
</P>
<P>
   Peter caught one grilse that morning. We made the hour's drive
to Runnymeade at midday to have lunch with the others. There we
learned that everyone had taken fish, whether salmon or grilse,
either on Runnymeade waters or on two stretches _ Main Pool and
Matapedia Run on the Restigouche _ controlled by the Ristigouche
Salmon Club. Marian Heiskell was ecstatic, having hooked and landed
two salmon at the Matapedia Run. As we lingered at our meal, dark
clouds piled up over the broad valley, bringing rain, torrential at
times, that lasted about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Peter and I drove to the Ristigouche Salmon
Club and the others of our party went to Two Brook. An
ever-attentive host, Cullman wanted each of us to have a shot at
all the available water.
</P>
<P>
   When Maas and I reached the highway bridge over the Restigouche
between New Brunswick and Matapedia, Quebec, I saw a long, wide,
brown stain, runoff from the storm, covering most of the area we
were to fish. Fishing for salmon in dirty water is usually a
worthless endeavor, and had I been alone I would have returned to
Runnymeade, and an afternoon's reading.
</P>
<P>
   We flailed the water until dark and the only fish we caught or
saw was a grilse that I took in the last half hour on a huge, ugly,
dirty-water wet fly, a cross between a Mickey Finn and an Edson
Tiger. The water was still somewhat discolored when we returned the
following morning and it was Peter's turn to catch the only fish, a
good-sized grilse.
</P>
<P>
   Cool weather moved in. Peter and I went back to Two Brook that
afternoon, and along with Joan Wulff, who loves the remote and
intimate Upsalquitch, we had some first-rate fishing that night and
the next day, our last. On the final morning I caught two grilse
and returned to camp to find Peter in the chair with an ice pack on
his swollen right knee. It had given way while he was wading
Caribou Pool. He had gone down facing upstream with water pouring
into his waders and was extricated from that position by his guide,
John Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   That evening, fishing different pools, Joan Wulff and I had fun
with both grilse and salmon that repeatedly slashed at our dry
flies, but didn't connect. Each of us muffed one good chance;
Joan's opportunity came while fishing a deer-hair mouse. Her
attention was diverted for an instant, the instant in which a
good-sized salmon engulfed the mouse, then rejected it. My
opportunity came when a nice grilse took my Royal Wulff, then spit
it out before I was able to tighten the line. My only excuse is
that having floated that fly over the same grilse more than 20
times, my attention had flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Peter had gamely limped back into the river that afternoon,
catching one grilse for a total of seven for the trip, one shy of
my effort.
</P>
<P>
   Rattling the ice in his drink that night, he said to me,
``You're top rod.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have added ``this time,'' but he didn't.

 &HT;    GOP SEES POSITIVE SPIN AS KEY TO VICTORY
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA Persuaded that the way to win in November is to
make nice in August, the Republicans have made a top-level decision
to curb their Democrat-bashing during their upcoming four-day
national
</P>
<P>
   convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 10 _ where a 10 would mean we'd ignore the other
party altogether and showcase only our own virtues _ we'll probably
come out here somewhere near an eight,'' GOP National chairman Jim
Nicholson said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have a positive image with the voters,''
Nicholson told reporters at a breakfast meeting. ``So it's vitally
important that this convention reflect that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson noted that, according to past polling, nearly 25
percent of U.S. voters said they decide which presidential
candidate they will support on Election Day based on the
impressions that they come away with _ both direct and indirect _
from the two major national political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The limited-bashing convention tactic also reflects the overall
campaign strategy that has been adopted by the Republicans'
presumptive presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. On
Thursday evening, Bush is scheduled to deliver an acceptance speech
that promises to be the most widely watched event at the Republican
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   In a interview on Friday with ABC's Nightline, Bush again
stressed his intention to run a positive campaign. He said he would
limit his attacks against his Democratic opponent, Vice President
Al
</P>
<P>
   Gore, to ``only those times and places where we're obliged to
counter-punch because (the Democrats) have distorted our positions
or our record.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision to tap former Defense Secretary Richard Cheney
as his running mate offers another signal that the Bush camp
believes it would be better off by adopting a positive message
during the fall
</P>
<P>
   campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In an approach that goes back to the 1952 Republican ticket of
Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, the former general took the
high road while Nixon took on the ``attack dog'' role against the
then
</P>
<P>
   incumbent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The convention tactics outlined by Nicholson stand in bold
contrast to what the Republicans did at their 1996 convention in
San Diego. On that occasion, for example, Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Tex., launched a
</P>
<P>
   vicious partisan attack against President Clinton, who was
seeking a second term.
</P>
<P>
   While her remarks played exceedingly well with the GOP partisans
in the convention hall, subsequent surveys showed that they tended
to alienate key swing voters who at the time were weighing whether
to
</P>
<P>
   support Clinton or the GOP nominee, former Sen. Bob Dole of
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush needs a positive convention,'' says Dick Morris, a former
Clinton political strategist who has also worked for Republicans.
``The GOP blew its 1992 convention by concentrating on attacking
Hillary
</P>
<P>
   Clinton. They screwed up their 1996 confab by lacing into her
husband. They need to avoid partisanship in Philadelphia at all
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to ``go positive'' in 2000, Nicholson said, is
that ``we have our political base locked down and the Democrat
Party does not.''
</P>
<P>
   If the party chairman's analysis is correct, it means that Gore
would have to make a major effort wooing such members of his core
constituency as blue-collar workers, who remain suspicious of the
</P>
<P>
   administration's trade policies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, on the other hand, would feel more free to stress issues
that appeal to swing voters, such as improving the nation's schools
and reforming Social Security.

 &HT;    Will Cheney's Western roots influence regional issues?
 &HT;    By Gary Harmon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ George W. Bush's selection of a
Westerner to be his running mate suggests greater national
involvement in parochial, Western issues, say political observers.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Dick Cheney, who spent 12 years in Washington,
D.C., as Wyoming's lone congressman, on the national Republican
ticket might mean ``some Western issues will get a little more air
time,'' said Pete Kolbenschlag, Western Slope director for the
Colorado Environmental Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   What happens after that, though, depends on the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbenschlag, for instance, would welcome greater federal
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, public-lands issues are really important and
unfortunately, they don't get a lot of attention in presidential
debates, which are dominated by more urban environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Gore, a Glade Park rancher, is banking on Cheney's
reputation to shore up traditional arm's-length Republican policy
toward Western issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that Bush is far better for
agriculture and ranchers of the West,'' Gore said. ``The best that
(Al) Gore could do is change his name, dammit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney crystallizes many of the strongest feelings in both
political parties, which is odd to Mike Strang, a Carbondale
rancher who served with him in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney had ``the best intellect of anybody in Congress with the
possible exception of Bill Archer,'' a Texas Republican. ``He's a
very thoughtful man and not an extreme person. He's not the
arch-Druid the press likes to make him out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Coler Wyoming congressman, Cheney can
provide that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the access,'' McInnis said. ``Even if I can get the most
strident Easterners, if I can just get an audience with them, we
always gain.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, though, isn't a proven vote-getter anywhere but Wyoming,
and ``in some ways, the Democrats have to be completely relieved''
by Bush's choice, said Michael Gizzi of the political science
faculty at Mesa State College.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad thing for the West to have a Western
candidate,'' but in Cheney, it has something else, Gizzi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cheney has become so enmeshed in politics that that
image just doesn't come into play. It would be a lot different if
he picked a Western governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney gives the Republican ticket something no one expects from
Wyoming, which reflects his most recent assignment in Washington,
D.C., as defense secretary, Gizzi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the foreign policy experience that a George W. Bush
would need,'' Gizzi said. ``The real question is how tied in is he
to the West after 25 years of national politics?''

SPORTS COLUMN: TWO STATUES BUT MYRIAD LESSONS TO ABSORB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.Y.)   By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is about statues, the one of Harold Connolly planned for
his old neighborhood in Boston and the one of Jackie Robinson and
Pee Wee Reese that doesn't seem to be growing in Brooklyn. I'm sure
there are universal historical, social and political issues in all
this, and if you find them, send them along. Why has
thelipsite(at)aol.com been overloaded lately with more paeans to
Mark Messier than to Linda Bensel-Meyers, the Tennessee
whistle-blower? Beats me.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to erect a statue of Jackie and Pee Wee was officially
announced last year by the administration of New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani after a campaign begun years ago by Stan Isaacs, then a
Newsday sports columnist. The financier and philanthropist Ted
Forstmann pledged the funding. A sculptor and a Brooklyn site have
yet to be named, in part because the city seems to have thought
that a press release was enough, in part because of a philosophic
disagreement over how the relationship of Jackie and Pee Wee should
be cast in stone.
</P>
<P>
   With two appealing young athletes usually described as ``black''
now standing astride America's signature white sports of golf and
tennis, it requires some effort to return to 1947, when Robinson
became the first recognized African-American to play major league
baseball. Robinson's debut was orchestrated by white men, most
importantly Branch Rickey, the Dodger general manager. While mostly
white business people will decide just how much Tiger Woods and
Venus Williams will earn from their talent, ambition and charisma,
the decision to place them in fame's way was not a white decision;
strong nuclear families, in particular visionary, risk-taking
fathers, set them on their paths and ran interference right to the
top.
</P>
<P>
   To properly appreciate this real progress, how much history do
we need to hang onto? One turning point in the Robinson epic,
nicely retold in Peter Golenbock's illustrated children's book,
``Teammates'' (Harcourt Brace, 1990), occurred early that first
season, in Cincinnati, not far from Pee Wee's Louisville home. As
Reds fans spewed hate onto the field, Pee Wee strolled over from
shortstop and put his arm on Jackie's shoulders. The white Dodger
captain was wordlessly saying, ``This black man is my teammate.''
The mostly white campaigners for the statue would like to
memorialize that gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow and the force behind the
educational foundation named for him, said last week that although
she appreciated the gesture, she would prefer a statue in which the
two players were depicted as ``equals.'' She remembered a
photograph in which they are leaving the field, shoulder to
shoulder, their hands almost touching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be more of a tribute to both of them,'' she said.
``There have been too many instances of a white person elevated at
the expense of a black person.''
</P>
<P>
   The statue of Harold Connolly, who won the 1956 Olympic gold
medal in the hammer throw, is to be erected on the grounds of
Brighton High School, where he played football despite a twisted,
foreshortened left arm crippled by a birth accident. So much of
Connolly's early life seemed to have been spent hiding the arm and
compensating for it.
</P>
<P>
   A former high school teacher who recently retired from a second
career as a Special Olympics executive, Connolly, who turns 69 on
Tuesday, has been writing his memoirs, mostly for his children. The
pages I've read about his left arm have been particularly candid
and moving. He writes: ``Concentrating on the Herculean effort of
raising my left arm up and sideways, I slowly placed my right hand
above her left hip and groped for her finger-tips with my
half-closed left hand. She, however, had to be the one who finally
took my limp hand into hers; and I became very much aware that she
knew and either felt repulsed or sorry for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was just dancing class. Connolly identifies himself as
``a handicapped person'' who ``knows the agony of all-out trying
and not accomplishing.'' After years of physical therapy as a
child, he writes: ``I began to consider myself a reject, chained to
a small army of twisted bodies in the hospital waiting room and
responded by trying to ignore my crippled associates. I wanted to
push myself into the `normal' society.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly paid his own way through college and to Europe to
compete, perfecting an explosive, spinning style that compensated
for his weak arm with speed and leg power. Defensive and shy, he
made himself into a fierce, sometimes ruthless competitor and
Boston's second gold-medal Connolly. A statue of James B. Connolly,
America's first Olympic champion, stands in South Boston, a rival
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Of his own statue, Harold Connolly says, ``I certainly hope my
left arm will be rendered realistically by the sculptor, as it
appears to others, not as it appears in my mind's eye, filtered to
look as much as possible to be the arm I wish it were.'' &QL;

   Most people don't sit down with statistical charts and decide on
the basis of the evidence what specter of death or calamity should
most fill them with dread. If they did, they would be pacing the
floor at night over cardiovascular disease. Clogged arteries and
bad hearts carry off nearly a million Americans a year, about as
many as all other diseases and disasters combined.
</P>
<P>
   But no. On some deep level, social researchers and psychologists
say, we choose as a society and as individuals from among an
endless menu of things that go bump in the night, what to fret over
and what to shrug off.
</P>
<P>
   Only neurotics tackle every item on the list, and only Alfred E.
Neuman of Mad magazine blithely ignores them all. But the things
that push the human panic button also have distinct patterns, the
experts say. The specters that haunted last week's news _ the crash
of the Concorde in France, the discovery of West Nile-infected
mosquitoes in New York's Central Park, the failed hijacking at
Kennedy International Airport _ were similar in one respect: They
were loaded with the mysterious freight of fright that can seize
us, whether it makes scientific sense or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``People climb mountains and expose themselves voluntarily to
all kinds of risks, but they don't like risk inflicted upon them
that they don't understand or have control over, like West Nile,''
said Dr. Roger E. Kasperson, director of a risk-study center at
Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden catastrophes like the Concorde crash tend to set human
nerves jangling even more. ``If you kill people one by one, people
tend to be very tolerant, but if you kill people in large numbers
in a single event, we don't like it,'' Kasperson said. ``Those
events are very scary and they get our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Our formulations of fear are also framed and focused, risk
analysts say, by the peculiarities of culture. The great
mythological symbol of America _ the lone-wolf individual, out
there challenging the world and all comers _ makes us devalue some
kinds of risks and elevate others. In surveys, most Americans say
they feel fairly safe in their cars, for example, because they feel
in control behind the wheel. They feel much less safe in planes,
because someone else is at the controls and passengers can't do
much about altering their odds. The fear persists even though
planes crash far less often than cars.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a contradictory mix of impulses that may be at
play, particularly in how people react to the West Nile virus and
the efforts to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Americans have not had to suffer the worst
effects of the world's most devastating wars, plagues and famines
of the last 100 years, they have a deep sense of optimism, and a
belief in the perfectibility of the world that risk experts say
plays heavily into the theater of fear. They tend to despise
fatalistic acceptance and believe that all problems probably have
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   If there are bad mosquitoes, that line of risk-management goes,
then let's wipe them out. But at the same time there's also a deep
strain of distrust toward experts and politicians who might purport
to know all the facts about fighting mosquitoes or the relative
safety of the pesticides used in the battle. The various
``right-to-know'' laws that have been passed in recent years,
covering everything from food ingredients to the known addresses of
sex offenders, all center on the idea that individuals are best
equipped to assess their own risk tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a paradox of our society,'' said Dr. Donald G. MacGregor,
a senior research associate at Decision Research, a private,
nonprofit research institute in Eugene, Ore., that studies public
perception of environmental health and safety. ``Our historical
perspective is that of the frontiersperson, but at the same time we
want structures to protect us so that while we're out there
practicing our frontier individualism we don't get hurt. We want
all the upside and we want to factor out the downside; we want 15
percent annualized return on our portfolios in the stock market,
but not take on any risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, the result is a three-corner misunderstanding that can
leave scientists, policy makers and ordinary people taking
completely different views of the same thing. Many Americans, for
example, routinely disregard the medical community's constant
refrain about the dangers of unprotected sex. On the other hand,
many people remain deeply anxious about nuclear energy, even though
from a strictly technical analysis, scientists say, it is probably
one of the safest, cleanest ways to generate electricity ever
devised.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers say that while they must occasionally fight the
impulse to write off ordinary people as fools, they also sometimes
find that the lay individual's assessment of risk, while perhaps
not strictly rational, has something that mere numbers cannot
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often the public is onto something,'' said Dr. Elizabeth L.
Anderson, the former director of risk assessment for the federal
Environmental Protection Agency, now an environmental science
consultant in Washington. ``But you can't get lost in the public
perception and lose what the science informs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   What seems risky is also often no accident or happenstance of
evolutionary psychology. Risk has its hangers-on, a kind of
infrastructure of anxiety, that includes various special-interest
groups trying to shape the public sense of risk to suit their own
agendas, as well as media organizations and politicians that
sustain themselves with anxiety's bracing energies.
</P>
<P>
   The public debate over smoking is considered, in risk-management
circles, a premier case in point. For years, the American Cancer
Society's preachy message that people should stop smoking for the
sake of their health mostly didn't work. It was rejected because it
ran up against the American credo of personal control: that an
individual's decision to smoke was an act of free will and no one
else's business. Only when the risks were reframed, centering
instead on the dangers of passive, second-hand smoke that resulted
from someone else's actions, did clean-air and indoor smoking laws
become common.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe these changes happen by themselves,'' said Dr.
M.V. Rajeev Gowda, a professor of public policy at the University
of Oklahoma who studies how people and societies make decisions
about risk. ``Everything involved here has a political
interest-group dimension to it, and part of their effort is to
capture the framing.''
</P>
<P>
   And some players just want a piece of the action. Howard
Rubenstein Associates, for example, the big New York public
relations firm better known for representing high-gloss
celebrities, began calling reporters last week with a whispered tip
about a new turn in the virus story: a mosquito, infected with West
Nile, that apparently feeds during the day, had just been
discovered by researchers at Fordham University. The researchers
themselves were a bit more circumspect; they are not sure yet how
common their new mosquito, Aedes japonicus, is, how well it
transmits the virus, or whether it even bites people.

PRO BASKETBALL NOTEBOOK: HORNETS' JONES EXPECTED TO JOIN THE HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   He almost had Juwan Howard four years ago, but the league voided
the deal and sent Howard back to Washington. At different
junctures, Pat Riley was also on the verge of bringing Mitch
Richmond and Latrell Sprewell to Miami, only to see his grand
pursuit of talent end in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in the last four years, Riley, the Heat
president and coach, finally seems to be homing in on adding an
All-Star caliber player to his athletically challenged roster.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jones will very likely be headed to South Florida in the
next few days, an Eastern Conference team official said Friday
afternoon on the condition of anonymity. Jones is hoping to leave
Charlotte in a sign-and-trade deal that would bring Jamal Mashburn
and Clarence Weatherspoon to the Hornets in exchange for the
All-Star shooting guard and Charlotte's Ricky Davis, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors could hold up the deal, including a deadline of
Friday night imposed by Jones on the club last week to work out an
arrangement with the Heat. But Jones only appeared to be killing
his own leverage with the ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than reap the maximum allowable contract the Heat can
offer him _ roughly $86 million over seven years _ Jones would have
two options: Take another team's $2.25 million exception with the
unwritten promise that he would be compensated after next season,
or sign for the maximum with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The other potential holdup may be David Falk, Jones' agent.
According to the official, Falk is scheming up a pitch for the
Bulls, who have $19 million in salary-cap space but little talent
after most of the league's top-tier free agents spurned them the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   If Falk's plan comes to fruition, the official said, the Bulls
would acquire Jones and Glen Rice to fill their vacancies at small
forward and shooting guard and keep United Center ticket revenues
from spiraling into the abyss.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets need to clear more cap room to complete the
transaction with the Heat. They need a third team with a salary-cap
exception to take a player such as Brad Miller in order to make
sure Jones gets the maximum deal.
</P>
<P>
   Riley was vehement about not losing two starters in a deal for
Jones, which helps explain why he refused to part with both
Mashburn and P.J. Brown. But he is getting antsy for a player who
can help elevate his team past the Knicks and the Indiana Pacers in
the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Before the second-round series against the Knicks last May, he
was asked if the well-traveled rookie Anthony Carter fit into the
Riley mold of role players he has coached in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love these kind of guys with big hearts,'' Riley said. ``But
I'd also like to get some big talent one of these days, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Magic a Big Winner
</P>
<P>
   With free agents able to sign Tuesday, Orlando appears to be the
big winner in the summer sweepstakes. Procuring Grant Hill and
Tracy McGrady _ and possibly Maurice Taylor _ should make the Magic
a bona fide playoff threat again.
</P>
<P>
   But its chances of competing immediately for a championship were
severely dimmed when Tim Duncan chose to stay in San Antonio, where
the All-Star center is expected to sign a three-year deal with a
fourth-year option totaling more than $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the Magic acquired one of the top-five players
in the game along with one of the most breathtaking young players.
If Taylor agrees to a deal in the next few days _ he is still
hedging and may wind up in Indiana, which has a $4.3 million
exception to offer him _ coach Doc Rivers has another great
offensive player to put on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   NBC even went so far as to include 10 regular-season Magic games
on their 2000-01 network schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Peel back the facade, though: John Amaechi, still learning the
game, is Orlando's center. Hill is coming off major foot surgery.
Neither he nor McGrady has yet to win a playoff series. For all his
ability, Taylor is coming over from the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic has some nice pieces and will be tremendously
entertaining. But after the oodles of cash were doled out, the
Magic still has some gaping holes, the kind only Duncan could have
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, general manager John Gabriel did his best to secure the
pick of the litter over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   If Eddie Jones ends up in Miami, the Chicago Bulls have to go
down as the major disappointment of the summer. Ron Mercer, Derek
Anderson or _ who knows? _Isaiah Rider may be their big
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a particularly rough off-season for general manager
Jerry Krause, whose promise to rebuild the franchise may have to
wait yet another season. After enduring two years of the draft
lottery, you wonder if Bulls fans can deal with another dismal
season after six championships in the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top free agents next season is Chris Webber, a power
forward. In Elton Brand and the recently drafted Marcus Fizer, the
Bulls have a surplus at the position.
</P>
<P>
   After Hill and McGrady committed themselves to Orlando, the
Bulls seemed to have their heart set on Milwaukee forward Tim
Thomas. But he deftly used Chicago for leverage, securing a maximum
contract from the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a still chance that Jermaine O'Neal will be dealt to
Chicago for a combination of players that may include the rookie
point guard Jamal Crawford. But that remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   If Krause does not shock everyone with a blockbuster deal over
the next two months _ given his cunning and savvy in the past, it's
not an impossibility _ the post-Michael-and-Scottie Bulls are
headed in the same direction as the powerhouse Celtics of the
1980s. Boston is still searching for a playoff berth years after
Larry Bird, Kevin McHale and Robert Parish retired.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Knicks Seem Dormant  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks spent time and money courting Grant Hill and Brian
Grant the past month, time and money that apparently went to waste
and made some of their current players question the franchise's
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Patrick Ewing, the player whom Dave Checketts has
often said ``will retire a Knick,'' wants more years and more
money.
</P>
<P>
   The window on the Knicks' championship hopes is always said to
be perpetually closing, one bad bounce away from the draft lottery.
And just as they slip below the tier of elite teams, the Knicks
find a way to end up deep in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Knicks cannot pull off a deal for a legitimate
rebounder in the next few months, they have no shot at returning to
the finals. At a time when Miami and Orlando are upgrading and
Indiana is mostly holding onto the team that came within three
victories of a title, the Knicks are running out of capable big
men.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating comments he made in March about playing three more
seasons, Ewing said last week that he planned to play one more
season in New York and then somewhere else if the Knicks did not
extend his contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks remember how well Ewing played the last time he
wanted an exorbitant contract. In the 1996-97 season _ his last
injury-free, productive season _ he was in All-Star form. But now
he almost seems out of touch with his own talent. Unlike many aging
former All-Stars, he has no comprehension of his declining skill
and agility.
</P>
<P>
   Would the Knicks pay Ewing for two more seasons given that he
has spent much of the past three years on the injured list? It is
unlikely. Meanwhile, their backup center, Chris Dudley, will very
likely have his contract bought out at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Knicks with a glut of power forwards and
shooting guards. Without capable big men, Allan Houston and Latrell
Sprewell are basically Grant Hill and Jerry Stackhouse and the
Knicks are a lower-echelon playoff team that goes home in early
May.
</P>
<P>
   Unless general manager Scott Layden can creatively find a way to
land an impact post player, the good times at Madison Square Garden
will soon come to an end. &QL;

TRACK AND FIELD'S TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Marc Bloom covered the Olympic Trials for Runner's World
Online.) 
 By MARC BLOOM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene pulled up lame in last
Sunday's Olympic trials 200-meter fiasco in Sacramento, Calif.,
Johnson blamed the news media for overblowing the showdown and
creating a weird chemistry that polluted the event. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when the United States had great milers like Steve
Scott and Sydney Maree going up against foreign stars like Eamonn
Coghlan and John Walker, the mile was usually set up as the final,
climactic event of a televised track meet. Meet promoters, track
officials and TV executives felt the mile was the event to sell.
The mile had glamour, charismatic personalities and the historical
weight of the four-minute barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, television always promised records. Instead of
focusing on the subtleties of competition and the significance of
victory _ the essence of track _ telecasters blabbered for an hour
about some record attempt. Invariably, there was a great letdown as
the records rarely came. No matter who won, the public was left
with the impression that the athletes failed. When track ultimately
fell off the national radar screen, track fans suggested that the
sport had lost its way and needed to refocus on competition, not
records.
</P>
<P>
   For this Olympic year, the competition has been keener than
ever: Marion Jones vs. Inger Miller in the 200; Regina Jacobs vs.
Suzy Favor Hamilton in the 1,500; Adam Goucher and Bob Kennedy in
the 5,000. Track and field had buzz again. The women's pole vault,
led by the world record-holder, Stacy Dragila and, of course, the
incomparable showing of Jones, seeking five gold medals in Sydney,
Australia, sparked weekly excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The event with the greatest legs appeared to be the men's 200.
Unfortunately, the news media drummed up the Johnson-Greene rivalry
to the point where it harmed the sport _ and in a sour finish to a
breathtaking Olympic trials, viewers were the losers. As The
Sacramento Bee mocked it, the simultaneous injury was the ``hammy
double whammy.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, there was no rivalry. Johnson has dominated the 200,
as well as the 400, for a decade, and you could make a case for him
as the greatest athlete in the history of track and field. Greene
is primarily a 100 man and is the world record-holder. When Johnson
withdrew from last year's national 200 against Greene, Johnson
rightly took some heat for claiming injury at the 11th hour.
</P>
<P>
   After that, NBC viewed a Johnson-Greene rematch as the event to
sell for the Olympic trials. NBC set the schedule, slotting the 200
final as the closing event of the meet _ 5:48 p.m., Pacific time _
for its live, prime-time broadcast. Meet officials, seeking marquee
value, went along. In Sydney, the last individual track event is
the men's 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Television not only set the schedule but also the agenda. In
Sacramento, Johnson versus Greene would be big _ huge _ and
reporters pounced on the story in a frenzy worthy of scandal. At a
pretrials news conference, Johnson and Greene were trotted out
together and questions focused on the athletes' supposed enmity,
instigating the trash-talk that followed. Inger Miller sat between
the two men like a referee at ``Wrestlemania.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Johnson and Greene were not innocent victims. They
could have merely said nothing. But the news media drove hard, and
the athletes' pride prevented discretion. Reporters would tell
Michael that Maurice said this; in turn, they would tell Maurice
that Michael said that. It made great theater.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists spent the week looking for anyone to interview on
the 200. They found the pliant Ato Bolden from Trinidad and Tobago,
Greene's training partner, always one with a provocative line. They
searched out the 1968 Olympic sprinter John Carlos, no stranger to
controversy, for his thoughts. Trash-talk escalated from window
dressing to a story unto itself. Johnson said everyone had
something to gain but him. Right again.
</P>
<P>
   The men's 200 was reminiscent of the 1984 women's Olympic 3,000
in Los Angeles, another made-for-television creation that trumpeted
a duel between the American star Mary Slaney and the barefoot
teen-ager Zola Budd, a South African with dual citizenship who ran
for Britain. Slaney was the far superior runner and a gold-medal
threat. Budd was a promising youngster with little international
experience. You know what happened: Slaney and Budd collided as
victory went to Slaney's true opponent, Maricica Puica of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   After the men's 200 preliminary round on July 22, reporters
swarmed around Johnson, and I couldn't get close. I noticed another
sprinter, Floyd Heard, standing by himself and went over to him.
Heard, at 34 the oldest man in the event, had just run his fastest
time in 11 years. In 1986, he had been ranked No. 1 in the world.
After almost quitting track last year with an injury, Heard was
giving it one last shot at the trials. He had a close friend
advising him, a guy named Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Heard looked as if he could make the Olympic team, but no one
seemed to care. When, in the 200 final, the overwhelming tension
and 118-degree temperature played havoc with the two marquee
protagonists' overworked leg muscles, Heard ran a close second to
earn a ticket to Sydney. His performance was a lifetime best 19.88
seconds, a time faster than Greene had run to win the 1999 world
title in Seville, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's good that the ballyhooed 200 blew up in everyone's
face. Now there won't be another circus in Sydney. Johnson can run
the 400, Greene the 100, and fans can root for a rejuvenated
34-year-old unknown in the 200.

THE KEY FOR NEW-HOME PROTECTION? LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Conn.)   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virtually every new car comes with a warranty that protects the
buyer against major mechanical problems for a specific period of
time or for the maximum amount of mileage.
</P>
<P>
   So, then, what kind of warranty do you get when you buy a new
house?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, depends on where the house is.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, state law requires that all new single-family
houses and condominiums come with a 10-year warranty.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the law creates an ``implied warranty'' that
protects buyers of new homes for up to six years. But unlike New
Jersey, New York allows builders to modify the warranty with the
buyer's consent.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, where state law provides buyers with a basic
one-year warranty, experts say that its scope depends almost
entirely on what the buyer's lawyer manages to get into the sales
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Desch, the chief of the Bureau of Homeowner Protection in
New Jersey's Department of Community Affairs in Trenton, said that
under state law, before builders can obtain certificates of
occupancy, they must present receipts for fully paid 10-year
new-home warranties, the terms of which are set by statute. They
can buy the warranties directly from the state's New Home Warranty
Program or from a state-approved private warranty company that
offers the same coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the first year, it covers a host of things that could
be wrong with new construction,'' Desch said. They range from floor
squeaks and roof leaks to cracks in the foundation and structural
defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coverage decreases over time,'' he said. In the second
year, the warranty covers only structural defects and flaws in the
electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning
systems. From the third through 10th years, the warranty covers
only major structural defects _ in other words, serious structural
problems caused by actual physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``As good as this program is, one of the things that people miss
is that this is only a limited warranty,'' Desch said, explaining
that there are some things that are not covered. Among them are
sidewalks, driveways, pools and outbuildings like sheds and
detached garages.
</P>
<P>
   When a homeowner files a claim during the first two years of the
warranty, Desch said, the Bureau of Homeowner Protection sends out
an arbitrator to meet with the homeowner and the builder to
determine whether the claim is valid. If it is _ and the decision
of the arbitrator is binding either way _ the state will order the
builder to make the necessary repairs. If the builder refuses to do
so, Desch said, the department can bar the builder from
constructing new homes in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For claims filed in the third through 10th years of the
warranty, he said, the builder is no longer obligated to perform
the repairs. Instead, the state sends out a claims adjuster to
determine if the claim is valid. If it is, the adjuster will
authorize the owner to hire someone to make the necessary repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, Desch said, and in cases where the builder is out
of business, bankrupt or refuses to cooperate, the money for the
work comes out of the state's New Home Warranty Trust Fund, which
is replenished by the fees builders pay the state for the
warranties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 20 years we've paid out about $35 million in
claims,'' Desch said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's statutory warranty on new homes works somewhat
differently.
</P>
<P>
   New York has a six-year implied warranty on any new home under
Section 777 of the state's General Business Law, said Douglas F.
Wasser, a Manhattan real estate lawyer. , It requires that the
house be free of all defects for a year after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is defined by the law as meaning that workmanship and
materials meet or exceed the standards of the applicable building
code,'' Wasser said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second year, he said, the warranty covers only mechanical
systems _ including plumbing, electrical, heating, cooling and
ventilating _ and ``material defects,'' defined as actual physical
damage to load-bearing parts of the house that make it unsafe,
unsanitary or otherwise unlivable.
</P>
<P>
   In the third through sixth years of the warranty, Wasser said,
only material defects are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the time periods covered, there are other significant
differences between New Jersey's New Home Warranty Program and New
York's implied warranty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while New Jersey's program provides both a system
for handling claims and money to pay them, New York's implied
warranty provides neither. And while every new home in New Jersey
comes with the same basic warranty, builders in New York are free
to negotiate with buyers to modify or even eliminate the protection
of the implied warranty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakest link in the New York law is the builder's ability
to disclaim the warranty,'' said Michael Liss, a White Plains real
estate lawyer, referring to the fact that if the buyer agreed in
the sales contract, builders could substitute their own warranties
in place of the statutory one. In fact, he said, some builders
insist upon a cap on the amount they will be liable for.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where lawyers really start to worry,'' Liss said. ``If
the builder puts a $100,000 cap on the warranty, and you've got a
house with real problems, then you're out of luck for any repairs
above the $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what the warranty or its terms, the only way for
an owner to force a recalcitrant builder to make repairs is to take
the builder to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most buyers' lawyers wince at handling new construction,''
Liss said. ``The contracts get too complicated, and there are
usually too many postconstruction claims to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in Connecticut face similar challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Connecticut, the only warranty you get by law is that
everything is going to work for one year from the date of
closing,'' said William Selsberg, a Stamford real estate lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The state's implied-warranty law, Selsberg said, provides that
new homes will be free of faulty materials, designed according to

   ``The warranty does not apply to any conditions that an
inspection by a reasonably diligent purchaser would reveal,''
Selsberg said. Such vague provisions leave real estate lawyers no
choice but to try to craft their own warranties by inserting them
into the sales contract and getting the builder to agree to them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of guesswork on the part of the buyer's lawyer
to try to cover every possible contingency,'' Selsberg said. ``And
when all is said and done, agreements and warranties are only as
good as the people who make them.''

VEEP CHOICE COULD CREATE SOUTHERN CHANCE FOR GORE  
 By CARL HULSE  
NYT Regional Newspapers  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush's
choice of Richard Cheney as his running mate demonstrates his
confidence that the South is safe GOP presidential territory. But
it leaves an opening for Vice President Al Gore to broaden his
appeal in the region.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By passing up such rising sons of the South as GOP Sens. Bill
Frist and Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the Texas governor signaled
his belief that he doesn't need any extra help in rounding up the
lion's share of the South's electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of assistance already. Younger brother Jeb, the
governor of Florida, is firmly in control of the state's GOP
apparatus and is a popular chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott, a former cheerleader, is a chief
Bush rooter and carries plenty of weight in his home state and
elsewhere across Dixie. Plus, Cheney's rock-ribbed GOP ideology
will play well in Southeastern states that like their politicians
more conservative than the nation in general.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Western tilt of an all-Stetson ticket from Texas and
Wyoming presents an opportunity for Gore should he choose to take
advantage of it. Naming a Southern Democrat such as North Carolina
Gov. Jim Hunt, Florida Sen. Bob Graham or Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.
_ all names that have figured in speculation _ could bring Gore
support that might have been lost had Bush tapped a native son.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a new dynamic at work as well. Former Georgia Gov.
Zell Miller, chosen to succeed the late Paul Coverdell in the
Senate, will now be on the November ballot in that state, which was
not scheduled to have a high-profile contest.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is an extraordinarily popular Democrat who figures to
boost voter turnout and improve overall Democratic prospects in a
state President Clinton carried in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That could be good news for backers of Graham as a veep
prospect. Consider this: Analysts say neighboring Georgia is the
one state outside Florida where Graham could have an appreciable
impact on his own. Added together, Florida's 25 electoral votes and
Georgia's 13 trump the 32 held by Texas and could prove decisive in
an election.
</P>
<P>
   MANDELA MATTERS
</P>
<P>
   Cheney isn't the only one who might be asked to explain his now
controversial vote against a 1986 House resolution calling for the
release of Nelson Mandela from a South African jail and urging
recognition of the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every Southern Republican serving at the time and
several Democrats took the same position on the resolution, which
received majority support but failed because it required a
two-thirds margin for passage. Thirty-two Democrats, many from the
South, sided with them, including the entire Georgia delegation and
a handful of Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Republicans _ led by rising star Newt Gingrich of
Georgia _ raised concerns that the ANC had communist leanings.
Since then, Mandela has been recognized as a worldwide hero and
many lawmakers no doubt wish they had that vote to cast again.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE MANIPULATION
</P>
<P>
   As Southern hospital executives howl about shrinking Medicare
payments, lawmakers are moving to correct a health care financing
formula that has bedeviled rural America.
</P>
<P>
   The problem? Reimbursement rates to hospitals and managed care
programs under Medicare were set according to historical spending
in a county. Hence, rates started out higher in urban areas where
big-dollar, high-tech medical centers were concentrated and skewed
lower in small communities where medicine is practiced more
conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   `'If you were efficient and getting the service at a low cost,
you got stuck with a low reimbursement rate,'' complained Sen. Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   To correct the situation, he and other lawmakers are proposing a
measure that would better equalize payments and they hope to get it
passed yet this year.
</P>
<P>
   THE CHECK ISN'T IN THE MAIL
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus is using his congressional Web site to help
the Internal Revenue Service track down his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   But it is good news. The Alabama Republican has posted a list of
322 district residents due IRS refunds the agency has been unable
to deliver because of illegible addresses and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no Regis Philbin, but i want to help unite my constituents
with the money the IRS owes them,'' said Bacchus, whose homepage at
www.house.gov/bachus also provides a link to the IRS refund request
form.

ETHICS QUESTION ON PICKENS; SCOUTS CAN SEE THE REDSKINS; AROUND THE
LEAGUE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also FBN-FALCONS-REEVES) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bizarre trip of wide receiver Carl Pickens ended last week
when he signed a multiyear, incentive-laden contract with the
Tennessee Titans. Both Pickens and his old team, the Cincinnati
Bengals, were happy he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Late during the negotiations, Pickens dumped his second agent
and was being advised by a third, Marvin Demoff, who is also the
agent for Titans coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that were interested in Pickens last week questioned the
ethics of that situation. But there have been a number of instances
when an agent represented both a player and the head coach on the
same team.
</P>
<P>
   The team officials complaining about the arrangement are simply
upset that they lost out on acquiring the wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts Can See the Redskins &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins' decision to charge $10 for admission to
training-camp practices has scouts from competing teams taking
advantage of a little-known league rule. It states that if a team
charges admission to practices, then scouts from competing teams,
normally prohibited from attending, can go.
</P>
<P>
   So scouts from about a dozen teams have paid their 10 bucks and
watched the Redskins go through their summer drills, several said
last week. Teams do not gain a huge tactical advantage by doing
this because teams rarely work on secrets in such a public setting.
But it does give scouts the chance to get an early start on looking
at the Redskins' personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' potential defensive line: Eric Swann and Sean
Gilbert at tackle and Reggie White and Chuck Smith at defensive
end. That could be, if their conditioning holds out, a formidable
foursome. ... Eric Moulds, the excellent Buffalo wide receiver, is
having his best camp ever, a scary thought for the rest of the
division. ... The Redskins will use cornerback Deion Sanders and
Champ Bailey together in a few of there special-teams situations.
... Look for Oakland cornerback Charles Woodson to be involved in
the offense this season. ... New England coach Bill Belichick on
wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was traded from the Jets to
Tampa Bay: ``I have a lot of regard for him. I'm glad he is out of
our division. When we first met, he straightened out some
misconceptions I had about him, and I straightened out some
misconceptions he had about me. We had a good working
relationship.''

REEVES' POOR TALENT PICKS FOR FALCONS RAISE CONCERN
</HEADLINE>
   (With FBN-NOTEBOOK) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1995 and New York Giants coach Dan Reeves informed the
front office he wanted to bring the free-agent quarterback Tommy
Maddox to New York. When several team scouts heard the news, they
rolled their eyes. They had viewed Maddox on film and thought he
possessed a weak arm, played nervous and had bad aim. Other than
that, he was fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves insisted. As coach and general manager of the Denver
Broncos, he had drafted Maddox with a No. 1 pick, and even though
Maddox was a disaster there, Reeves still wanted to give the player
another chance. Maddox got it. On Oct. 15 of that year, against
Philadelphia, Maddox went six of 23 for 49 yards and three
interceptions. His passer rating for the game was zero.
</P>
<P>
   Experiment over. Maddox was gone soon after that horrid
afternoon and is now out of the league, but Reeves' stubbornness
about Maddox started a rift between the coaching staff and the
front office.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was fired as the Giants' coach, with the main issue being
control over personnel decisions like picking the players in the
draft. Now, as head coach and general manager of the Falcons,
Reeves has taken the once joke of a franchise to new heights, a
Super Bowl berth. His coaching ability was the main reason the
Falcons upset the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC title game two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves has also continued to demonstrate that he is one of
the worst talent evaluators in football. Except now there are no
checks and balances as there were with the Giants. He makes the
picks and there is no one in the Falcons organization willing to
challenge him. Thus, considering the questionable nature of Reeves'
recent selections, it is not an overstatement to say that the
franchise could soon take several large steps back.
</P>
<P>
   That is already beginning to happen. Atlanta is only two years
removed from the Super Bowl, and St. Louis has passed the Falcons
in the division, as most likely has Carolina. Both teams added
depth and speed with smart drafts.
</P>
<P>
   What some coaches do not seem to understand is that coaching and
evaluating talent are two different animals. Personnel men and
scouts log tens of thousands of miles going to college games and
watch more film than a movie critic. There is no such thing as a
part-time scout, just as there is no such thing as a part-time
coach.
</P>
<P>
   The examples of good coach/bad talent scout are everywhere: Mike
Ditka, the former New Orleans Saints coach, traded his entire draft
for running back Ricky Williams, which may end up being one of the
biggest draft blunders of the last 15 years. That move helped get
Ditka fired, yet he had been a good enough coach to have led the
Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl XX championship in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1997, 1998 and 1999 drafts under Bill Parcells as general
manager of the Jets, he selected 22 players total, but only eight
have started with the team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.
None of his draft picks has made the Pro Bowl. Parcells was
recently named coach of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   So, great coach plus mediocre talent evaluator does not always
add up to a great draft.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is one of only three coaches in league history to take
three different teams to the playoffs (Parcells and Chuck Knox are
the others). His coaching job with Atlanta the season of Super Bowl
XXXIII was among the best of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves has done a poor job of replenishing talent, to the
point where it is conceivable that a few years from now, when aging
stars like running back Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris
Chandler move on, there will be mediocre talent, or less, waiting
to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 draft, Reeves' first for the Falcons, stands as a
symbol for his troubles in picking players. He traded down eight
spots in the first round to take Nebraska cornerback Michael
Booker, passing a better player at the position in Shawn Springs,
and also passing tight end Tony Gonzalez, now one of the league's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Booker, after several years of struggling, bolted
training camp without an excuse (he hung out at a local waffle
house) and questioned whether he wanted to play football. Booker
has returned to camp, but his future is cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine players from that draft, three at one point or
another left the team. Quarterback Tony Graziani was also in that
class, and he has been a total bust.
</P>
<P>
   The recent picks of Reeves have not been much better. His
first-round pick in 1998 was Keith Brooking out of Georgia Tech, in
1999 it was Patrick Kerney out of Virginia. Also in that draft,
Reeves traded his 2000 No. 1 pick to Baltimore so he could draft
Mississippi State tight end Reggie Kelly, despite the fact few
teams had Kelly rated as a first-rounder and the Falcons had a
surplus of tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those players will turn out to be Pro Bowlers, but so far,
none has shown much potential. In other words, the cupboard is
running bare.

DOING THE BALANCING ACT OVER PRACTICES
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Training camp is pro football's laboratory, a
testing ground with an inherent contradiction to its objective.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is like hammering a molten piece of steel. It is a
violent undertaking, for the steel has to be struck to take shape.
Hit it too often or too forcefully, and it may break or crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Football coaches spend the six weeks of training camp and the
attendant exhibition game schedule seeking such balance as they try
to prepare and evaluate nearly 80 players for the hotbed of
conflict that approaches with September's regular season. To do so,
they must push and prod, occasionally letting 300-pound bodies slam
into each other just to see what happens, to see who moves backward
and who does not.
</P>
<P>
   They must let their prized running backs be thrown to the
ground, let their quarterbacks be sacked and their linebackers be
blocked at the knees.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, what coaches want most out of training camp is a
healthy roster of players. So they spend a far greater amount of
time trying to protect the players _ their multimillion-dollar
inventory _ from colliding with each other in hazardous
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The words heard most frequently at Giants training camp is the
plaintive bellow of coach Jim Fassel: ``Stay up! Stay up!''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel shouts this as nearly every practice play concludes. He
does so to prevent his backs, ends and linemen from losing their
footing, leading to a pileup of mammoth bodies. It is in those
pileups, as arms and legs tangle, that ligaments are strained and
torn and bones give way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay up!'' Fassel yells 40 or 50 times a practice.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, someone does not stay up.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday at Giants camp, it was Dhani Jones, a promising
rookie linebacker. For days beforehand, Jones had brought smiles to
the faces of Giants coaches, who talked about how they had stolen a
talented player with a sixth-round pick in April's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was fast and big at 240 pounds, and he displayed a special
athletic quality that made him stand out. In football parlance, he
was ``always around the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But running down on a drill simulating a kickoff, Jones paused,
went to change direction on grass wet from a morning rain, and
slumped to the ground. He got up, but the anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee _ the stabilizer of side-to-side motion _
was not attached as it had been seconds earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Jones will be lost for the season and faces six months of
grueling rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows you how life can change from moment to moment,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of a similar knee injury sustained by former
Giants wide receiver Omar Douglas running virtually the same drill
during the team's 1997 training camp. Douglas did not get up, and
never played again for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   As Douglas lay in the grass that summer day, his career changed
forever in a moment, his helmet was next to an orange traffic cone
the coaches were using to mark the spot where players made their
cuts for the drill.
</P>
<P>
   As trainers worked on a writhing Douglas, a coach walked over,
grabbed the cone and moved it five yards to the right. A whistle
blew. The drill continued.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, when that scene was recounted to Douglas, he
shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may seem heartless,'' he said, ``but it's just football.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was obvious the Giants coaches were shaken by
Jones' injury. It was apparent in their faces when they discussed
the loss of a talented player. And this year, Fassel has made his
training camp less rigorous. There have been several days with just
one practice when there had been two sessions in the past.
Full-contact exercises have been scant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a no-win situation,'' Fassel said. ``If you don't
work the guys and have injuries, people will say you didn't do
enough to get them in condition. It's a fine balance and it's on my
mind 24 hours a day: Are we working them too little or too much?''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel and his head trainer, Ronnie Barnes, sat down this winter
and examined the circumstances of every injury from the 1999
season, from sprains to broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of broken bones in games,'' Fassel said. ``Now
what are you going to do about that? Sometimes a guy just steps
wrong. That's what Dhani did. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that injury, I was concerned about the coaching staff.
So I told them: `Look, we can't get paranoid out there. We can't be
walking around on eggshells.'''
</P>
<P>
   As Fassel spoke, he stood alongside the acres of practice fields
where he is molding his fourth Giants team. He pointed to a group
of tight ends who were doing extra work after practice on a distant
field.
</P>
<P>
   A machine was firing footballs at the players. As each player
tried to catch a ball, a coach slammed him across the shoulder pads
and helmet with a padded blocking dummy.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, a football coach for 27 years, took in this scene. With
a thin smile, he turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough game,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ As he skated around the ice one day last week,
it was difficult to tell Rick DiPietro, the New York Islanders' No.
1 draft choice, from the youngsters he was teaching at a
goaltending clinic. Wearing a sweater with No. 1 and his name on
the back was all that seemed to distinguish DiPietro from the
campers, some of whom were only three years younger than the
18-year-old goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, the first goalie to be selected as the top overall
pick in NHL history, signed a three-year contract on Tuesday. He
recalled how Tom Barrasso, at age 18, went directly from
Acton-Boxboro High School in Massachusetts to the Buffalo Sabres
and was named the rookie of the year in the 1983-84 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there is going to be a lot of pressure put on me,''
DiPietro said. ``We let go of two great goaltenders. You've got to
remember, I'm a young guy. I'm only 18 years old, so it's a long
shot for any 18-year-old to make an NHL squad right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders traded goaltenders Roberto Luongo and Kevin Weekes
on draft day to make room for DiPietro, who played only one season
at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working out pretty hard and trying to get myself
focused,'' DiPietro said. ``Hopefully, I can have a successful
camp, and wherever the New York Islanders feel best to put me,
that's where I'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarded as possessing puck-handling skills superior to most NHL
goaltenders, DiPietro finds it hard to believe that he could be a
starter in the NHL when this season begins. The Islanders, however,
did take out an insurance policy by acquiring John Vanbiesbrouck,
36, a day after the draft, providing DiPietro with a mentor and a
capable backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mention John Vanbiesbrouck in the same breath as you do
all the other great American goalies,'' DiPietro said. ``Sitting
next to him in the locker room, seeing what he has to say about his
experiences is a wonderful tool for me and something that hopefully
I'll be able to use to my benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They mentioned they were going to try to get an older,
experienced goaltender and I don't think they could have picked a
better guy. I don't think it's hit me yet. I think maybe in late
August when I step in that locker room for the first time and put
on the gear next to a guy like John Vanbiesbrouck, it's going to
actually hit me what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro said that he would not mind serving as the No. 2
goaltender behind Vanbiesbrouck, and he would also accept starting
the season in the minors if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   He believes, however, that he is ready to learn on the NHL
level. The Islanders, who had made Luongo the highest-drafted
goaltender only three years ago, are uncertain just what the plan
will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like him to play all the time,'' general manager Mike
Milbury said. ``That'd be my first preference, but we've got a guy
like Vanbiesbrouck here who's going to want minutes, too. I don't
want to ascribe some game plan that I don't have. Eventually, this
guy is going to be our goaltender if we're right, and I think we
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be our long-term No. 1 netminder. When is the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``With John, we don't have the urgency, the pressure, to get
this kid time here right away. Ask him and he wants to be the
starting goaltender on opening night. That's part of the appeal of
this kid, that he wants to be under the spotlight, wants to feel
the pressure. He likes it, which is a good way to be for a
goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders have put themselves under the microscope with a
drastic upheaval this summer, and Milbury is well aware that the
team's fate may lie in the unlikely hands of DiPietro, along with
other young players like 19-year-old Tim Connolly and 20-year-old
Mathieu Biron.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pressure I've felt over the last few years has all
gone away as of the draft,'' Milbury said. ``If it works and we
fine-tune things, good, then I've done a good job. If it doesn't
work, it's time to move on.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ TriBeCa, the old butter-and-eggs district of Lower
Manhattan, isn't sizzling any longer. It's deafening.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen construction and large-scale renovation
projects are clamoring simultaneously. Jackhammers and backhoes are
carving up Greenwich Street, which is being narrowed to create more
of a pedestrian promenade. Equipment in the telecommunications hub
on Hudson Street rumbles into the night.
</P>
<P>
   With all the activity spurred by a robust economy, walking
through the once-somnolent TriBeCa _ which drew worldwide attention
last year as crowds mourned outside the apartment of John F.
Kennedy Jr. _ is now ``like walking through a war zone,'' said
Madelyn Wils, the new chairwoman of Community Board 1, who has
lived on Duane Street for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the din includes the playful shrieks of youngsters outside
P.S. 234 on Chambers Street, a reminder that while TriBeCa has lost
some of its diversity _ and the aroma of roasted coffee and roasted
peanuts in the air _ it is ``much more of a neighborhood now than
it ever was,'' in the words of Bill Barrett, a sculptor who has
lived and worked on Worth Street since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the opening of the swank TriBeCa Grand Hotel, even
under the global spotlight that followed Kennedy, who lived on
North Moore Street, TriBeCa is still small-town _ albeit a town
that is industrial at its Belgian-block, iron-canopy core, where
residents fight for every inch of lawn and garden.
</P>
<P>
   Its villagelike insularity extends to development, which is
dominated not by the mid-Manhattan giants but by smaller builders,
mostly in their 40s, many of them local, some of them architects.
</P>
<P>
   What they are building, make no mistake, is housing for the
rich. Lofts overlooking the Holland Tunnel exit command $1 million
and more. Warehouses and factories where space rented for $1 a
square foot in the 1960s are being sold as condominiums for $500 to
$800 a square foot.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of TriBeCa, which stands for Triangle Below Canal,
lies within four historic districts that were designated by the
Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1991 and 1992. Jennifer J.
Raab, the current chairwoman, sees TriBeCa as a ``textbook example
of how economic development and preservation go hand in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The real estate market provided the investment that led to the
stunning restoration of these gems,'' she said, ``but without
historic preservation regulation, there would have been no
guarantee that restorations and new construction would have been as
sensitive, which would have limited the economic value of the
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The rehabilitation of TriBeCa landmarks, though, has come
literally at a high price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their preservation and prettification proclaimed a new social
reality,'' Joshua B. Freeman wrote in ``Working-Class New York''
(The New Press, 2000). ``Workers of the type who once created the
wealth of Gotham in these very buildings could not afford to enter
their portals, nor would they be made to feel welcome if they
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Glassman, the editor of the monthly Tribeca Trib, belonged
to a food co-op 20 years ago. There were no grocery stores then,
let alone four-star restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bemoan the fact that only wealthy people can move into the
neighborhood,'' he said. ``But I don't have bad feelings toward the
people who do move in. I would posit that they are a different
breed from other Wall Streeters or new-money types. If you're going
to spend $2 million to live in a warehouse, you're different from
somebody who wants to live in the suburbs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the years, Steven Wils noticed the growing number of
children in the neighborhood. For a while, it made him anxious. He
operated Harry Wils &AMP; Co. on Duane Street, across from a park, with
18 trucks coming and going around the clock, laden with butter,
eggs, cheese, olives, chocolate, spices and oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were 50 kids, now there were 150,'' Wils said. ``It
just wasn't safe anymore.'' Happily accustomed to living over the
store, Wils reluctantly moved the business to Secaucus, N.J., in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, the community board chairwoman, still live over
the store, only the store is now a row of fine antique and
furniture dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Wils was the last butter-and-egg man but there is still an
aromatic trace of Washington Market downwind of Transit Trading
Corp. at 29 Leonard St.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only ones left,'' said the middle-aged man on the
loading dock, before refusing further word and withdrawing behind
sacks of oregano, fennel and caraway.

MILTON GARLAND, 104, ONE OF OLDEST WORKERS IN U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Mo., Nev., Ohio, Tenn., Va., Calif., Mass.)  By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milton W. Garland, who showed up for a 47-cents-an-hour job at a
refrigeration company in 1920 and stayed on until this May, died
Thursday at a nursing home in Waynesboro, Pa. He was 104.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, who earned 41 patents over eight decades in the field
of refrigeration, was honored in 1998 as the nation's oldest worker
by Green Thumb, a nonprofit group that helps older and
disadvantaged people get jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, a Green Thumb spokeswoman, Alice Ann Toole, said, he
was the oldest worker who could and would come to Washington for
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Stubbart, a copy editor and columnist for The Examiner, a
newspaper in Independence, Mo., was the first choice in 1998,
because she was two months older than Garland. Her health did not
permit her to travel then or the next year. Toole said that a
Florida real estate agent and perhaps others who were older than
Garland were thought to be still on the job, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by any measure, Garland, a tall, courtly mechanical
engineer, displayed great longevity. Until late May, when he had a
heart attack and moved to a nursing home from the house where he
had lived since 1926, he still worked 20 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   He had stayed on after his formal retirement in 1967 from the
Frick Co., a refrigeration equipment company that is now a unit of
York International. ``They hired him back the next day,'' his wife,
Alice, said.
</P>
<P>
   Using a magnifying glass, he evaluated 2,000 patents a week in
search of ways they might be applied to refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   Also in his retirement years, he organized a training school for
Frick's refrigeration engineers and wrote an engineering design
manual. He called it ``Industrial Refrigeration 102,'' in honor of
his age when he published it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just report to work like anybody else,'' he said in an
appearance before the Senate Special Committee on Aging in 1998,
when he was honored by Green Thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Wooten, president of Green Thumb, suggested that he was
being modest. ``At 102, I cannot imagine being as sharp as he
was,'' Wooten said. ``He was so balanced and so together. We were
at the press conference and he was asked a question about how he
helped solve a rubber shortage during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he went into detail about the process. It was way over
my head, but he spoke in logical and methodical terms, almost like
he had written it out.''
</P>
<P>
   When Japan controlled Asian rubber plantations, Garland's
inventions helped make artificial rubber-making possible by
reducing temperatures during production.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Garland was officially named Mr. Refrigeration by the
American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning
Engineers, in honor of his work from the gold mines of South Africa
to the ice cream factories of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The group said his most recognizable invention was the first
``shell'' ice maker, which manufactured ice on the outside of tubes
that are 4 inches across and 10 feet long. The method was cleaner
and more efficient than the previous system of making ice in
galvanized cans. Its uses ranged from chicken-processing plants to
dairies to a two-mile-deep gold mine, where temperatures were
reduced from 110 degrees to a more comfortable 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Ward Garland was born Aug. 23, 1895, in Harrisburg, Pa.
His father worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad, and as a boy
Garland went to work delivering newspapers. He later worked in a
shop repairing Indian brand motorcycles. His specialty was the
wooden wheel rims.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, he built a motorcycle from parts and drove it to
college at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Mass. He
paid for his schooling by managing two apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shoveled the snow, took out the garbage, fired the
furnaces,'' Garland told The Worcester Sunday Telegram in 1995,
when he received an honorary doctorate. ``Had to get up awful early
every morning, but I had good board and lodging and everything I
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   His schooling was interrupted by his service in the Navy during
World War I. After graduating from college, he went to work for
Frick in 1920, rising to superintendent of field installation work
after three years. He held that position until 1948. At his
retirement, he was vice president for technical services.
</P>
<P>
   His passion for refrigeration never abated. ``You see, it's a
heat exchange process, and different materials have different
conductivity,'' he said two years ago. ``There's always a chance of
improving the heat transfer rate.''
</P>
<P>
   His work took him to the Hoover Dam, for which he designed
systems to cool the water, sand and rock used to make the concrete
to build it. Pouring concrete in the fiercely hot temperatures of
southern Nevada would have otherwise been impossible.
</P>
<P>
   He made machinery that allowed the large-scale manufacture of
dry ice, making it possible to ship fresher food to troops overseas
during World War II. He also helped the war effort as a consultant
for Pratt &AMP; Whitney, builders of aircraft engines; the Army's
all-weather laboratory at Fort Belvoir, Va.; Goodyear Aircraft in
Akron, Ohio, and the Atomic Energy Commission in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Alice; a son, M. Ward, of Quartz
Hill, Calif.; a daughter, Jean L. Woloshyn of Big Bear City,
Calif.; six grandchildren; 13 great-grandchildren; and a
great-great-grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Garland took work seriously, always showing up at 8 a.m. in a
hat, starched white shirt and three-piece suit. His advice was
simple, old-fashioned and not particularly sugar-coated. ``Go into
something and then stay with it, and then like it,'' he told the
Senate panel. ``You won't like it unless you have expertise in that
line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he did not have a playful side. He took up piloting his
own airplane at 60 and kept it up until he was 75. He drove his own
car and played golf until he was 99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live like you're going to live forever, not like you're going
to die tomorrow,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   When asked his secret for his own longevity, he sometimes noted
that he avoided sauerkraut.

 &HT;    Parenthood vs. productivity?
 &HT;    By Maria Mallory
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having children saps your energy, your focus, your
life in general, or so traditional wisdom would have you believe.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think once the babies come, workers _ especially
working mothers _ begin to slip in their productivity, their
allegiance to their jobs and their commitment to career ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a common stereotype that having children is a signal the
working parent will use any excuse to get out of work in order to
spend more time at home.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some managers believe that. Maybe some colleagues of
employed parents also share the prejudice. But parents disagree.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1999 national survey of 680 employed parents by
Lutheran Brotherhood, a nonprofit financial services organization
based in Minneapolis, 52 percent of those questioned said
parenthood has made them more productive at work and having
children does not detract from their job performance. Only 10
percent said parenthood made them less productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though some people think parents won't be as focused on
their jobs, I have found that they are more productive because they
want to make things work,'' said Gwen Kuhrt, human resources
manager at Lutheran Brotherhood. ``They're motivated to be good
team players.''
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed 56 percent of the fathers believe they now
get more done at work, compared with 48 percent of the women. The
reason: ``Women still have more household and child-rearing
responsibilities, though that is changing,'' said Kuhrt, who has a
master's degree in human resource management.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding: Parents of teenagers felt more productive than
those of preschoolers. ``That surprised me, too, but despite the
after-school activities teens have to get to and other demands,
they are more self-sufficient and can even help out with household
chores,'' Kuhrt said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlie Russell Hochschild, professor of sociology and co-director
of the Center for Working Families at the University of California
at Berkeley, says working parents, of necessity, ``become more
productive because they're more organized and distill their tasks
more efficiently. They're clear about their priorities, and that
shows in their decisions. They strive for balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hochschild, the author of ``The Time Bind: When Work Becomes
Home and Home Becomes Work'' (Metropolitan, $9.99) and mother of
two adult sons, says that she ``got better at prioritizing and less
distracted at work'' after she became a parent.
</P>
<P>
   As more mothers choose to stay home, when they choose to
continue working, they must also be choosing to maintain a level of
work ethic and responsibility, reasons Mary Jensen, who is a member
of Mothers &AMP; More, a national organization for women who have
altered their careers to care for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a working mother for two years,'' Jensen says. ``It
didn't affect my productivity. If anything, it probably made it
better. I had to budget my time more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think the people who are continuing to work must be
committed and must be productive because that's a choice that they
are making'' to continue on the job rather than opt out, she says.
``In my organization, those who are working are productive and
committed to that. Those who are not, they have admitted that'' and
no longer work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely more efficient a worker now because there's
just so much more to do,'' says Pam Hainlin, who is president of
Mothers &AMP; More. ``In order to accomplish all that you'd like to do,
you have to do what you do better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a big procrastinator. I used to be a deadline
worker, would thrive at working at 11 o'clock at night,'' she
recalls. ``If I had a presentation that next morning, I was not
stressed out staying up. I'd work the night before and stay up til
3 in the morning if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she's a mom, Hainlin says she's changed her ways. She
had to. ``Children can't wait. You can't say, `Hang on honey, I'll
feed you in a couple hours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Productivity, Hainlin says, is enhanced by these four factors:
</P>
<P>
   Prioritization. ``You absolutely have to prioritize how and when
you're going to use your time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Planning. ``To get done what you want to get done, you have to
plan ahead of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology. ``I use e-mail instead of the phone, I have a Palm
Pilot I carry around with me, and I never put it down. I have a
headset for my phone so when I am on the phone on a call, I can be
doing other things, hands free,'' Hainlin says.
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility. ``I recognize now, and I didn't before, the need
for flexibility. Not only flexibility on my part because I
understand I truly don't control things, but also for my need for
flexibility at home and on the job,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected happens. Flexibility is the key to keeping up. In
fact, as a volunteer, Hainlin's work is the result of her ability
to work in an accommodating environment. ``I work 20 hours a week
and couldn't do that without flexibility,'' she says.

HUD'S GUN BUY-BACK PROGRAM UNAUTHORIZED, CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs to add words ``denied that'' in 11th graf   beginning
``In a telephone x x x.)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Defying congressional Republicans, the Clinton
administration says that it will continue paying local governments
to buy back guns from private owners despite orders from House
budget appropriators to end the program.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Buyback America, the $15 million program is intended to
reduce gun violence in cities, particularly around public housing
projects, by helping the police and housing authorities purchase
firearms for about $50 each, with no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Clinton unveiled the program last September, 70
cities, including San Francisco, Hartford, Conn., Atlanta,
Baltimore, Md., Newark, N.J., and Houston, have spent $3.5 million
to buy more than 17,300 guns, most of which have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   But from its inception, the program has been sharply criticized
by the National Rifle Association and by opponents of gun control
in Congress, as a waste of money that leaves guns in the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
appropriations subcommittee that oversees the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, told the agency's secretary, Andrew Cuomo,
to stop financing the program.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Cuomo, Walsh said that existing law did not
authorize such spending, a position supported by the General
Accounting Office, a nonpartisan congressional research agency.
Programs in at least 30 cities have been put on hold because of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement President Clinton planned to release Sunday,
he asserts that the housing department has clear legal authority to
finance the program, which he contends will help prevent ``an
untold number of gun accidents, suicides and crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite HUD's clear authority to carry out this important
program, the gun lobby and other opponents of common-sense gun
safety measures continue to challenge this initiative,'' Clinton
says in the statement. ``Congress should put the public safety
interests of American families above those of the gun lobby and
support these efforts instead of working to undermine them.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over Buyback America comes at a time when gun control
is playing an increasingly prominent role in the fall elections.
The NRA and the gun industry, as well as gun control groups, are
promising to spend record amounts helping to elect their respective
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also say they expect to use the issue to
underscore sharp ideological differences between Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. Gore, the presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee, supports an array of tougher gun laws, while
Bush, the likely Republican candidate, opposes most new gun
restrictions and has been a strong ally of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Walsh denied that he had been
pressured by the NRA or its allies in Congress. The Republican
whip, Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, a leading supporter of the
association, is a member of Walsh's subcommittee. And its ranking
Democrat, Rep. Allan Mollohan of West Virginia, who co-signed the
letter to Cuomo, is considered a loyal ally of the rifle
association by gun-control advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said he acted on his own because he believed that federal
money was being spent inappropriately, draining money from a
program to fight drugs in public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration has found the gun lobby to be an
excellent whipping boy,'' he said. ``But I have not consistently
supported or opposed the gun lobby. This is just an appropriators'
responsibility to make sure that funds are spent appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo disputed that, saying in an interview, ``I have no
doubt the NRA and like groups are behind many of these anti-gun
safety maneuvers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what would happen if the buyback program continued, Walsh
said that housing officials could be fined or even jailed. But he
said he was not sure he was prepared to seek such penalties.
</P>
<P>
   The buyback program has proven popular in many cities. In Corpus
Christi, Texas, officials spent their entire grant of $19,500 to
buy 260 guns in just one day, turning away more than 100 people the
next morning. In Davenport, Iowa, a $21,000 grant was spent in
under three hours to buy 420 guns.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the program said each gun purchased removed a
serious hazard. But the NRA contends most of the guns bought back
are old, cheap weapons that are unlikely to be used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Some gun control advocates agree with that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not getting street crime guns,'' said Kristen Rand,
staff counsel for the Violence Policy Center, which lobbies for gun
control.

 &HT;    Taste great and good for you
 &HT;    By Sofia Villalobos
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EATON, Ohio _ Sour apple, cinnamon, root beer or mint chocolate
_ choose a flavor. Parents can take a vacation from tantrums and
screeching cries since pharmacist-technician Kenneth Kramm invented
Flavorx _ 42 flavors to cover the bitter taste of some prescribed
and over-the-counter liquid medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular flavors are bubblegum, cherry and grape,''
said Edee Gosnell, a registered pharmacist and owner of Medicap
Pharmacy in Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   Used to cover even the most brutal antibiotic, the concoction
isn't quite as popular as it could be, but the solution is
beginning to grow. ``We have posters and advertisements telling
customers they can bring their medication and have it flavored for
$3,'' Gosnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Just like an ice cream shop, a large menu hangs from the ceiling
for customers to choose and even try their preferred gusto. The
concoction is easy to swallow, but doesn't taste like candy. ``It
makes the medicine more palatable, but not so good that a child
would want to drink the entire bottle,'' said Gosnell.
</P>
<P>
   According to his Web site, www.flavorx.com, Kramm and his father
began experimenting with the flavors because Kramm's daughter,
Hadley, who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy as an infant, would
gag and even vomit her medication. If she did not absorb the proper
amounts of medicine, Hadley would suffer seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington, D.C., resident says his daughter's condition has
stabilized since she has been able to consuming the proper
medication and keep it down.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Kroger pharmacies in the Miami Valley began
offering Flavorx, charging $3 a shot. ``But not all 42 flavors can
be mixed with just any medication,'' said Mike Davidson, a
registered pharmacist at Kroger. ``My 5-year-old daughter Shelby is
kind of picky and we've had to change the flavor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a child doesn't care for the first taste chosen, parents can
have the medicine reflavored two or three times free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Flavorx does not alter the effectiveness of the drug taken. An
over-the-counter bottle of cough medicine works just as well after
the few flavorful drops are figured in. And there is no age
restriction _ adults can be choosy, too.
</P>
<P>
   If the children are fine, but you need help getting the cat to
swallow his hairball medicine, Flavorx Veterinary System is working
on a version for pets. Flavors like beef, tuna or liver have been
launched to help owners avoid kitty scratches and barks of disgust.
</P>
<P>
   And, Kramm notes on the Web site: ``Dogs like peanut butter and
birds like grape.''

SEARCHING FOR WAYS TO DESIGN FASTEST CAR
</HEADLINE>
  By BRAD SPURGEON

<P>
   It helps to know the ingredients before baking the cake.
</P>
<P>
   And Formula One's point standings before the 11th race of the
season, at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim on Sunday, have
rarely illustrated better how few teams really know how to cook up
a great car. The leaders, Ferrari and McLaren, have 92 and 88
points, respectively _ sharing all the victories _ while Williams,
in third place, has only 19.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Formula One different from most other racing series
is that each team must build its own car according to a highly
complex recipe _ the technical regulations set by the International
Automobile Federation, the sport's governing body _ rather than
buying an off-the-shelf chassis from a car manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in car quality between teams, said Gary Anderson,
the technical director at Jaguar, is because each of the 11 teams
in the sport have been able to master the construction of only a
certain percentage of the parts of a car.
</P>
<P>
   While Jaguar may have mastered 70 percent, McLaren and Ferrari
will have mastered 80 percent. Every year a team can improve on the
parts they understand best, he added, but it takes time, money and
risk to research and develop the parts they do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like making a cake when you've got seven ingredients, but
really there should be 10 ingredients,'' Anderson said. ``And no
matter how precise you are with the seven ingredients, it still
won't make the cake better until you discover what those other
three are that you're missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If each team could master every one of the car's 3,000 parts,
they would also be able to improve on those from year to year and
make a car much faster,'' he said. ``But without all the
ingredients, research sometimes leads them up the wrong track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say there's something silly in the steering geometry that we
don't understand yet,'' he said. ``I may make a mistake on that and
make it worse. But we don't know we've made it worse because we
don't know it exists yet as far as the performance value of the
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep on looking into the unknown to see what parts
really make a difference on the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Herbert, the Jaguar driver who has driven for seven
different teams over 11 seasons, said that teams almost always
improve their new-model cars _ built between the seasons _ but that
a car's relative value can be learned only during the races.
</P>
<P>
   ``While you may have done a one-second jump in lap time compared
to the year before, the other teams may have done two seconds,''
Herbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like last year the car was quite good and we were, relative to
everybody else, quite competitive. This year the car is better than
last year, but relative to the rest, it's not as competitive as it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   A poorly conceived car has little hope of a quick-fix remedy,
said Mario Ilien, the designer of the Mercedes engine, which powers
the McLaren, and not even the best engine will improve a bad
chassis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put the new engine in the new car, you might have
some surprises because some of the auxiliary things like the fuel
system, the oil system or cooling system might not work in harmony
with the engine,'' he said. ``But that's not so difficult to sort
out. With a chassis it's a different issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Development then becomes a matter between the drivers and the
engineers as they try to find the best setup and add-on parts to
make for a faster drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it all depends on how good it is when it first goes on the
track,'' Herbert said. ``You can make a bad car maybe OK, but you
can't make it a very good car. And you can probably make a good car
possibly very good if you do the right things to it. Just a very
good car is a very good car.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Head, the technical director at Williams, disagrees.
``The Lotus 72 when it first ran was a bit of a disaster,'' he
said. ``But they went away and did some pretty major modifications
and it came back and won the world championship.''
</P>
<P>
   But that car, with which Jochen Rindt became world champion
posthumously in 1970, was built and modified in an era when the
recipe was much less byzantine than it is today.

 &HT;    `Harry' stirs publishing cauldron
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When is a bestseller not a best seller? Well, if
it's a children's book, it might be a different kind of best seller
than you thought.
</P>
<P>
   Next question: When is a children's book not quite a children's
book? Well, maybe when lots of adults are reading it, too.
</P>
<P>
   We're beating around the bush here to get to the same place
everybody seems to be getting these days _ which of course is to
Harry Potter Land, a magical place that's changing more than just
the reading habits of millions of children.
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, of course. With the possible exception of a
few oddballs who think J.K. Rowling's little literary wizard is the
work of (gasp!) Satan, nearly every parent, librarian, teacher and
book dealer you can find thinks it's terrific that the four Potter
books are attracting kids who would normally be locked onto video
screens till their eyes bleed.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've been living under a rock, you know by now that
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' has sold a gazillion copies
in its first few weeks, and kids by the score are downing the
752-pager in a single weekend, kerplunk.
</P>
<P>
   But publishing being a business, there are ripples caused by
that much money being spent on something. Publishers and
booksellers have been unhappy, for one thing, to see Harry Potter
taking up so darn much space on that most venerated of book-market
indicators, the New York Times best-seller list.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the list changed. The Times Book Review created a
separate list for children's books (see today's ReadingRoom, page
8C). This moved Harry over and let folks like Danielle Steel, James
Patterson and John Grisham back on top, where Rowling and her
creation had been roosting.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McGrath, editor of the Book Review, admits that the
change was made to keep the best-seller list from being
overHarrywhelmed, but says that's not meant as a negative
reflection on Potter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some complaints that Harry Potter has been relegated
to the minor leagues,'' McGrath said. ``But I'm hoping at least
someone will like it. We've been talking about making a children's
list forever, and the intention was to children's books some
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some folks might worry that it could also raise the financial
stakes on a genre that so far has escaped the blockbuster mentality
that drives adult publishing and other media, but Jean Gaffney
isn't worried. ``I'm an optimist,'' she says. ``I think a good
author and a good book will always find their place.'' And she
thinks the Harry Potter books are very, very good _ classic, even.
</P>
<P>
   She should know. She's the children's librarian at the
Miamisburg branch of the Dayton-Montgomery County Public Library,
and a former Caldecott Award juror. She's watched kids devour the
books and then, when they're done, look around for other good stuff
to read.
</P>
<P>
   Upsides to Potterism, she says, are that it's made it cooler for
boys to read, has stimulated book talk among kids who previously
couldn't imagine such a thing, and also raises the profile of
children's fiction _ which sometimes has taken a back seat,
marketwise, to picture books for younger kids.
</P>
<P>
   Roth says, ``The good news for us is we now have 15 children's
books on the best-seller list. Before, it was just three,'' the
Potter books on the main list. ``This is more a celebration of all
children's books and authors. So we like that.''

BUSH'S STANCE ON EDUCATION PREVAILS IN BATTLE ON PLANK

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ After a fierce debate, the Republican platform
committee Saturday voted against a call to abolish the Department
of Education, with some conservatives warning that the party was
breaking with the small-government principles of the Reagan
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   It was a victory for Gov. George W. Bush, who has campaigned
hard on education, and it was emblematic of his allies' efforts to
reorient the party, on a small set of issues high on the voters'
agenda, to a more centrist appeal. On other matters, though, from
opposition to gays in the military to contraceptives in
school-based clinics, conservatives held sway Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Saturday's education debate revolved around the way the
party's less-government-is-best philosophy is viewed by the voters
at large. ``When you say the abolishment of the Department of
Education,'' argued Sen &UR; . &LR;  Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a Bush ally, many
people hear ``that we don't care about education _ and if there's
one thing Republicans care about, it's kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Williams of Oklahoma, a conservative committee member who
pushed for the abolition, argued, ``We need to remain true to what
President Reagan began with our revolution in the '80s; that the
government is too large, too costly, and control needs to be
returned to the states.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., countered, ``We deal every day with
people who are scared to death that Republicans want to do away
with education.''
</P>
<P>
   After the votes, which also reinserted elements of the Bush
education program that had been stripped by conservatives in
subcommittee, Bush spokesmen declared a major victory. Ari
Fleischer declared it a ``marked departure from the '96 platform,''
and added that, ``We did make it clear to delegates that this was a
crucial issue to Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   As it pushed toward completion of its work, the 107-member
platform committee reasserted that ``homosexuality is incompatible
with military service,'' overwhelmingly rejecting efforts to remove
that plank. Fleischer noted that ``the governor believes `don't
ask, don't tell' is the appropriate policy and he supports that.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also rejected an attempt to defend contraceptive
services in school-based clinics. Philip Hellreich, a committee
member from Hawaii who offered the amendment, argued that as a
doctor, he saw too many teen-agers with unwanted pregnancies.
``Without the appropriate use of contraceptives,'' he argued, ``we
will have many, many more unwanted pregnancies.'' Opponents, who
asserted that abstinence was the appropriate course, easily
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   While the party's platform does not call for the abolition of
any federal agencies _ four years ago, it called for several _ it
still reflects a party deeply suspicious of the federal government
and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The platform reiterates one of the guiding principles of modern
conservatism _ that more and more power should be shifted to the
states: ``The dramatic success of welfare reform _ once states were
allowed to manage their programs _ is a stellar example of what
happens when we give power back to the people,'' the platform
declares. ``We must acknowledge as a general matter of course that
the federal government's role should be to set high standards and
expectations in policies, then get out of the way and let the
states implement and operate those policies as they best know
how.''
</P>
<P>
   The power of conservatives was perhaps most clear on the issue
of abortion and gay rights. Abortion rights supporters tried on
several occasions to remove the abortion plank or add a provision
recognizing and expressing respect for Republicans who hold
different views on the issue, but they were decisively beaten each
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is are we a pro-life party or are we a
pro-abortion rights party,'' declared Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a
staunch opponent of abortion. ``It's left to the Republicans, the
heartless Republicans, to care about the unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   With a graphic description of what opponents call partial birth
abortion, Hyde declared, ``If this party stands for nothing else,
it ought to stand for violent objection to that butchery.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of that struggle were pre-ordained; Bush and top
Republican leaders had announced early on that they wanted the
abortion plank left alone. Democrats and abortion rights supporters
see it as an important vulnerability in the fall election, because
it calls for a blanket ban on abortion and the appointment of
judges who reflect the party's philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   On gay rights, conservatives declared repeatedly that the party
needed to put itself wholeheartedly on record against recognizing
civil unions between homosexuals, and added a provision to the
platform defining marriage as ``the legal union of one man and one
woman.'' They also added language declaring, ``We do not believe
sexual preference should be given special legal protection or
standing in law.'' And the platform reiterates its contention that
homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, a leading conservative, said in an interview that he
was pleased with the platform. ``On the sanctity of life, it's
solid and consistent with the past,'' he said. ``I think it's a
strong conservative platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, another veteran conservative activist, said:
``I think it's wordier and not as good as '96. Of course, we kept
the pro-life plank, but I thought the '96 platform was better.''

ARAFAT SEEKS SUPPORT ON TOUR, ACCUSING ISRAEL OF LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Story rewritten throughout.)  
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A deeply disgruntled Yasser Arafat left his base in
the Gaza Strip on Saturday on a diplomatic tour aimed at
solidifying Palestinian support in the wake of the Camp David
talks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Palestinian leader departed for Paris, where he was to
meet President Jacques Chirac before visits to Russia and several
key Arab nations, he gave vent to some of the frustration and anger
that have built up among Palestinians since the Camp David talks
broke up on Tuesday over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks since the talks, President Clinton and Ehud Barak,
the Israeli prime minister, have represented Arafat as the spoiler
who wrecked the possibility of a wide-ranging peace agreement by
rejecting U.S. proposals for the future of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian anger was compounded on Friday when Clinton, seeking
to bolster Barak's political standing in Israel ahead of a crucial
parliamentary no-confidence vote on Monday, gave an interview to
Israeli television saying that Israel's flexible stance at Camp
David had pushed him toward a decision to move the U.S. Embassy in
Israel to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Palestinian reaction, aides to Arafat said they
would go ahead on Sunday with a meeting between senior Palestinian
and Israeli representatives on the border of the Gaza Strip that
both sides have depicted as a resumption of the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But with Arafat traveling and Barak fighting for political
survival, officials on both sides said they expected the new talks
to be brief, and to avoid entanglement on the complex issue of
Jerusalem. ``It's mainly just to show we're still talking,'' one
senior Israeli official said.
</P>
<P>
   By raising the possibility of a presidential order for the
embassy to be moved from Tel Aviv, and saying he would make the
decision before the end of the year, Clinton delighted the Jews,
and enraged the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Although largely symbolic when measured against the financial
and diplomatic support the United States has given Israel since
1948, the fact that the U.S. Embassy, along with those of most
other nations, has remained in Tel Aviv has always been taken as a
signal that Washington has not prejudged the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gaza airport, Arafat avoided direct criticism of Clinton,
and of the president's remarks about the embassy issue, masking the
deep dismay that aides said he had expressed privately about
Clinton's remarks since the Camp David talks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Arafat focused on the Israelis, saying that his
diplomatic tour would seek to counter ``the big lies'' that had
characterized Israeli accounts of Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put our friends and our brothers, the Arabs and the
Europeans, far away from the Israeli propaganda and big lies that
they are trying to put out about what happened at Camp David,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem were broadcast just as
the Sabbath began on Friday evening, there was little formal
reaction from Israeli politicians. Privately, many were delighted,
although some right-wingers were critical of Clinton for
intervening to help Barak win Monday's no-confidence votes in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli news reports said Barak had sought a gesture from
Clinton that would bolster him particularly with right-wing and
religious groups whose votes in Parliament could determine whether
his government survives.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli news reports on Friday said that Clinton made the
remarks as a direct result of a telephone call from Barak asking
for a gesture that would bolster his support with the Israeli
public, and in particular with right-wing and religious groups that
will determine whether the government survives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the interview to reiterate his praise of Barak
after the Camp David talks, describing him as ``more creative and
more courageous'' than Arafat in his readiness to accept painful
compromises over Jerusalem. He said Barak had ``done everything he
could to reach agreement while backing the vital interests of
Israel,'' and chided Arafat for saying that the Palestinians would
go ahead with a formal declaration of Palestinian statehood after
Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any direct response from Arafat, the
Palestinians made their views known through Hanan Ashrawi, who
frequently acts as a spokesman for the Palestinian cause. In
remarks to Agence France-Presse, Ashrawi said that Clinton's
remarks exposed the ``underlying American bias'' in the peace
process, and added, ``It sounds like blatant political blackmail,
all in the interest of Barak.'' At another point, she said that the
television interview amounted to ``pandering to Barak and Clinton's
domestic needs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian media in recent months have frequently alleged
that Clinton has tilted increasingly toward the Israelis in an
attempt to help Hillary Rodham Clinton in her Senate election
campaign in New York. The White House has ridiculed the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas, the militant Islamic movement that has vigorously opposed
Arafat's engagement in the peace effort, was even more strident
about Clinton's remarks on moving the embassy. Mahmoud al-Zahhar, a
senior Hamas aide, hinted that the group could attack American
installations in the Middle East if the move went ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamas will be the first to fight against this issue, and it's
not only Hamas,'' he said in an interview with Reuters. ``The
entire interests of the United States will be in danger in all
Islamic states. Moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem would
be regarded as American recognition of Israel's occupation of
Jerusalem, which is a flagrant challenge to Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   On his tour of Europe and Arab nations, which his aides said
would include Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia, and possibly other,
non-Arab Muslim states, Arafat will in effect be countering a U.S.
diplomatic offensive in support of Clinton's peace proposals, and
in particular the U.S. plan for Jerusalem. That proposal would give
the Palestinians limited authority in parts of east Jerusalem in
return for giving up their claim to all the eastern half of the
city, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who stopped in Egypt on his way home Wednesday, will be
trying to blunt the impact of a tour beginning this week by Edward
Walker, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern
affairs, who is a former ambassador to Israel and Egypt. The State
Department announced on Friday that Walker would visit 14 countries
over the next several weeks, apparently in a bid to change Arab
thinking on Jerusalem. Most of the Arab reaction since Camp David,
from governments and in the media, has been strongly supportive of
Arafat's demand that ``all of Jerusalem'' be returned to the
Palestinians in a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Arafat were at pains not to depict the Palestinian
leader as opening a political battle with Clinton. At Gaza airport,
reporters were told that Arafat had received a private letter of
``encouragement and praise'' from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Palestinian officials urged Clinton to remain impartial.
``We hope he will remain fair in all issues relating to us,'' said
Nabil Shaath, who was an adviser to Arafat at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Barak needs all the help he can get if he
is to survive as Israel's leader. A post-Camp David poll published
in Friday's Jerusalem Post suggested a new drop in Barak's
popularity, with 53 percent of the respondents saying the Israeli
leader ``offered too much'' at Camp David, 11 per cent saying he
didn't offer enough, and 28 per cent saying he ``offered the right
amount,'' on Jerusalem and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also showed that a growing number of Israelis favor an
election over the peace process, and would prefer a national unity
government over the option Barak has pursued of reconstituting the
coalition that collapsed before Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political commentators said that they still expected
Barak to win on Monday, but that the situation remained touch and
go. They said much depended on whether Barak could persuade David
Levy, the foreign minister, who refused to travel to Camp David,
not to abandon the coalition, a step that would swing the three
votes Levy controls in the 120-seat Knesset into the anti-Barak
camp. Levy, sharply critical of Barak's performance at Camp David,
has said he will make up his mind on Sunday.

RAYMOND PORTWOOD JR., 66, COMPUTER GAME PIONEER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Ill.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raymond Eugene Portwood Jr., who began working as an animator
with the Walt Disney Co. at 17 and went on to become one of the two
principal creators of the pioneering and popular Carmen Sandiego
series of children's computer games, died July 17 in Windsor,
Calif. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   Portwood died of a heart attack at a convalescent center, where
he had lived since a stroke 18 months ago, according to his wife,
Myra Bates Portwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmen Sandiego games, a painless way to learn academic
subjects by following an animated vamp in a trench coat around on
the computer, have sold 6.5 million copies and led to three
television series. Introduced in 1985, the game was one of the
first approaches to computerized education for children, and it
remains one of the most popular.
</P>
<P>
   With his colleague, Lauren Elliott, Portwood is credited with
dreaming up Carmen Sandiego, who, as a former secret agent gone
bad, is the ringleader of a gang of eccentric provocateurs who roam
the world causing trouble, usually by stealing a treasure of local
significance. The player assumes the role of Interpol detective,
tracking Carmen Sandiego or her henchmen from city to city and
nation to nation on the basis of clues provided by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She changed all her money for zlotys,'' a witness might say,
prompting an informed player to head for Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Portwood and Elliott worked principally on the first two Carmen
games, ``Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?'' and ``Where in
the U.S.A. Is Carmen Sandiego?'' Many more games followed, covering
subjects like math and history.
</P>
<P>
   It began in a spare building in San Rafael, Calif., that was the
home of Broderbund Software. The company's creative team would meet
in what was called the rubber room to bounce around ideas.
Portwood's artistic sensibility was critical to the process, his
colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other people could talk it,'' said Douglas Carlston, a founder
of Broderbund. ``He could see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlston gives Portwood much of the credit for Carmen. ``If he
wasn't the most key guy, he was one of the most key guys,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bull, a software engineer who was part of the original
design team, said that Portwood was responsible for ``a large part
of the original concept.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carmen games were some of the first to move computer games
out of the arcade and into the classroom. In 1987, Ariella Lehrer,
president of Lehrer Associates, a Los Angeles-based educational
software consulting firm, said, ``This software gets high praise
from teachers because it combines so many subjects and reference
skills, and kids never get tired of it because the computer
generates clues and geographic settings at random.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Broderbund's best-selling products, Carmen Sandiego
helped the company become so successful as a software maker that it
was bought by the Learning Co. in June 1998 in a stock swap valued
at $420 million. In May 1999, Mattel bought the Learning Co. for
$3.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Myra Portwood said her husband and Elliott had no chance to cash
in on the financial bonanza personally. Although they received
substantial royalties for the first two Carmen games, she said,
Broderbund changed its compensation arrangements for later
versions. As a result, she said, the two developers left in 1992
and formed their own game company, Elliott Portwood Productions.
</P>
<P>
   Portwood was born in Chicago on Sept. 16, 1933, the son of a
house painter. When he was 11, the family moved to Burbank, Calif.
He showed talent for drawing cartoon characters, and a family
friend introduced him to a Disney animator, who invited him to
submit a portfolio of his work.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, he joined the Disney animation army of more than 200. He
did not attend college, but read voraciously and became known for
his vast vocabulary. He loved old movies, music and practical
jokes. He positively delighted in turning language upside down.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his and Elliott's last company was in Petaluma,
Calif. His resultant joke: ``You can pet a cat, but you can't pet a
luma.''
</P>
<P>
   At Disney, he worked on films including ``Lady and the Tramp''
and ``Sleeping Beauty.'' For ``Peter Pan,'' he contributed to the
famous scene in which a crocodile chases Captain Hook. In those
precomputer days, each frame had to be laboriously prepared by an
assembly line of artisans. Portwood was a link in that chain.
</P>
<P>
   In his five years at Disney, he also frequently worked on the
Jiminy Cricket animations that introduced segments of Disney's
evening television program. ``He said he'd probably drawn more
crickets than anybody on the planet,'' Carlston said.
</P>
<P>
   To earn more money for his growing family, Portwood took jobs
with Security National Bank in Orange County, Honeywell
International and the University of California.
</P>
<P>
   After a divorce, he married his second wife, who operated a
bakery in Sebastopol, Calif., where he lived until his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; his daughters, Kim Portwood of Santa
Rosa, Calif., and Kathi Gamberutti, Kari Hermanson, Kelley Portwood
and Kristi Portwood, all of Monterey, Calif.; and two sisters,
Lynette Foster of Redondo Beach, Calif., and Darlene Insley of
Santa Cruz, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Portwood's job at Broderbund was the culmination of all his
passions, his wife said. For one thing, he was paid to play with
words, one of his favorite things. Many of the names of Carmen
Sandiego's henchmen and henchwomen, said to have been his
creations, were either very inspired or very bad puns. Some
examples: Rob Burr, Clement See, Belle Igerent and Mandy Lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, he could play endlessly with computers; at
home, his wife finally had to put a sheet over the family PC to
have any hope of catching his attention.

LEGENDS OF NFL WELCOME THE CLASS OF 2000 TO THE HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ One hundred eleven of pro football's 136 living
Hall of Fame members strode onto the stage here, a place revered by
the owners, coaches, and athletes who play the game, and by the
fans who follow them.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Gillman entered in a wheelchair. Roger Staubach and Joe
Namath glided across the stage to thunderous applause. Franco
Harris and John Mackey and Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh and so many
more champions were introduced, a throng of football heroes
immersed in a pool of adoring onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Super Bowl of enshrinement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   There will never be another ceremony that features this many
20th century members.
</P>
<P>
   That drama and appreciation of history served as the backdrop
for the induction of the class of 2000. And matching the moment was
a noble and glitzy class, one of the most complete and interesting
since the first enshrinement in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Montana, Ronnie Lott, Dave Wilcox, Howie Long and Dan Rooney
shared a common theme of thanks to family, friends and teammates
who helped them reach the Hall. And their reception overflowed with
interest and emotion from the thousands of fans packed around the
Hall, easily the largest crowd for an induction here.
</P>
<P>
   There were many moments that will be chronicled in pictures and
in sound. Moments that will last inside the Hall of Fame _ along
with a bronze bust of each _ forever. This group pushed the total
number in the Hall to 204.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox was the first to be inducted Saturday, and he spoke
unselfishly about the friends he has gained in the NFL and about
his magical memories. Wilcox played linebacker for the San
Francisco 49ers from 1964 through 1974, and he was presented by one
of his coaches, Mike Giddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football gave me a chance to meet people and to travel all
over the world,'' Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me if I played with Joe Montana with the 49ers, and
I tell them I played before Joe and before money. I earned $12,500
a season. But the memories are wonderful. And now there are 204
people in this Hall and in the next 100 years, at that rate, there
will be 904. That is still so few. This is so very special.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, a defensive end who played with the Raiders from 1981 to
1993, said that baseball is America's pastime but that football is
``America's passion.'' He was introduced by Earl Leggett, his
former line coach.
</P>
<P>
   Leggett said that Long was the right pick for the right team and
the right time for the Raiders. He said Long was the best leader he
had ever been around. Long is one of only seven defensive ends to
reach the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud that I played my entire career with the Raiders
because that is something that rarely happens in today's game,''
Long said, referring to current players who frequently move to
other teams via free agency. ``I have always appreciated the
history of this league. Now my sons have watched film of my career
this week and they say: `Wow, Dad, you were pretty good. You were
pretty tough, too.' Their love means more to me than anything in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, said Long, does his 22-year marriage to his wife,
Dianne, who, he said, has been his confidante, friend and
counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Lott chose his father, Roy, to present him. Lott was a 49ers
safety from 1981 to 1990, and then spent two seasons with the
Raiders and two more with the Jets before retiring in 1994. He was
a ferocious and feared hitter, but his father talked about his
compassion and his love.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, the former quarterback, was presented by the former
49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr., who said that Montana's legacy is
``much larger than life'' and who described how Montana ``turned
losses into wins.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo praised Montana's ``unmatched loyalty, excellence,
courage and heroics,'' and said, ``They will live in our hearts and
dreams forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana offered humor, pulling out a long sheet that he said
contained his speech.
</P>
<P>
   But Montana went on the speak emotionally about how he felt over
the last six months, as if ``I'm in my grave and people are
throwing dirt on my coffin and I'm trying to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The glowing praise and retrospect on his career made him
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I didn't understand what this was all about until
I got here this weekend and saw all of these guys and realized I
was on a new team,'' Montana said. ``This is not the ending point
but the beginning of my career and life with a new team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, was presented by the Hall
of Famer Joe Greene, a former Steeler. Rooney has spent the last 45
years with the Steelers. Now he and the rest of the class of 2000
will be recognized forever in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many to thank,'' Rooney said. ``I thank them
all.''

WITH GOP GUESTS, CAMDEN TRIES TO PAINT OVER ITS ROT 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ For just one evening, this city is trying not to
ooze misery. It deployed the Public Works Department's only
grass-cutter to mow vacant lots downtown, forsaking 2,000 others
that needed tending. The streets need cleaning, but the city's
seven sweepers are old and broken. Camden has 3,500 vacant
buildings, but only a three-man crew to keep them boarded up.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are coming to Camden on Sunday night, and the
task of making the East St. Louis of the East presentable would
have challenged Potemkin himself.
</P>
<P>
   Welcoming ceremonies for the Republican National Convention will
be held on Camden's waterfront, the only redeveloped slice of the
city. It offers great views of Philadelphia's skyline, and of the
lighted boat show and fireworks planned on the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   But coming to New Jersey through Camden is like entering a
split-level through the mud room, and cleaning for the guests has
been a chore.
</P>
<P>
   Just over the Ben Franklin Bridge from Philadelphia, state and
regional officials recently spent $45 million to clear out
unsightly businesses on Admiral Wilson Boulevard, including topless
joints and by-the-hour hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Camden has 209 miles of road, but attention has focused on four
routes through downtown to the waterfront. Crumbling buildings have
been knocked down, rotting trees uprooted, flowers and shrubs
planted, broken windows covered with fresh gray boards and light
posts decked with banners. The road to the newly docked USS New
Jersey is lined with shipping containers that hide industrial
detritus. On the waterfront, mulch has been blown among fresh beds
of flowers, and at the Children's Garden near the state aquarium,
the newest creature is an elephant topiary named George, as in W.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first impression is important,'' said Gov. Christie
Whitman, Sunday night's host. But it can also mislead.
</P>
<P>
   As the VIP's gaze at Philadelphia, here's what will be festering
in the city of 82,000 behind their backs: school dropout rates as
high as 60 percent. Almost 40 percent of households earning less
than $20,000. A tax base that yields only about $29 million for
combined city and school expenses of $350 million. A mayor indicted
on corruption charges, like two of his last four predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a casualty,'' said the Rev. Michael Doyle, a priest in
South Camden for 32 years, ``and America is to blame for a Camden.
They don't see it that way. It's like a drunk on a grate and people
say, `It's not my problem.' If you can't save a Camden in a
powerful economy, then when will we be able to make it livable?
When?''
</P>
<P>
   There are glimmers of hope _ a few remaining corporations, the
waterfront, some renovated housing _ but they are hard to spot amid
weed-choked lots, abandoned homes and the addicted roaming like
stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who is waging a legislative battle to seize control of
Camden, said she was shaken by the depth of its problems during a
nighttime tour with state troopers in 1996. That trip recently
produced a photograph of the smiling governor frisking an innocent
black man. Back here the other day to award some grants, she said
that after that tour, ``All I could think of was what would I have
been like if this was my environment growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Shinnelle Queensbury perhaps could suggest an answer. At 14, she
lives in the South Camden neighborhood the governor visited the
other day. Despite a family history laced with drugs and prison,
Shinnelle is a serious student at the Creative Arts High School,
taking summer enrichment courses and singing and dancing in a local
production of ``Secrets Every Smart Traveler Should Know.'' Despite
the pressures of the street, she could do a one-girl show of the
same name for Sunday night's visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait until you get to my block,'' she said, leaving the
commotion around the governor. She lives with her grandparents, and
there is only one other house on her side of the street that is not
boarded up. ``A brick fell out of that house and almost hit me,''
she said of a crumbling building on the corner.
</P>
<P>
   On her block, she said, ``the police patrol, but the drug boys
run.'' Her teachers are encouraging, but neighbors razz her
because, she said, ``I like to talk with proper English.'' Imagine
coming home from school happy, she said, only to learn ``one of
your relatives has done something wrong or someone was shot in
front of your aunt's house.''
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, Camden adopted Walt Whitman's poetic line: ``In a
dream I saw a city invincible.'' That dream is long gone, but
flashes of resilience remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really trying,'' Shinnelle Queensbury said, crossing the
deserted street on her way to sing and dance, ``but there's so many
things pulling me down.''

ROBERT MCFARLAND, 62, BROADCAST JOURNALIST  

</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert McFarland, a former correspondent, producer and

 &HT;    Wolff's at door of major role
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It didn't take a full-page color spread in Rolling
Stone for Josh Wolff to realize that he isn't in Lilburn, Ga.
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening page of the magazine's special July Olympic
fashion section was Wolff, wearing nearly $200 of designer
sportswear and flying through the air with five superimposed rings
around him. The shots of him and his U.S. men's soccer teammates
were placed ahead of a relaxed pose of Maurice Greene, the
100-meter dash favorite in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we'll take whatever we can get,'' Wolff said. ``It was a
lot of fun to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer always has been a lot of fun for Wolff, the former
standout striker at Parkview High School and for the Brookwood
Steamers elite youth program.
</P>
<P>
   He is certain to make the final Olympic roster that will be
announced next month
</P>
<P>
   Wolff is having his best professional season for the Chicago
Fire of Major League Soccer. In 14 starts, he has scored five
times, and on Tuesday he put his club in the quarterfinals of the
U.S. Open Cup with the only goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a knack for scoring in the clutch. His game-winner
in early June against Kansas City knocked off the last unbeaten MLS
team.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff's decision to turn pro after three seasons at the
University of South Carolina symbolizes the U.S. Soccer
Federation's attempt to accelerate the development of its men's
program. Only one current Olympic team member is an amateur, with
most of the rest based in MLS with Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran college and USSF staff coach Clive Charles will take a
more experienced group to Australia than the band of collegians,
indoor players and handful of European pros who represented the
U.S. in the 1990 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic men's soccer is limited to players 23 and under, except
for three older players allowed per team. Most countries use the
Olympics as a springboard for the World Cup and high-level club
competition. Nigeria won the gold in Atlanta, and several of its
players are now starring for some of the top clubs in Europe. So
are those from Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans just want to advance out of group play for the
first time and get a taste of the kind of international game they
will encounter at the senior level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is more pressure on this team, since we're the
first group to come out of a professional environment,'' Wolff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, who turned 23 in February, spent his first year playing
with an MLS developmental team. Then he went to Chicago, which won
the MLS title in 1998, its first season.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that has slowed him down was a torn knee ligament
suffered on a freak play during a training session last fall. He
lined up to practice a penalty kick, but his left knee crumbled
after just a few steps. He missed the rest of the playoffs but was
ready to go when spring training began in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee is fine, but it's harder coming back mentally than it
is physically,'' he said. ``It's a matter of staying in shape and
knowing it's going to get better every day. You're so eager to get
back to where you were. In April and May, I wasn't back to where I
felt really good about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But a groin injury to Bulgarian World Cup hero Hristo Stoichkov
and the call-up of high-scoring forward Ante Razov to the U.S.
national team for World Cup qualifying has given Wolff more playing
time.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 8 and with great mobility, he is ideally suited to
play beside target players. He has done so most of his career,
including pairing with Conyers native Clint Mathis at South
Carolina. During Olympic qualifying, he played a similar role with
Chris Albright of D.C. United and 18-year-old phenom Landon
Donovan, who out of high school turned pro with German club Bayer
Leverkusen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be good for me or the team to talk about who's
going to start at this point,'' coach Charles said. ``But I do see
Josh playing a major role for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the Olympic squad takes on the Bolton Wanderers, an
English Division One club, in an exhibition in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become better and smarter players because most of us
have been in a professional environment,'' Wolff said. ``The
toughest part is that we're not going to be together very much.
These games are going to be big because they're going to see where
we are as a team.''

AN IRANIAN STAR AT HOME IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the hundreds of thousands of Iranian expatriates in the Bay
Area of Northern California, the soccer star Khodadad Azizi was
hailed as a national hero when he arrived last March (along with
his wife and 3-year-old daughter) and signed a four-year contract
to play for the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer. Unlike
many of the aging players who have left leagues in Europe and South
America, Azizi, 29, came to the five-year-old U.S. league in his
prime, having played three seasons in Germany for F.C. Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Azizi led Iran to its first berth in the World Cup
finals since 1978 and played in the emotionally charged 2-1 victory
over the United States in Lyon, France. In 1997, he was the first
Iranian named the Asian Footballer of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   As the Earthquakes (5-10-8) have struggled in MLS this season,
so has Azizi. A lingering hamstring injury has limited him to 13
games, in which he has scored only one goal with four assists.
Still, Azizi, on the strength of balloting by his countrymen, was
voted to the starting lineup of Saturday's MLS All-Star Game in
Columbus, Ohio, finishing fourth among midfielders on the West team
with more than 27,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in New York the last week in June for a match
against the MetroStars, Azizi toured U.N. headquarters accompanied
by the Iranian ambassador, Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, and recorded a
public-service announcement in support of the international
anti-drug campaign, ``Sports, Not Drugs,'' which will be broadcast
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Azizi spoke about his career, his country and his move to the
United States with Jack Bell, a staff editor for the sports section
of The New York Times, with the assistance of an interpreter,
Mehran Molkara. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: You have been called the Persian Michael Jordan. Was there a
negative reaction at home when you decided to come to the United
States to play? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Look, I am a soccer player. I'm not involved with politics.
There was no negative reaction. The people in Iran have no problem
with the American people. They like Americans. There are a million
Iranians living in the U.S. There has got to be something good
about the United States. I always get phone calls from reporters in
Iran and they want to know how I have been treated. I talk about
the hospitality and the friendliness of people here. I think that
many people around the world dream of seeing the U.S. I love Iran
and can't truly live anywhere else. But after Iran, this is the
best place to live in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why, in the prime of your career, did you decide to come to
the United States? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: Because it is exciting and interesting. I still had the
opportunity to play in Europe, but after coming to the United
States for a friendly game (Iran-United States in January in
Pasadena, Calif.), after I saw all the Iranian fans, I made up my
mind to join MLS. I chose San Jose because of all the Iranian fans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You played several years in the Bundesliga, one of the
toughest leagues in the world. How would you compare the quality of
play in MLS? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: What surprised me the most is that the German league is very
physical, but I believe that MLS is more physical and hard.
Naturally, in Europe they don't consider MLS a top league, but I
believe people think it is going in the right direction and that it
is able to attract big stars.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have heard that women in Iran are not permitted to attend
soccer games. So what is your impression of the popularity of
women's soccer in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have seen a few games of the American team and, obviously,
they deserve to be No. 1 in the world. You can tell you have better
youth programs here for girls than anywhere else in the world. In
Iran, the reason that women are not allowed in the stadiums is
because of the intense environment. It is not a pleasant
environment for women to be in. Of course, that could be worked on.
This is not a difference in culture; it is a religious thing in
Iran. There is now a women's league in Iran, but you don't see men
going to watch the women play like in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the World Cup finals in 1998, many Americans looked at
the group that included the United States, Iran, Germany and
Yugoslavia and believed that a victory and three points against
Iran were a virtual certainty for them.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's exactly how we looked at it when we thought about
playing the U.S. We knew it would be harder to get points from
Germany and Yugoslavia. I know that the game was a big deal in
America, but it was even more important for the people of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You were in Iran recently for a tournament. Did you notice
any changes?
</P>
<P>
   A: The atmosphere in Iran is getting better every day, contrary
to what many people have heard in the West. The young people follow
what is happening in foreign countries. They want to and can visit
foreign lands. Travel is not restricted. In my personal opinion, I
think that people are more in tune with what is happening in the
world than they were 10 years ago.

PRETEENS AND OTHERS LEARN SAILING SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.)  (Eds: Herb McCormick is the editor of Cruising World magazine.) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To the discordant sounds of halyards slapping against
masts and sirens screeching down Storrow Drive last Wednesday,
11-year-old Brad Louw hauled in on the mainsheet, swung the tiller
over and instructed me to shove off. With a cold, unseasonable
northeast breeze filling the well-used sail of our ancient but
shipshape Cape Cod Mercury, Brad set a course down the gray Charles
River.
</P>
<P>
   As he eased the sheet expertly to spill a 15-knot gust, it was
hard to believe Brad had been sailing for less than two months. But
something in my movements did not inspire a corresponding sense of
confidence. ``So,'' Brad wondered, ``have you ever sailed before?''
</P>
<P>
   Had there been a free moment, I would have regaled the boy with
my sea tales. In that instant, however, Brad was smartly bearing
away to cut astern of a close-hauled Mercury with another urchin in
command. As for sea stories, he was too busy amassing his own.
</P>
<P>
   For over six decades at the full-service boathouse on the
Charles that serves as the headquarters of Community Boating Inc.,
countless sailors of all ages have been logging similar personal
adventures. Today, those between the ages of 10 and 18 can follow
Brad's example and take advantage of the best deal in boating.
Early last month, having just moved to the states with his family
from South Africa, he walked in and plunked down a dollar, which
paid for a summer's worth of lessons, boat rentals and experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations like Milwaukee Community Sailing, St. Petersburg
Sailing Center in Florida, the Dana Point Youth and Group Facility
in California, and the Long Shore Sailing School in Westport,
Conn., all offer similar programs for youths and adults.
</P>
<P>
   A national directory of community sailing offerings called
``Where to Sail'' is available on the U.S. Sailing Web site
(www.ussailing.org), or by calling (401) 683-0800.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last decade, the growth in publicly accessible sailing
opportunities has been huge,'' said Kim Hapgood, the program
director at Rhode Island's Sail Newport center and a member of the
U.S. Sailing council on community sailing. ``An increasing number
of people are attracted by the challenges sailing offers, and it
also appeals to people who already like to sail but don't want to
own boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1937 by a bullheaded, well-connected social
worker named Joe Lee, Boston's Community Boating Inc. is the
granddaddy of public sailing centers. Lee, who started with seven
ragtag boats with sails fashioned from bedsheets, would be startled
if he could see today's fleet of 75 Mercurys, five Sonars, six
Rhodes 19s, and about a dozen 420s, sailboards, Lasers and kayaks,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday afternoon, with a miserable forecast better suited
to an afternoon in a library or a theater, about 50 diehard kids of
varied ethnic backgrounds _ down from the hundreds who would gather
on a typical July day _ lingered about the docks in various degrees
of soakage. Charlie Zechel, the director of instruction, didn't
seem to mind the low turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the busiest summer here in years, and it's nice to
have a little break,'' he said. ``Generally, we maintain a nice,
steady state of being on the verge of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the April-to-October season, about 1,500
junior sailors and nearly 8,000 adults will participate in
Community Boating programs. A full year's membership costs $190,
though short-term plans are also available. Experienced sailors can
take a test that will allow them to use boats on a level
commensurate with their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners must take a five-day shore school that provides them
with a Solo rating. Sailors can then earn higher ratings _ and
privileges on more boats and in greater wind strengths _ with
further instruction and testing, which they can schedule at their
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once someone gets to where Brad Louw is, with a couple of
ratings, it's all pretty self-directed,'' Zechel said.
</P>
<P>
   As we sailed back to the docks, Brad's teeth were clattering.
Bare-chested except for a life vest, with a rivulet of rain
cascading off his nose, he had been sailing for hours before taking
me out. He had turned back now only because I made him. Then he
handed me the tiller and called the puffs funneling through the
Longfellow Bridge. He was a natural, and he was ready for more.  &QL;

WOLTERS ADJUSTS TO EXPANSION TEAM LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When does playing become more important than winning?
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, that may sound like a question that a
self-absorbed athlete mulls over while sitting on the bench,
watching teammates gaining notice and, depending on the situation,
having all the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Almost one year ago, Kara Wolters pondered these thoughts to
herself. She is not selfish, but she knows how to take advantage of
a good opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   So, after spending last season on the sideline as the Houston
Comets proceeded toward a second consecutive WNBA championship,
Wolters was happy to be selected in the fifth round of the
expansion draft by the Indiana Fever. She had appeared in only 10
games for the Comets, averaging 4.1 minutes; she was impatient for
a fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely wanted to leave because I knew it was time to
go,'' Wolters said in a recent telephone interview. ``Houston
probably didn't want to mess with a good thing, so I couldn't crack
their rotation. I felt I was ready to play steady minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston (21-4), led by Sheryl Swoopes, Tina Thompson and Cynthia
Cooper, has continued its winning ways this season, while the Fever
(7-18, after a victory over Portland Friday night in which Wolters
went 7 for 7 from the field), as expected, has struggled. As with
most expansion teams, Indiana has had trouble trying to blend a mix
of raw, young players; 10 of the 12 players on the Fever roster are
either rookies or in their second year in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   For Wolters, especially, losing has been an unpleasant change.
She not only played with Houston last year, but she was also a
starter for the University of Connecticut during its 35-0 record
and NCAA title in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough coming into the season because we have that
expansion-team mind-set,'' said Wolters, Indiana's starting center.
``The expectations have to be that, going into a game, we feel we
are supposed to win. We can't say to ourselves, `Hey, it's all
right that we lost because we hung in tonight with a good team.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the on-court transition for Wolters has been a slam dunk.
Nicknamed Big Girl because of her 6-foot-7-inch, 227-pound frame,
Wolters has received the opportunity she yearned for. She is
averaging 25 minutes a game, and her statistics are both
competitive and impressive: 11.8 points a game, .560 field-goal
shooting (second in the league), 4.7 rebounds a game, 1.1 assists a
game, 1.25 blocks a game (seventh) and .795 free throw shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected her to play big minutes this season,'' said Fever
coach Anne Donovan, who at 6-8, a three-time former Olympic center
and a member of the women's basketball Hall of Fame, is someone
Wolters can look up to in more ways than one. ``It was difficult
for Kara in Houston because they had their system already set up,
so there wasn't an opportunity for her. She is a tremendous post
player, mainly because she has great hands. We try to work the
inside-outside game, so when she draws a double team, she does a
good job of kicking it back outside to the perimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Wolters is playing the inside-outside game
with point guard Rita Williams, a former UConn teammate. ``Rita and
I are close on the court because we know each other's strengths and
weaknesses,'' Wolters said. ``We know when to get the ball to each
other, so we both get good looks at the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   Another one of Wolters' former teammates at UConn is Paige
Sauer, a 6-5 center who warms the bench for the Los Angeles Sparks
behind the All-Star and Olympian Lisa Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paige is in almost exactly the same position I was in with
Houston,'' Wolters said. ``She has to pay her dues, but I always
offer her encouragement. She and I realize that we are lucky to be
playing in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   One trend, however, that discourages Wolters about the WNBA is
the increasing emphasis on guard play and the neglect of the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am a dying breed because the game has become so much
quicker,'' she said. ``I think the post is overlooked when it comes
to offense. I have no choice but to evolve with the changes. It's a
shame.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Fever ends its debut season, Wolters' year will
continue in Sydney, Australia, where she and 10 other players on
the U.S. team, including Chamique Holdslcaw, Yolanda Griffith,
Teresa Edwards, Lisa Leslie, Dawn Staley and Sheryl Swoopes, will
play for the Olympic gold medal in women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to do everything I can do for this team, whether it's
playing two or 20 minutes in a game, or just giving encouragement
to other players,'' Wolters said. ``It's really amazing to me to be
a part of this.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert George Crowder, an experimental psychologist and an
authority on memory, died Thursday at his home in Hamden, Conn. He
was 60.
</P>
<P>
   Crowder gained wide recognition in 1976 with the graduate
textbook ``Principles of Learning and Memory,'' which summarized
the research done on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The book remains in print and until recently he was working on
an updated edition.
</P>
<P>
   He also was author, along with Richard K. Wagner, of ``The
Psychology of Reading: An Introduction.'' A contributor of numerous
articles and book chapters, he was an editor, along with Frank R.
Schab, of ``Memory for Odors.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowder joined the faculty at Yale as a lecturer in 1965, was
promoted to full professor of psychology in 1976 and retired from
active teaching two years ago because of his failing health.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 28 years, Julie Butterfield
Crowder; two sons, Edward and Bruce, both of New Haven, Conn.; a
daughter, Lorial Crowder of Boston; and a half-bother, David L.
Crowder of Seattle.

ROBERTO SUAREZ, 68, A BOLIVIAN DRUG FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roberto Suarez Garcia, once one of the most-wanted drug
traffickers in the world, died on July 20 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.
He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was a heart attack, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez entered the cocaine trade in the mid-1970s. He came to be
called the godfather of the trade in Bolivia and was a major
supplier to the Medellin cartel in Colombia. He claimed to have
amassed $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1989, the Bolivian police arrested him. Margaret Daly
Hayes, a political scientist and an expert on Latin America, wrote
in 1990, ``This was the first time Bolivian authorities had taken
action against a drug kingpin.''
</P>
<P>
   The police surprised him at one of his ranches, in northern
Beni, where he had been born.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest was made when nearby Chapare Province reportedly
accounted for half the world's crop of coca leaf.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez was convicted of producing and selling cocaine and began
serving a 15-year prison sentence, but was released in 1996. His
wealth dwindled. At his death, he owned 500 head of cattle, by one
account. Weeks before, he said on television that selling cocaine
was ``the worst mistake I ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer said he had 18 children with several wives. A son,
Roberto Suarez Levy, was killed in 1990 in a gun battle with the
police.

IAIN HAMILTON, 78, COMPOSER OF VOCAL WORKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Britain, N.C., Mass., N.Y.)  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iain Hamilton, a Scottish composer best known for his operas and
other vocal works, died July 21 in London. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was born in Glasgow and his family moved to London when
he was 7. He attended the Mill Hill School there, and upon
graduation he was apprenticed for seven years as an engineer.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1947 he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music,
where he studied composition and piano and graduated with high
honors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, he was considered one of the bright young hopes of
British music. But though his compositional ability was
consistently praised, his stylistic fluctuations decreased the
impact of his work. He began writing in a Neo-Classical tonal idiom
and was then highly influenced by rigorous 12-tone techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, he returned to a more accessible harmonic
language, including lighter works with a calypso flavor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he left Britain to become a professor at Duke
University, where he remained until 1968. He was a member of the
composition faculty at the Tanglewood Music Center in Massachusetts
the summer of 1962. During the 1971-72 concert season, his
instrumental works were highlighted in a series of concerts by the
New York Chamber Ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he returned to Glasgow, where he taught at the city's
prestigious university. His opera ``The Royal Hunt of the Sun,''
adapted from the Peter Shaffer play, was given a well-received
premiere in 1977 at the London Coliseum. His adaptation of
Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' with a libretto by the stage director
Colin Graham, was produced in London in 1981. He wrote several
works for piano and four symphonies. The last symphony, composed in
1981, received its premiere two years later in Edinburgh.

   NEW YORK _ The seemingly unending boom in the hotel business in
New York continued unabated during the first half of this year,
despite an influx of new rooms and the prospect of more to come.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by PKF Consulting, which specializes in
the hospitality industry, the occupancy rate in Manhattan reached
84.4 percent, a record for any six-month period since the firm
began collecting statistics in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost of spending a night reached $224.83 during the
period, also a record, and an 8 percent increase compared with the
same period last year. And the trend is upward. PKF reported that
the average room rate for the month of June was $236.54, an 11.7
percent increase over June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting firm,
which conducts a similar survey, reported the occupancy rate at 84
percent and the average room rate at $249 a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occupancy and room rates were at record levels, and this is
supposed to be the slow half of the year,'' said John A. Fox, a
senior vice president of PKF, who explained that demand for hotel
rooms was typically lower in the January-to-June months than in
July to December, a period of vacations and holidays when people
are more apt to travel to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotels in the city are selling out 200 to 250 nights a year,
which means they are turning away business, so I am not concerned
that we are going to be adding some rooms,'' Fox added.
</P>
<P>
   He said the strong market of the last few years has encouraged
the development of hotel projects, including the conversion of
office buildings and the upgrading of single-room-occupancy hotels
to those catering to transients.
</P>
<P>
   Some 4,000 to 4,500 hotel rooms are expected to be added to the
New York market this year, one of the largest expansions in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist interest in New York accounts for much of the demand for
lodging in the city, as the crowds surging through Times Square and
along Fifth Avenue every day attest.
</P>
<P>
   But the buoyant economy, which is gobbling up office space in
the city, is increasing demand from business travelers as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson, the global leader of the PricewaterhouseCoopers
hospitality practice, has calculated that every additional 100
square feet of office space that is occupied in the city generates
0.7 room nights of hotel demand.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to this demand, developers are rushing to complete
new hotels, most of them conversions of existing buildings. An
exception to this trend is the Sofitel that opened earlier month on
44th Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas; it
was new construction from the ground up. Rooms cost $350 a night,
and suites, $450.
</P>
<P>
   Another new entrant in the market is the Red Roof Inn Manhattan,
the franchise chain's first in New York City, on 32nd Street just
west of Fifth Avenue in a converted office building not far from
Herald Square. The hotel was developed by Apple Core Hotels, a
company owned by the Horn and Kohane families that has four other
moderately priced hotels in Midtown Manhattan and a hotel and
conference center in Hempstead, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The $23 million conversion of the 17-story loft building on 32nd
Street has produced a hotel with 171 guest rooms plus a business
center, exercise room, meeting space and a breakfast room.
</P>
<P>
   Room rates will range from $89 to $329 a night, which is in
marked contrast to some of the other new boutique hotels scheduled
to open soon, where room rates will start at nearly $300 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Dandapani, Apple Core's chief operating officer, said
converting the old loft building to a hotel was difficult,
particularly so because a retail store on the first floor refused
to leave, limiting the size of the lobby. He said that passenger
elevators are now where the freight elevators were in the old
building, and the shafts for the old passenger elevators are
occupied by a stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everything is new, but the four walls on the
outside,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Since the building is hemmed in on three sides on the lower
floors, most of those floors were unsuitable for guest rooms, which
have to have a window. So that is where the exercise, conference,
business and breakfast rooms were situated. On the upper floors,
windows have been punched through the walls, even though the view
is often only of the roofs of lower buildings nearby.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be some sweeping views from a glass-enclosed
rooftop bar, which Dandapani hopes to complete within a year.
</P>
<P>
   A similar rooftop bar already exists at the Best Western
Manhattan, which Apple Core also owns. It is on the north side of
32nd Street, just to the west of the Red Roof, and hotel guests
there can take in the sight of the Empire State Building looming in
the background only a block away.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Core's other hotels, all developed in the last five years,
are the Quality Hotel &AMP; Suites on West 46th Street, the Comfort
Inn, also on West 46th, and the Quality Hotel on Lexington Avenue
at 30th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the hotels are operated in collaboration with
national chains, Dandapani said Apple Core had its own reservation
system, which brought in about 50 percent of the reservations
independent of the franchise affiliations. It is staffed 24 hours a
day, he said, to avoid forcing front-desk clerks to make
reservations in addition to their other duties.
</P>
<P>
   Dandapani said the Apple Core's occupancy rate ran well over 90
percent and said that the group was looking for other properties to
develop as hotels in New York. But, he added, they must be well
located and suitable for conversion.
</P>
<P>
   One building that Apple Core bought but later decided was not
suitable for its market is the old Leavitt Building on West.
Acquired from Apple Core for the Mass Mutual Financial Group by
Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers, the new hotel is scheduled to
open next month as the Muse, with 200 rooms. It is being described
as a boutique hotel that will emphasize personal service at rates
that will range from $295 to $395 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's proximity to the theater district will be emphasized
in a ground-floor restaurant _ so far unnamed _ that was designed
by David Rockwell, who did such restaurants as Nobu and Heartbeat.
The exterior will have a simulated curtain of woven stainless steel
drawn up to one side as if opening onto a stage. Inside, the
decorations will include simulated theater scenery with banks of
spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant will have 85 seats and will provide room service
for the hotel and a complimentary buffet called the ``midnight
pantry,'' where guests can find cookies and desserts, fruit and
cheese plates and ice cream after a night at the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Another boutique hotel scheduled to open late this summer is the
Dylan, in the former Chemists Club, on East 41st, between Madison
and Park avenues. The renovation of the 1903 building cost Morris
Moinian, the developer, $30 million and produced a 108-room hotel,
with rates of $295 to $450 a night.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's restaurant will be called Rx, with a nod to the
building's past. The hotel will have two conference rooms that can
be combined to seat up to 75 people. Guest rooms will have
high-speed access to the Internet and television sets with Web
access.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Central Partnership, the local business improvement
district, is planting trees along the sidewalks in the area and
installing antique-style street lamps with hanging flower baskets.
Plans are to designate that section of 41st Street as Library Walk
in recognition of its proximity to the New York Public Library and
to install plaques in the sidewalk with quotes from famous books.

HILLARY CLINTON FAULTS ARAFAT FOR FAILURE OF MIDEAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton criticized the Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat Saturday for the failure of the recent Middle
East peace talks at Camp David and, taking a leaf from President
Clinton's political handbook, called for moving the U.S. Embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who has taken a number of pro-Israel positions in
her Senate campaign, noted that the president had said in an
Israeli television interview on Friday that he favored moving the
embassy and would decide before year's end whether to do so. Israel
and many Jews around the world have long sought international
recognition for Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has avidly courted New York's Jewish vote _ about 12
percent of the state's electorate and has declared that Jerusalem
should be ``the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   She said as long ago as last year that the embassy should be in
Jerusalem, but Saturday, she went a step further than her husband,
setting a year-end deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the president has announced he'll review the
decision about moving our embassy to Jerusalem,'' Clinton said in
an interview on New WCBS Radio in New York. ``That's absolutely the
right thing to do. But I'd like to see that move be made before the
end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's opponent in the Senate race, Rep. Rick Lazio, told
worshippers at an Orthodox synagogue on Long Island on Saturday
morning that he also supported moving the embassy, but said the
move should be done immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the breakdown of two weeks of talks that President
Clinton had brokered at Camp David _ talks that stumbled over the
status of Jerusalem _ Clinton suggested that Arafat was largely to
blame, and she praised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for his
efforts to resolve issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that Prime Minister Barak came committed to
reaching a deal that would guarantee peace and security for Israel
and the entire region, and I'm sorry that Chairman Arafat didn't
show the same commitment,'' Clinton said .
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also echoed her husband's appeal to Arafat not to carry
out his stated intention of unilaterally declaring a Palestinian
state by Sept. 13, with or without a peace agreement. She had said
last week that if Arafat did so, the United States should cut off
aid to the Palestinians, and she reiterated that warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian authority must abide by its commitment to
avoid violence or unilateral action,'' she said. ``It must be clear
that any unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood would be
entirely unacceptable and should be met with a cutoff of United
States assistance. This is an issue that must be resolved between
the two parties at the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was greeted warmly Saturday at an Orthodox synagogue in
Westhampton Beach, on Long Island, after he vowed to continue
working for a unified Jerusalem. He spoke at the synagogue a week
after Clinton addressed the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to Jerusalem, my position has been clear and
consistent, over the past eight years,'' he said, referring to his
terms in Congress. ``I have supported a united, undivided
Jerusalem,'' he told the crowd of several hundred worshippers, who
spilled out onto the outer patios of the synagogue. They greeted
his words with applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have repeatedly called for and voted for the respect and
recognition that comes with having our embassy in the eternal
capital of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   At a later meeting with reporters, Lazio reacted to Clinton's
call for the embassy to be moved to Jerusalem before the end of the
year. He said that the embassy should be moved immediately, and
criticized his opponent for her position.

SCHUMER OFFERS DETAILED PLAN FOR TACKLING ENERGY PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even with unusually cool weather over the last month,
demand for electricity is rising throughout the region, continuing
a six-year trend that is straining the capacity of power plants,
according to a report to be released Sunday by Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The booming economy and prevalence of computers and high-tech
equipment in the home and workplace have caused electricity
consumption in New York City and Long Island to grow faster than
anyone anticipated,'' said Schumer in the report, which was
obtained Saturday from his staff. Using data from Consolidated
Edison and Keyspan, the report says consumption on a typical summer
day has increased 20 percent in New York City and 23 percent on
Long Island since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to face the music,'' Schumer said. ``If we ignore the
looming, chronic energy shortage, we risk the economic well-being
of the entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has been a leading advocate of deregulation of the
electric power industry and won favor from national environmental
groups by calling for cleaner power plants, recommended an
unusually detailed shopping list of investments for New York City
and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the proposals are new power plants in the region, although
the report does not specify where.
</P>
<P>
   Other investments, the report says, should come in new
transmission lines connecting the region to other parts of the
country where electricity is more plentiful, fuel cells and other
alternative energy sources, and financial incentives for business
and homeowners to reduce consumption on days of particularly high
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that we can solve this problem in an
environmentally sound way,'' Schumer said. The report calls for a
broad spectrum of local officials, utility executives and
environmentalists to develop an energy-saving program.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by Schumer's staff, which incorporates data from
the National Weather Service, concludes that residents and
businesses have increased the consumption of electricity to run a
range of appliances besides furnaces and air conditioners, meaning
that spikes on demand are less closely associated with the weather
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   It found, for example, that New York City residents used 11,231
megawatts of power on the day in June when the temperature reached
88 degrees and service was disrupted temporarily on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan, prompting angry complaints from Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and many residents. In contrast, it found that city
residents had used less power _ 10,551 megawatts _ on a summer day
in 1995 when the temperature soared to 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   On both days, as on many others in between, it said consumption
in the city came perilously close to the maximum that Consolidated
Edison can provide _11,650 megawatts.

SOCIAL WORKERS SAVOR A CITY OF RISKS AND REWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wis., N.J., Kan., Mass., Mo.)  By MONTE WILLIAMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 3 p.m. one recent day at Columbia University,
and seven graduate students, who ranged in age from 25 to 58, sat
in a circle in Room 308 of McVicor Hall, home to the university's
School of Social Work.
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, Judith Marks, read from the students' reports
about their work with clients. But weeks of newspaper headlines,
and the presence of a reporter, later provoked a discussion of
social work and its rewards and perils.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Goldberg, a 25-year-old from Madison, Wis., had been
struck on the back of the head with a chunk of concrete by a man on
a Manhattan street in a seemingly random attack. Goldberg, who
plans to attend Columbia's social work school this fall, had
expressed concern for her assailant. She speculated that he had had
a troubled childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The students, who said they were upset by the randomness of the
attack, said they admired Goldberg's generosity of spirit. They
said it was consistent with a social worker's outlook on violence _
to always try to understand its roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society is into blaming individuals,'' said Kristen Miller,
27, one of the students. ``Violence is intergenerationally
transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who grew up in Morristown, N.J., and works with mentally
ill children in Newark, N.J., said she felt sad for Goldberg when
when she heard about the attack. But she thought the incident might
have been avoided if ``society provided the resources people
need.'' Specifically, she advocated more funding for the treatment
of the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   However awash New York City is in Wall Street bonuses and budget
surpluses, venture capital and disposable income, it remains for
some people one of the world's great social work laboratories _
full of poor, troubled people, children at risk and marriages
coming apart. And its magnetic pull brings people here from all
corners of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Kucera, who recently completed the social work
graduate program at Hunter College and is from Columbia, Mo., said,
``Moving to New York, I think I've compromised my safety, but I'm
much more concerned for the safety of the people I've worked with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to move to New York because it has one of the largest
social service networks in the country,'' she said. ``I also chose
New York to practice because of the diversity of the people and the
complexity of the socio-political climate. Under Giuliani, social
services have been cut back. Nevertheless, I think even in these
difficult times, New York City is an exciting place to study and
practice social work.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Condon, a 26-year-old student at Columbia's School of
Social Work, said the attack on Goldberg had frightened her because
it was random. But Condon, who grew up in Pearl River in Rockland
County, said that she, like Goldberg, would probably look at the
environment the assailant came from and the problems he faced had
she been the victim. Social workers, she said, seek to find out why
things happen.
</P>
<P>
   And that includes the causes of violence, especially after
incidents like the attack on Goldberg or the stabbing death in 1999
of Amy Watkins, a student at Hunter College Graduate School of
Social Work, who had come to New York from Kansas. Watkins was
slain two blocks from her apartment in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn.
Her killer was never caught.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Parker, 32, who graduated from Hunter's school of social
work in May, came to New York from Methuen, Mass., 10 years ago. He
decided to study social work so he could help change society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the continuing disparity of income _ how
people were excluded from jobs, education, housing and
opportunities in general,'' he said. ``The system is working
against the poor as far as pulling them out of their economic
hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who knew Watkins, helped to set up a scholarship in her
name at Hunter. Like Goldberg, she had the kind of idealism that
motivates most people in the social work field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amy was a beautiful person with a vision of justice and social
equity,'' he said. ``A lot of people would think she was overly
compassionate.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Mummers in sequined costumes strummed banjos.
Demonstrators in dreadlocks pounded jun-juns and other African
drums. Party planners readied a potent vodka concoction called a
``Richard Nixon'' _ guaranteed to give you an 18 1/2-minute gap in

Conventioneers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With 45,000 people expected for the convention _ and another
20,000 or so coming for protests _ the world will be watching the
nation's fifth largest city for the coming week.
</P>
<P>
   Civic leaders are hoping to showcase a vibrant, revitalized
community and reap financial benefits that will last long after the
GOP delegates leave. But under the watchful gaze of a ubiquitous
police presence, scores of dissident groups also plan to piggyback
on this media focus.
</P>
<P>
   The competing image machines were revved up as visitors streamed
in Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Center City _ the downtown district of shops and hotels and
offices _ was bedecked in red, white and blue. Music greeted
arrivals at the airport and train station. With corporate help, the
city hosted a party for reporters on Saturday night and readied
another gala for delegates the following evening.
</P>
<P>
   The citizenry is expected to turn out for that event, a giant
fireworks show and parade of lighted boats on the Delaware River.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference, Mayor James F. Sweet predicted a payoff.
Despite the expense and exertion, Sweet said, he expects ``this
city is going to be highlighted in a very positive way to people
around the world in a way we couldn't possibly afford to pay for.''
</P>
<P>
   But TV crews also showed up Saturday for the first of dozens of
scheduled demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Five animal rights activists were arrested for planning to dump
more than a ton of manure at the First Union Center, the site of
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's largest rally attracted about 1,500 people in support
of universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few blocks from City Hall, African drums set the beat for
a protest against police brutality. The issue has smoldered here
since the 1980s, when then-Mayor Wilson Goode ordered the bombing
of a house in which members of the radical MOVE group had
barricaded themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then this summer, Philadelphia TV news crews videotaped
Philadelphia police kicking and beating a carjacking suspect named
Thomas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unfortunate for poor Thomas Jones, but fortunate for
our movement in that the world saw what goes on here,'' said Ella
Forbes, founder of Mothers Organized Against Police Terror.
``That's what we have lived with for many years, but it was just
captured on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Liberty Bell, 200 antigun protesters laid out
nearly 30,000 shoes to represent victims of gun violence, while
nearby a group supporting gun owners set up 1,000 American flags.
And at Independence Mall, 30 people in wheelchairs in a ``Rolling
for Justice'' demonstration for rights for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The largest scheduled protest is a Sunday parade combining many
of the causes _ which range from animal rights to anti-globalism.
Organizers said the parade will feature 30-foot inflatable cruise
missiles, giant puppets and Corpzilla _ a paper-mache,
international corporate monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like it has ever hit Philadelphia before,'' said
Michael Morrill, an organizer of Unity2000, the umbrella
organization of the protest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the parties have begun.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Richard Nixon'' drink will be featured at a ``Shock the
Vote'' shindig at the Trocadero night club sponsored by Shift, a
non-profit group devoted to increasing voter participation.
</P>
<P>
   Each state delegation will get an individual welcoming reception
on Sunday, and Hank Williams Jr. will play at a concert honoring
elected Republican officials.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first national political convention in Philadelphia
since 1948, when both the Democrats and Republicans convened in the
city. However, the city has a long history of hosting political
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   The First Continental Congress convened here in 1774 and the
founding fathers gathered in 1787 to write the U.S. Constitution.
The first Republican convention was held here in 1856.

PHILADELPHIA HOPES GOP HOOPLA WILL BOOST CIVIC EGO

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ This city has struggled for years with a massive
civic inferiority complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to Philadelphia and they have worse than low
expectations,'' moans city leader David Cohen. ``They have no
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Republican Party faithful pouring into town for
their political family reunion that starts Monday, Philadelphia
residents believe they have more at stake in hosting a successful
convention than any other city in recent memory. It's not just
reputation on the line, it's self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between politically vibrant Washington, D.C., and
commercial giant New York City, the locals always thought they
suffered by comparison. And when the city began sliding into the
same economic funk plaguing other rust belt cities in the last
decades of the 20th century, they just suffered.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had lost its manufacturing base and 10 percent of
its population by 1990. People and jobs fled to the suburbs, and
crime filled the gaps. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Former Mayor Ed Rendell gets the credit for stopping the
decline with large infusions of federal dollars and his
determination to lure hotels and entertainment downtown. People use
the word ``renaissance'' when they talk about Philadelphia now.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell decided after attending his own party's Democratic
convention in Chicago in 1996 that snaring one of the major
political conventions was the answer to his recovering city's
public relations woes. But local corporate and political leaders
thought the pursuit was a waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at me like I was stone-cold crazy,'' recalled
Rendell, shaking his head. When the GOP announced in November 1998
that Democrat-dominated Philadelphia was its choice for the 2000
convention, his city was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we're different than Chicago, we're different than
New York, we're different than San Diego and Houston. All these
cities have established hospitality presences,'' said Cohen,
Rendell's former chief of staff and co-chairman of the local host
committee for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact for us is going to be completely different,'' Cohen
said. ``If you spend enough time here, you'll see the enthusiasm
for this convention. The Republicans are going to own this city.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the 18 months since the GOP made its choice, Philadelphia
has scrubbed, primped, rebuilt and renovated everything from
building facades to subway stations. Workers in recent weeks have
hung red, white and blue bunting from every available ledge and
light standard and flowers sprout from hanging baskets, window
boxes and boulevards.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee has raised nearly $50 million from local
donors to help throw the party. Nearly 4,500 new hotel rooms have
been added in time for the convention, and more than 100 taxis have
been added to the traffic winding its way through Philadelphia's
narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   The city has taken extra care to spruce up the attractions that
underscore Philadelphia's rich, patriotic history _ the Liberty
Bell, the house where Betsy Ross designed the first American flag
and Independence Hall, site of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence and the drafting of the U.S. Constitution. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Small armies of volunteers massed in the last week to clean up
the routes between the airport, downtown and the sports arena
housing the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Philadelphians, taxi driver Sidney Miller was worried
about whether a looming strike by municipal workers would leave
piles of garbage on the city curbs as an estimated 45,000
conventioneers and journalists filled those new hotel rooms. ``What
a mess that would be. They've got the city by a stranglehold,''
Miller fretted.
</P>
<P>
   The city reached a tentative agreement with the union last week,
averting the danger of an embarrassing strike. That moved the
threat of disruption by protesters to the top of the worry list for
many locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we've been dealt an excellent opportunity to create a new
image, a better image and a deserving image, because there is a lot
of great stuff going on here,'' said Republican talk show host Mike
Smerconish. ``And yet it seems like there are people who are
determined to screw it up.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 20,000 activists are expected in town over the week
to protest everything from the death penalty to police brutality _
the latter a particularly hot topic after television cameras
recently caught on videotape a phalanx of Philly cops beating a
suspected carjacker. That incident only served to remind people of
Philadelphia's reputation in the years under former police
commissioner and Mayor Frank Rizzo (now deceased) as a city where
the police frequently administered punishment at the time of
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks we're still at that stage,'' said Larry Frankel,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in
Pennsylvania. ``The allegations of police misconduct are certainly
much lower now, and there's a better system of tracking the use of
force.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no real drama left in political conventions, Smerconish
said, since the presidential candidates are anointed in advance and
they've usually announced their running mates by convention time.
Expected GOP nominee George W. Bush announced Dick Cheney as his
running mate last week. So Smerconish worries that protests have
the possibility of becoming a dominant story from the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge spelled out the strategical
importance of his region in pitching Philadelphia to the Republican
convention site selection committee, former Mayor Rendell recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Draw a quadrant across the United States, from Wisconsin to
Minnesota, south to Maryland, north to New England _ we carried one
state there in '96,'' Ridge told the GOP officials. ``You've been
going to the South and the Southwest and California for all your
conventions _ time to get back into that quadrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge was right, said Rendell, who, &UR;  &LR; ironically, &UR;  &LR; has since been
tapped as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``And
throwing in the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall as props? Not so
bad either.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic consultant questions how much diversity spin the
GOP can pull from Philadelphia, since there's been little movement
from the city's significant African-American population away from
the Democratic Party. Bush has appeal among Democrat-leaning
Hispanics, the consultant said, but Hispanic voters are not a
significant presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
   And the president of Philadelphia's African-American Chamber of
Commerce questions why so few local black businesses have been
awarded convention business if the GOP is interested in broadening
its appeal to minority voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the GOP has been the party of commerce and
business,'' said Clay Hammond. ``It would have been a great
opportunity to position the candidate, saying this is the
tremendous outreach we did, these are the numbers of
African-American businesses we used.''
</P>
<P>
   But host committee co-chair Cohen said the RNC and host
committee reached out to minority business owners ``in an
unprecedented fashion,'' offering to aid minority businesses in
marketing themselves, and creating an online directory for
potential vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he is proud of the efforts the host committee made to
involve local minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I satisfied with the results? Absolutely not,'' Cohen said.

BUSH CHALLENGES GORE TO SUPPORT MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Republican George W. Bush challenged Vice
President Al Gore on Saturday to ``pick up the phone'' and urge
President Clinton to sign legislation passed by the Republican
Congress that would eliminate the so-called tax penalty paid by
married couples under the federal tax code.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Striking a populist tone on the second day of a five-day, five
state trip to the GOP convention in Philadelphia, Bush urged
Clinton to sign into law the GOP-sponsored legislation that cleared
the House and Senate in time to reach the president's desk before
the opening of the Republican nominating convention on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be penalizing marriage in the tax code,'' Bush
told more than 1,000 supporters spilling out of an aircraft hanger
into pouring rain at an airport rally in Owensboro, Ky. ``Mr.
President, you ought to sign that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a jab at Gore, Bush noted his opponent's claims to have
been the ``most influential vice president in history'' and
declared: ``If that's the case, he ought to pick up the phone and
he ought to tell President Clinton, `You ought to sign the marriage
penalty relief bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the federal tax code ought to be revised to
``encourage marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-sponsored legislation would end a so-called ``penalty''
paid by married couples that file joint federal tax returns.
Currently, married couples filing jointly pay more taxes than they
would if they were not married and filed individual tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vows to veto the measure, contending it consumes too
much of the federal budget surplus and benefits the wealthy more
than the middle class. Last week, Clinton asserted that Republican
lawmakers have passed a series of ``reckless'' tax cuts that
threaten to ``drain away our hard-earned surplus and put us back in
the red.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush derided the Clinton-Gore administration's resistance to the
deep tax cuts that he proposes as a way to return a portion of the
blossoming federal budget surplus to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``believes a surplus is the government's money,'' Bush
said, eliciting boos from his partisan audience in Owensboro. ``We
believe the surplus is the people's money and after we set our
priorities, I want to share some of that surplus with the people
who pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not only going to hear the voices of the
people who are creating jobs, we're going to hear the people who
are struggling go get ahead in their jobs and knock down the toll
booth on the road to the middle class,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to revise a federal tax code that he said imposes a
higher proportionate tax on a single mother raising two children on
$22,000 a year than on someone earning more than $200,000. ``That's
not right,'' Bush insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later touted the GOP platform approved by state party
leaders in Philadelphia for final convention action on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to win the presidency ``not to hold the
job'' but to lead the nation in ``new directions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win this campaign because we have the best
ideas (and) we have the right platform,'' Bush declared. ``We've
got a philosophy that's conservative and a philosophy that's
compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters aboard his campaign plane that he was ``not
overconfident,'' adding that he had ``seen defeat first-hand'' and
had seen ``poll numbers crumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments followed Gallup poll commissioned by Time
magazine that showed Bush leading by 16 percentage points among
likely voters _ the widest lead Bush has enjoyed since he and Gore
captured their parties' presidential nominations in March.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hitting Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia and
Ohio, arriving in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

REAL ESTATE: MORE PEOPLE CALLING CINCINNATI'S DOWNTOWN HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Texas, Colo., Pa., Ga., N.C., Ore., Ky.)   By JOHN ECKBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Hofmeyer family bought the decrepit Biltmore apartment
building on West Fourth Street in downtown Cincinnati in 1990 and
two years later the Lombardi, a historic but condemned apartment
building on an adjacent lot, banks balked at loans to update the
units. Housing in the city's central business district was in a
downward spiral. Parking was scarce. There was no grocery, and few
young professionals were ready to live in a Midwestern downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Max and Angela Hofmeyer and their five sons, who
own a plumbing company, concluded that their out-of-pocket
investment in upgrading the two distressed buildings would pay off.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Hofmeyers, both 68, sold their house on two acres in
a suburban neighborhood on the west side of town, and at an age
when many Americans would be looking to retire to a beach community
became part of a Cincinnati back-to-the-city movement, living in
one of the buildings that they were refurbishing.
</P>
<P>
   They knew there would be challenges. After all, the Biltmore was
half-occupied and four of the 28 apartments had never been
completed after a previous attempt at renovation. The family was
confident, however, that the building could be returned to its
former glory. There were tall ceilings, white marble hallways,
exposed brick walls and distinctive windows in a building that at
one time had been a coveted address.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was risk, but we knew felt comfortable knowing that
after a lot of work we would have quality apartments, and quality
apartments will have renters,'' said their son Paul, who helped
update kitchens and bathrooms in both buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Because of investors like the Hofmeyers _ and heavy public
subsidies for other projects _ the population of the square-mile
Cincinnati Central Business District has reached levels not seen
for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The population increase is similar to the trend back to downtown
that has been noted in other cities across the nation. Eugenie
Birch, who heads the department of city and regional planning at
the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, has compared
housing trends in 40 American cities from 1990 to 1999 and found
that one in four have returned to 1970 population levels.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1999 study, ``Downtown Living: A Deeper Look,'' she
reported that Cincinnati had one of the more robust markets for
downtown housing in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   She estimated that 4,810 people lived downtown in 1999, up from
3,838 in 1990. Kathy Schwab, residential development adviser to
Downtown Cincinnati Inc., a nonprofit group, said that there were
about 2,100 housing units downtown, with 10 or so buildings
restored or converted, five more under construction and two
projects in development.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people were reflecting anecdotally _ that more people
were moving back downtown _ was really happening in some cities
like Cincinnati,'' Birch said. ``This is a fragile trend that has
happened for a lot of reasons. People want to walk to work. They
like an urban life with all its attachments: good restaurants,
theater and art museums.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are living in lofts, converted factories,'' she added.
``It's a lifestyle choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Birch initiated her study when she reviewed a 1998 report by the
Brookings Institution and Fannie Mae, the federally chartered
mortgage financing corporation, that showed many American cities
expected to see healthy increases in downtown housing. In that
report, however, Cincinnati was not in the top tier. Planners had
projected that only 3,500 people would be living in the central
business district by 2010, about the same number they thought were
living downtown in Columbus and Pittsburgh today. But that study of
26 cities did not have fixed central business district boundaries,
and planners had estimated downtown boundaries and populations.
</P>
<P>
   While Birch thought that the methodology of the report could be
sharpened, she agreed with the finding that there was a broad trend
of people moving back to downtown. In preparing her study, she
focused on the growth in the number of downtown households, and
restricted the geographical scope of the report to core blocks.
Instead of relying on rough estimates by local planners, she bought
data from Claritas, a company that specializes in demographic and
economic data. Cities with downtowns that posted significant gains,
according to her study, included Dallas, Denver, Colorado Springs,
Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C., and Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   The Hofmeyers never regretted their move from suburbia to
downtown, though they have now returned to a suburb to be closer to
grandchildren. ``We had a rooftop deck with views of downtown and
the river,'' Hofmeyer said. ``But at the beginning friends told us
we were nuts.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Hofmeyers' two buildings had waiting lists until earlier
this year, when some tenants fled because of inconveniences from
the construction of a new football stadium for the Cincinnati
Bengals about three blocks south. Seven vacancies resulted, all of
which have since been filled, although the waiting list is a thing
of the past, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings where young and single tenants live include a
former cigar warehouse called East Eighth Lofts, where all 45 units
were rented in 60 days last fall. Other apartments have gone into
the former Shillito Department Store.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Bonner, a professor of art at Northern Kentucky
University, moved into East Eighth Lofts last fall after spurning
``cookie-cutter'' complexes in nearby suburbs. The central location
means he spends less for gasoline and has a manageable commute to
the university, six miles south. Also, he said, he is not
contributing to urban sprawl, though the lack of a grocery downtown
remains an inconvenience. He pays $670 a month in rent, which does
not include utilities, and $120 a month for two parking spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet half the people in the building are lawyers, doctors or
professionals,'' Bonner said. ``I love it downtown: to walk out the
door and see an opening at the Contemporary Arts Center or go grab
something to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the challenges for developers has been competition from
other neighborhoods and the city's historically low housing costs,
said Ralph D. Bolton, the former head of Cincinnati downtown
development and now a principal at the architecture firm of
Brashear Bolton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were and are very good neighborhoods close to downtown
that were accessible and had relatively inexpensive housing stock
and apartments,'' he said. ``What has to happen for downtown
housing to be attractive is it must attract people from those
neighborhoods: offer some kind of vitality and value.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising rents and property values in recent years in nearby
neighborhoods like Clifton and Hyde Park that have long attracted
young professionals have also added to the attraction of downtown
housing. In the 1970s and 1980s, most housing downtown was aimed at
low-income residents. Today the mix includes more upper- and
middle-income residents, and as a result restaurants and clubs are
opening in long-vacant buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Apartments in the Biltmore and Lombardi bring $350 to $725 in
rent, but that does not include $75 a month for a parking slot.
</P>
<P>
   A few units go for more: the rent for a two-bedroom town house
with deck is $800 a month and approaches $900 when parking is
included. Although that may seem a bargain when compared with rents
in major cities like New York and Chicago, it is pricey by
Cincinnati standards.
</P>
<P>
   The Hofmeyers are in the market to buy another apartment
building downtown, but times have changed. A nearby shell carries a
$325,000 price tag _ far from the $10 that the Hofmeyers paid the
city for the Lombardi nearly a decade ago.

ARTISTS SEEKING NEW SPACES JOIN A NEIGHBORHOOD'S MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just 100 yards from the corner of Bushwick Avenue and
McKibbin Street, inside a brightly lighted basement garment
factory, the buzzing of sewing machines rises and ebbs like
dentists' drills as a dozen women hunch over tables stitching
elastic waistbands into blue polyester pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   Three floors above, Rachel Bick works among half-clothed
seamstress dummies and drawings of conceptual outfits, creating
dresses that sell for hundreds of dollars more than the pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The building at 255-265 McKibbin St., home to Bick and Quality
Knits, is in the midst of a transformation. For decades artists
have been moving eastward, out of the East Village and into
Williamsburg, in search of bigger spaces, lower rents and hipper
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Now the artists have reached farther still, renting former
manufacturing spaces around the fifth, sixth and seventh stops from
Manhattan on the L train. Most of the new arrivals call the area
East Williamsburg, but to longtime residents it is Bushwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it because it's not as trendy as Bedford Avenue, which
is so hot you have people from Manhattan going out there for the
night,'' said Bick, who wore rose-colored sunglasses, a straw
cowboy hat, beige pants and a short purple top that revealed her
pierced navel. ``I like it better off the beaten path.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists colonizing the old industrial buildings on the
western end of Bushwick say they feel they are playing the role of
pioneers. Crime is down in the area, as it is citywide, but many
new residents have stories of break-ins and car thefts and have
held meetings recently to discuss a series of muggings.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Castagna lives a floor above the garment factory and
creates jewelry and wearable art from discarded dish mats, broken
computer parts, pieces of silver and anything else she can find _
including the scraps from the factory below. Since she moved in six
months ago she has been able to drag friends to her place for a
birthday party, but many acquaintances and relatives have been
resistant to visiting without a special occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relatives who live in Staten Island are like: `Bushwick?
Why would you want to live out there?''' Castagna said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Williamsburg or the East Village, the fifth subway stop
has no cafes in which residents can gather, but the new arrivals
have organized a summer film festival and studio tours. And the
Hispanic grocery store at the corner of McKibbin Street and
Bushwick Avenue has become the place to pick up food, meet friends
and practice Spanish with the clerks.
</P>
<P>
   But as the neighborhood has changed, so has the store. Two weeks
ago Joshua Nathanson, a painter and recent graduate of the School
of Visual Arts, asked the shop to stock veggie burgers. Their
arrival delighted Nathanson, yet part of him worries about what he
has wrought. What if the veggie burgers force out the mango juice
or plantains? And what if the arrival of the artists forces out the
longtime residents?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to live in New York to do artwork, and live around
other artists, but I do wonder how it affects the people around
me,'' Nathanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the artists appear somewhat torn between their desire to
find fabulous space and the worry that they will gentrify the
neighborhood. And they are concerned that rather than helping
diversify the community, they may merely be establishing a separate
existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange block,'' Bick said as she stood at the window
of her loft, while a neighborhood cookout given by Hispanic
homeowners was barely visible below her. ``They have a block party
with merengue and we will have our party on the roof with techno.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, the artists around the fifth stop seem to be the only
ones worrying. Inside the Latino Supermarket, Octavio Olivo, a
manager, proudly shows off the Honey Bunches of Oats, Woodchuck
Draft Cider and American Spirit cigarettes. All of those items were
suggested by the loft dwellers but have become popular with Latino
customers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they came here we didn't know about this stuff,'' Olivo
said, his hand resting on the oat cereal. ``Now everyone is buying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the block party below Bick's apartment, the residents said
they were enthusiastic about their new neighbors and the changes
they have brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten very multicultural,'' Nilsa Sievens said as she
stood by the grill. ``I have no complaints. The cops tend to drive
by more now.''
</P>
<P>
   Deeper into Bushwick, however, the prospects for peace between
the new arrivals and longtime residents may not be so good.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the block party, two stops away on the L train,
Andrea Champlin stared down at the black flakes of burned newsprint
fluttering from the edge of what had been her Sunday paper.
</P>
<P>
   Champlin has had plenty of newspapers stolen from apartment
porches. But this felt different. Staring at the burned paper
brought into focus the hard stares and catcalls she had endured on
walks between her loft and the subway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new frontier,'' she said. ``I don't know if I will
stay. I will have to see if the neighborhood changes, but I am
going to give it another year.''
</P>
<P>
   At the seventh stop, artists are hoping to attract a few more
pioneers. Last month someone broke into Eduardo Larrea's studio and
stole his VCR, fax machine and tools. An increase in loft dwellers
would make the streets feel more welcoming and add a few more
watchful eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But at the fifth stop, some people worry that there may already
be too many backpack-toting artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood has changed a lot,'' said Franco Gotte, a
sculptor and one of Bick's neighbors. ``A few years ago we were the
only people getting off the train with backpacks. Now it's like
everyone has backpacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, some loft dwellers said, is that professionals who
have a tendency to follow artists are arriving. ``I saw a suit
getting off the train the other day,'' Ms Bick said to Gotte.
</P>
<P>
   Rents are starting to rise along McKibbin Street and some of the
artists who moved in during the last two years fear they may have
to move. Nathanson said that unlike artists who favored other
neighborhoods in past decades, the people at the fifth stop have
barely had a chance to settle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people moved into SoHo they had 15 or 20 years when the
rents were stable, before they started going up and pushing out the
artists,'' Nathanson said. ``But nowadays as soon as the artists
move in, they are priced out.''

LAWYERS GEAR UP FOR SUITS OVER TWO MEDICATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Within two days in March, one widely prescribed
medication was removed from the market and another's use was
severely restricted, after each was linked to scores of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Rezulin, a diabetes drug, and the restrictions on
Propulsid, a medication for severe heartburn, were coincidental in
timing, but served as a double-barreled call to action for lawyers
who specialize in large-scale litigation involving products to
which illness or injury has been attributed.
</P>
<P>
   In newspapers and on the radio and the Internet, such lawyers
have been advertising their services to people claiming or fearing
harm from the drugs, and the first of what are expected to be many
lawsuits against the drugs' manufacturers have been filed in
federal and state courts across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this legal warfare is centered in New York City. Because
Rezulin's manufacturer has its headquarters in the New York area,
and New York law firms are among those recruiting clients for the
litigation, federal court officials have directed that all Rezulin
suits filed in federal courts anywhere in the country be
transferred to U.S. District Court in Manhattan for consolidated
and efficient handling _ a common practice with complex cases that
are related. Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy has been assigned to preside
over the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising for clients who may have been hurt by Rezulin or
Propulsid vividly illustrates how an aggressive segment of the
legal profession sets the stage for mass-tort actions, those in
which suits are brought on behalf of large groups of people who
suffer similar illnesses after using the same product. This segment
of the bar has long been the subject of bitter debate.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics, including business groups and members of Congress
and law school faculties, say such lawyers are legal buccaneers,
even vultures, who are driven by the prospect of millions of
dollars in fees to seek excessive punitive damages that inhibit
manufacturers and add to the cost of many products.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Burger, the former chief justice of the United States,
was especially riled by such lawyers' advertising for clients,
terming it an unseemly spectacle, and he dissented from rulings
that upheld the right of lawyers to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of mass-tort specialists, including many consumer
groups and others in Congress and academia, say those practitioners
level the playing field, making it possible for people hurt by
wealthy companies' harmful products to be justly compensated. They
also credit this combative arm of the bar with giving businesses a
necessary incentive to exercise care in putting products on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers' ads, unless false or misleading, are ``very much in
the public interest'' because they permit people to ``learn their
rights as soon as possible,'' Monroe H. Freedman, a legal ethics
specialist at the Hofstra University Law School, said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the arguments, the mass-tort lawyers' machinery is
clattering away in relation to Rezulin and Propulsid, much as it
did in the past in spawning widespread litigation on behalf of
those who contended they were harmed by drugs and medical devices
like the anti-miscarriage drug DES; the diet-pill combination known
as fen-phen; and the Dalkon Shield, a women's contraceptive device.
</P>
<P>
   On March 21, the federal Food and Drug Administration announced
that Rezulin _ introduced in 1997 to treat type 2, or adult-onset,
diabetes _ would immediately be removed from the market at the
agency's request by its manufacturer, the Parke-Davis division of
Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J. Warner-Lambert has since
merged with Pfizer Inc., the New York-based pharmaceutical giant.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said in March that Rezulin, which was taken by nearly 2
million people, had been linked to 90 cases of liver failure,
resulting in 63 deaths and necessitating 10 liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the manufacturer of Propulsid, which the FDA
said had been associated with nearly 350 reports of heart rhythm
disturbances, including 80 fatal cases, announced that it would
withdraw the heartburn drug from pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville, N.J., said it would instead
distribute the drug free to a limited number of patients for whom
all other drugs had failed and who did not have heart problems or
take certain other drugs that made Propulsid potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 million prescriptions had been written for Propulsid
since it was put on the market in 1993 by Janssen, a subsidiary of
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A Pfizer spokesman, Bob Fauteux, said last week that the company
was ``aware of approximately 200 suits'' claiming injury from
Rezulin, some involving more than one plaintiff, that had been
filed in federal and state courts across the country. A Janssen
spokesman, Greg Panico, said he did not know the number of
Propulsid suits that had been filed but was sure that ``we do not
have hundreds.''
</P>
<P>
   The two companies say that the number of reported adverse
reactions to their drugs is small compared with the large number of
people who benefited from them.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers who have filed the suits, and those planning to
file, insist that the full picture is yet to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that only one serious drug reaction out of 10'' is
reported to the FDA, said Robert Gordon, a partner in the Manhattan
firm of Weitz &AMP; Luxemberg, ``we see that as the tip of an
iceberg.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The firm specializes in mass-tort cases involving product
liability law. It has run advertisements asking ``Propulsid
victims'' to ``fully explore'' their legal rights by calling the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public likes to see it as vultures,'' Gordon said of
lawyers' seeking clients who might have been affected by drugs that
were pulled from the market. ``But the lawyers come in to say, `How
about compensating the people who have been injured?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, however, the legal results are at odds with later
scientific findings. The manufacturers of silicone breast implants,
for instance, paid $7 billion in judgments or settlements to women
who said they were harmed by the devices. But a scientific study
last year found no persuasive evidence that the implants were
responsible for some of the most devastating ailments that the
plaintiffs attributed to them, such as lupus and rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jay Bern, of the Manhattan firm of Napoli, Kaiser, Bern &AMP;
Associates, said that Warner-Lambert had ``failed to advise the
medical community as well as the individual potential users of the
dangers it knew were inherent in the use of Rezulin, such as
potentially fatal liver problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Fauteux said that Warner-Lambert ``appropriately warned of
Rezulin's risks,'' while Panico said the adverse reactions to
Propulsid occurred when the drug was not used in an ``appropriate
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In its newspaper ad, headlined ``Rezulin Alert,'' Bern's firm,
which also has a history of mass-tort litigation, tells former
Rezulin users that they ``may be entitled to financial
compensation'' if they have liver troubles or symptoms like swollen
legs from a buildup of fluids, and it urges them to ``call us
immediately to learn about your legal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Bern's clients, Bruce Dallow, began to experience leg
swelling about a month after he began taking Rezulin in May 1998.
Within several months ``his legs were like tree limbs,'' his wife,
Helen, recalled last week. Dallow, 59, of Ridgefield, Conn., is
awaiting a transplant because of severe damage to his liver that he
attributes to Rezulin. Bern filed a suit for Dallow in state
Supreme Court in Manhattan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dallow said that while he had been contending with arthritis and
diabetes before using Rezulin, the drug caused weakness and fatigue
that left him unable to continue in his job as a security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was superman,'' he said of his pre-Rezulin
days, ``but I was hanging in there.''

MINORITIES ON FORCE SAY POLICE WATCH THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In an unusual alliance, the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association is joining the New York Civil Liberties Union and
groups representing black and Hispanic police officers to discuss
their concerns about the Police Department's possible monitoring of
the groups, which are often critical of the department.
</P>
<P>
   The groups are planning to hold a news conference Sunday to
release a letter they have written to Police Commissioner Howard
Safir about some of the department's activities in connection with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil Liberties Union has always been and continues to be
concerned about the possible surveillance of political activities,
and we will raise serious and substantial questions about it at the
press conference,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the
civil liberties group.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations that Siegel and the police union think have
come under scrutiny are 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care and
the Latino Officer's Association. The heads of the two
organizations, Lt. Eric Adams and Lt. Anthony Miranda,
respectively, will also attend the news conference, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a senior commander in the department's Internal
Affairs Bureau, testifying in an unrelated civil lawsuit, revealed
that two inquiries had been conducted into 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement and Adams, its president. While the official, Deputy
Chief Raymond King, said the investigations had been closed without
any finding of wrongdoing, the disclosure raised questions about
why they had been conducted.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the investigations, Adams was followed and his
telephone records obtained, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter to Safir praises him for his willingness to meet
Adams to discuss the investigations, but suggests that perhaps
other police officials, presumably without his knowledge, have been
monitoring the groups' activities. The letter, signed by Siegel,
Adams, Miranda and Greg Longworth, a PBA lawyer, cites the
department's consistent monitoring of press conferences held by the
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel would not comment Saturday on the contents of the letter,
saying he did not wish to discuss it before it was delivered to
Safir. A police spokesman said the department would have no comment
until Safir saw the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance of the normally conservative police union and
Siegel, one of the city's most persistent and vocal critics of
department practices, comes as the union is locked in bitter
contract negotiations with the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased that the PBA has agreed to appear at the
press conference,'' Siegel said, adding, ``We believe that their
involvement with the black and Latino groups sends a strong message
of unanimity on a fundamental question about possibly problematic
NYPD practices.''

IN NASHVILLE ON AUG. 8, GORE PLANS TO ANNOUNCE HIS NO. 2
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.C., Tenn., Pa., Calif.)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ Vice President Al Gore plans to
announce his choice of a running mate on Tuesday, Aug. 8, campaign
aides said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The date, five days after the Republican convention in
Philadelphia and a week before the Democratic convention in Los
Angeles on Aug. 14, will kick off a three-week road show during
which Gore hopes to dominate the news and establish momentum for
the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat unusual for a presidential candidate to announce
in advance when he is going to announce his choice of a running
mate. But the Gore campaign hopes to set up a stark contrast with
what it perceives as the haphazard atmosphere that characterized
Gov. George W. Bush's selection of Dick Cheney. Gore's campaign
spokesman, Chris Lehane, described that atmosphere as
``carnival-like.''
</P>
<P>
   By setting a date for the announcement, Gore aides said they
hoped that they could eliminate some of the chaos leading to it,
and that voters would perceive Gore as making this important
decision in a mature, methodical manner _ and, by extension, that
they would perceive Bush as not ready to occupy the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement is scheduled for Nashville, where Gore's
headquarters are. The new ticket will then almost certainly head to
the running mate's home state. From there the two will travel
through the battleground states, separating at some point. Gore is
not scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles until Aug. 16, two days
after the convention opens. Just before then, he will conduct a
kind of ``passing of the torch'' ceremony with President Clinton so
that Gore can enter Los Angeles as his own man.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gore said Saturday during a walk on the beach with
his family that he had still not settled on a running mate,
although he has given strong indications that he is close to a
decision. He told reporters earlier that there were fewer than 10
people on his list; the list is believed to be much smaller than
that.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had made his choice, Gore said Saturday, ``Not yet,
we're just having a good time.'' Aides said he had been swimming
and working on a jigsaw puzzle as he and his family began a
weeklong vacation at the five-bedroom seaside home of Parker and
Becky Overton, the Greenville couple who own a sporting goods
business and have been longtime friends of the Gores.
</P>
<P>
   The home is on Figure Eight Island, a guarded, gated community
with no commercial development just north of Wrightsville Beach,
where outsiders are stopped at a small bridge. Other homeowners
include the actors Kim Basinger, Alec Baldwin and Andy Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters as he flew here that he was actively
``mulling'' his choice but would probably not reach a final
decision until after he returned to Washington on Thursday. The
``mulling'' process itself is meant to contrast with what Gore
aides characterize as a frantic scramble for Bush and an incomplete
vetting of Cheney that left him unprepared for an immediate assault
from Democrats on his voting record.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore team says that for the first time in the long
preconvention positioning, the Cheney selection has given it an
important assist in illustrating Bush's weaknesses and Gore's
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's advisers, while conceding they are generally in the dark
as to whom he might pick, have given a couple of clues as to what
may be guiding his thinking over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   As they critique the Cheney choice, they focus on two things.
They say that Cheney is a ``retro'' candidate from the past and
that ``the visuals'' _ of an older white man with a history of
heart trouble _ hurt Bush. The suggestion is that Gore will pick
someone young and fresh and that the pictures of the two together
will immediately convey a positive sense of vigor and energy. Gore
is almost certainly guided by the instant lift his own selection
gave Bill Clinton in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the first thing people say to be positive and be
something you can build on,'' said one Gore strategist. ``That's
the problem Bush has been having _ they've been on the defensive
the whole week. You want the kickoff to be something powerful that
carries you for the first 48 to 72 hours. This issue stuff is
hurting Cheney. What's left is the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than go for a niche candidate who would help with a
specific state or a specific group of voters, Gore is believed to
be seeking someone who would reinforce his own strengths in much
the same way that he reinforced Clinton's. Both came from the
South, the same age group and the ideological center of the party,
and they proved that reinforcement rather than balance could be a
winning formula.

IN AMSTERDAM, BILLY GRAHAM TORCH WILL PASS TO MANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (Eds: Inserts 2 new grafs, beginning ``Graham also abandoned
...'')  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ The Rev. Jack Ruimb, senior pastor of a
congregation in the western highlands of Papua New Guinea, has by
his own count founded 321 churches in that South Pacific nation
since 1978. When he visits villages to speak about Jesus, Ruimb
said, he sometimes shows movies of another evangelist preaching.
``I use most of Billy's films,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Billy, he meant the Rev. Billy Graham, whose organization,
the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, has gathered Ruimb and
10,000 other evangelists from 190 countries in Amsterdam this
weekend for a nine-day conference billed as the largest such event
ever held.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam 2000, as the gathering is called, has turned a
rambling convention center on the city's southern edge into an
extraordinary crossroads of global evangelical Christianity. In the
space of a few minutes, a visitor can encounter the head of a
Protestant seminary in Pakistan, a Presbyterian pastor from Sudan
and a married couple of Salvation Army majors from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The makeup of the largely male group of participants reflects
the trend now marking global Christianity: the faith's shift toward
the Southern Hemisphere as the number of Christians expands rapidly
in Asia and Africa while remaining little changed or even declining
in northern countries. Lutherans in southern Africa, for example,
now outnumber those in North America.
</P>
<P>
   This trend accelerated sharply with the demise of colonialism
four decades ago. Churches, like governments, passed into local
hands, and the Scriptures were translated into native languages,
noted the Rev. Ian T. Douglas, associate professor of world mission
and global Christianity at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shift from being a church of the Western, industrialized
nations to being a church of Asia, Africa and the Pacific has
happened within the lifetime of most Christians,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He called it as significant a development within Christianity as
the faith's earlier and much more gradual shift in its center of
gravity from the Mediterranean to northern Europe and North
America.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have come here partly to learn about what is
happening in the rest of the world. Samuel Bartholomew, 26, a
student at Dallas Theological Seminary in Texas, said he wanted to
gain ``a greater global awareness of how God's moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference is symbolic in a personal way, for Graham. In
material distributed beforehand, the event is being described as a
``passing of the torch'' from the 81-year-old evangelist to a new
generation of preachers. (However, Graham has given no indication
that he will retire, and indeed plans to preach in Jacksonville,
Fla., in November.)
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpected and poignant turn of events, Graham was forced
to cancel plans to speak at the opening session Saturday night. He
is staying in the United States on doctors' orders, after
undergoing recent surgery to relieve a buildup of fluid on the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   Graham also abandoned plans to address the conference Saturday
night by satellite. Instead, his son conveyed the evangelist's
greetings and read a brief statement from him.
</P>
<P>
   The Graham association released a short statement explaining
that Graham had ``felt he lacked the energy and strength, following
a sleepless night, to deliver his opening remarks.''
</P>
<P>
   A close observer of the Graham organization, William Martin, a
professor of sociology at Rice University in Houston, said the
conference seemed a fitting place to speak of passing the torch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the true successor to Billy Graham is not going to
be any single person,'' said Martin, the author of a biography of
Billy Graham, ``A Prophet With Honor'' (Morrow, 1991). ``The
circumstances are not likely to permit it or encourage it. He sees
his own legacy not as one person, but as these tens of thousands of
evangelists preaching all over the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Graham's absence has heightened the role here of his eldest son,
Franklin, who is first vice chairman of the Graham association and
his father's designated successor as that organization's head.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the younger Graham, 48, president of a
Christian relief organization called Samaritan's Purse, said his
father ``took a nose dive, healthwise,'' after he finished a public
preaching event in Nashville, Tenn., last month. ``It was a
dangerous situation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Admitted to the Mayo Clinic, Billy Graham had two shunts
implanted to drain off the fluid and relieve the pressure on his
brain. His condition has improved markedly, and he is being treated
on an outpatient basis. He will watch the conference by satellite,
his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham will be among the speakers here _ but not until
after he has flown for one day to Philadelphia to offer a prayer at
the Republican convention when it opens on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of the global reach of the conference, its
proceedings will be simultaneously translated into 28 languages,
from Arabic to Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   In its 50 years, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has
built ties to churches and other Christian organizations throughout
the world. It relied on them, a spokesman said, to screen the
28,000 applicants who wanted to come to Amsterdam, selecting the
10,000 due to arrive here.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Southwell, an official of the association, said the
conference was intended particularly to bring in people under 45,
who were ``significantly involved'' in evangelism but rarely, if
ever, had attended a big religious conference.
</P>
<P>
   Two west African preachers who were among Friday's arrivals said
they hoped to learn more about carrying the Christian message into
their countries' communities.
</P>
<P>
   Appollos Nuhu Jabho, a Nigerian, serves as a missionary with
evangelical and Pentecostal churches in his own country, and said
he was seeking ``spiritual refreshment, spiritual revitalization.''
The Rev. Edem J. Anthony, said he came from Togo to learn new
evangelistic strategies. ``I am working with young people in the
schools,'' he said. ``We are getting to the rural villages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Solomon Kendagor, a Kenyan, and his wife, Ruby, a
Canadian citizen born in Trinidad, illustrate the crosscultural
trends of modern Christianity. They work as missionaries in St.
Louis, training Americans to reach out to international students
studying in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students we work with, not all of them will become
Christians,'' Ruby Kendagor said, ``but they will go back to their
native countries and say: `Yes, Christianity is true. People showed
kindness to me.'''

   COLOMBIA-INTRO _ With the highest murder and kidnapping rates in
the world, a raging civil war, the worst recession in memory and
plummeting public confidence in the army and the government,
Colombia is facing the most dire crisis in its history. Thousands
of people are fleeing the country, while human rights activists
estimate another 1 to 2 million have been displaced internally by
repeated attacks by leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitary
groups. We profile two groups _ kidnap victims and displaced people
_ as a window into everyday life in Colombia. (Williams, Cox News
Service)

   COLOMBIA-KIDNAP _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families come to the
national radio station each week, clutching hand-written notes they
hope will somehow reach their kidnapped relatives. With an average
of 8 kidnappings a day, Colombia is a nation living in fear.
Leftist guerrillas and paramilitary groups have turned kidnapping
into a big business _ some 3,000 victims were snatched last year _
to raise money for their armies. We profile a few families of
kidnap victims who hope against hope they will somehow see their
loved ones again. (Williams, Cox News Service).

   COLOMBIA-DISPLACED _ BOGOTA, Colombia _ Libia Barahona watched
warring leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries battle in
her remote village for months, dodging bullets and hiding with her
five children. Finally, she fled, abandoning her small store and
restaurant, eventually making her way to Bogota, where she is now
homeless. Barahona is one more victim in the tidal wave of 1 to 2
million Colombians - mostly rural peasants - displaced by the
country's civil war. Human rights activists fear the US aid package
may only increase the flow of refugees as poor campesinos are
forced out of the countryside by crop eradication programs and the
escalating war between guerrillas and the Colombian army.

   MEXICO-MIGRATION _ SAN FELIPE TORRES MOCHAS, Mexico _ Like
millions of other young Mexicans, Eusebio de Haro set out for the
United States in May, confident he'd find work like he did before.
Instead De Haro was shot to death, allegedly, by an elderly Texas
rancher after he and another young man knocked on his door to ask
for water in a remote area near the Rio Grande. The option to the
United States for work is as deeply ingrained in De Haro's home
state as the Virgin of Guadalupe. But it is an option that appears
to be getting more deadly every day for those who choose to cross
the border illegally. Migration is probably the toughest of all
issues between these two countries. And Mexican President-elect
Vicente Fox, who is from De Haro's home state, has heightened the
profile even more, suggesting more visas for Mexican workers and
working toward an open border for the free flow of labor in as
little as 10 years. (Ferriss, Cox News Service).

<P>
   MIGRATION-SIDE _ GUANAJUATO, Mexico _ Migration has affected
some towns in Fox's Guanajuato state where state social workers
attend to abandoned families and other problems. They're also
encouraging successful migrants to invest in communities to create
jobs there. These are towns that send construction workers to
Arkansas, laborers and harvesters to Texas and Georgia and others
states. We tell it from the perspective of a young social worker we
watched in action. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

   GOP-MONEY _ WASHINGTON _ As Republicans gather in Philadelphia,
there's a lot of wooing going on. The nation's biggest companies,
often with crucial issues before Congress, are pouring millions of
dollars into the Republican National Convention, and they'll do it
again in a couple of weeks when the Democrats meet in Los Angeles.

   WESTERNER-CHENEY _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ George W. Bush's
selection of a Westerner to be his running mate suggests greater
national involvement in parochial, Western issues, say political
observers. The presence of Dick Cheney, who spent 12 years in
Washington, D.C., as Wyoming's lone congressman, on the national
Republican ticket might mean ``some Western issues will get a
little more air time,'' said Pete Kolbenschlag, Western Slope
director for the Colorado Environmental Coalition. What happens
after that, though, depends on the speaker. (Harmon, Grand Junction

   WESTERN-ISSUES _ GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ Never underestimate the
importance of the West to presidential candidates on the stump,
especially when reaching out to voters outside the West. Protecting
wilderness, for instance, ``plays well in California,'' said
Michael Gizzi, a professor of political science at Mesa State
College, even if it might not win Colorado. That kind of
directional drilling for electoral votes _ sink a drill in the
red-rock side of flyover country and hope to strike gold in
California or New York _ is a staple of national campaigning. In
some cases this year, though, the direction gets reversed. (Harmon,

   BUSH-YEARS _ PHILADELPHIA _ The George W. Bush presidential

a governor not acclaimed as a great orator. ``Tomorrow,'' Bush said
in March 1999 at the Austin Convention Center, ``I will file papers
forming an exploratory committee so I can take the next step in
considering a campaign for president of the United States. This
will allow my friends to begin assessing the level of support for
my candidacy and to begin raising funds.'' Support turned out to be
good. Fund raising turned out even better. (Austin

   HUNLEY _ For most of the 136 years since it became an icon of

buried in the soft mud at the bottom of Charleston Harbor _ lost,
then found, but always surprisingly safe from the ravages of time.
All that will change next month when a giant crane lifts the
Hunley, encrusted with marine growth, from its watery grave into
the sunlight of a Carolina summer. For Civil War and submarine
buffs the world over, raising the Hunley will mark the realization
of a dream. For archaeologists, it is the start of a race against
time _ one that will ultimately determine how many secrets locked
inside in the 40-foot submarine are uncovered. ``The minute the
Hunley reaches the surfaces, we will have a ticking time bomb on
our hands,'' says'' says Maria Jacobsen, the archaeologist who will

GOP CHAIRMAN SAYS PARTY DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GAYS &HT;    By SUSANNA McBEE
 &HT;    c.2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Despite strong anti-gay language in the party's
platform, Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson said here
Saturday that the GOP ``is steadfastly against discrimination of
any kind,'' including that directed at homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson was asked at a breakfast meeting with reporters how he
thought the party's 2,066 delegates would react to the appearance
of the openly gay daughter of presumptive vice presidential nominee
Dick Cheney at the convention Wednesday night when Cheney is
expected to deliver his acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Cheney, 31, until recently was the Coors Brewing Company's
corporate relations manager for the gay community. She is now a
college business major in Colorado. Ray Sullivan, a spokesman for
the George W. Bush campaign, said, ``We expect her to attend.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said that if she attends the event with her female
partner, ``I think it would be just fine. I don't think it would be
a problem. This party is steadfastly against discrimination of any
kind against anybody regardless of their race, sex, creed or any
preferences that they choose to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The party chairman's words contrasted with the document approved
by the 107-member Republican Platform Committee, meeting across
town about the same time Saturday that he was speaking. It restored
language on gay rights that had been dropped in an initial draft.
The section ended up saying, ``We do not believe sexual preference
should be given special legal protection or standing in law.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members also voiced support for the ``traditional
definition of marriage'' and denounced efforts by gay rights
advocates to ``force states to recognize other living arrangements
as marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   After heated debate the committee the committee approved a line
saying, ``We affirm that homosexuality is incompatible with
military service.''
</P>
<P>
   The language would require the armed forces to revert to their
former outright ban on gays in the military, the policy that
preceeded President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell, don't
pursue'' system, which permits gays to serve as long as they are
not openly homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's version puts the platform at variance with
Bush's views. The Texas governor ``believes the current military
policy is correct,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said after the
committee's vote. ``There's always going to be some language that's
not 100 percent in sync with the governor. But the governor
believes `don't ask, don't tell' is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   During the debate Cheryl Williams, a platform committee member
from Oklahoma, said that troops ``are in very close proximity when
they are training'' and that gays in the military create
``mistrust.'' She added that the current policy has been ``very
destructive to the morale of our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Eleveld, a committee member from Michigan, replied, ``I
don't know what (a soldier's sexual orientation) has to do with
whether you can trust him when he's in the foxhole next to you. I
don't think we should rule out a large group of men and women who
prefer a different sexual lifestyle from service in our military.''
</P>
<P>
   Convention delegates will vote on the platform Monday night.

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ Peru's prime minister on Saturday warned that
organizers of demonstrations that left six people dead and more
than 80 wounded on Friday, when President Alberto Fujimori was
inaugurated, could be held responsible and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial center of Lima was converted into a smoky
battlefield during the inauguration, as thousands of demonstrators
charged police barricades, threw firebombs, set bonfires and
vandalized government offices. The police arrested scores of people
but not before fires raged out of control in several public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there is responsibility, and it lies with those who
organized the march,'' Prime Minister Federico Salas said. ``This
is now in the hands of the federal prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts saw the comments as a hint that opposition leaders,
including Alejandro Toledo, could be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo ran against Fujimori but dropped out of the race a week
before the May runoff, saying the election was fraudulent. He said
Friday's damage and deaths were caused by government intelligence
agents who infiltrated the crowds. ``If they blame us, they cannot
get away with that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The six people who died Friday were all bystanders _ five
security guards and one driver at the Banco de la Nacion, a public
bank that was set ablaze. Firefighters said they could not put out
the fires quickly because their trucks were blocked by rioters.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators punched holes in the tires of four fire trucks
before they could reach the Palace of Justice to put out a blaze,
the Lima fire department reported.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori shuffled part of his cabinet on Saturday, appointing as
economy minister Carlos Bolona, who engineered sweeping
privatizations and deregulation policies in the early years of the
president's first term.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Bolona, a 50-year-old economist, is intended
to improve relations with foreign investors and businessmen, who in
recent weeks have complained that Fujimori is becoming a populist.
Since his re-election in May to a third five-year term, Fujimori
has pushed through legislation that suspended several
privatizations and withdrew tax benefits to foreign mining
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural speech, Fujimori spoke of replacing imports by
increasing government support for several industries. But he also
promised to reduce government deficits and keep inflation down to 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bolona has been critical of the government for
overspending, but during the election campaign he came to the
president's defense and sharply criticized Toledo.

<P>
   Fujimori also changed his interior, industry, labor and
agriculture ministers. The cabinet changes came less than a week
after he replaced Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante, a moderate who
was pushing for democratic reforms, with Salas, the mayor of a
small provincial town who ran against Fujimori this year and won
just over 2 percent of the vote. Fujimori said his appointment was
intended to bring the ``responsible opposition'' into his
government.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Salas called for the replacement of
Vladimiro Montesinos, the intelligence chief held responsible by
international observers for organizing campaign dirty tricks. In
the last week, Salas has dropped his criticism.

BUSH CHALLENGES GORE TO SUPPORT MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 By STEWART M. POWELL   
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Republican George W. Bush challenged Vice
President Al Gore on Saturday to ``pick up the phone'' and urge
President Clinton to sign legislation passed by the Republican
Congress that would eliminate the so-called tax penalty paid by
married couples under the federal tax code.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Striking a populist tone on the second day of a five-day, five
state trip to the GOP convention in Philadelphia, Bush urged
Clinton to sign into law the GOP-sponsored legislation that cleared
the House and Senate in time to reach the president's desk before
the opening of the Republican nominating convention on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be penalizing marriage in the tax code,'' Bush
told more than 1,000 supporters spilling out of an aircraft hanger
into pouring rain at an airport rally in Owensboro, Ky. ``Mr.
President, you ought to sign that bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a jab at Gore, Bush noted his opponent's claims to have
been the ``most influential vice president in history'' and
declared: ``If that's the case, he ought to pick up the phone and
he ought to tell President Clinton, `You ought to sign the marriage
penalty relief bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the federal tax code ought to be revised to
``encourage marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-sponsored legislation would end a so-called ``penalty''
paid by married couples that file joint federal tax returns.
Currently, married couples filing jointly pay more taxes than they
would if they were not married and filed individual tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vows to veto the measure, contending it consumes too
much of the federal budget surplus and benefits the wealthy more
than the middle class. Last week, Clinton asserted that Republican
lawmakers have passed a series of ``reckless'' tax cuts that
threaten to ``drain away our hard-earned surplus and put us back in
the red.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush derided the Clinton-Gore administration's resistance to the
deep tax cuts that he proposes as a way to return a portion of the
blossoming federal budget surplus to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore ``believes a surplus is the government's money,'' Bush
said, eliciting boos from his partisan audience in Owensboro. ``We
believe the surplus is the people's money and after we set our
priorities, I want to share some of that surplus with the people
who pay the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is not only going to hear the voices of the
people who are creating jobs, we're going to hear the people who
are struggling go get ahead in their jobs and knock down the toll
booth on the road to the middle class,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush vowed to revise a federal tax code that he said imposes a
higher proportionate tax on a single mother raising two children on
$22,000 a year than on someone earning more than $200,000. ``That's
not right,'' Bush insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush later touted the GOP platform approved by state party
leaders in Philadelphia for final convention action on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to win the presidency ``not to hold the
job'' but to lead the nation in ``new directions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win this campaign because we have the best
ideas (and) we have the right platform,'' Bush declared. ``We've
got a philosophy that's conservative and a philosophy that's
compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush told reporters aboard his campaign plane that he was ``not
overconfident,'' adding that he had ``seen defeat first-hand'' and
had seen ``poll numbers crumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's comments followed Gallup poll commissioned by Time
magazine that showed Bush leading by 16 percentage points among
likely voters _ the widest lead Bush has enjoyed since he and Gore
captured their parties' presidential nominations in March.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hitting Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia and
Ohio, arriving in Philadelphia on Wednesday.

BUSH ROARS INTO KENTUCKY TO WIN THE STATE'S VOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Gov. George W. Bush swung through another
battleground state Saturday, proclaiming that the days of
Republican losses were over. ``We haven't won Kentucky lately,'' he
thundered, ``but that's going to change come November.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush promised to bring a new tone to Washington as he
criss-crossed Kentucky on the second day of his march to the
Republican National Convention. He drew large crowds despite
downpours and drizzle, with people lined up under umbrellas to
shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're sick of the politics of personal destruction,
there's a place for you in this campaign,'' Bush shouted to an
audience that crammed into an airport hangar in Owensboro and
spilled out onto the rain-drenched tarmac. ``If you want somebody
to unite the nation, there's a place for you in this campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   His words Saturday were not aimed as pointedly at President
Clinton as they were on Friday when he began his tour in Arkansas,
but he still ended every speech promising to uphold ``the honor and
the dignity'' of the presidency. He tried for soaring tones,
promising ``to lead Americans in new directions.''
</P>
<P>
   But off the campaign trail his vice presidential running mate
was not shy about taking on Clinton. In an interview taped for the
program Fox News Sunday, Dick Cheney said: ``I am generally one of
those people who thinks Bill Clinton has been an embarrassment to
the country. He is a tragic figure in a way, obviously very
bright.'' He said Clinton has ``an impressive set'' of political
skills but has ``fundamental flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign struck back promptly. ``They have been saying
for weeks that they would not engage in the politics of personal
destruction,'' said Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the vice
president, ``But right out of the box they've resorted to old-style
Republican politics.''
</P>
<P>
   As Bush made his way to the convention, gone were his usual
small panel discussions. All across Kentucky, he revved up the
kinds of rally crowds not seen since the height of the Republican
primaries. Balloons fell. American flags unfurled. Confetti
dropped. Rock music blared. And streamers were shot to the rafters.
The only thing that went wrong was the breakdown of a backup press
plane.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere the crowds were large. As many as 5,000 people
chanted his name in a sports arena in Joplin, Mo., on Friday night.
In Owensboro, people stood under umbrellas in heavy rain to shake
his hand. And outside the Louisville Slugger Museum, where an
oversized baseball bat towers over the building, hundreds more
waited in the drizzle for an outdoor rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased by the energy level,'' Bush told reporters on his
campaign plane. He said the audiences were ``like the crowd you'd
expect on the last days of the campaign.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the Republican convention opens on Monday, congressional
leaders will be relegated to less desirable time spots and some of
the focus will be on nonpoliticians whom Bush described as ``people
who are reinforcing our message.''
</P>
<P>
   The perils of that approach were on display Saturday when Chris
Payne, an employee of a grain company, dressed in his work clothes,
kept losing his lines as he was introducing Bush. Several times he
stopped in midsentence and had to pull a written speech from his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry. I'm not a public speaker,'' he said. He then read
of Bush, `He trusts you and me to make the best decisions,'' which
was supposed to be a plug for Bush's plan to divert some of the
Social Security payroll tax to individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And he took pains to assure older people that Bush's Social
Security plan would not affect them but only younger workers. ``I
want the elderly here in this audience to hear me loud and clear,''
he said. ``Don't be fooled by that kind of politics where they're
going to get on your TV screen and try to scare you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush,'' he said, ``will keep the promise to the
elderly in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also fired up audiences with talk of tax cuts, though he
did not explicitly mention his plan to cut taxes by $1.3 trillion
across a decade. ``You see I happen to think the surplus means
government has more money than it needs,'' he said, to cheers. ``I
happen to know that one of the reasons we have a surplus is that
the taxes on the people that are working hard are the highest
they've been since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference in this campaign,'' he roared. ``My
opponent thinks the surplus is the government's money. We know the
surplus is the people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   A small crowd of protesters opposed to the death penalty read
out the names of people executed in Texas and chanted, ``Killed by
Bush.'' But they were far outnumbered by Bush supporters. Bush
shouted louder into the microphones, and the sound system mostly
drowned the demonstrators out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrives at the convention Wednesday morning, Bush
will have passed through three other states that voted for Clinton
in the last two elections _ Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
And he pledged Saturday that not only he but Cheney would appear in
swing states as the fall campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times the vice presidential candidate, we'll say OK,
head out to solidify the base,'' he said. ``But our intention is
that both of us will be focusing on swing states. I may be there
one week and he'll be there the next.''

NEWCOMERS CONTRIBUTE IN A HURRY FOR THE METS
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be hard for even the most pessimistic New
York Mets fan to find anything wrong with Saturday's game. The Mets
played brilliant defense, got hits when they needed them and had
solid pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza hit a mammoth homer. Mike Bordick homered on the
first pitch he saw as a Met. Rick White, the newest addition to the
bullpen, was the winning pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals will not be a late
addition to the ``10 Greatest Moments in Mets History'' promotion
Sunday, but it was satisfying. The Mets won their fifth game in a
row, and Bordick and White, acquired Friday from Baltimore and
Tampa Bay, respectively, played a part.
</P>
<P>
   White pitched the eighth inning with the score tied, 3-3. He
issued two walks, and with two outs faced Cardinals pinch-hitter
Shawon Dunston, a trading-deadline acquisition by the Mets last
season. White struck him out, then watched as his new teammates
mounted a winning rally in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura, who came off the disabled list after missing two
weeks with a bruised rotator cuff, drew his third walk of the game
to lead off. Bordick singled with one out, and another walk by Mike
James _ the Cardinals' 10th of the day _ loaded the bases for
pinch-hitter Lenny Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, who has returned on the bench with Ventura back, dropped
a single into right field, scoring Ventura and giving the Mets a
4-3 lead. Armando Benitez worked a 1-2-3 ninth for his 25th save,
striking out Jim Edmonds on a 97 mph fastball to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cheer of the game was for Bordick, the Mets' new
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've heard people say is you've got to watch this
guy for a while,'' Bordick said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   It took Mets fans one pitch to recognize Bordick in a big way.
He pounded a chest-high fastball from Andy Benes over the
left-field fence to lead off the third. It was Bordick's 17th homer
of the year, extending his career high and tying the score, 1-1.
One pitch into his Mets career, and Bordick had received a standing
ovation at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets kept at Benes, whom they battered for 11 hits and six
runs in five innings in May. He walked three of the next five
hitters, bringing up Piazza with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza pulled a single to left, scoring Jay Payton and giving
the Mets a 2-1 lead. The hit improved Piazza's career average with
the bases loaded to .400. In 90 at-bats in that situation, he has
12 homers and 101 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, whose 14 career grand slams put him in a first-place
tie with Cincinnati's Ken Griffey Jr. among active players, came up
next. But Ventura, who walked in his first at-bat off the disabled
list, grounded to first to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did not have the lead for long. After Edgar Renteria
singled to open the fourth, Edmonds smacked an opposite-field home
run, his 30th homer of the year, to put the Cardinals ahead, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   That lead stood until the sixth inning, when Piazza came up
again. Piazza had gone eight games without a home run, matching his
longest drought of the season. His drive in the sixth traveled so
far, one run seemed insufficient to account for it. Piazza turned
on a Benes pitch and launched it toward a children's playground
behind the left-field bullpen. It bounced over the bullpen's back
fence and onto the top of a party tent, 455 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning offensive display, and two batters later, the
50,726 fans at Shea Stadium witnessed stunning defense. Todd Zeile
crushed a ball to deep center field, sending Edmonds sprinting
back. Tracking the ball all the way over his left shoulder, Edmonds
extended his glove just far enough to snare the ball, toppling to
the ground as he caught it.
</P>
<P>
   The catch was similar to one Edmonds made for Anaheim three
years ago, which became a staple of highlight shows and helped earn
him the recognition he needed to win a Gold Glove. Edmonds plays
for the Cardinals, but the Mets fans had to stand and cheer this
catch, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They were happier cheering a great defensive play by their own
center fielder one inning later. Dennis Cook put himself in a
bases-loaded, one-out jam in the seventh by walking two and
allowing a double. Ray Lankford flied to Jay Payton in center, and
pitcher Rick Ankiel _ who was pinch-running _ broke for home.
</P>
<P>
   Payton fired the ball in and caught Ankiel easily. Cook, backing
up the plate, pumped his arm excitedly and did not leave the field
until he greeted Payton.  &QL;

DAYNE SHINES IN GIANTS SCRIMMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was the best of both worlds for coach Jim
Fassel during the New York Giants' annual intrasquad scrimmage
Saturday. In the opening moments of the 41-play scrimmage, the
first-string defense dominated the second-string offense.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Giants' first offensive unit got on the field
several plays later, quarterback Kerry Collins looked sharp,
completing 4 of 5 passes for 87 yards, including a 60-yard
touchdown to Amani Toomer. Meanwhile, the rookies Ron Dayne and Ron
Dixon displayed no stage fright as each scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news was that the Giants' reconfigured
offensive line provided good protection for Collins and opened
holes for Dayne and Tiki Barber, who led all rushers with 24 yards
on three explosive carries up the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive starters were going against the second-string
defense, which is especially inexperienced on the line, but the new
and improved offense the Giants have promised did indeed look new
and improved. It was just a scrimmage, but three years ago in this
scrimmage, the defense outscored the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne, who gained 17 yards on four carries, showed some of the
skills that made him attractive to the Giants. Although he was
stopped for a 1-yard loss on his first carry, Dayne, the team's top
draft pick out of Wisconsin, ran for 5 yards on his next carry and
then ran for 12 yards _ breaking through three arm tackles as he
dashed around the left end.
</P>
<P>
   Later, on third down at the 1-yard line, Dayne took a handoff
from Collins, paused behind the pile at the line of scrimmage, then
bulled easily into the end zone over right guard. The wherewithal
to wait and see a developing hole impressed Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play was actually called to the left,'' Fassel said. ``But
Ron knows how to press a hole and make the cut. That showed a lot
of instinctive patience, and his patience is one of his best
attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Mike Cherry, the
third-string quarterback, bursting alone into the end zone on an
out-and-up route. Dixon, a third-round draft pick from Lambuth
University, dropped the first pass Cherry threw to him, but later
caught a 17-yard pass over the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Hilliard also had two receptions for 24 yards and Joe
Jurevicius caught two passes for 11 yards. Joe Montgomery carried
the ball five times for 16 yards. Defensively, linebackers Pete
Monty and Ryan Phillips were credited with sacks, as was defensive
tackle Frank Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said the Giants sustained no serious injuries.

BUSH HAS HIS WAY ON EDUCATION IN GOP PLATFORM
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DAN FREEDMAN
</P>
<P>
   C. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - Texas Gov. George W. Bush's convention aides on
Saturday put down a brief conservative Republican rebellion aimed
at scuttling his more moderate education policy.
</P>
<P>
   In several voice votes, the 107-member Republican platform
committee restored Bush's ideas on raising academic standards,
realigning the Head Start program, and providing vouchers for
children in failing public schools. The committee, which wrapped up
business Saturday just 48 hours
</P>
<P>
   before the Republican national convention's opening day, also
turned back a conservative bid to restore an old GOP plank to
abolish the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   That directive was a major element of the party's conservative
agenda under President Reagan in the 1980s. Since then it has been
the most visible dimension of the conservatives' bid to remove the
federal govnment from oversight of public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has pledged to make education a cornerstone of his campaign
as a ``compassionate conservative.'' On the campaign trail, he has
cited among his achievements as governor boosts in teachers'
salaries and in standardized test scores of minority students.
</P>
<P>
   So when the platform education subcommittee voted Friday to
delete a seven-point outline of Bush's policy, the presumptive GOP
candidate's Philadelphia ground forces swung into action. The
campaign's ``whip operation,'' modeled on the Capitol Hill system
for rounding up party-line votes, succeeded in coralling loyal
platform committee members, and they drafted substitute language.
From the campaign trail, Bush had given his nod to move in,
according to Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The new five-point outline put more emphasis on local control of
schools in order to meet conservative objections to Bush's view
that Washington does have a role to play in education.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a Bush ally and co-chair of the
platform committee, argued that the governor's proposals ``are not
new federal programs, federal bureaucracy, but principles of
leadership in education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We send delegations to Texas to see how they do it in Texas,''
said another ally, platform committee member JoAnn Davidson from
Ohio. ``Why would we not want to speak to the principles of
Governor Bush in this platform?''
</P>
<P>
   Platform members who succeeded in stripping out the Bush policy
Friday were muted in their effort keep it out Saturday. Bush ``is
very aware the Department of Education is a stumbling block,'' said
Cheryl Williams, a delegate from Oklahoma. However, the Bush policy
''`renews the feel that it's the federal government that's
controlling (education),`` she charged.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who describes herself as a conservative ``mom'' from
Edmond, a suburb of Oklahoma City, spearheaded the effort to
reinstate the language on abolishing the Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The abolition call was in the 1996 platform but was deleted from
the draft of the this year's platform in accordance with Bush's
view that Washington should have a role in maintaining education
standards and offering education alternatives to parents in
academically troubled schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has made tremendous strides despite the
Department of Education,'' Williams said. ``Can you imagine what he
could have done had the federal government not been involved?''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argued that Republicans have suffered from the public
perception that in calling for abolition of the Department of
Education, the party is anti-child and anti-education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the perception is fact or whatever, that's the
case,''' said Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., also a committee co-chair
along with Frist.
</P>
<P>
   After her amendment was defeated, Williams said she was
```bothered'' by the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ```I'm having trouble reconciling his work as a sitting governor
with his stand on expanding the Department of Education,''' she
said. ``I don't know how to reconcile it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she said she would continue to support Bush
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   The full convention will vote on the platform Monday night. $$$

VENEZUELANS VOTE TODAY ON THEIR FUTURE, NATIONAL AND LOCAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACAS _ In the lingo of Venezuela's residents and its media,
Sunday's vote isn't just big, it's a ``mega-election.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 candidates are vying for 6,000 public offices. The
posts include the presidency, seats in the National Assembly,
governorships, mayoralties, and memberships in several lesser-known
local and national councils.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not the last election either. There will be another one
next month for other municipal offices.
</P>
<P>
   While there seems to be little mystery over who will win the
nation's top post (the fiery incumbent, Hugo Chavez, is expected to
win easily over his closest rival, former military comrade
Francisco Arias) and little interest in the smaller offices, much
of the drama of Sunday's vote will focus on the makeup of the
Assembly, or congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the world knows who's going to be president, but
what we don't know yet is whether he'll have a real Legislature to
keep him in check,'' Herman Escara, a 48-year-old congressional
candidate in Carabobo state, said Saturday. ``Hopefully the people
will see the need to have another power to balance a strong
executive.''
</P>
<P>
   All of Venezuela's public offices are up for election because of
a constitution adopted late last year. It is part of an overhaul of
the political establishment pushed by Chavez, the former coup
leader and paratrooper, who himself was elected less than two years
ago on a pledge to destroy the old, corrupt two-party system.
</P>
<P>
   Those parties barely exist today. Most of the congressional
candidates represent one of the many smaller factions that have
sprouted since Chavez's victory in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new parties and their candidates, riding on the
president's still-strong popularity, support Chavez. Others don't,
because they fear he sounds and acts too authoritarian. And some
candidates, like Escara, prefer to remain independent in a country
still in the midst of political transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main message is that we need to keep democracy and we need
a pluralistic assembly to keep political equilibrium in this
country,'' said Escara, a former senator.
</P>
<P>
   To gain a veto-proof majority, Chavez's supporters will have to
win 112 of the Assembly's 166 seats, an achievement that might have
seemed a lock just a few months ago, but now appears less likely,
according to political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venezuelan voters are not as quick to buy into Chavez's
revolution today as they were a year ago,'' said Enrique Urretzia,
a political consultant. ``But even with a simple majority of, say,
51 percent, Chavez will have a lot of power for a president.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's elections are the sixth in less than two years for one
of Latin America's longest-running democracies, making Venezuela's
12 million voters some of the wisest when it comes to recognizing
political tricks, and among the most weary of casting ballots,
especially in a country which is now sandwiched between a stagnant
economy and rising levels of crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in democracy, but I'd much rather see someone,
anyone, turn this country around,'' said Gladys Carrillo, 32, who
was selling plastic sunglasses at a weekend street fair Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers are concerned that the magnitude and complicated
nature of the elections may prove difficult to manage. The vote,
originally scheduled for May 28, was postponed at the last minute
because of several irregularities, including computer software
problems and a delay in delivering voting materials to local
precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Organization of American States and the Carter
Center, which sent the two largest teams of foreign election
monitors, said the problems appear to have been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Although a national simulation of the electronic vote-counting
system was not conducted in Venezuela, as it was before disputed
elections in Peru two months ago, officials will conduct an audit
of the system Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is concern because this is such a large and complex
system,'' Ruben Perina, chief of the OAS mission here, said
Saturday. ``We will start questioning when we see irregularities or
deficiencies in the process. But so far, none of the political
parties appears to be complaining.''

HONG KONG POLLS SHOW GROWING DISCONTENT WITH GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Discontent with the Hong Kong government has risen
to an all-time high since the former British colony's return to
Chinese rule, according to the latest bimonthly official survey.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in five people is happy with the government, while six
in 10 are dissatisfied or very dissatisfied, a dramatic slump since
the last official survey in May. Forty-three percent said they were
not confident China's capitalist enclave would continue to be
prosperous and stable, a 10-point jump since May.
</P>
<P>
   The results reflect growing resentment of a local government
widely viewed as ineffective, unrepresentative, and unresponsive.
Residents, who will go to the polls in six weeks, recently have
protested over property prices, wage cuts, and civil service
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In the balloting, voters will be able to elect nearly half of
their Legislative Council directly, but will not be given the
chance to unseat their increasingly unpopular chief executive, Tung
Chee-hwa, picked by a Beijing-selected committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, a former shipping tycoon, was chosen to lead Hong Kong for
five years after its return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997. He
came to office on a wave of patriotic optimism over Hong Kong's
return to Chinese rule and enthusiasm over a breakneck economy, but
his governing style has alienated a majority of the public and a
wide array of legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Tung's administration has been dogged by scandals over faulty
construction in public housing, a fiasco that forced out his
Harvard-educated housing chief, and by perceived attempts to quash
independent surveys that showed rising discontent.
</P>
<P>
   An array of surveys have shown that while Hong Kong people are
disillusioned with their local government, they are generally
satisfied with China and its apparent hands-off policy. Beijing's
Communist leadership promised Hong Kong virtual autonomy for 50
years following its return to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``People appreciate that Beijing has left its hands off Hong
Kong, but people blame Tung for looking to Beijing for advice or
consulting them. He doesn't show his own leadership, and that makes
people feel they can't trust the government,'' said Albert Cheng,
who hosts a popular radio talk show, ``Teacup in a Tempest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheng said his callers complain about joblessness, cuts in
take-home pay, and the perception that a few tycoons are ``looting
Hong Kong'' _ and that Tung is helping them do so by favoring
captains of industry and keeping property prices high for real
estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's representatives in Hong Kong rallied to defend Tung,
with Saturday's official China Daily saying that Tung ``deserves
full credit for the achievements . . . during the past three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday seminar on economic development in China, Henry Fok
Ying-tung, Beijing's top adviser on Hong Kong, said those who
dislike Tung ``are a minority, but Mr. Tung represents the
government, and he was appointed by the central government, so this
cannot be ruined by a few people who chant `Dump Tung' slogans.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael DeGolyer, director of the Hong Kong Transition Project,
a long-term study of Hong Kong, said Chinese officials ``seem
convinced there's a conspiracy of pollsters to dump Tung, as though
the messengers who carry the death notice are the ones who
committed the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the intuitive thinking of an authoritarian regime,''
DeGolyer complained. ``A democratic regime . . . would figure out
how to improve performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The new government survey showed people were most upset about
labor issues, with unemployment at 5 percent and wages dropping.
The next most cited concerns were a perceived stagnant economy and
housing problems. Among people dissatisfied with the government, 40
percent accused the administration of inefficiency. Forty percent
of all respondents said the government was indifferent to public
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong people are increasingly dissatisfied because they
feel Hong Kong could do better,'' DeGolyer said. ``People no longer
want a patriarchal system with a captain of a ship who says, `You
go where I tell you.' But we have a ship captain for a chief
executive.''

 &HT;    McCain navigates Bush's route
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Right off, things were different. No coffee or
doughnuts, and precious few memorable one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain gassed up his campaign bus for one more ride
Saturday from Washington to the Republican National Convention. But
in place of the wise-cracking maverick was a politician who was
trying awfully hard to be the loyal soldier.
</P>
<P>
   He mostly succeeded, telling reporters that George W. Bush is
running a centrist campaign that he supports, praising his onetime
rival for choosing Dick Cheney and tamping down talk of his future
in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2004, I fully expect to campaign for the re-election of
President Bush,'' McCain said to some of the 72 reporters who
joined a four-bus caravan to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he preferred to think of the ride as a ``trip down
memory lane,'' recalling countless hours aboard the bus in New
Hampshire and later in South Carolina, California, New York and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped in Blue Bell, Pa., to campaign for Stewart Greenleaf,
a Republican congressional candidate, at a town hall meeting
attended by 200 people in a hot gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain acknowledged, and said he regretted, that the large
entourage and his busy schedule during the convention might have
created the impression that he remains interested in pursuing the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will have a prime-time speaking role Tuesday night, and
he said he would devote his speech to convincing independents and
his supporters to vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Today, McCain will address the Shadow Convention, an alternative
gathering that will highlight the need for campaign finance reform,
the growing gap between rich and poor and problems in the war on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On the topic of the presidency, while he said several times that
he was reluctant to speculate, McCain, 63, said it was most
unlikely that he would run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be older. That's a factor,'' he said. ``The second
thing you have to figure is could we catch the lightning in a
bottle again? Could the circumstances that prevailed this last time
happen again?''
</P>
<P>
   About the only time McCain flashed a bit of the pique that was a
staple of his surprising, but ultimately failed campaign was when a
reporter asked if he had received permission from the Bush campaign
to stage the bus trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I checked, I'm a U.S. senator elected by the
people of Arizona,'' he said. Still, he was eager to show himself a
good sport after a sometimes ugly campaign with Bush. McCain's 250
delegates will be urged to support Bush and to accept defeat
graciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be a sore loser. Americans do not admire or
appreciate a sore loser,'' McCain said. ``So we just move forward.
Try to make the very best of it. I think I'm step eight of a
12-step presidential recovery program.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is scheduled to campaign with Bush in the West for three
days during the week following the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush and his wife, Laura, will spend the night at the
McCains' vacation home near Sedona, Ariz. McCain said he has been
asked to set aside another 10 days to campaign with Bush between
now and the election. Most of his energy will go to helping elect
congressional candidates who have been clamoring to have McCain
appear with them.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with his campaign's tradition, the buses departed
late from an Arlington, Va., hotel and arrived an hour late in Blue
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife, Cindy, was aboard, exchanging hugs and kisses
with several reporters who were regulars on the bus. She also toted
a video camera on behalf of ABC's Good Morning America.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta McCain, the senator's 88-year-old, globe-trotting mother
also rode along, admonishing her son at one point to step aside so
people could move past him. ``I raised my children with no
manners,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several media heavyweights, including George Stephanopoulos of
ABC News, showed up. Unlike most of his media colleagues,
Stephanopoulos climbed into a chauffeur-driven black Cadillac when
he finished his leg of the trip in McCain's bus.
</P>
<P>
   The senator plans to leave Philadelphia on Wednesday, but to
return Thursday to listen to Bush's acceptance speech that evening.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned that he has yet to be asked to join Bush on stage
at the convention's end. The joint appearance of the victor and the
vanquished in a show of unity is a tradition at political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he'd be pleased to raise his hand with Bush's, then
recalled the end of the 1980 Democratic convention, when President
Carter essentially chased Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) around the
stage in search of a picture of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be fun if I did like Kennedy did to Carter?''
McCain said mischievously. ``Kennedy was a lot quicker in those
days.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Reform Party members target Buchanan
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leaders of the Reform Party aimed to take a step toward removing
Pat Buchanan's name from the party's presidential ballot Saturday.
Seven of the party's 10 executive committee members met at a Dallas
hotel to vote on whether Buchanan could continue as a candidate
after accusations of fraud in his campaign, said Michael Farris,
the party's nominating committee chair. Buchanan spokesman, Brian
Doherty, dismissed the efforts as ``outrageous.'' The 164-member
national committee will review the executive committee's decision
when it meets Aug. 8 in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH WIDENS LEAD OVER GORE, POLL SHOWS
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush has widened his lead over
Democrat Al Gore to 16 percentage points, a CNN-Time poll released
Friday shows. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney led Vice President
Gore, 52 percent to 36 percent. The Green Party's Ralph Nader got 5
percent, and 4 percent for the Reform Party's Buchanan. The poll of
684 likely voters shows Bush's lead increasing by 10 percentage
points since mid-June, when he led 48 percent to 42 percent. The
survey has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS TO RELEASE NEGATIVE ADS
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee plans to air its first
negative Bush ad this week during the GOP convention, spending
about $3.5 million in 17 states, Democratic Party sources said
Saturday. The ads are designed to slow Bush's steady climb in the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   NADER CALLS GOP SCENE A `CARNIVAL'
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader dismissed the Republican convention as a ``political
carnival'' Saturday and denounced the two major parties for
accepting millions in corporate funds for the conventions. Speaking
five miles from the where the GOP convention opens in Philadelphia
on Monday, Nader criticized the parties for accepting $13.5 million
in federal funds, plus cash and in-kind contributions from private
entities. ``They pocket the taxpayers' money and sell the
conventions to special interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   BIG DOLLAR CONVENTION DONORS
</P>
<P>
   The $1 million donor list for both conventions includes
Microsoft Corp., which is giving $100,000 in cash and $900,000 in
software and services to each convention. The company is one of
major contributors facing high-stakes issues involving the federal
government. Others include:
</P>
<P>
   United Parcel Service is giving about $1 million in cash and
services to each convention.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospace and defense giant Lockheed Martin Corp., is giving
$100,000 to each convention.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, which is on both million-dollar lists, has
loaned a fleet of 400 cars to each convention as part of a
tradition that goes back to the 1950s. The vehicles include: 100
Buick LeSabres, 20 minivans, six Chevy Suburbans, 48 Cadillac
Sevilles and 10 Cadillac DeVilles.
</P>
<P>
   GORE COURTS HISPANIC VOTE
</P>
<P>
   Courting Hispanic voters, Gore challenged Bush to join him in
backing a Democratic proposal to expand immigration rights for
hundreds of thousands of Central Americans. Gore is pushing
legislation that would broaden the rights of about 500,000 Central
Americans and longtime illegal aliens seeking to obtain
citizenship, a hot issue among Hispanics. Currently, people fleeing
Cuba and Nicaragua can obtain citizenship; the new measure in
Congress would expand the list to include Salvadorans, Guatemalans,
Hondurans and Haitians. ``I call upon George W. Bush to make clear
his stance on this issue and join me in challenging Congress to
pass this essential legislation,'' Gore said Friday. Bush ``does
not support a complete amnesty at this time,'' spokesman Scott
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
   TRIPLE AMPUTEE TO GIVE GOP SPEECH
</P>
<P>
   Triple amputee and Vietnam veteran David Wenzel will share his
vision _ of a country where people with disabilities can have
access to homes and jobs _ when he addresses the Republican
National Convention on Thursday. A former mayor of Scranton, Pa.,
Wezel, 55, has been chosen to second the presidential nomination of
Bush. ``We are not looking for a handout. We want to give people
the opportunity to improve themselves,'' said Wenzel. If elected,
Bush has promised to ask Congress for $1 billion over five years to
help aid people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON DISSES `FRAT' BOY BUSH
</P>
<P>
   At a Democratic fund-raiser Friday for Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy
in Barrington, R.I., President Clinton mocked Gov. George W. Bush
for his gee-whiz attitude toward the presidency. ``I've been
governor of Texas. My daddy was president. I own a baseball team.
They like me down there,'' Clinton said, imitating Bush.
``Everything is rocking along hunky-dory. Their fraternity had it
for eight years. Give it to ours for eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. PROTEST SITE MAPPED OUT
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for civil liberties groups and the city of Los Angeles
agreed Friday on a protest site for demonstrators at the Democratic
National Convention, a parking lot across from the entrance to the
Staples Center, where the convention will be held in mid-August,
officials said. A federal judge had ruled last week that the
proposed site, in a parking lot farther away and out of sight and
earshot of entering delegates, was unconstitutionally restrictive.

&HT;    TEXAS REPUBLICANS RALLY BEHIND BUSH DESPITE DISCORD 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If George W. Bush can take anything for granted
in his campaign for the White House, it will be his continued
strong support from voters in his home state, including the 248
Texas delegates and alternates to the Republican National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush and most of the Texas GOP activists who will help
nominate him for president don't see eye-to-eye on some key issues
_ including education, trade and the role of homosexuals in the
Republican Party. These are differences that the candidate and the
delegates will try to downplay during their party's showcase event.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of a running mate and his stands against such things
as abortion, gun control and taxes emphasize the conservative part
of Bush's ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the Texas delegates are more conservative than Bush
_ and for that matter more conservative than many others at the
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Before most delegates even arrived in Philadelphia, a potential
tempest was brewing over Bush's decision to allow an openly gay
congressman to address the convention.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., is to speak Tuesday night on trade
issues, not gay rights, but his scheduled appearance was vigorously
attacked by delegate Cathie Adams of Dallas, president of the
ultraconservative Texas Eagle Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an affront to our families. This is just absolutely
wrong,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams estimated that as many as 70 percent to 75 percent of
Texas' delegates and alternates are social and religious
conservatives. They were selected at a state party convention in
Houston last month that also produced a Texas GOP platform
differing sharply with Bush in a number of policy areas and more
conservative on several issues than the national platform expected
to be adopted in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took the unusual step of skipping the state meeting
because, his campaign explained, he needed to spend the time in
states where he has to compete for votes. But there also was
speculation that he wanted to distance himself from debate and
publicity over a state party platform that would raise red flags
with the moderate voters whom he also needs to capture the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Chairwoman Susan Weddington said delegates'
differences with Bush are relatively minor. She predicted a ``very,
very strong'' show of support for Bush from his fellow Texans in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of our members are excited about his
candidacy,'' added Chuck Anderson, executive director of the Texas
Christian Coalition and a Texas delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has defused abortion as a convention issue and reinforced
his conservative support by picking Dick Cheney as his running mate
and agreeing to support a strong anti-abortion plank in the
national party platform.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's personal anti-abortion position is not as strong as
that espoused in the state Republican Party platform, which calls
for a total ban on abortions, without exception. Bush supports
exceptions in cases of rape or incest and to protect the life of
the mother, although he avoids calling attention to those
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists, meanwhile, represent a major disagreement between
Bush and many of his fellow Republicans. Bush hasn't exactly been a
hero for homosexuals. He opposes gay marriages and last year
opposed a bill before the Texas Legislature that would have given
homosexuals special protections against hate-motivated crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush had a highly publicized meeting with gay Republican
supporters in Austin a few months ago and declared himself a
``better person'' for the experience. Kolbe's scheduled convention
speech is believed to be an outgrowth of that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republicans, however, have a strong anti-gay plank in
their state platform that condemns homosexuality as ``contrary to
the fundamental, unchanging truths that have been ordained by
God.``
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, spokesman for the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay GOP
group, said there will be a record 18 openly gay delegates and
alternates to the Republican National Convention. None is from
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush and the leadership of the (national Republican)
party are all very committed to an inclusive, uplifting, positive
convention,'' Ivers said. ``If there are people who are concerned
about that, they are out of step.``
</P>
<P>
   Weddington said Bush has made it clear he isn't yielding on
issues promoted by gay rights activists and said she wasn't
concerned about Kolbe's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the concession is on the part of the leadership of the
gay movement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Weddington said that education, particularly government's role
in it _ and not gay rights _ may be the most significant sticking
point between Bush and many Texas Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Party platform urges abolition of the U.S. Department
of Education, but Bush doesn't go that far.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has made education reform a top issue of his campaign,
says he wants to de-emphasize the role of the federal government in
the public schools. In proposing new accountability requirements
for public schools, he has taken pains to insist that individual
states, not the federal government, would set their own standards.
But some Texas Republicans fear the accountability requirements
would have the federal government hovering over the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who want to do a much quicker dismantling of
the educational bureaucracy, both state and federal, and that's a
conflict,'' Weddington said.
</P>
<P>
   Other differences between Bush and the Texas GOP platform
include:
</P>
<P>
   --The platform urges the repeal of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which Bush supports. The platform also opposes permanent
trade relations with China, which Bush also supports.
</P>
<P>
   --Texas Republicans called for repeal of the minimum wage. Bush
hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   -- The platform supports the adoption of ``American English'' as
the official language of Texas and the United States. Bush, who is
reaching out to Hispanic voters, doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   -- Texas Republicans have called for abolition of the Internal
Revenue Service. Bush, instead, has called for changes in the tax
code.

 &HT;    Atlanta home to some, but asylum elusive
 &HT;    By Saeed Ahmed
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Until three months ago, Edgar Maldonado was a
relatively wealthy, well-respected television journalist in Bogota.
But in strife-torn Colombia, where the conflict between leftist
guerrillas and right-wing death squads have led to virtual
lawlessness, wealth and ties to the media can get you killed.
</P>
<P>
   When a close friend was gunned down in a hail of bullets on his
way to work at a radio station, and another was abducted to send a
message to journalists to self-censor their coverage of the
political violence, Maldonado decided he had no choice but to flee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting two, three death threats a day and when I
contacted the police, they simply said, `Take care; yours is not a
serious situation,''' said Maldonado, 48. ``But in the last five
months, the situation at work got so bad that the director of the
station said, `You are welcome to continue working for us, but you
better go off some place where you'll be more safe.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So, like thousands of Colombian professionals, Maldonado left
his well-established life behind and moved to Atlanta _ drawn to
the city, he said, by abundant job opportunities and a better
standard of living than elsewhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Colombia, if people get the impression you have some money,
you can be assured you or someone in your family will be among the
10-15 people who are kidnapped and held for ransom daily to fund
the civil war,'' Maldonado said. ``So what choice do you have? If
you are poor, like 80 percent of the population is, you simply move
from one part of the country to another. But if you can afford it,
you give up everything you worked hard for and leave, whatever the
outcome may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado was lucky. Soon after moving to Atlanta, he found a
job as an editor with La Voz del Pueblo, the only foreign-language
newspaper catering to Colombians in the area.
</P>
<P>
   But for most escapees, ``whatever the outcome may be'' means
taking up work in restaurants and grocery stores _ a far cry from
the affluence they were used to at home.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 30,000 Colombians now live in the metro area,
concentrated mostly in Cobb and Gwinnett counties. The Colombian
Consul General expects 10,000 more to arrive this year, making
Colombians the second-largest Latino group here, after Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the U.S. government frowns upon granting asylum to people
fleeing countries it considers allies, only a handful of Colombians
can claim asylum. Most come on temporary travel visas and stay
beyond the return date.
</P>
<P>
   W. Fred Alexander, acting Immigration and Naturalization
director in Atlanta, said that, although a substantial number of
Colombians have lately expressed concern for their safety, no
change in policy is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to judge each asylum application on its
merits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This pains Maldonado, who misses his wife and two teenage
children still in Bogota. He has resigned himself to navigating
through lengthy bureaucratic red tape before he can expect to be
reunited with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But such is life,'' he said. ``I am a man without a country,
and they are a family that is not whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Maldonado misses his country and yearns to return. But he also
knows that the turmoil in Colombia is unlikely to end soon, and the
exodus to Atlanta and other cities will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very gray and people have lost all hope,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, the situation will get much, much worse before it
gets better in Colombia.''

 &HT;    Kidnappings rattle Colombia
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The families arrive each Friday afternoon,
standing quietly in the dim hallway of Radio Nacional de Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Most clutch handwritten notes they will read into the
microphone, while others cluster in a corner or near the stairway,
whispering among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Torn by civil war, drug trafficking and a terrible crime wave,
Colombia has the highest kidnapping rate in the world, with nearly
3,000 victims reported last year.
</P>
<P>
   The crime has become so common in this nation of 39 million that
several radio stations now broadcast messages each week from
families hoping to reach missing loved ones. Many may never know if
the messages are heard, but they come anyway because they don't
know what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps because you feel you are doing something,'' said
Deisy Gonzalez Castillo, 30, a Bogota lawyer whose uncle was
kidnapped in April. ``We never thought this would happen to us. It
leaves you so upset. You can't eat or sleep, and you get
bad-tempered. You just want to go outside and run away.''
</P>
<P>
   While the drug war and the civil war have paralyzed parts of
Colombia, the wave of kidnapping _ an average of eight people per
day _ has touched nearly everyone: rich and poor, rural peasants
and the urban middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like ripples in a pond when you throw in a stone,'' said
Olga Lucia Gomez, a psychologist who works with Pais Libre _ ``Free
Country'' _ a group that aids families of the victims and has
organized a national campaign against kidnapping. ``The victim is
damaged, his family is damaged, their friends are damaged and all
of society is damaged. It breaks down trust and creates chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the crimes are committed by Colombia's leftist
guerrilla and right-wing paramilitary groups, which use the ransoms
to fund their armies. Common criminals also nab people, often
selling their victims to the guerrillas or paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Ransoms range from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of
thousands. Families are forced to sell their homes and businesses
and borrow every peso they can find, while businesses are extorted
for the return of their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Most shocking to many is that of the 2,945 kidnap victims in
1999, 7 percent were children.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's government has recently made kidnapping of children a
major issue in its talks with the leading guerrilla group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The group's
leaders have denied taking children but defend kidnapping as a
legitimate means of funding their 36-year-old insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo's family is typical of the victims. Her uncle,
Silvio Castillo, wasn't a guerrilla or a paramilitary. He wasn't
political at all, and he certainly wasn't rich.
</P>
<P>
   A truck driver, he was on a routine trip from Bogota to Medellin
to deliver auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jeep cut him off, and men got out with guns,'' said Deisy
Castillo. ``Another driver who was ahead of him saw it happen. We
have heard nothing from Silvio or the kidnappers since he was
taken. They never found his truck.''
</P>
<P>
   Families often wait for months before a ransom note arrives _ a
tactic that increases the pressure, leaving the victim's relatives
desperate and willing to pay whatever it takes to recover their
loved one.
</P>
<P>
   Many report their loss to the National Police, but often they
can do little but wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't express the pain you're feeling, and how can you
expect anyone to understand?'' said Sylvia Lopez, 36, whose brother
Jorge disappeared in May 1999 while driving a delivery route in
Bogota. ``These kidnappers are people without hearts or
consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are happy moments when families are reunited.
Recently, the radio station was buoyed by visits from four released
victims, who came to encourage families of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept me with a rope around my neck and my hands tied, all
day and all night,'' said Nidia Velazco, who was held for six
months. ``It was the FARC. They didn't treat me badly, but they
watched us and kept us tied up even when we went to the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian government estimates that, in 1999, 68 percent of
kidnapping victims were released after ransoms were paid, 26
percent were rescued and 6 percent were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Velazco was kept in a house in the mountains outside Bogota with
several other victims. Meeting with the wives of two kidnapped men
after her release, she gave them encouraging details, describing
their health, eating habits and long hair from months without
visiting a barber.
</P>
<P>
   The wives of the missing men listened intently to every detail.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, the psychologist, worries that the crime has become so
common that Colombians now simply accept it as a normal part of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks it's just the rich who are the victims, but
it's not,'' she said. ``They come from every walk of life. The
worst part is there is no one to answer for this. It leads to a
lack of trust, to a perception that there are enemies everywhere.
The social fabric is torn apart. How can you have a society when
people can't trust each other?''
</P>
<P>
   Deisy Castillo's life has been changed since her uncle was
nabbed. Once optimistic, a freshly minted law school graduate, now
she struggles to find hope. She has no job, nor does her husband,
also a lawyer. They get by doing legal work for friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Since the kidnapping, the tough times have become edged with
fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't let my children outside to play,'' she said. ``I'm
scared for them. We're scared to own anything because we fear
someone will come for us if they think we have things. If we could
leave Colombia, we would. There's no future here for my children.''

COMMITTEE REBUFFS EFFORTS TO PULL MORE TO THE LEFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Repeatedly brushing aside amendments from its
embattled liberal wing, the Democratic Party's platform committee
Saturday adopted a party blueprint that hews closely to Vice
President Al Gore's centrist views on trade, fiscal policy,
national defense, crime and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-page document approved Saturday was a fitting successor
to the platform created for Bill Clinton's first presidential
campaign in 1992, which broke sharply from the party's liberal
roots. Saturday, the 186-member committee, dominated by Gore
supporters, again and again knocked down efforts to tug the party
back toward the left.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals supporting universal health care, a moratorium on the
death penalty, punishments against corporations that pay low wages,
tougher rules for international trade, and better health care for
prisoners were withdrawn or overwhelmingly defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of a small band of liberals, the committee
approved planks putting the party firmly behind a limited missile
defense system, aggressive debt reduction, modest tax cuts and
expanding global trade through the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The liberals did not go down quietly. Talking to reporters
outside the committee room, members of a group calling itself the
Progressive Caucus to the Democratic National Convention complained
that their views had been ignored and that the Gore campaign had
pressured committee members to vote against their planks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about a big tent,'' said Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of
Cleveland. ``But this tent just got a bit smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hayden, a state senator from Los Angeles who is also a Gore
delegate, said the platform had failed to address the challenge of
Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate who strongly opposes the
World Trade Organization and who, polls show, has been drawing
voters away from Gore in California.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said the center-straddling platform would turn off the
party's liberal base, making it more difficult to find committed
campaign foot-soldiers. As a result, he warned, Gore would have to
rely on negative attacks against the Republican ticket of Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to lift the enthusiasm of tens of thousands of
people to make phone calls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Progressive Caucus did not have much support in the room
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No major environmental groups were present to raise objections
to the platform.
</P>
<P>
   An observer for the United Auto Workers, which objects to Gore's
trade policies and has not endorsed him, said the platform
committee had addressed the union's concerns in private
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And an official with the AFL-CIO, which has endorsed Gore, said
that despite its flaws, the platform was generally acceptable to
organized labor, the single most important constituency in the
Democratic coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've succeeded in moving the party from free trade toward
fair trade,'' said Gerald Shea, an adviser to John Sweeney, the
president of the labor federation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints from the liberals, party leaders
portrayed the platform debate as more open than the Republicans'
process. And they said that the fault lines within their party over
trade and national defense are not as deep as those dividing the
Republicans on abortion and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sections of this platform that I am not wild
about,'' said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, a co-chairman of the
platform committee. ``But the bottom line is, we know how much
different and how much better this is than the Republican
alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Al From, chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, a
centrist group, said, ``Don't forget, we followed a lot of the
policies the Progressive Caucus would like us to follow now in the
1970s and '80s, and we had the kind of stagnation that turned core
Democrats away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform goes to a full vote by the delegates on the second
night of the Democratic convention next month. No amendments will
be allowed from the floor, and it seems unlikely that liberals will
be able to muster enough support to force a floor vote on a
minority report.
</P>
<P>
   One of the liveliest debates Saturday was over a proposal to
strike language endorsing development of a limited national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals contended that the idea was unproven, costly and likely
to ignite a new arms race. But Gore's supporters argued that
remaining silent on missile defense would give the Republicans
ammunition to attack Democrats as soft on defense. Bush supports a
global missile defense system. The progressives' amendment was
tabled.
</P>
<P>
   On the contentious issue of trade, the platform says, ``It's
clear we live in a globalized world, and that there is no turning
back.'' The platform obliquely endorses a concept known as fast
track _ without using that phrase _ calling for broad presidential
powers to negotiate trade compacts without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   To appease labor unions and environmental groups, the platform
says workers rights, human rights and environmental protections
should be negotiated in all trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   On crime, the platform endorses ``tougher penalties _ including
the death penalty _ for those that dare to terrorize the
innocent.'' But it also calls for DNA testing and ``effective''
legal counsel for death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   A few members of the committee had proposed calling for a
moratorium on capital punishment. But they withdrew the amendment
for lack of support. Instead, the committee adopted the language:
``In all death row cases, we encourage thorough post-conviction
reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform adopts debt reduction _ Clinton's guiding economic
principle _ as the heart of Gore's economic policies. And it calls
for using the federal surplus to strengthen Medicare and Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   In its longest section, on education, the platform supports
using federal money to increase teachers' pay, reduce class sizes,
rebuild crumbling schools and help families pay for college
tuition. But it also calls for requiring teachers to pass periodic
reviews making it easier to close down failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The platform, like Gore's campaign agenda, firmly endorses a
woman's right to an abortion, strong gun regulations, a hate crimes
law, sweeping campaign finance reform, and an end to racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   On the environment, supporters of Gore proposed an amendment
endorsing several of the vice president's campaign pledges: to
restore the Everglades, restrict oil and gas drilling off the
coasts of California and Florida, and prohibit drilling or logging
in the wildest areas of the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members from Alaska and many of the Western states
objected to the language, saying it would hurt local economies. But
the measure passed by the narrowest vote of the day, 47-33.

METS HAVE TAKEN BIG STEP FORWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Bordick put on a Mets uniform for the first time Saturday,
then hit the first pitch he saw for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, you say? That's thousands of miles and two geographic
divisions away, you say? True, the bigger news, as it pertains to
the Dodgers and their playoff push, was Arizona's acquisition of
Curt Schilling. But the moment that deal went down, whatever the
Mets were trying to do, and subsequently did, was the business of
the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate focus is on the National League West, and the
Dodgers entered Saturday 2 games behind the Diamondbacks and in the
running for the division title. Yet, that baseball invention deemed
to stir more interest late in the season _ you know, the wild card
_ is as much a part of the playoff race as the Dodgers' pursuit of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Dodgers in third place in the division, but
they're in third place in the wild-card race, which the Mets lead.
San Francisco trails them by a half game and the Dodgers are 2
games back.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mets did Friday _ and it might be determined two months
from now _ could have an equal affect on them as Arizona's dealing
for Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   So while the Dodgers, with their limited prospects and their
unwillingness to part with any of the few high-caliber ones they
have, took the only possible path and brought back the
much-maligned Ismael Valdes, and the Diamondbacks grabbed one of
the top 10 pitchers in baseball, the Mets filled their glaring
voids.
</P>
<P>
   And they might have done it with a Bordick, a player who at this
point might be more valuable than the aging Barry Larkin, who nixed
a deal between Cincinnati and the Mets last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bordick) makes all the routine plays and sometimes the
spectacular play,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips said after
the deal. ``He can turn the double play. He really gives us the
stability that was lacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick was an enormous piece for the Mets to get, but they also
shored up a few of the other areas that were of great concern. They
added right-hander Rick White and right-handed power off the bench
in Bubba Trammell, both acquired from Tampa Bay hours after Bordick
was brought in from Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Mets made their move to make a charge at National
East leader Atlanta, which led the Mets by five games Saturday
morning. That's the focus, but the consolation prize of the
wild-card spot lands the Mets in the playoffs. And Phillips might
not be done.
</P>
<P>
   He's talking to Colorado about Pedro Astacio, Florida about
closer Antonio Alfonseca and Texas about John Wetteland. More
bullpen depth or another starter, all of which puts the Mets in
better position to pull closer to the Braves and pull further away
from the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Diamondbacks made themselves markedly better with
the Schilling deal, though which team it works out better for is
years from being determined because of the prospects they sent to
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are much better with Bordick's defense through the
middle, his veteran approach and his ability to revitalize the
clubhouse by going from a team 12 games out of a playoff spot to
the wild-card leader.
</P>
<P>
   But how much better are the Dodgers by reacquiring Valdes?
</P>
<P>
   It could be an enormous improvement, but it's an unknown because
Valdes has not pitched much this season, and when he has pitched he
hasn't been very good. Valdes is 2-4 with a 5.37 ERA, and while
that's better than the 1-6, 5.75 ERA rookie Eric Gagne had with the
Dodgers, his announced return didn't make many players jump for
joy.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took a huge step toward winning the division, but
equally important is what transpired on the other coast.
</P>
<P>
   __ Concession from Schilling: The Arizona Diamondbacks gave up
four players, each of whom have high, yet-to-be-reached ceilings to
get Curt Schilling from the Philadelphia Phillies. But the
deal-maker, as far as the Diamondbacks were concerned, was
Schilling's willingness to make a concession.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, owed $6.5 million next season, had a right to demand
a trade after the season since he has a multiyear contract. But
Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo spoke with
Schilling's agent, Rick Thurman, and was told the right-hander
wouldn't ask for a trade after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two waivers from him,'' Colangelo said. ``He waived his
demand for a contract extension and waived his right to be traded
after this season.''
</P>
<P>
   This point immediately makes the Diamondbacks the team to beat
in 2001. They'll have lefty Randy Johnson and Schilling as the No.
1 and No. 2 starters for the next 14 months. One of the two has led
the majors in strikeouts each season since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he is signed for next year is very important in
this deal,'' Arizona general manager Joe Garagiola Jr. said. ``This
is not a stretch-drive, rent-a-player.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Brave Jordan: Atlanta's Brian Jordan is trying to fight
through the pain and finish the season, but his shoulders are in
such bad shape that he'll have surgery on both of them after the
season. Jordan has a tear in his right rotator cuff and he's
experiencing discomfort in his left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping cortisone shots in each shoulder will relieve some
of the pain and there's no question it is affecting him at the
plate. Jordan is hitting .192 with no homers and six RBI this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely getting both repaired this offseason,'' Jordan
said. ``I can't try to make it through another year like this. Any
sane person would probably go on the DL and try and heal up.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slammin' Sammy: Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa is back to hitting
homers, smacking eight since the all-star break and pulling within
three of Gary Sheffield's league-leading 34. But the ball isn't the
only thing Sosa's slamming around.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs general manager Ed Lynch knew he was in trouble when team
president Andy MacPhail took over the Sosa contract negotiations.
Lynch was fired a month later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more opportunity now to have a winning team because
Andy MacPhail knows what it takes,'' Sosa said. ``I don't want to
criticize Ed Lynch, because he was a great person and made some
beautiful moves, but I think Andy will make the right decisions for
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, like a contract extension?
</P>
<P>
   __ Against the book: San Diego manager Bruce Bochy took his
baseball book of conventional wisdom and threw it out at San
Francisco. With two on and none out, Bochy had Kevin Nicholson
sacrifice to set the table for . . . pitcher Woody Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it had merit. Williams was hitting .348 and had three
hits in his last start. Williams drilled a pitch to the left-field
wall and settled for a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't say this too often, but Woody's in a zone at the
plate. He looks so good up there,'' Bochy said. ``It's obvious by
the way he's taking pitches. He's seeing the ball so well.''

NOTEBOOK: EX-GM ANALYZES ANAHEIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody likes to play GM this time of year, even former GMs
like Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi calls this time of year ``a blast'' with all the activity
going on. Even if there is no trade made by a team, there is plenty
of talk, as Bavasi knows all too well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 his Angels were in a race with the Rangers, who obtained
shortstop Royce Clayton, pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and third baseman
Todd Zeile in deals. The Angels got nothing and lost the division.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Indians wanted pitcher Chuck Finley, but Bavasi
wanted one more prospect than the Indians were willing to part
with, and again no trade was made. Finley signed with the Indians
during the offseason and the Angels got nothing.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it would be easy to criticize Bavasi for not
making a deal in those cases. But, as Bavasi says, ``You don't want
to make a deal just to make a deal. You want to make a good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there isn't one available, you just have to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're trying to do what's best for the organization in both
the short term and the long term,'' he said. ``It's not easy to do.
You can set up the organization now and later, or you can cripple
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Just because Bavasi is not the Angels GM anymore doesn't mean he
doesn't have ideas on what they should do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Angels GM) Bill (Stoneman) is in a position where he has to
make a decision,'' Bavasi said. ``Does he think they can win the
division or win the wild card? I think Seattle will win the
division. Oakland has the wild card right now, but I think Anaheim
is better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Anaheim gets healthy and stays healthy, I like their
chances. They have a better lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' primary need at this point seems to be a productive
designated hitter, but Bavasi has other ideas. He said he likes the
group of young pitchers the Angels have, and he should. He drafted
and developed them. But to depend on so many of them during a
pennant race, he says, is another matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's tough is to count on a whole group of kids to
contend,'' Bavasi said. ``I think they need another arm. Not that
they're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Missed it by that much: Last week, Indians shortstop Omar
Vizquel was four innings away from setting the American League
record for consecutive errorless games by a shortstop. Then the
Twins' Matt Lawton hit a tricky hopper to Vizquel, who bobbled it
for an error, his first of the season and first since last Sept.
25.
</P>
<P>
   His errorless streak ended at 95 games, tying Cal Ripken's AL
mark. The major-league record is 101 games by the Mets' Rey
Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vizquel: ``Ever since I entered pro ball, it's been my
dream to play a whole season without an error.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gotta be the shoes: All teams have dress codes on flights,
but the Devil Rays' Jose Canseco recently found it difficult to
find a pair of dress shoes that didn't hurt his inflamed left heel.
But he improvised, wearing a pair of comfortable golf shoes on the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes, I'm willing to do it,'' Canseco said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Uniform change: When Hal Morris was traded from the Reds to
the Tigers a couple of weeks ago, the Reds were playing the Tigers
at Comerica Park.
</P>
<P>
   The game had already started and Morris was in his Reds uniform
when the trade was made. So he simply switched clubhouses, changed
uniforms and finished the game in the Tigers clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quest for .400: Nomar Garciaparra was hitting .398 through
Friday, but he says he doesn't concern himself with becoming the
first since Ted Williams in 1941 to hit .400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Numbers, I never look at them,'' he said. ``I don't like them.
I don't care about them.''

BUSH DYNASTY HOPING FOR SPOT ON EXCLUSIVE PRESIDENTIAL ROSTER 

</HEADLINE>

By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1988, when then-Vice President George Bush was running for
president, the news media often mentioned that no sitting vice
president had won the higher office since Martin Van Buren in 1836.
But Bush did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard much about the Van Buren factor in this
election,'' Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the former president's
eldest son, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, it's the Adamses,'' said Bush, referring to John
and John Quincy Adams, the only father and son to have served as
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is expected to receive the Republican presidential
nomination Thursday in Philadelphia, would like to add his and his
father's name to that limited roster of presidential dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Bush must defeat Democratic candidate Al Gore in
what will be the United States' first head-to-head presidential
clash between political dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to have a presidential election between a Gore and
a Bush, and that's the first time you've had dynasts running
against each other, two candidates for president whose fathers have
held high political office,'' said Stephen Hess of the Brookings
Institute and author of ``America's Political Dynasties.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Bush's father president, his grandfather, Prescott
Bush, was a U.S. senator. And Gore's father, Albert Gore Sr., was a
prominent member of the U.S. Senate. The senior Gore died in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's brother, Jeb, is governor of Florida. Jeb's son, George
Prescott Bush, 25, who is campaigning nationally for his uncle, has
been named one of the nation's most eligible bachelors and is
frequently mentioned as the next generation's heir to the Bush
political mantle.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, is involved
in her father's campaign and is talked about as the next generation
of political Gores.
</P>
<P>
   And one of Gore's potential running mates is Indiana Democrat
Evan Bayh, who now holds the U.S. Senate seat that his father,
Birch Bayh, held for three terms. Another possible Gore running
mate is Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a rising star
in the Kennedy clan.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes and the Gores are relatively new political dynasties
in the United States, Hess said, and even the glamorous Kennedys
are really only in the second generation of holding elective
political office. Joseph Kennedy, father of former President John
F. Kennedy, was an appointed ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a glamour there. There's also a lot of Kennedys,''
Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Political dynasties are numerous in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that when he wrote his book 30 years ago, 17 percent
of the members of Congress had direct ancestors who also had served
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia of the United States Congress says 16 family
dynasties have produced eight presidents and 86 members of
Congress.

TEXAS FAMILY-VALUES CROWD UPSET ABOUT GOP'S GAY SPEAKER 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ As they tend to do elsewhere, Republicans and
gays are making deeply conflicted bedfellows here in the City of
Brotherly Love on the eve of the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening would almost be an amusing burlesque, except
that it's the latest chapter in a long-running serial.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, the only openly gay Republican in Congress
will briefly address the delegates on the issue of free trade. This
innocuous bit of scheduling is being received in some aggrieved
quarters as an affront to family values.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly lathered up on the matter is the Texas delegation,
the members of which include some of the most socially conservative
Republican activists in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas GOP platform reserves some of its harshest criticism
for what it terms ``homosexual behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, the Arizona congressman in question, gets
three minutes on the podium during the evening event themed
``Strength and security with a purpose: Safe in our homes and in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, some Republicans don't feel safe in their homes with
Kolbe talking about NAFTA in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson Republican, elected to the House in 1984, served in
Vietnam with the U.S. Naval Reserve and was awarded the Medal of
Valor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kolbe is a big supporter of NAFTA _ another issue on
which the state party platform takes a dim view _ it's clear the
only objection to his history-making role in the convention is that
he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the reaction from within the party is no big surprise.
It was just two years ago that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss, equated homosexuals with kleptomaniacs and sex addicts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, due in for the coronation on
Wednesday, also has struggled with the gay issue. Politically, Bush
intractably opposes gay marriage and tougher hate crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, the compassionate conservative tries to have
it both ways: He'll meet with gay Republicans, but won't risk
alienating anti-gay Republicans by actually supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   But with the national convention at hand, a different spirit
prevails. What will the delegates say when they find out that Dick
Cheney has a lesbian daughter?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this isn't news to Bush _ he's known the Cheney
family for years, including 31-year-old daughter, Mary. The Kolbe
appearance also is on the schedule with the approval and blessing
of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that Kolbe, the only openly gay Republican in
Congress, was not actually the first. That distinction goes to
Steve Gunderson, the former congressman from Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson did not seek re-election in 1996 after then-House
Speaker Newt Gingrich told him that conservatives in Congress would
never support him to chair a committee he was in line for.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Gingrich's lesbian half-sister, Candace
Gingrich, as spokeswoman for the National Human Rights Campaign,
was grand marshal of Houston's Gay Pride Parade. She urged
attendees to be ``open and proud.''
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Republican National Convention, 18 of the more
than 4,000 delegates and alternates are themselves open and proud,
representing the largest contingent of openly gay conventioneers
(none from Texas) in the party's history.
</P>
<P>
   That's one statistic you won't see touted in the Republican
Party literature.

GOP DUO HAVE `DIFFERENT CAMPAIGNING' STYLES, BUSH   SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ After less than a week in the spotlight with
his running mate, George W. Bush Saturday conceded that Dick Cheney
is not yet up to full speed on the campaign trail, and said it was
clear the two have ``a different campaigning style.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's warming up,'' Bush said during a flight from Missouri to
Kentucky. ``This fellow has been in the private sector for a while,
and hasn't been on the campaign trail.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the Texas governor added, ``he's an accomplished
campaigner. He got elected statewide in the state of Wyoming four
or five times, I think six times, if I'm not mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   The characterization of Cheney _ who was highly articulate in
his four public appearances last week but failed to inspire the
same enthusiasm as Bush _ came amid renewed criticism by Democrats
that the GOP vice presidential candidate had unsavory ties to the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dug out a remark Cheney made in 1999 applauding the
OPEC decision to slash oil production, which contributed to this
year's higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struck by the extent OPEC seems to have gotten its
act together. . . . A certain amount of near-term optimism is
justified,'' Cheney said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A Gore spokesman said the statement by Cheney _ who until Aug.
16 will be the chief executive officer of Halliburton Co., a giant
oil-services company _ was ``further evidence that a Bush-Cheney
ticket would turn the Oval Office into the oil office.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Bush campaign said that oil prices were low at
the time and that Cheney was promoting Halliburton to other
businessmen. The campaign found a comment by Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson, a Gore ally, who said at the same time, ``We feel that
lower oil prices are good for consumers, but we recognize they can
have a negative impact domestically on some of our friends like
Venezuela and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ongoing Democratic attacks do not seem to have
stuck. Several polls in the past few days have shown Bush and
Cheney pulling further ahead of Gore, who plans to name his running
mate on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a day of obstacles _ including pouring rain and the
breakdown of a Bush press plane carrying dozens of reporters _ the
Texas governor appeared more invigorated at each stop. Greeting
enthusiastic crowds in Owensboro, Ky., Louisville, and Cincinnati,
Bush basked in his popularity _ and in waves of confetti the
campaign introduced last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has scheduled campaign stops in Ohio, West Virginia, and
Pennsylvania before arriving Wednesday in Philadelphia for the
Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush family is planning to play a significant role at the
convention. In a conversation with reporters Saturday morning, Bush
spoke in particular about his father, denying the conventional
wisdom that the former president serves as a career counselor or is
trying to reestablish the Bush dynasty through his eldest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm mindful of the Adams family factor,'' Bush said, referring
to John Adams and John Quincy Adams, the only father-son duo ever
to win the presidency. ``It wasn't all that long that he'' _ the
elder Bush _ ``himself was the president of the United States,
which will make the story unique and different.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush continued: ``He is a dad first and foremost. . . . This man
is not a political consultant. And the advice I get from him is the
advice a dad would give a son. It is comforting. And so I will
approach the moment with a lot of feeling and a lot of emotion,
recognizing that there's going to be a lot of people watching, with
my family, which means more to me than anything, will be there,
including my wife and children, by the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his optimism, Bush declined to dwell on a battery of new
polls, including a Time magazine poll that showed Bush widening his
lead over Al Gore to 16 percentage points and a Newsweek poll that
shows him leading Gore 47 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to his lopsided defeat in the New Hampshire primary,
where he had predicted victory, Bush Saturday said he was ``not
going to get overconfident.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what can happen,'' Bush said. ``I've seen polls
crumble. I have seen defeat firsthand.''
</P>
<P>
   He also described the difference between his campaigning style
and that of Cheney, a former defense secretary. Cheney's style,
Bush said, is ``a little more laid-back than mine.'' Asked to
describe his own style, Bush replied: ``Not laid-back.''

HISPANIC VOTERS MAY BE INTRIGUED BY BUSH'S COURTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LORI RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ For the last 14 months, Houston businessman Raul
Romero has gamely crisscrossed the country on behalf of his home
state's hijo favorito, or favorite son, Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Often at Bush's side and charged with the job of Hispanic
outreach, Romero has tapped into a lifetime of high-powered
contacts, linking fellow Latinos with his close personal friend,
who will claim the Republican presidential nomination this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Romero's hometown, where Hispanics in the new census may
approach 40 percent of the population, he has told every minority
who would listen that Bush is a uniter, not a divider. In
California, where the GOP-driven, anti-immigrant initiatives of the
1990s pushed Latinos to the Democratic camp in droves, Romero has
said the same has never happened in Bush's Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And in this city whose name is Greek for ``brotherly love,''
Romero for weeks has meticulously planned an elaborate,
Latino-themed event aimed at the hearts and souls of an electorate
historically Democratic but now seen as increasingly up-for-grabs:
The nation's 7 million Hispanic registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be Bush's first public appearance when he arrives
in Philadelphia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a magnificent celebration that sends forth
a very compelling message,'' Romero says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make a statement, and that is that the governor is
a new kind of Republican who believes in inclusion, not exclusion;
in uniting, not dividing,'' he says. ``What we're trying to say is
give this guy a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The finishing touches were put this weekend on the gala at the
Philadelphia Museum of Art based on a Bush campaign mantra that
promises a new day, ``Es Un Nuevo Dia.''
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Estefan and the Miami Sound Machine are headlining the
Latino star power. Hispanic heavyweights in attendance range from
Houston City Controller Sylvia Garcia to Los Angeles chairman of
the Latin Business Association, Hector Barreto. Latino youngsters
will talk about reaching their American Dreams, GOP-style.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Republican National Committee continues to pump
an expected $10 million into wooing the nation's fastest-growing
constituency, the 4,000-plus delegates descending this week are
still overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of anti-immigrant, anti-affirmative action
sentiment from some GOP candidates, President Clinton raked in 72
percent of the Latino vote in 1996, a jump from the 61 percent he
managed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To the faithful, though, Bush is tailor-made to heal his party's
racial breaches. He speaks serviceable Spanish, has a Mexico-born
sister-in-law, counts Latinos and blacks among his closest friends
and prides himself on winning an unprecedented 40 percent of the
Texas Hispanic vote in 1998. Since the Iowa primary, when he rolled
out a Spanish-language TV ad promising ``Un Nuevo Dia,'' Bush has
also doggedly gone where few white Republicans have dared.
</P>
<P>
   He ventured among conferees in Baltimore for the annual meeting
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Dole shunned that gathering in 1996, and has since openly regretted
the snub.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also assiduously courted black members of the Congress of
Racial Equality, and Latinos at the National Council of La Raza
meeting in San Diego and at the League of United Latin American
Citizens gathering in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I have what I believe in and who I will eventually
vote for,'' LULAC national president Rick Dovalina, a Houston
attorney, says. ``But I also know that, as an organization, it's
very important for us to keep our options open and support the
Latino agenda, whichever candidate and party best addresses it.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio media guru Lionel Sosa, who has produced
Latino-targeted ads for every Republican ticket but Dole's since
1980, believes minorities and especially Hispanics are beginning to
rethink their traditional Democratic loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're using a message of inclusion, of opportunity, of shared
conservative values, and we're addressing issues important to
Latinos: education, health care, Social Security,'' Sosa says.
``Most importantly, we're showing the governor as the man that he
is _ a different kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's sway has been enough to color this convention at a
minimum as politically correct. A platform draft released Thursday
drops previous language that would make English the official
language. The draft excludes 1996 provisions recommending the
denial of social services to illegal immigrants and stating that
even legal immigrants should not rely on taxpayer help.
</P>

   But wherever Bush has met a large minority gathering this
election season, Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate,
has almost always appeared before or after him. So has a
self-appointed ``truth squad'' of minority Democratic officeholders
from Texas, including Houston state Sen. Mario Gallegos and state
Rep. Garnet Coleman, who have pounded the Bush record.

   ABOARD THE STRAIGHT TALK L EXPRESS _ He may have fired up his L
trademark bus once again yesterday, but John S. McCain wants to
make this very clear: He's not trying to steal anybody's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't intend this bus trip to be an extravaganza,'' a
jovial McCain said as he sat in his usual red swivel seat in the
back of his white bus, drinking soda after soda. On board were many
of the staff members who had run the Arizona senator's campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination, L and some of the reporters
who had covered his many town hall meetings in New Hamp- shire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we were hoping was it would just be a good time, and that
it would be report- ed as such,'' McCain said. ``We thought L we'd
have a trip where just the old timers came with us, but it just
grew and grew and grew.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   McCain traveled from Arlington, Va., to the Republican National
Convention in L Philadelphia with several busloads of re- porters
in tow. The convoy was bigger and a good deal more festive than it
had been for most of McCain's unsuccessful primary campaign, and
McCain was happy to have the company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He appeared at a town hall meeting L yesterday afternoon in Blue
Bell, Pa., with state senator Stewart Greenleaf, a candi- date for
the US House. The crowd of sever- al hundred gave McCain a loud
ovation, and laughed heartily at his well-worn one-lin- ers, like
the one about Arizona being so dry the trees chase the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that his trip, and his busy sched-  &UR; -------------------- &LR; 
ule in Philadel- phia, had an-L noyed some L aides of the L
soon-to-be L GOP presiden- tial nominee, L George W. L Bush, McCain
L was careful to L give the Texas governor his L due at every L
possible turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always L said I'd sup-L port the nomi- nee of the par- ty,''
McCain L said, ``Gover-L nor Bush is L running the L kind of cam-L
paign I would L have run if I L were the nomi- nee.''
</P>
<P>
   He praised Bush for appealing to a wider variety of voters now
than during the primaries, and said the governor was running a far
more ``centrist'' campaign, concentrating on is- sues like
education and military reform.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won seven primaries, including New Hampshire, Michigan,
and Massachu- setts. The battle in South Carolina, which the
senator lost, was especially vicious, and McCain was clearly angry
during and after it because of what he called the Bush cam- paign's
negative tactics. But the Bush of South Carolina had not been the
true Bush, McCain said yesterday, calling the tactics there ``the
exception to the rule of the cam-  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  paign he's
L run.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, McCain said, L he would do L himself no L good by
dwell- ing on his in-L juries now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I was unhappy about some of L the things that
happened dur- ing the cam-L paign,'' L McCain said. L ``I don't
know L of a campaign L that the loser L isn't unhappy L with some L
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the L point is, you L can't be a sore loser. Ameri-L cans
do not ad- mire or appreciate a sore loser, so you just move
forward and try to make the very best of it. I think I'm at step
eight of the 12- step presidential recovery program.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He described his relationship with L Bush these days as
``cordial.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The senator will deliver a prime-time address in support of the
Texas governor on Tuesday night, and has a busy schedule of
appearances throughout the convention, including a speech at the
``shadow conven- tion,'' organized by commentator Arianna
Huffington. McCain said that speech, too, would be an attempt not
to compete with  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  Bush, but to bolster him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain will host a reception for his del- egates today to thank
them for their work, and to urge them to put aside their anger and
throw themselves behind Bush. L McCain will campaign with the
governor out West for three days after the conven- tion, and have
Bush and his wife, Laura, visit his ranch near Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain stepped gingerly yesterday L into the subject of his own
future ambitions. He said he fully expected Bush to win in
November, and probably would be elected to a second term. His
strongest supporters are counting on the senator's running in 2004
if Bush loses to Gore. And this week's high-profile appearances may
be a kind of testing of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried to avoid the subject yes- terday, but when pushed
to talk about what he might do if Bush lost, McCain said he wasn't
sure whether another run at the L presidency was even possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you have to figure is, could we catch that lightning
in a bottle again?'' he said. ``Could the circumstances that pre-
vailed last time happen again? The kind of unconventional campaign
we ran, could L that work?''
</P>
<P>
   He was nostalgic about his campaign. ``It was the greatest
experience of my life,'' McCain said. ``I can't tell you how
grateful I am for having had this experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The old fire returned, however, when a reporter asked McCain if
he had gotten Bush's permission for his pre-convention odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time I checked,'' he bristled, ``I'm a US senator elected
by the people of Ari- zona.''

`CITY IS JUMPING' AS LAVISH GOP BASHES KEEP REVELERS ROCKIN'

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Forget the somnolent speeches and studied
applause of First Union Center where the Republican National
Convention is being held this week. The real GOP action _ and fun _
takes place far from the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Museums, Navy yards, restaurants, hotel ballrooms, historic
homes, a rail terminal and golf courses are being commandeered for
the Grand Old Party. Even the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of
Art, scene of a memorable moment in the movie ``Rocky,'' are booked
for a Republican gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia 2000, the convention host committee, rolls out the
red carpet Sunday night with an al fresco dessert party for the
state delegations, a lighted boat parade on the Delaware River and
a fireworks extravaganza above the city skyline. Monday morning, an
abbreviated Mummer's parade and a street-side hoagie party will
keep visitors entertained and well fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is jumping,'' said Jeff Guaracino, Philadelphia 2000
volunteer. ``While the entire city may not be able to be on the
convention floor, the entire city is a part of this thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, takes over the Electric
Factory club for a late-night, invitation-only party starring Blues
Traveler.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest tickets is a Mardi Gras-themed bash in the
Navy Yard, for which supporters of Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., are
flying in Tauzin's cousin, Cajun chef Jimmy Gravois, from
Louisiana. The event is estimated to cost $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   American Bandstand's Dick Clark returns to Philadelphia to the
old WFIL studios, where the original Bandstand was broadcast, for a
party honoring Rep. Michael Oxley of Ohio. Chubby Checker and
Frankie Avalon will join Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The one event guaranteed to rock Republican ranks is the George
Magazine/Creative Coalition fund-raiser benefiting the Michael J.
Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and the Christopher Reeve
Paralysis Foundation. Fox will attend, and Heather Locklear also is
on the affirmative RSVP list.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas and New York delegations party together later in the
week at a club called Zanzibar Blue. Chase Bank picks up the tab.
Fans of Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-San Antonio, gather one evening for
festivities at the Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   The city's museums and historic buildings present a wealth of
unique party venues. The roof deck of the renowned Franklin
Institute Science Museum _ offering tree-level views of the city's
skyline and monuments _ is booked every night of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The stairs and plaza in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art
(the ``Rocky steps'' locale) are the setting Wednesday morning for
``Es Un Nuevo Dia,'' (It's A New Day), a Hispanic-themed event
welcoming Gov. George W. Bush to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 ticketed guests are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's Raul Romero, Bush's national adviser for Hispanic
outreach, has spent the last three weeks organizing the event
starring salsa queen Celia Cruz, Jon Secada, Grammy winner Carols
Ponce and Mariachi Campanas de America from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Major contributors to the Republican Party have their own social
schedules to maintain. The Eagles ($25,000 donors), Team 100
($100,000 donors) and Regents ($250,000) donors have the
opportunity to rub elbows with elected officials, policy makers and
former presidents at a host of off-the-convention-floor activities.
</P>
<P>
   After his acceptance speech, George W. Bush and 5,000 invited
guests will reconvene at the Spectrum Stadium for a celebration
bash and concert by country stars Brooks &AMP; Dunn.

GIMELSTOB'S TEMPER DOESN'T BRING WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GERRY GITTELSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Some professional tennis players play better
after losing their cool.
</P>
<P>
   Not Justin Gimelstob. After taking the first set against Michael
Chang in Saturday's Mercedes-Benz Cup semifinal, Gimelstob began
acting out midway through the second set, and he was never the
same, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Up 3-2 in the second set, Gimelstob became bothered when a
cellular phone in the stands rang during his serve. He stopped and
loudly screamed, ``Shut off your phone!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughed and cheered, but it was the beginning of the
end for Gimelstob, who never fully regained his concentration.
After Chang won the next two games, Gimelstob tossed his racket _
this time the crowd booed _ and the umpire issued a warning for
racket abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob punctuated losing the set by tearing off his shirt _ a
la Hulk Hogan entering a wrestling ring.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the match Gimelstob, a UCLA graduate making his
homecoming, had a lot less fan support.
</P>
<P>
   Did Gimelstob blow it?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's difficult to say,'' Chang said. ``Part of the way
Justin is is to be intense and show his frustration. It's just a
part of his personality. I know John McEnroe always played better
when he got fired up. I don't know if Justin does or he doesn't.
Everyone handles it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Clawing ahead: Jan-Michael Gambill raises baby tigers at the
Cat Tails park near his home in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking stock: Gimelstob, who recently surpassed $1 million in
career prize money, said he enjoys following the stock market _ his
best friend is a stockbroker _ but only as a ``hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bringin' the heat: Late in the second set of the
Chang-Gimelstob match, play was halted when a fan fell ill and was
carried off by attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Identified as Phyllis Adler, she was taken to UCLA's emergency
room for dehydration and heat exhaustion, according tournament
officials.
</P>
<P>
   She was reported in good condition shortly after the match.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast start: No one was hotter than Arnaud Clement this week.
He hadn't lost a set through the first three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Celebrity sighting: Dustin Hoffman, who participated in a
charity match here Monday, sat in the first row for Chang's
victory.

LABOR UNIONS WELCOME CASH OF CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia may seem an odd venue for a Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   The City of Brotherly Love is a union town. Organized labor's
presence, while smaller than in previous decades, is still evident
here, from the docks on the riverfront to the checkout lines at the
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   And Philadelphia's union members, traditionally stalwarts of the
Democratic Party, are a key reason this city hasn't elected a
Republican mayor since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The city's labor unions, however, are largely embracing the
Republican convention. The GOP faithful may not bring a governing
philosophy the union members can espouse, but conventioneers do
carry cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad they're here,'' said Pat Coughlan, international
vice president for the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees,
Local 274. ``They're coming into our town. They're creating work.
They're spending money and creating jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two unions, representing more than 14,000 local government
workers _ from librarians to garbage collectors _ had threatened to
strike during the convention. Union leaders had even sought
volunteers willing to be arrested outside the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   But the two locals, both affiliated with the American Federation
of State, County and Municipal Employees, reached tentative
agreements with the city earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Some union members plan to participate in a mass rally scheduled
for Sunday in Philadelphia's Center City. But a number of unions,
including the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees, as well as
the Building Trades, have promised not to strike or picket during
the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's unions claim 250,000 members, or about 10 percent
of the civilian labor force in the greater metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, nearly one of every three jobs in Philadelphia
was a union position, noted Walter Licht, a professor of history at
the University of Pennsylvania. But as the city's manufacturing
jobs migrated elsewhere, Philadelphia's union membership dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, the city's labor unions caused real headaches
for Philadelphia convention planners, with six different unions
squabbling over jurisdictional issues at the Pennsylvania
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   But the local unions joined the citywide effort to land a
convention this summer, and the Republicans signed on.
</P>
<P>
   By holding their convention here, in a city that is not only
pro-union but nearly half African-American, Republicans are hoping
they can portray their party as more inclusive. ``It gives us
chance to show that our party can be competitive in urban areas,''
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   As they finished converting the city's First Union Arena into a
convention hall, hundreds of laborers wore T-shirts identifying
themselves as ``Republican for a Week.'' Later this week, they are
planning a rally at which the shirts will be tossed into a bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Union leader Coughlan noted that while labor leaders want the
GOP's business, they also want their members ``to see them for what
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our answer is going to be Al Gore,'' he said.

MONTANA DISCOVERS MEANING OF HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ It was late Friday night when it finally hit Joe
Montana. He had been resisting _ fighting _ this concept of being a
Hall of Famer. He had always viewed it so differently than he did
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was looking at it in the proper perspective,''
said Montana, unquestionably the crowd favorite of the five
enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday. ``I thought
the Hall of Fame was an ending. I mentioned to a couple of people
that in some ways _ and I'm 44 years old _ in some ways I feel like
I'm in my grave and in my coffin alive and they're throwing dirt on
me. I can feel it and I'm trying to get out. It wasn't until this
weekend, these past three days _ with these gentlemen behind me and
spending the time with them that I really got the true meaning of
what this is all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life we spent going from Pop Warner to a new team to
junior high to high school and to Notre Dame, to San Francisco and
Kansas City. And in the middle of the night last night I woke up _
and I had a whole other speech prepared _ I told my wife, Jennifer,
`I got the meaning and I have to write it down and I don't want to
forget it.' This isn't an ending. It's a beginning. A beginning of
the rest of my life with a new team. Look at these guys _ what a
team it is,'' said Montana.
</P>
<P>
   There were friends from the western Pennsylvania area, including
high school coach Paul Zolak (father of former Patriot quarterback
Scott), as well as former 49ers owner Edward DeBartolo Jr., and
former coach Bill Walsh, a Hall of Famer and one of the 111 living
members. The other inductees are Ronnie Lott and Dave Wilcox of the
49ers, Howie Long of the Oakland Raiders, and Pittsburgh Steelers
owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Montana said he achieved his first dream of playing for Ara
Parseghian at Notre Dame and thanked him for recruiting him along
with six other quarterbacks. He thanked Dan Devine for giving him
his chance with the Irish, to Walsh for drafting him in the third
round and for teaching and demanding ``perfection. If he didn't get
that, he'd settle for greatness. He could handle that,'' Montana
said.
</P>
<P>
   He was most emotional in his feelings for DeBartolo, the
embattled former owner who pleaded guilty to failure to report a
felony in a Louisiana riverboat casino gambling scheme that
ultimately led commissioner Paul Tagliabue to suspend him and fine
him $1 million. DeBartolo's sister, Denise, now owns the 49ers and
DeBartolo has moved to Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took care of our teammates and they know what we're talking
about on and off the field. He was always there,'' Montana said.
</P>
<P>
   He felt similarly about Lott, whom DeBartolo called the ``heart
and soul'' of the great 49er teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Ronnie Lott, who taught me on and off the football field
what a true man is supposed to be. Ronnie spoke and Ronnie
delivered. You've heard walk the walk and talk the talk? That's
Ronnie. He's a great example for me to continue. I had a few
injuries to my career and he was always there to pick me up. When a
friend is in need he was always there. It doesn't matter when,
where, how far. His wife would agree with me, he's rarely home
because he's out fulfulling promises to these people. He always has
his hand out _ not to take but to give. To me, that's more special
than anything,'' Montana said.
</P>
<P>
   Montana, who led the 49ers to four Super Bowl titles and won
three MVP awards, thanked his parents, Joseph and Theresa Montana,
for teaching him ``never to quit'' and for bringing him all over
Pennsylvania to play basketball, football, and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke about each of the inductees, saying about Long, ``He
chased my skinny butt all over the place for years and he often
asked me to slow down.'' Montana, who grew up a Steelers fan, noted
Rooney's great Steeler teams. Though Wilcox played before him (his
career ended after the '74 season), Montana was taken by the film
clips of Wilcox's ferocious play and quipped, ``Even your son
called you a cheap-shot artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana, called the ``greatest quarterback of all time'' by
DeBartolo in his introduction, acknowledged his four children and
his wife, whom he called his ``best friend.'' Montana added, ``It's
not the easiest thing to be married to an athlete. We might seem
calm on the outside but on the inside we're a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   No way. Not Joe Cool.

TRIALS LEAVE ROOM FOR ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In most countries, the two best men in the world would be
automatic choices for the Olympic team. Not in America. Now that
both Michael Johnson and Maurice Greene will be watching the 200
from the stands in Sydney, the old debate has been rekindled.
Should teams be selected in one-shot trials? By a committee? By a
combination of the two?
</P>
<P>
   The United States uses all three models. Track and field and
swimming have always been one-shot. Basketball and baseball rely on
committees. Gymnastics and cycling use the combination. Most often,
the combination works best because it's fairest to everybody. The
best athlete won't be left home just because he or she wakes up
sick on the wrong day or gets tripped in a preliminary. And
everyone else has a chance to make the team at trials without
worrying about backroom politics.
</P>
<P>
   Purists say that one-shot is best because it mimics the Olympics
_ if Dan Jansen falls down at the Games or Sergei Bubka no-heights,
too bad. But if US sports federations are going to be funded based
on the medals they win, they're going to make sure their best
people make the team. That's why USA Gymnastics already guaranteed
Blaine Wilson a spot and why none of his rivals are griping.
Everyone knows he's The Man, and without him, the Americans don't
have a chance at a team medal.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC leaves the decision up to each federation, as long as
the process is open and fair, and allows athletes to appeal to an
independent arbitrator. That's what sets the United States apart
from Kenya, which dumped its whole Olympic men's marathon team last
week for ``complacency.'' Elijah Lagat and Moses Tanui had earned
their places by finishing 1-3 in the 2000 Boston Marathon and
Japhet Kosgei had won Tokyo. Named instead were Eric Wainaina,
Kenneth Cheruiyot and Ondoro Osoro (who was shot by carjackers last
week). Lagat and Tanui claimed they were sacrificed ``at the altar
of personal vendetta and cheap propaganda.'' Lagat has been named
to replace Osoro and odds are Tanui and Kosgei will also end up
going since Kip Keino, the two-time medalist who heads the national
Olympic Committee, says he won't take the second string to Sydney.

old-boys club? There wasn't a single woman among the 48 new
candidates proposed last week. Among the 14 chosen to be
rubber-stamped at the September meeting is outgoing USOC president
William Hybl. In order to stay a member, though, Hybl will have to
have some senior USOC position after his term ends. His addition
will bring the number of Americans on what will be a 127-member
body to four (Anita DeFrantz, James Easton, and former volleyball
player Bob Ctvrtlik) . . . No royal lodgings and no limo for IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch in Sydney. ``We will be in a
hotel, a normal hotel,'' he says. And for wheels, he'll use a van .
. . Stan Smith, named US Olympic men's tennis captain Thursday, has
until Tuesday to (a) persuade Pete Sampras to play, which is
unlikely, and (b) name a doubles team. If Sampras declines, as
expected, Smith will tap Jan-Michael Gambill to go with Andre
Agassi, Michael Chang, and Todd Martin. The doubles team likely
will be fourth-ranked Alex O'Brien and Jared Palmer. Meanwhile,
women's coach Billie Jean King made it easy on herself by naming
Serena Williams to play doubles with sister Venus. Had Serena not
been chosen, Venus had hinted she might stay home, too. And the
sisters made it easy on King by winning Wimbledon. Odd woman out,
then, is Lisa Raymond, the top-ranked doubles player.

   With the selection deadline two weeks off, the US Olympic rowing
team is nearly set. Since would-be challengers to the women's eight
and men's lightweight four have withdrawn, there'll be no trials
for those events. And since last year's women's quad of Kelly
Salchow, Laurel Korholz, Jen Dore-Terhaar, and Hilary Gehman won a
medal at the recent Lucerne regatta, they'll likely be named the
Olympic boat. The men's eight, favored to win gold for the first
time since 1964, is all but determined. The X factor is Brown
junior Dave Simon, who is coming off back surgery. If he's ready,
he'll row in the four and Mike Wherley will stay in the eight. If
he's not, Wherley will go in the four and Newburyport's Cy Beasley,
who rowed the single in 1996, probably will be in the eight. The
United States, by the way, is the only country to qualify in all 14
events (eight men's, six women's) for Sydney . . . Back in action
for the US women's soccer team are keeper Briana Scurry and
midfielder Michelle Akers, who've been sidelined virtually all
year. Scurry, who's been plagued with shin splints, played her
100th match against Norway last week. And Akers, who has been
recovering from major shoulder surgery, saw second-half action in
two matches. Still missing, but due back soon, is captain Carla
Overbeck. The Americans have a chance to even their series (at
13-13-2) Sunday in Oslo with the Norwegians, the only team in the
world that has the edge over them . . . Defender Jeff Agoos and
defensive midfielder Chris Armas could be two of the three over-23
players on the US men's soccer team in Sydney. They're suiting up
for Sunday's tuneup in Indianapolis against the Bolton Wanderers,
the English first division club . . . Odds are that at least half
of the US track and field Olympians who haven't met the ``A''
standard (e.g. men's walk and women's triple jump and javelin)
won't do it by the Sept. 11 deadline. Those who should include
Michael Stember (1,500 meters), Nick Rogers (5,000 meters), and Jud
Logan (hammer).

   The day of the pixie is over in US gymnastics. Of the 30
entrants at last week's national championships, more than half were
18 or older and four (including 28-year-old Kristie Phillips) were
22 or older. Only one (Tasha Schwikert) is 15, which is the new age
limit . . . Who will be in the FleetCenter back room next month
choosing the final three members of the women's gymnastics team
when the trials end? Team coordinator Bela Karolyi, two-time
Olympian Tracee Talavera, longtime judge Marilyn Cross, and former
competitor Chari Knight-Hunter. The standing nine-member men's
committee will pick the final two males . . . Significant upset in
freestyle wrestling, when Charles Burton knocked off former world
champ Les Gutches last week in a wrestle-off for the final spot on
the US team. Gutches, who had won five straight US titles, had
beaten Burton in April, but missed the June trials with a back
injury. Burton won their best-of-three by a 5-0 count in the final
match . . . There was only one surprise at the recent US
weightlifting trials in New Orleans: Shane Hamman outpointing
Olympic veterans Tom Gough and Wes Barnett to join Oscar Chaplin
III on the men's team. Hamman clean-and-jerked 507 pounds, most
ever by an American; he was the first US lifter to break 500 in a
dozen years. The women's team was a given _ Cheryl Haworth, Tara
Nott, Robin Goad, and Cara Heads-Lane. Haworth didn't even have to
show up _ she'd already qualified on past performance. Gough,
Barnett, and Suzanne Leathers of Saunderstown, R.I., still will go
to Sydney, since the Americans expect to get a few last-minute
entries from the international federation . . . Latest Olympic
documentary by storyteller Bud Greenspan focuses on five athletes _
Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci, US decathlete Dan O'Brien,
Ethiopian marathoner Abebe Bikila, Australian swimmer Duncan
Armstrong, and Russian greco-roman wrestler Alexander Karelin. It
will air Aug. 20 on Showtime . . . Carrying the Olympic torch last
week was Jack Lockett, Australia's oldest man. At 109, he's five
years older than the modern Olympic Games.

ROBINSON FINDS NO IFS, ANDS OR BUTT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't a head-butt.
</P>
<P>
   That's the official line, according to Hall of Famer Frank
Robinson, Major League Baseball's vice president for on-field
operations, who suspended Red Sox center fielder Carl Everett 10
games for his contact with umpire Ronald Kulpa after his ejection
July 15 in a game against the New York Mets at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never ourselves said he head-butted him,'' Robinson
said by telephone from his West Coast office Friday. ``That was
reported in the papers, and on TV and stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl's agent (Larry Reynolds) sent us a tape. That was his
contention, that he never head-butted him. I hadn't seen the tapes
yet. Carl didn't head-butt him, but he clearly made contact with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say this: Nothing was taken off the penalty because he
didn't head-butt him. There was no deduction. Whether he
head-butted him or not was not the overriding fact of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been considerable speculation that Robinson, who is in
his first year as the man who metes out justice for on-field
incidents, wanted to give Everett a stiffer penalty than the one he
did, but he was pressured by other big league officials and the
union to stop at 10.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't deny that. ``I don't think that's the important
thing,'' he said. ``I think the important thing is what I decided
to do at the end. That's why I like to take my time with these
things, because initially I may feel one way.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances were these: When Everett stepped into the
batter's box for the first time that Saturday afternoon, Mets
catcher Mike Piazza complained to Kulpa that Everett's left foot
was too close to home plate in the righthanded batter's box. A
player is not supposed to be standing closer than 6 inches to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Mets pitcher Dennis Cook had angrily raised
the same issue after being ejected for hitting Everett with a
pitch. Red Sox manager Jimy Williams later contended the Mets had
gone to the umpires before the next game about the issue, but crew
chief Randy Marsh insisted that wasn't the case. Piazza, Marsh
said, was the first to call attention to it that day.
</P>
<P>
   Kulpa drew a line with his foot. Everett got back in the box and
erased the line with his foot. When Kulpa drew another line later
in the at-bat, words were exchanged, Everett was ejected and then
erupted at Kulpa. Twice, he made contact with the umpire, the first
time with the bill of his helmet, which he subsequently threw down,
the second time with some part of his face _ his nose and lips, but
apparently not with his forehead, which would have constituted a
head butt.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that he thought Kulpa, a first-year umpire, acted
properly. ``I certainly thought he did,'' Robinson said. ``How else
would Carl know where he has to be unless he drew a line? Then Carl
got back in the box and erased it. Back a ways, when I was playing,
an umpire would take the hitter's bat and draw a line, and say,
`This is the box.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So this wasn't something new, you just don't see it nowadays.
So he certainly acted properly in that respect. And what he said to
Carl was proper, but it still may have set him off because Carl
felt he was being forced to do something he's never been asked to
do before.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson interviewed Everett by telephone, with union lawyer
Robert Lenaghan also on the line. Robinson was asked if Everett
expressed any regret for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``No he did not,'' Robinson said, ``But I wasn't looking for any
at that time. I never anticipated an apology. He may in time, when
we cross paths later, he may show remorse, but that's not important
to me. What's important is that he go on with his career and
conduct himself in a gentlemanly way.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett's suspension was the longest given a player for an
on-field incident since Bill Madlock, then playing with Pittsburgh,
rubbed his glove in the face of umpire Jerry Crawford in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to send any messages,'' Robinson said. ``What
I'm trying to do is get a penalty that fits the incident. And this
case warranted a strong penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Everett remained on the field for close to five
minutes after his ejection also factored into Robinson's decision,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all plays into it,'' he said. ``I try to tell players that
what they do after they get ejected weighs just as heavily and is
just as important as what they did to get ejected. Some guys think
that since they've been ejected, they're going to get their money's
worth. I say, `Well, if you're going to get your money's worth,
you're going to have to pay later.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson rejected the suggestion that one reason he didn't give
Everett a stiffer penalty was because he would not only have been
penalizing the player but the team as well. A longer penalty could
have had an even greater impact on the Sox' bid for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Robinson said, ``because I don't feel like I would have
been deciding the pennant race. That comes down to a player's
actions, or a coach's actions, with that type of penalty. He did
it, not me. I only react to what they've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was asked if Everett was out of control during the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on who is judging `out of control,' '' he said.
``My definition may be different from yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I think he had lost control. But I think he had
control enough of himself that he wasn't going to do anything to
physically harm the umpire or anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was managing, and even a few times when I was playing,
and I had heated arguments with the umpires, some of the players
and coaches would say to me, `Man, we had to get you out of there
before you hurt the umpire.' No way. There's something in the back
of your mind that tells you you can't do that, even while you might
be acting silly and crazy out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Everett was getting away from (the coaches and players
trying to hold him), it was like, `Let me have my say.' He's not
going to take his helmet off or throw the bat down if he had lost
total control. Was he out of control? Any time you go off like
that, you're out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he was not surprised when Everett decided to drop
his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know, that's why you just sit here and wait,''
Robinson said. ``I wasn't surprised he dropped it. I think it was
wise on his part, to get it out of the way so he can get back in
there.''

<P>
   Dirty little secret
</P>
<P>
   Last week's report that steroids were discovered in Manny
Alexander's Mercedes after the Red Sox infielder loaned the car to
a 20-year-old batboy prompted plenty of jokes, most along the lines
that if Alexander, who has one home run this season, was using
steroids, he must not have read the instructions on the label.
</P>
<P>
   One law enforcement source said that it's unlikely any charges
will be brought against Alexander, since he was in Chicago at the
time of the discovery, batboy Carlos Cowert was in the car, and it
will be very difficult to establish any link between Alexander and
what was found in the glove compartment. Some people have taken
shots at the Sox for hiring a batboy who has had previous run-ins
with the law, but in this view the Sox deserve credit for reaching
out to a kid and judging him by his behavior when he was on their
clock. By all accounts, Cowert had a flawless record in four years
and never violated the trust the Sox placed in him by allowing him
to work in the team's clubhouse. It is no cause for celebration
when a young man loses his job after what began as a routine
traffic stop.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the jokes about Alexander and steroids, last week's
news accounts thrust a spotlight on a subject that some have called
baseball's dirty little secret. Padres general manager Kevin Towers
has long spoken out about the growing use of steroids in the game;
San Diego has tested its minor leaguers for the last three years
and MLB spokesman Rich Levin said last week that all minor leaguers
are now tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found people in the minor leagues who have been using
steroids,'' Towers said, ``and we've gotten them help.''
</P>
<P>
   How prevalent is steroid use in the big leagues? Some estimates
have pegged it as high as 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the data,'' Towers said, ``but I know it's
prevalent. It really hasn't come up at the general managers'
meetings. Beacuse of the players' union we know we can't test them
for it, but if you talked to 30 general managers, all 30 would have
to say they know an individual or more who use them in their
clubhouse. I walk through a clubhouse _ even most writers could _
and say, `That guy is using. That guy is using.' It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to notice a guy who's put on 70 pounds of bulk on
a skeletal system that wasn't designed to carry that kind of
weight, and that's why you see so many guys breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see drunkenness leaving the clubhouse anymore, but
you have all those supplements and shakes and blenders going in the
clubhouse now. That's more prevalent now than alcohol or smokeless
tobacco or amphetamines.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players, including most of the game's top stars, use some
kind of legal muscle-enhancing supplement. Towers was reviewing
some literature on one such product, creatine, when he received a
phone call from a reporter about his concern about steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Towers said that with such big money at stake, more players are
willing to take the health risks associated with steroid use. What
he fears, he says, is a Lyle Alzado situation in baseball,
referring to the former pro football star who died of a brain tumor
that reportedly was linked to his use of steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to know not only these young players, but their wives
and their kids,'' Towers said. ``I would hate to have a Lyle Alzado
situation, then tell a player's wife we knew about the steroids and
didn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The collective bargaining agreement does not allow for random
testing of any illegal substances. If a player is found to be using
an illegal substance, he is given therapy. After that, he is
subject to discipline.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The low down on Arrojo
</P>
<P>
   One rival baseball uniformed official predicted Cuban pitcher
Rolando Arrojo, who he said was never happy in Colorado after being
dealt by Tampa Bay last winter for third baseman Vinny Castilla,
will be a big plus for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's proved he can pitch,'' he said. ``And being around Pedro
(Martinez) will help him. He needs to be around guys who do it the
right way. Arrojo really wanted out of Colorado in the worst way.
He pitched there in the All-Star Game (in 1998) and didn't like it
then, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not perfect, then it's like it's not worth it. If he
thinks he's out of it, he'll take himself out of a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good guy. He's just got some bad ideas. That's where I
think Pedro will really help him. I don't think there was anybody
on the Rockies he could relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo won't exactly be missed in the Rockies' clubhouse. His
critics point to a game against the Giants July 6, when the Rockies
were in the midst of a 11-game losing streak that knocked them out
of contention, when he gave up a 4-0 lead in the span of 10
pitches. When third baseman Jeff Cirillo came to the mound, Arrojo
shoved him away. He also was known to walk away from pitching coach
Marcel Lachemann, one of the most respected figures in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched real well in Boston,'' the official said.
``Remember, he came back from that thing in Miami, where he got to
see his mom and brother, and pitched real well against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``His problem can be lefthanded hitters. That's where pitching
in Boston may be a little bit of an advantage, where he may not
have to face as many. He likes to drop down against lefthanded
hitters and sometimes it works against him. He definitely has the
stuff to get them out, but you need to watch his arm angle, because
he'll get too low and stay there, because he likes it. (Red Sox
pitching coach Joe) Kerrigan will either reach him or Rolando will
spit him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's right, Arrojo throws 93 to 94 miles an hour, and
occasionally touches 95. Age is always a question . . . He's really
a pretty good guy, and as a pitcher, he can be as good as he wants
to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he's pitching for a contract, He does want to make some
money. He has to run off a couple of good months if he wants to
have any hope about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo will be eligible for salary arbitration for the first
time after this season.
</P>
<P>
   An executive with another club said that the Sox paid dearly for
Arrojo by having to pick up Mike Lansing's $6 million contract for
next season, plus the $1.25 guaranteed buyout for 2002 if his
option isn't exercised, but that Arrojo could be a big factor down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of guy who will make six starts, and four of
them will be good ones. He's serviceable, and he's cheap,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brothers in arms
</P>
<P>
   One AL executive can't imagine the Sox picking up Ramon
Martinez's $8 million option for next season. ``That would be a
mistake,'' he said. ``How can they afford it? Can't they
renegotiate, maybe give him two years at $5 million a year. He
scoffed at the suggestion that the Sox would risk alienating Pedro
if they didn't pick up the option. ``It's nice that they're
brothers, but why do people really think the players hold the
hammer? What's the inherent threat there, that he's going to quit
pitching good? That's ridiculous.''

KRAFT PUTTING THRUST IN BELICHICK'S BRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ The New England Patriots are facing odds of 200-1
and up on winning the Super Bowl, according to some Las Vegas
oddsmakers who appear to be discounting the Bill Belichick factor.
Although the team has but a few stars, a lot of mediocre players,
and several unproven ones, Bob Kraft hired Belichick because he
felt the coach could outsmart the opposition. Kraft opted for
Belichick over Dom Capers and Tom Donahoe because Belichick would
bring superior divisional knowledge, as well as an ability to
devise game plans against the biggest weapons in football.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure truly is on Belichick, who has been billed as a
``defensive genius.'' The fact is, he may not have the players to
execute his schemes. He will have the usual three-year honeymoon
period for coaches, but he'd better be a winner before that's over
or face expulsion from the head-coaching ranks.
</P>
<P>
   As Belichick brings his gang of wounded knees here for Monday
night's Hall of Fame game against the San Francisco 49ers, we look
ahead to the regular-season schedule and try to figure what Kraft
was thinking when he hired Belichick. The coach loves to take it
one team at a time. And so do we:
</P>
<P>
   --Tampa Bay (home): Belichick must devise ways to keep Warren
Sapp from stuffing Drew Bledsoe into his meat grinder. That's
priority one. Offensively, who knows Bucs receiver Keyshawn Johnson
better than Belichick and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis, his
former Jets coaches? Certainly they must know how to exploit his
weaknesses. Everyone has weaknesses. And of course, young
quarterback Shaun King should be a perfect example of someone
Belichick can turn dizzy with his game plans.
</P>
<P>
   --New York Jets (twice): Real interesting. Will Belichick, Weis,
and defensive backs coach Eric Mangini get the best of Al Groh and
his staff, or will it be vice versa? Also, Bill Parcells
desperately wants two wins and he wants his draft picks, especially
the one acquired as compensation for Belichick, to be huge factors.
Belichick and Weis know why Vinny Testaverde was so successful two
years ago. They know why Curtis Martin has such good games against
the Patriots. Belichick knows what makes the Jets' defense tick and
the strength and weaknesses of the players he once coached. But
obviously, Groh knows how Belichick thinks defensively. This is the
ultimate chess game.
</P>
<P>
   --Minnesota Vikings (home): Cris Carter is the Hall of Famer,
but the Patriots must stop Randy Moss. How will Belichick
accomplish this? A little Ty Law in Moss's shirt and a lot of
roughing by Lawyer Milloy? The Vikings will start second-year
quarterback Daunte Culpepper. This should be another easy one where
Belichick can gain the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   --Miami Dolphins (twice): Shut down an already suspect running
game, rattle quarterback Damon Huard or Jay Fiedler, and find a way
to score against a tough Dolphins' defense and this could be a
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   --Denver Broncos (away): Regardless of what year it is, or who
the coach is, playing at Mile High Stadium is something the
Patriots simply don't do well. Belichick's role here is to get them
over this psychological hurdle, contain Terrell Davis, and pressure
and confuse a very poised Brian Griese. A win here would be a large
feather in Belichick's cap.
</P>
<P>
   --Indianapolis (twice): It's all about Peyton Manning. Belichick
actually did a pretty decent job containing him last year with the
Jets. The rest of the league is probably wondering how Belichick
could send Manning plummeting into a season-long funk because once
Belichick devises something to stop Manning, the rest of the league
will follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   --Buffalo Bills (twice): The Bills love to pound the ball down
your throat, which will put the interior part of the Patriots' line
and linebackers front and center. With Rob Johnson the likely
quarterback, Belichick may be able to take advantage of yet another
mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   --Cleveland Browns (away): Belichick is always welcome in
Cleveland _ as long as he's the opposing coach. Not a popular guy
there, this will be another case of going up against a coach _
Chris Palmer _ with whom he once worked and who understands how he
operates. In this case, the Patriots might have the edge in player
talent. Once again, young quarterback Tim Couch will have to crack
whatever mind game Belichick will play with him.
</P>
<P>
   --Cincinnati Bengals (home): The Bengals could have a very good
offense led by sophomore quarterback Akili Smith, who is mobile and
exciting. Belichick may have to approach Smith as he does Doug
Flutie and try to keep him in the pocket. The Bengals start the
year with a decent offensive line, good skilled positions. Let's
see if they can hold down the Patriots' offense, which is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   --Detroit Lions (away): The Lions have some terrific receivers
that must be contained and a decent defense, but who knows if pass
rusher Robert Porcher will have ended his holdout by Thanksgiving
or whether Charlie Batch will be the quarterback. This is a tough
one because the Patriots play the Browns Nov. 19 and the Lions four
days later.
</P>
<P>
   --Kansas City Chiefs (home): The Chiefs like to control the ball
and pound it up the middle, similar to the Bills, and they always
have an aggressive defense. Elvis Grbac can be rattled into making
mistakes which is Belichick's best chance of creating turnovers and
getting his team into good field position. It's a Monday night game
at home, so it's a definite adrenaline lift.
</P>
<P>
   --Chicago Bears (away): This is really a great matchup:
Belichick's defense vs. Gary Crowton's offense. This may be as good
as it gets in terms of converging strategies. Belichick and Crowton
are arguably as good at what they do as anyone in the league. The
Bears should be much improved and the game is at Soldier Field in
December.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubting that Belichick will have a strong defense,
but if the offense can't move the ball and they have a lot of
three-and-outs, as was the case a year ago, that wears out the
defense. Weis will also have an enormous amount of pressure to put
together a decent offensive line to protect Bledsoe, and will need
Terry Glenn to stay healthy. We'll begin seeing the season unfold a
little at a time starting Monday night.

   One thing Belichick hopes to inherit from his years with
Parcells is that his teams get stronger as the season goes on.
Belichick must, however, pull out all of his tricks, knowledge, and
ability to get through the first half of the schedule. If the
Patriots can hit their week off on Oct. 29 at 4-4 or 5-3, Belichick
may have fooled the oddsmakers.

   Signs of the times

   When the owners meet in September, the subject of
incentive-filled contracts is likely to be a hot topic.
Spearheading this is Kraft, who would like to see the
``earn-your-pay'' approach be uniform around the league. Kraft's
negotiators, Andy Wasynczuk and Jack Mula, have begun implementing
this approach in the offseason. Mula signed all nine draft picks
using this approach, and though he may have irked an agent or two
along the way, the bottom line is the Patriots got their draft
picks for bargains, holding down the amount of signing bonuses
while going heavy on incentives. Wasynczuk signed Bruce Armstrong
to an incentive-laden deal for the minimum salary, and when he
renegotiated Vincent Brisby's deal recently, the team cut his pay
in half, but added several incentives based on receptions that
could give Brisby the opportunity to earn $2.6 million _ $1.1
million more than his base salary. Kraft runs all of his businesses
this way, offering employees incentives to earn bonuses based on
performance. Preliminary indications are that players union
representative Gene Upshaw would give his blessing to this provided
there are other concessions made. If the NFLPA goes along with this
method of payment, it would be another shot in the arm for NFL
owners, who already are incredibly protected by not having to issue
guaranteed contracts and now can lower the cash outlay on signing
bonuses and pay big money only if a player performs at a high
level. Wouldn't that be Utopia?

   Bledsoe acknowledges he felt a little intimidated when he walked
into Orafino (Idaho) State Maximum Security Prison July 11, but he
feels he's making a difference in the lives of the children of
convicted criminals. Bledsoe's ``Parenting With Dignity'' program
is a comprehensive course offered by the Bledsoe Foundation that
teaches parenting skills. Although prisoners may find it difficult
to take an everyday role in raising their children, they can still
encourage their youngsters not to follow in their footsteps.
Bledsoe thinks the course is working. ``The best evidence I can
share on that is that my dad (Mac, a former school teacher who
authored the program with his wife, Barbara) had been there the
year before and spoken to them and left our program with them. When
we arrived, they were stating back to us things that were in the
program. They had better lines of communication with their
families. It's an area where we can make a difference. I forget the
exact statistic about the percentage of the criminals whose parents
were also criminals. If you can break that cycle and eliminate one
generation of it, you're making inroads.'' Bledsoe spoke to small
groups, totaling about 350 inmates in all. ``When those doors slam
shut, you get a glimpse of what it would be like to have your
freedom taken from you. It was eye-opening. What struck me the most
is if you put them in a different setting they look like one of
your uncles, just regular people who made mistakes. My perception
was that they were going to be hardened criminals, but I felt
differently after spending time with them.''

   Patriots punter Lee Johnson, 39 and still going strong, was
indirectly involved in Steve Young's decision to retire. Johnson,
one of Young's best friends, said the former 49er quarterback spoke
to him quite often about whether to retire, but ``in the end it was
his decision. He's always been known to seek out what other people
think. But it was all him and he wavered until the last minute. He
knew he had to do it but he didn't want to do it.'' Johnson doesn't
believe Young would ever want a full-time broadcasting gig, but
``he'd probably do some things on a part-time or special basis.
He's just going to stay in the Bay Area until his baby is born and
then he'll probably leave the area.'' . . . By the time Ronnie
Lott, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday,
had hit New York (1993-94), he was near the end of his career. But
his coach, Pete Carroll, certainly could see why Lott wasn't far
from Canton. ``Nobody tried to hit somebody as hard as he did,''
said Carroll. ``It was really important to him to set that
standard. He was a great competitor, a team leader. Nobody played
with more disregard for his body, yet he played so long. He could
have played in any age. The expectations for himself were so
high.'' . . . So much for the strength and conditioning program
being such a huge factor. Andy Katzenmoyer attended only about a
half-dozen workouts and instead spent most of his time at Ohio
State with strength coach Dave Kennedy. Katzenmoyer returned in
excellent condition. Katzenmoyer realized he needed to be in even
better shape to contend with the rigors of an NFL season. ``It's
very, very long compared to the college season. I started to feel
the injuries that never occurred to me before _ aching joints,
muscles, and stuff like that.'' Now Katzenmoyer is in position to
be a starting inside linebacker with Ted Johnson. He must battle
Tedy Bruschi for the job, but the feeling is that the combination
of Johnson and Katzenmoyer gives the Patriots two huge bodies in
the middle of the field that could shut down the run . . . Former
San Diego Chargers head coach June Jones has to be wondering about
the way things are done in Hawaii where he's the university's head
football coach. The athletic department has rid itself of the
80-year-old rainbow logo partly because, according to AD Hugh
Yoshida, it ``ties in with the gay community.'' They also said it
tied in with Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition and NASCAR driver
Jeff Gordon's pit crew. Now, the football team will have a green
and white ``H'' as a logo and be known as the Warriors. Hmmm. That
invites a whole new set of problems, doesn't it? Adrian Klemm, the
Patriots' second-round pick, has said that he isn't crazy about
returning to Paradise except to see friends. Evidently, Hawaii
isn't a comfortable place for everyone . . . The Peoria Pirates
went 14-0 for the 21-team Indoor Football League, tying the 1972
Dolphins for a season-best mark for a professional football
franchise. The Pirates are coached by Bruce Cowdrey, who, I guess,
had a wide-open style, averaging 55.9 points per game and allowing
27.4 points per game. Talk about home ``arena'' advantage: the
Pirates won by an average margin of 37 points per game . . . The
induction ceremonies here often remind us: Why isn't Gino
Cappelletti enshrined? . . . Parcells may be the next coach
inducted here as early as next season unless he makes another
comeback. He was adamant again about his statement earlier this
winter that he had coached his last game, but a report came out
this week indicating he was thinking of returning to coaching next
season. Parcells denied it vehemently on various talk shows last
week . . . There was no outward sign that the strain of working for
someone like Daniel Snyder had taken its toll on Washington
Redskins' director of college scouting, Joe Mendes, who worked for
the Patriots from 1982-1993. But that's the speculation. Mendes
signed all of those All-Pro players and top rookies to big money,
then split. There have been rumors that Mendes could be rejoining
Charley Casserly in Houston as the expansion franchise's new
capologist, but Mendes said he has no job plans for the moment . .
. Chasing a dream of playing in the NFL isn't for everyone. It
requires great mental and physical toughness, and though the
rewards are plentiful, so is the sacrifice. Those are the issues
Patriots' fifth-round pick Dave Stachelski appears to be wrestling
with as he decides whether to keep pursuing an NFL career or move
on with his life . . . Talk about not living up to expectations.
When the Cardinals amassed a front line of Simeon Rice, Eric Swann,
Mark Smith, and Andre Wadsworth, it was the second coming of the
Purple People Eaters. But it never materialized. Swann was cut,
Rice has never been the force he was supposed to be, Smith has held
out two years in a row, and Wadsworth is injury-prone. The
Cardinals now start Brad Otis, Tony McCoy, Jerry Drake, and Tom
Burke and, the funny thing is, they might be better off . . .
There's Bills-mania at their new training site in Rochester, N.Y.
The Bills have averaged about 6,250 fans per day. Not bad for a
team that lost Bruce Smith, Thurman Thomas, and Andre Reed and is
without Flutie, who will miss the rest of training camp with a
groin tear . . . One place the Patriots might look for defensive
line help is Carolina, which has 11 pretty good linemen including
Reggie White. Tim Morabito, who was signed as a free agent and who
visited with the Patriots during the offseason, may be available .
. . Give Chad Eaton credit for not trying to be a media darling and
everybody's talk show guest and concentrating strictly on football.
Eaton may have taken a step back last year, but don't bet against
him making the Pro Bowl this year . . . It looks like Crowton has a
great chance to be the coordinator in demand in the offseason after
the fine job he did with the Bears' offense last season. Crowton
interviewed with the Patriots and the Krafts still rave about him.
If things had fallen through with Belichick or Capers, Crowton
might have been the head coach in New England. Crowton earns
$275,000 and his salary will increase to $300,000 and $325,000 the
next two years. But Crowton will likely be a top choice for the
Houston job, as will Weis if the Patriots have a big year on
offense . . . The Cowboys have been sending scouts to watch the
Redskins' practice. Because Snyder charges fans $10 to watch
training camp, teams can get around a rule that prohibits teams
from scouting one another in camp. And they have. Evidently, a few
other teams, including the Rams under GM Charlie Armey, have also
had representatives there . . . Despite searching elsewhere, the
Patriots realize that the best site for training camp is Bryant
College. No other facility in New England offers the same amenities
of practice fields, locker rooms, dorms, cafeterias, meeting space,
etc. . . . In a rare moment when Mike Shanahan was actually loose
and relaxed, he cracked a joke. When asked about guard Mark
Schlereth's left knee after 13 operations, he quipped, ``It looks
like a jigsaw puzzle.'' . . . When Carolina meets Jacksonville next
week, watch Panthers quarterback Steve Beuerlein and Jaguars coach
Tom Coughlin. Beuerlein didn't take kindly to Coughlin's staff
violating Pro Bowl rules and blitzing. At the time, Beuerlein
shouted at both Coughlin and defensive coordinator Capers from the
sideline. Beuerlein said he won't hold any grudges. ``We've got
more important things to do than worry about what happened in the
Pro Bowl,'' said Beuerlein. ``We'll never know why exactly things
happened the way they did. But nobody got hurt. I came out of it
fine and I still have an awful lot of respect for both (Coughlin
and Capers).'' . . . Despite New Orleans owner Tom Benson pushing
for Houston to be in the NFC, the AFC owners, led by Kraft, will
insist that Houston be an AFC expansion team. The Texans (OK, I'm
jumping the gun on a nickname) will likely join the AFC Central in
2002. Here's another possibility, when the divisions are reshuffled
somewhat to take the Texans in, watch a possible push for the Colts
to move out of the AFC East and into the Central . . . The Patriots
never entered in talks with Carl Pickens at any time, though they
should have. The deal Pickens accepted with the already talent-rich
Titans, will count only $600,000 against the cap. He does receive a
$4.5 million roster bonus next March and a $1 million base salary.
Difficult to handle at times in Cincinnati, Pickens fired agent
Steve Zucker who had worked so hard on his behalf for so many
years, hired Atlanta-based Hadley Engelhard, and then fired him and
agreed to the deal on his own. Asked about his past problems he
said, ``When everything around you is negative you can't help but
be negative. Here, the players know from Day 1 they're going to win
10, 11, 12 games. What's not to be positive about? That comes from
the confidence they have. I just want to play.'' The advent of
Pickens protects the Titans from Yancey Thigpen's injuries.

OSBORNE'S STILL THE CHOICE FOR NEBRASKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Neb. _ The building sits in the eastern part of town, a
one-room log cabin next to a municipal swimming pool, which is
strangely empty on this hot July afternoon, in the middle of a
complex of athletic fields that are also empty.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is surprised. Sure, it's July, but it's also the
middle of the week and there are chores to be done on the farms
that dominate the area in the heart of the biggest congressional
district in Nebraska _ an area that covers four-fifths of the state
and almost 65,000 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   And in a town like Geneva, which is a two-hour ride from Omaha,
in the middle of Fillmore County, there are other concerns, such as
the decline in the price of corn and the steady exodus of the next
generation of farmers to bigger and better things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a sense of stability here as the weekly luncheon
meeting of the Geneva Rotary Club convenes. Sloppy Joes, corn on
the cob, brownies, and iced tea are on the menu for the 30 or so
people who have gathered not so much for a discussion of their
problems, but to hear ideas on how to solve them. Or at least words
that will make the tough times more digestible.
</P>
<P>
   It is still the heartland of America where the dream lingers,
where a room of people gets on its feet and sings ``My Country 'Tis
of Thee'' and ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' with such
sincerity and passion that it sends chills up and down your spine.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the guest speaker has come to offer his
thoughts. It is here that Tom Osborne comes on this Tuesday
afternoon, with words of hope, with a vision, as he calls it, to
make things better, even if it's only in a sense of being and of
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   It is here that the former football coach at the University of
Nebraska has come with a simple message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the energy,'' he said. ``And I still feel I have
a little opportunity where I can make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Osborne is running, running as hard as he did when he was
guiding the Nebraska Cornhuskers to 255 wins and three national
championships over a 25-year head coaching career that has made him
almost a mythical figure in this state. He is running for the US
Congressional seat in Nebraska's 3d District, a predominantly rural
area that covers almost all of the state except the urban centers
of Omaha and Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   But at 63, three years removed from a retirement from coaching
that he now concedes may have been premature, Osborne may also be
running away from something as well, as he tries to find something
to fill the void in his life that the absence of coaching has
created.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reputation on the rise
</P>
<P>
   He has been running since January when the idea that had been
percolating in his head for the last few years evolved into a
formal announcement of his candidacy. The last time the rest of the
country had an up-close look at Osborne was after the 1998 Orange
Bowl, when a Nebraska romp over Tennessee gave the Huskers a share
of their third national championship.
</P>
<P>
   After so many years of coming up just one short, Osborne put the
cap on a career that for his last five seasons had produced a
stunning 60-3 record. When it came to winning college football
games, no one did better than Osborne and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Not without cost, however. Osborne had given up much during a
head coaching career that began in 1973 as a 36-year-old
replacement for Bob Devaney, the man credited with building the
foundation of Huskers football.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's family _ wife Nancy, son Mike, and daughters Annie and
Suzi _ had seen only glimpses of him during the long seasons that
began for him in late July and didn't end until the conclusion of
the recruiting period in February.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne concedes with some guilt that Nancy had raised the
children virtually by herself and he promised her that, after 25
years, it would be time to do something else.
</P>
<P>
   He also made a similar commitment to longtime aid Frank Solich
the time was coming when he would step down and Solich would be the
man to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne also had concerns about his health. He had heart bypass
surgery in 1985. After that, Osborne lost weight. He changed his
diet, which included giving up red meat _ a tough thing to do
publicly in a state where cattle outnumber people, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Although Osborne has since had no major heart problems, an
irregular heartbeat in his final year of coaching seemed to be
another omen it was time to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. While the Huskers were winning games and titles
and Osborne was building his reputation in his home state, a series
of off-field incidents involving his players was tarnishing his
reputation outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   The most notable incidents involved defensive lineman Christian
Peter and running back Lawrence Phillips. Both were involved in a
series of crimes involving verbal and physical abuse of women that
caused an uproar across the country, made even greater by
Nebraska's high profile as a college football power.
</P>
<P>
   It also caused concern inside the state, with the eyes of
Nebraska turning to Osborne for explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's message was simple: ``Trust me,'' he said. ``You don't
know all the facts. I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's words were sincere. He has always had almost a
missionary zeal for saving souls, for seeing the good in everyone.
He was a coach, but he was more than that, serving as a father
figure to many of the players who came from one-parent families.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who earned a doctorate in educational psychology at
Nebraska, also recognized the changing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer a `Leave it to Beaver' era,'' he conceded when
talking about the new generation of athletes that came under his
sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips incident, however, changed things. Phillips, a
troubled young man who came from a group home environment in
California, had pushed the envelope since his arrival. Osborne gave
him one chance and then another, feeling that if he turned on
Phillips, no one would be there for him.
</P>
<P>
   But when Phillips's temper flared into a physical attack on his
girlfriend _ something Osborne maintains was not as severe as
reported _ Osborne suspended him for six games, a punishment
Osborne's critics say didn't fit the seriousness of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the other incidents involving Nebraska players,
Osborne's image in the minds of many outside of Nebraska was
sealed: just another football coach who would condone anything to
win football games.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the state, there was concern and investigations, but the
ultimate decision was based on the quality of the man Huskers fans
felt they knew. If Tom said it was OK, it was OK.
</P>
<P>
   And that, as much as anything, is what has made his political
future in Nebraska a mortal lock to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Trust in Tom and things will be fine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Primary choice
</P>
<P>
   John Gale was feeling pretty good about things nine months ago.
The state Republican Party chairman from North Platte was ready and
eager to fill the void when Bill Barrett, Nebraska's Republican
representative from the 3d District announced he would not seek a
sixth term. And since the 3d District had not elected a Democrat
since it was created following the 1960 census, Barrett felt
reasonably confident that, if he could win the primary in May, he
would be heading to Washington following the general election in
November.
</P>
<P>
   That was until Osborne made his announcement Jan. 27. The
following day, the first polls came out and Osborne had the support
of 72 percent of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Three candidates dropped out immediately. Gale stuck it out, but
with a feeling of inevitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt pretty overwhelming,'' he said. ``I knew I wasn't
going to win, because name recognition is the major quality of any
campaign. And he has it in spades.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 9, Osborne won the primary with 71 percent of the vote,
setting up a fall campaign against Rollie Reynolds, an insurance
and real estate developer from Grand Island.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, like Gale, is an overwhelming underdog. Although
Reynolds has not conceded the race and has lobbied for a series of
debates (Osborne says he will participate in one), he understands
he dynamics of the state and Osborne's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my hero,'' said Reynolds. ``He's everybody's hero. With a
name recognition like that, how can he lose?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Setting the agenda
</P>
<P>
   It is 10:45 a.m. and Tom Osborne is running pretty much on
schedule as he pulls up to the Conoco gas station in his Ford
Expedition. He is running a grass-roots campaign as he traverses
the state.
</P>
<P>
   On the schedule this morning is an appearance at the Fillmore
County Fair, a Rotary Club luncheon in Geneva, a tour of a soybean
processing plant in his hometown of Hastings, and a dinner
appearance in Kearney. It has been that way since January, with
only a slight letup after he won the primary. Schools, plants,
county fairs. Breakfasts, lunches, dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like recruiting in a lot of ways,'' says Osborne,
as he gets out of his truck at the county fairgrounds just outside
Geneva. ``Only the agenda is different. I'm not still talking to
parents about their kids, but I'm talking to them about their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne is running as moderate conservative. He has conservative
values, yet he is in favor of a moratorium on the death penalty and
is for limited gun control. They are stands not normally associated
with conservatives in the heartland. He also placed a limit on
campaign spending and funding. He said he will accept no PAC money
and limits contributions to $300.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne is in the heart of farm country. The price of a bushel
of corn has dropped to $1.50. Farmers are looking at fields that
are rich with crops, but without markets that can get them fair
market values, in their opinion.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, as he has done most of the time, Osborne travels
without fanfare. There is no entourage, just Tom driving with
friends who serve as county coordinators. This time it is Bob
Bettger, a farmer who has 4,500 acres of land, and grows mostly
corn and soybean.
</P>
<P>
   Bettger, like most farmers in the area, concedes Osborne does
not have in politics. He acknowledges that someone like Rollie
Reynolds might have better qualifications, but he says Osborne
still has the trump card. He's Tom Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got stature,'' says Bettger, a 1971 Nebraska graduate and
a Huskers season ticket-holder. ``He wants to do what's best for
the 3d District.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne stands, watching the judging of hogs for leanness and
quality. His initial presence is subtle. A few look his way. Then a
few more. Within five minutes, he is surrounded. Children come up
for autographs. Adults come by to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is what he's done for us,'' says Don
Bristol, a farmer, who brought his wife and children to the fair
for the day. ``People believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol is worried. He is a farmer and he is worried about his
future, about that of his family. ``The situation in the farm
community is pretty bleak,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is leaning toward voting for Osborne, although he
hadn't heard Osborne's opinion on farm issues. ``I'm hoping there
will be a debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he pauses. Barring some gigantic gaffe, he will vote for
Osborne. He concedes there is a danger Osborne might not be
qualified, that despite the effort Osborne has made to get up to
speed on issues concerning farmers, he might not be able to provide
any help.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a concern,'' he says. ``But what's our alternative?''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne is formally introduced to the crowd. He makes some small
talk, takes note of a hog that is a little too frisky, and jokes
about how he can use all the votes he can get.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughs. The message is clear. It is not so much the
message. Rollie Reynolds or anyone else can talk about the problems
of Fillmore County and farmers. They can talk about the quality of
life. But it's not the same.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Osborne can say it and it means something, because Tom
Osborne is saying it.
</P>
<P>
   Later, even Osborne concedes that. He has talked about farm
issues and education. Now he is talking about hope. Not only for
the next generation of Nebraska farmers, but for the folks sitting
in front of him who have raised their children and made sacrifices
for them and now are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a vision,'' he tells them. ``I believe in the potential
of young people and usually they respond to that vision.''
</P>
<P>
   He alludes to his handling of the Lawrence Phillips situation.
``Most people in Nebraska felt I tried to do the right thing,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about his commitment and how he feels he can make a
difference. ``This isn't just a two-year commitment,'' he says. ``I
hope to do it for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Run is deep-rooted
</P>
<P>
   Things are quiet at the Tom Osborne campaign headquarters in
Hastings. No phones ringing. A muted television in the background,
giving grim details of the crash of the Air France Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   This is where it all began for Osborne more than 60 years ago.
``Just up the street a few blocks from Hastings College,'' Osborne
says with a smile. ``That's where I grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after all these years, he remains a mystery to all but his
closest friends, not showing too much of anything. He is a
Nebraskan to his toenails, tall, a bit worn, but of good stock.
This has been his home. Always will be, even when he goes to
Washington, he makes it clear he will not live there. ``Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday,'' he says. ``Then it's back here. This is
where my interest lies, not Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne has been a star all his life. In high school and at
college he was voted the Nebraska athlete of the year. Yet even
then, more than 45 years ago, he had formed his personality.
</P>
<P>
   Some would call it aloof. Others call it arrogant or conceited.
Even Nancy, his wife of 38 years, found him ``obnoxious'' on their
first date.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne's classmates called him ``Yak,'' a swipe at his
reticence in talking very much. Osborne resented the nickname, but
conceded he had an early defense mechanism that precluded him from
showing anger or joy.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the town where his personality and values were
formed, he is very much a real figure.
</P>
<P>
   He is making this run for Congress because he feels it is his
calling, because he has yet more to give. His net worth, estimated
between $6 million and $16 million, is not an issue. He will give
to charity, and says that when he dies, most of it will go to
charity after he takes care of his family.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants to give back more to the state, to the people who
have supported him for so long. He concedes he thought about making
a run for governor two years ago but the timing wasn't right. He
wasn't ready. He needed time to assess what was inside of him.
</P>
<P>
   He says he knows it will be rough at first. Politics and sport
are alike in some ways and different in many others. Others who
have ventured into the political arena after a career in athletics
have told him so.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Watts is a Republican congressman from Oklahoma who played
quarterback for the Sooners against Osborne's teams. Watts, who is
chairman of the House Republican Conference and regarded as a
rising Republican star, says politics and sports have vast
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would find a place where the egos were as
big as they were in athletics,'' said Watts. ``Then I entered
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Watts said he has faith in Osborne's abilities. ``I told
him, `You are going to be fine, whatever you do,' '' said Watts.
``But this business is much different from football and athletics.
In football, you measure success every week. In politics, sometimes
it takes years. In this business, there aren't a whole lot of
40-yard gains. But rather 4 yards here and 10 yards there and
pretty soon you will score.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Steve Largent, also a
Republican congressman from Oklahoma, said Osborne has qualities
that can overcome the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has a lot of credibility,'' said Largent. ``He's so
much more than X's and O's. He lifts the perceptions of the office
we all hold. He enhances what we're about. The general perception
is somewhere just above used-car salesman. To have a person like
this is the best way to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who don't come from sports see a tougher road. Veteran
congressman Marty Meehan (D-Mass.) said, ``It's a lot different
than being head coach at Nebraska, where you say this is what we're
going to run on offense, and this is what we're going to run on
defense, and anyone that doesn't like it, there's the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little different in Congress. You have to form
partnerships and friendships over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Meehan concedes Osborne's persona will help. ``Other
members will want to get to know him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That too will be difficult. Osborne is what he is. He is
unlikely to change or bend or veer off course. He said he toyed
briefly with the idea of getting back into coaching last season as
two schools, Houston and Michigan State, made overtures.
</P>
<P>
   But his Nebraska roots were too deep. Now he is ready for
another challenge, another venue, a modern-day Jefferson Smith, the
ideal young congressman played by Jimmy Stewart in the classic film
``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Osborne says he has never seen the movie, but has heard the
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get my head handed to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But considering who Tom Osborne is and what he has done, don't
count on it.

PRESIDENT, AT WIFE'S CAMPAIGN FUND-RAISER, STRESSES DIFFERENCES IN
PARTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heaping lavish praise on his wife as the most
intelligent and passionate person he has ever met, President
Clinton exhorted a small but generous clutch of contributors in
Manhattan Saturday to guard against complacency in a time of
prosperity and to remember the vast differences between Republicans
and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good-times elections are as big a test of our judgment and
our values and our national character as the tough-times
elections,'' he said, speaking at a luncheon fund-raiser sponsored
by Korean-American organizations at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The event collected $250,000 for Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S.
Senate bid. ``Remind your fellow Americans not to go to sleep in
this election year, that what you do in good times is just as
important, maybe more important, as what you do in bad times, in
elections. Elections are choices with real consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The president repeatedly emphasized what he described as the
``huge differences'' between the two parties, singling out tax
cuts, gun safety laws and hate crimes legislation as examples.
</P>
<P>
   But even though his remarks seemed to be less about the Senate
race than about the larger contest between Republicans and
Democrats, he had nothing but praise for his wife, the candidate at
the center of Saturday's fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the hundreds of people I've known, including many
presidents and candidates for presidents, I have never known anyone
who had the same combination of intelligence and passion and
knowledge and ability to get things done for children, for
families, for education, for health care as my wife does,'' he said
in introducing Mrs. Clinton. ``She can do things and she knows
things that no one else now in our public life can do and know,
just because of the life she's lived.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was an equally lavish display of admiration. Mrs.
Clinton, who has tethered her campaign to the successes of the
Clinton administration over the last eight years, urged her
audience to make election-year choices that would continue those
successes, giving her husband credit for reducing crime,
introducing health care for poor children and trimming the welfare
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is a better place today than in 1992 because of
his leadership, and I'm very appreciative,'' she said. ``We all
have a choice, to decide whether we go forward together or make a
U-turn back to the past.''
</P>
<P>
   What effect Saturday's audience would have on her race, though,
remained unclear. Organizers of the event estimated that a quarter
of the contributors came from out of state, and a few of the most
prominent donors said they had not yet decided whom to vote for.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raiser was organized by Albert Kwak, a businessman from
Iowa City who said he was approached by a friend of the president's
_ a Cleveland businessman, Tony George _ to arrange a
Korean-American function for Mrs. Clinton's campaign. Neither Kwak
nor another organizer, Gilliam Kim, the owner of a Chicago cellular
telephone company, would say how much they donated.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides said Saturday that the gathering of about 200
people had generated roughly $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's event was Mrs. Clinton's second fund-raiser among
Korean-Americans. The first, held two weeks ago at a Korean
restaurant in Flushing, N.Y., in Queens County, raised about
$60,000, campaign aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton praised Korean-Americans for their educational
achievements, noted her support for a federal hate crimes law and
applauded the contributions of immigrants to New York, pointing to
a recent report that concluded that 40 percent of all New York City
residents today were born outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a wonderful statistic,'' she said. ``New York
is really the world.''
</P>
<P>
   She repeated her call for affordable health care, money to equip
old schools with new technology, and prescription drug benefits for
the elderly on Medicare. Her remarks were notable only in that she
said nothing about her Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio. Last
week, she urged him to engage in a series of debates and excoriated
his links to a group with unorthodox views on the causes of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, in agreeing to debate, suggested three locations. Two of
them had been scheduled months ago, when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
considering running for the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Mrs. Clinton's aides said she would debate him
anywhere, at any time.

DIPIETRO'S FIRST TASTE OF SUCCESS IS SWEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, when Rick DiPietro is driving alone in his car or
sitting quietly by himself, he thinks about what has happened to
him in the last year, even the last few months, and he still can't
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   There was the victory in the Beanpot, his outstanding
performance in the World Junior Championships, his selection last
month as the No. 1 overall pick in the National Hockey League entry
draft. Last week, that pick translated into a lucrative contract
with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his contract is settled and the media whirlwind has
died down, DiPietro said his focus will go back to on-ice pursuits
as he prepares for life as a pro athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of running around and stuff, away from
the rink,'' said DiPietro. ``Now I get to put my focus toward
getting mentally and physically prepared to be successful for
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro, who will live with a family on Long Island in the
fall, said all the fanfare has been a great deal to absorb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's hit me yet,'' he said. ``I've been doing so
much running around, I haven't had time to sit back and really
think about what's actually going on here. When I step in the
locker room for training camp and I see some of the guys I've grown
up watching _ like John Vanbiesbrouck _ it's going to finally set
in and I'll finally realize what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He is spending the rest of the summer working out with fitness
guru Mike Boyle and will attend the World Junior camp in Lake
Placid, N.Y., in August. The following month, when he turns 19,
he'll set his sights on winning the Islanders' starting goaltender
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll embrace the challenge whatever it may be, whether it be
at the minor league level or the NHL level,'' said DiPietro, who
played one year at Boston University before deciding to enter the
draft. ``There was a lot of talk that a young goaltender would have
to spend some time in the minors before he'd be able to prove
himself in the NHL and that's something I realized. I never really
expected to get an opportunity where I could step right in. I was
going to accept playing in the minors and work up from there. I was
ready and looking forward to starting my pro career and hopefully,
developmentally, playing with pros every day will make me that much
better. I was using college as a steppingstone to the next level. I
thought I made a lot of great strides playing with a lot of
talented players (at BU).''
</P>
<P>
   There will be pressure to perform and to live up to the billing
that accompanies all No. 1 picks. The fact he is a goalie will put
him in the spotlight even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a lot of added pressure,
especially being a goaltender and going first overall, which had
never happened before,'' he said. ``I'm going to try to do the
things that will get me prepared for the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro is supremely confident and believes he belongs in the
NHL, whether it be this fall or somewhere down the line. Scouts
have been very impressed with his puck-handling abilities, which
have been compared to those of New Jersey netminder and two-time
Stanley Cup winner Martin Brodeur. DiPietro said he sees himself as
more of a Grant Fuhr-style goalie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize I'm going to have to tone it down and pick my
spots,'' said DiPietro. ``Martin Brodeur is pretty successful with
it. At the college level, I was fortunate to make mistakes and not
pay for them. I realize at the NHL level, if I make a mistake, it
will end up in the back of my net and hurt my team.''
</P>
<P>
   He has enjoyed the attention and the excitement but is also
looking forward to his preparation for the big time. In terms of
spending any of his riches, DiPietro said the first order of
business is a car for his brother, who has been lobbying hard for
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is first on the list to get a couple of presents to
show them how much I appreciate what they've done for me over the
years,'' he said. ``Now (that the contract is settled), the reality
is going to start setting in pretty quick. All the glitz and
glamour is winding down and the real job is going to be at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   DiPietro said it's going to take some time for him to get used
to the fact that now he's a pro athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything has sunk in yet,'' he said. ``It's
going to be funny, now that I have my own checking account with my
own money. It's going to be pretty weird at first.''
</P>
<P>

   Taking shots

   Maple Leafs general manager and coach Pat Quinn was never a
shrinking violet as a player and he isn't one off the ice, either.
At a recent charity golf tournament, Quinn was critical of the NHL,
claiming it has taken on too many of the NBA's characteristics.
``We have an awful schedule again,'' said Quinn. ``Too many
back-to-back games, which I guess is the way they like it in the
NBA but hockey is a different game. The thing is, the same company
that does the NBA schedule does ours, too.'' Quinn said that the
NBA pretty much plays halfcourt ball (``They basically stop the
game while they walk the ball up the floor,'' said Quinn), and that
philosophy has contributed to slowing down the game of hockey.
``The same thing's happening in hockey,'' said Quinn. ``We took a
game that has a great flow to it and clogged it up. We've gone back
to a fall-back game, a countertrap game, and what it does is clog
everything up. We've gone to a stop game, too, just like
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The waiting game
</P>
<P>
   The future for Flyers center Eric Lindros remains uncertain. He
could be sidelined three or four months into the season, depending
on the results of neurological tests. Lindros, who has suffered six
concussions in his career and had four in a five-month span last
season, said he's feeling much better but will postpone any
decision until after he is examined in Chicago by concussion expert
Dr. James Kelly. The Flyers, trying to plug holes, signed
29-year-old center Derek Plante. ``Our feeling is, not knowing what
Eric Lindros is going to do, this would give us at least five
centermen,'' said GM Bob Clarke. ``The last couple of years haven't
been so good for Plante but we believe he is young enough and
talented enough to bounce back. We look at this as (a depth
move).'' Plante had two goals and two assists in 33 games last year
with Dallas and Chicago . . . Wayne Gretzky is finding out that
owning a team, or at least being close to owning a team, isn't that
easy. Gretzky, who is in the process of purchasing the Phoenix
Coyotes with majority partner Steve Ellman, has talked to current
owner Richard Burke about allowing him to run the team. But Burke
isn't interested in surrendering his authority until the transfer
is complete, which will happen once the Ellman group pays the
outstanding balance. ``We had some disagreements,'' said Gretzky,
referring to Burke. ``I tried to get us to have full authority of
the team. But Mr. Burke said that until he relinquishes it, he
still owns the team. That's the way we have to look at it.'' Burke
said it wouldn't make any sense to allow the new group to run the
franchise until they buy it. ``Nobody is going to turn a business
over before a sale is completed,'' said Burke. ``Until they buy it,
I still own it and I'm responsible for all the consequences. If
they are going to make changes in the front office and on the
roster, I'm not going to let them change all those people and move
them until they buy it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Honoring Briere
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of Pittsburgh are that the No. 21 of Michel Briere,
who was killed in a car accident in 1970 following his rookie
season with the Penguins, will be retired by the team this fall.
Mario Lemieux is the only Penguin to have his sweater raised to the
rafters . . . The Canucks signed veteran goalie Bob Essensa, who
was an unrestricted free agent. The 35-year-old played 30 games
last season for the Coyotes, finishing with a 13-10-3 record . . .
One of the key reasons Mark Messier is no longer in Vancouver was
the Canucks' unwillingness to give him more than a one-year deal.
Messier, who signed with the Rangers for two years, wouldn't have
fit into Vancouver's plans beyond this season. ``It wasn't a
financial issue as much as there's a time when we had to let the
kids start to play and we thought it was the year after this one,''
said director of hockey operations Dave Nonis. ``It just so happens
we have to move it up a year now.'' The Canucks will generate quite
a bit of interest by having Swedish twins Henrik and Daniel Sedin,
the top two picks in the 1999 draft, on the roster this season . .
. One final thought on DiPietro. It's refreshing to see an
18-year-old so well-spoken, thoughtful, and cooperative and who
handles the attention so graciously. Though DiPietro credits those
who have come before as examples he's followed, there are people in
the league a whole lot older who could learn something from his
example . . . 39 days to training camp.

DOOR TO HALL A LITTLE WIDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio did not make it on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Joe DiMaggio who, 15 years after his
inexplicable rejection from the Baseball Hall of Fame, was named
``The Greatest Living Ballplayer'' by the same sort of people, one
presumes, who couldn't see clear to put him into the Hall on the
first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Do not expect to find any easy answers when
the question is ``Why is/isn't so-and-so in the Hall of Fame?''
</P>
<P>
   The actual process is not difficult. Eligible members of the
Baseball Writers' Association of America receive a ballot listing
eligible players (last year there were 30). A voter may vote for as
many as 10. If no candidates appear worthy, the voter signs a blank
ballot and returns it to BBWAA secretary-treasurer Jack O'Connell.
It is not like football, for which a 36-member committee meets
Super Bowl week with a mandate to select a minimum of four
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The process may not be difficult, but the decision certainly is.
Whereas once the standards used to decide the worthiness of the
candidates were ludicrously high _ Joe DiMaggio not a first-ballot
Hall of Famer? _ the standards that have evolved have created a
Hall of Fame that includes many players the hard markers among us
feel are unworthy of the honor. Once the damage (if that is the
proper word) has been done, a decision must be made. When presented
with a ``borderline'' Hall of Fame candidate, do I adhere to the
current standards? Or do I arbitrarily raise the bar in a haughty,
perhaps even quixotic, show of defiance?
</P>
<P>
   A truly caring voter agonizes when presented with the ballot.
Anointing someone as a Baseball Hall of Famer means you are
changing his life. Isn't that silly, when you think about it? Is
Tony Perez a better player, or, more important, a better person,
than he was nine months ago? We know better. He was a fine player,
and he has always been an honorable and much-respected man. He's no
different now than he was in 1999, '89, or '79. But now he's a
certified Hall of Famer. He has increased stature, and, as he will
soon learn, access to more income.
</P>
<P>
   Does he really belong? Well, sure, if you compare him with the
likes of Billy Williams, Willie Stargell, Duke Snider, Jim
Bottomley, Earle Combs, Rick Ferrell, Elmer Flick, Chuck Klein,
Billy Herman, Harry Hooper, George Kell, Fred Lindstrom, Dave
Bancroft, Jess Haines, Eppa Rixey, Red Schoendienst, and Ross
Youngs, the last 14 of whom were chosen by the controversial
Veterans' Committee after being continually rejected by the
writers. But was he ``great,'' in the sense that Lou Gehrig and
George Sisler were ``great?'' He was not.
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Hall of Fame has major gradations, and I mean
major. It's a big drop from Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Christy Mathewson,
and Rogers Hornsby to George Kelly, Chick Hafey, Jim Bunning and,
yes, Tony Perez. And speaking of Hornsby, did you know that the
righthanded hitter with the highest career batting average of all
time (.358) did not make it on the first ballot, either? You want
to talk about strict constructionists.
</P>
<P>
   Although some pine for those type of Good Old Voting Days,
they're not coming back. We have a very inclusionary Hall of Fame,
and as a result we have any number of borderline candidates who
fall under the category of ``If him, why not him?'' Usually, there
is no good answer.
</P>
<P>
   There is much confusion concerning the voting process. Do not,
for example, put any credence in the idea that Perez was being
``snubbed'' or ``overlooked'' during his first nine years on the
ballot because he was a Latin American. He said during his
acceptance speech that he hopes the door is now open for such
fellow Latins as Tony Oliva, Luis Tiant, Dave Concepcion, and
Minnie Minoso.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bogus issue. Each man's case is different. Injuries
greatly restricted Oliva's career. As for the other two, it just so
happens that I, for one, vote for Tiant and Concepcion every year,
and will continue to do so as long as each is on the ballot. Looie
needs no intros around here, and I maintain Concepcion was the best
all-around shortstop between World War II and Ozzie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   As for Minoso, he is one of my two main personal crusades (Bill
Mazeroski being the other). Minoso, a dark-skinned Cuban, didn't
get to spend a full season in the bigs until 1951, when he was 28.
(He played nine games with the Indians in 1949.) He then batted
better than .300 seven times while scoring more than 100 runs four
times, driving in more than 100 four times, leading the league in
triples three times, stolen bases three times, doubles once, and
hits once. He was a noted scrapper and hustler whose presence
energized teams.
</P>
<P>
   His is a criminal omission, and shame on my fellow voters for
allowing his name to languish on the ballot for 15 years without
enough people doing the requisite homework.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is half-right. Heritage has everything to do with Minoso
not being in. Had he been allowed to play before age 28, he'd have
put up tremendous career numbers. He should not be forgotten. But
people didn't go past his name because they were racists. It's
because they were intellectually lazy.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to the Veterans' Committee to do the right thing for
a man who was a victim of history and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   It took Perez nine years to get in because he did not have a
compelling case; that's why. It's why Jim Rice is not in and Bert
Blyleven is not in and our friend Luis Tiant is not in. They have
interesting cases. They do not have open-and-shut cases, like, say,
Ted Williams, Bob Feller, or George Brett.
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned that there were 30 names on last year's ballot. In
my judgment, 11 of them have absolutely no business being there.
You may look at the same list and decide to increase or decrease
that number by one or two, but I'd bet we'd be in general
agreement. After that, let the arguments begin!
</P>
<P>
   I could make a devil's advocate case for all of my remaining 19
possibilities. I could make a strong devil's advocate case for 12
(Blyleven, Gary Carter, Concepcion, Carlton Fisk, Tommy John, Jim
Kaat, Jack Morris, Dale Murphy, Perez, Rice, Bruce Sutter, and
Tiant). In the end, I voted for Carter, Concepcion, Fisk, Rice, and
Tiant. Notice I did not vote for Perez. I trust this doesn't make
me a bad person.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult, and it will get even harder next year when Don
Mattingly, Kirby Puckett, Dave Stewart, Lou Whitaker, and Dave
Winfield are newcomers to the ballot. I'd say that Puckett and
Winfield should be considered locks. Then again, no one has ever
been unanimous. DiMaggio was made to wait in the corner for a year.
And someone once voted for Terry Puhl. I have enough trouble
explaining me, let alone someone who would waste a precious vote on
Terry Puhl.

<P>
   With free agency, an intriguing trade proposal never entirely
fades from memory. A three-way deal involving the Celtics, Nuggets,
and Clippers collapsed under the weight of salary and draft pick
demands that would not be met. It was unofficially pronounced dead
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But a proposed deal sending free agent guards Tariq Abdul-Wahad
to the Celtics and Derek Anderson to the Nuggets could still be
alive. Depending on where much-talked-about free agent forward
Austin Croshere goes (Toronto) or stays (Indiana), the Raptors
might enter the Celtics-Nuggets dealings. (``I think Toronto may be
involved after they're done with Croshere and people like that,''
said Celtics coach and president Rick Pitino Friday. ``Maybe (the
Raptors) would be brought into the equation.'') If Croshere does
not end up in Toronto, the Raptors would make an appealing
under-the-cap partner in a possible deal. Resuscitation efforts
started Friday and continue.
</P>
<P>
   The odd lifecycle of the proposed three-way trade illustrates
the difficulty of deal-making in the NBA. For a team with no cap
room like the Celtics (and the majority of NBA franchises), a
successful deal must satisfy a number of interests and
basketball/business philosophies. Some teams balk at paying the
luxury tax that comes into play for the 2001-2002 season. Some
teams prefer stocking draft picks. Some teams choose not to take
action until key free agents are settled, diminishing the risk of
overpaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any deal that you do, unless you're talking about two players
straight up _ which means that their salaries are within 15 percent
and $100,000 of each other and their contracts are roughly the same
_ there are stumbling blocks because each team has its own rules
that it operates under,'' said Celtics general manager Chris
Wallace. ``Putting a whole group's interests together, several
parties in one, is tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Team presidents, general managers, player personnel directors,
and coaches spend much of the free agency period _ which ends
Tuesday _ recruiting players and talking on the phone, trying to
find out where teams stand and what their options are. Boston-based
agent Mike Martin contends that any multiteam deal is difficult to
complete because the teams, players, and agents all hear different
news that sways their decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really happens is by the time you get to what you're
being told, so many other things are happening,'' said Martin, who
represents Fall River's Chris Herren, a player involved in the
original Celtics-Nuggets-Clippers proposal. ``The bottom line is
everybody says it's easy to match up dollars, but that's tough to
do. How do you speculate what a Derek Anderson's going to make or
get in the free agency market. If people are putting numbers
together, it's all speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Celtics' front office will go after a player it
covets, deal-makers Pitino and Wallace are restricted financially
by future league stipulations, like the luxury tax, and current
rules regarding exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   A tax system goes into effect in the 2001-02 season. At the end
of next season, the NBA will derive a figure (estimated to be in
the low $50 million range) from auditing the league's books. If a
team salary exceeds that figure, it will pay a ``dollar for
dollar'' tax or luxury tax to the league for the amount it exceeds
the figure.
</P>
<P>
   Teams such as the Mavericks and Trail Blazers seem to view the
luxury tax as the cost of winning. But the Celtics and many other
franchises do not want to pay the luxury tax, avoiding long-term
contracts that could push them dangerously close to the anticipated
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's monumental because we have a budget to live by,''
said Pitino. ``There are so many things out there that we would
like. (The budget) stopped us from signing Danny Fortson. It
stopped us from offering and going out of character for Ron Mercer
back when. We have a budget we live by and we stick by it to stay
away from this tax. The luxury tax is just not something we'll get
into . . . Our owners are adamant against paying a luxury tax and
we realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of their NBA brethren, the Celtics have the
league-allowed exemptions, a salary slot at $2.25 million and
another at $1.2 million. Unless they can come to terms on a
three-way deal involving a team under the cap, the Celtics must
wait for players to filter down to their level. Not an appealing
option for a power broker like Pitino who is bent on action.
(``There are about five or six teams in the league that'll pull the
trigger,'' said Pitino. ``We're one of them.'')
</P>
<P>
   Boston chose to reach for talent considered above the exemption
level, making shooting guards (namely Abdul-Wahad, Anderson, and
Mercer) priorities. Abdul-Wahad was already offered a $32 million
contract from the Nuggets that he turned down. But a player does
not push away $32 million and take $2.25 million so he can enjoy
winters with a view of the frozen Charles River.
</P>
<P>
   Although the admiration between Abdul-Wahad and Pitino appears
mutual, the player's agent had a much more practical outlook.
Unless Wallace ``became a magician,'' Paco Belassen thought it
would be impossible to complete a deal with only the Celtics. Time
and again, Belassen has said his client will not settle for the
exception, believing Abdul-Wahad is worth approximately $5 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   As Tuesday draws closer, agents are more apt to consider all
scenarios open to their clients. Tony Dutt set Tuesday as the date
he will discuss options with his client Anderson. At the start of
the month, the best case Dutt envisioned was a sign and trade,
allowing the Clippers to explore opportunities. Now, Dutt is no
longer content to wait, reasoning that if Anderson must play for
the exemption, it should be on a team such as Miami or San Antonio,
which are said to have cap room in 2001-2002. Dutt does not want
his player left out in the cold, an exemption player on a team that
will not provide a good fit or delayed payday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world with the new collective bargaining agreement,
free agency is not really what it says,'' said Dutt. ``You have to
be under the cap to even make a run (at a player) and there's very
few teams under the cap because of the fact they go over the cap to
sign their guys. So the teams that are really taking care of their
guys are the teams that don't have any money. You have to be
prepared to make some hard decisions at some point. We knew all
along that a sign and trade could be difficult because it means
everybody's got to be happy and that's not an easy thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Players like Grant Hill, Tim Duncan, and Tracy McGrady are the
few lucky free agents. They agreed to deals early (Hill and McGrady
heading to Orlando and Duncan remaining in San Antonio). When the
negotiating period started July 1, it was a seller's market.
</P>
<P>
   As the final week of July passes, free agents face a buyer's
market. Some teams ask themselves, ``Why overpay now when players
might take less later?'' But it can be a risky strategy when most
free agents have more than one suitor and some franchises will meet
money or year demands.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the decision on deals often rests with the team
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some owners, this is a hobby for them and they'll throw
money around,'' said Martin. ``Other ones run a tighter business
and they worry about the bottom line. If that's the case, that's
why I think trades like this (Celtics-Nuggets-Clipper) seem like
they're getting done and they don't get done. It's usually because
everybody involved up until that point who is a decision-maker has
agreed, and then you get to him (the owner) and it's, `No way.'
It's his money.''

GARBER SEES MLS AMONG ELITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS _ MLS commissioner Don Garber made an ambitious
statement during his state of the league address last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to be among the leading soccer leagues in the
world,'' Garber said. ``That dream is achievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching a typical MLS game often makes that dream seem either
far-fetched. But when D.C. United defeats Vasco da Gama of Brazil
or Newcastle United of England, the dream comes slightly more into
focus.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a feel-good time in the league, Garber is still in
the honeymoon stage of his reign, and the investors have committed
funding through 2003, despite decreasing attendance and sustaining
losses of about $50 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   And Garber, wisely, did not place a timetable on his goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be five or 10 years, or it might take 50 or 100
years,'' said Mark Noonan, the MLS executive vice president of
marketing and fan development. ``You have to think of it as a
process and we are at the beginning. That is how the investors see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The MLS is in its fifth year and is far behind the more
sophisticated leagues in England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain
_ the top five leagues in the world. But the US is fertile
territory for soccer development, and even bucolic outposts such as
Ohio are becoming home to aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a crowd of 18,212 attended the Columbus
Crew-Newcastle United exhibition at the Lamar Hunt-built Crew
Stadium. Saturday, 23,495 tickets were sold for the MLS All-Star
game. And, judging by the pre-game introductions, those fans are
knowledgeable and opinionated. Lothar Matthaus, the controversial
MetroStars defender, was almost unanimously booed by citizens whose
major tourist attractions include the Germantown culinary district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting with (Newcastle players) Alan Shearer and Duncan
Ferguson when they played Columbus, and they were knocked out about
the quality of play,'' Miami Fusion coach Ray Hudson said. ``They
had no idea it would be as good as it is. They thought it was going
to just be banging into everyone. They were genuinely impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got every right to be optimistic but we shouldn't be too
eager. It's evolving well by itself. I just hope that we can bring
in the players that can't be nurtured by the college system, the
ones with the God-given talent. We don't need any more of the
athletic-type player. We need the ones who can take your breath
away. Marco Etcheverry. Carlos Valderrama. Mamadou Diallo is like
that _ he just has that something.''
</P>
<P>
   In its mission statement, the MLS hoped to be ``competitive on
an international level'' and ``to provide affordable family
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Garber, though, has increased the stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the first time I've heard something like that from the
league,'' agent Cory Clemetson said. ``And it's important because
nobody wants to be second-best in this country, much less the No. 5
sports league.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good indication of how serious their intentions are will be
how they handle Cobi Jones's contract. If you are not going to
reward Cobi Jones who are you going to reward?''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson is hoping to gain a contract worth $1 million annually
for Jones. The league's stated maximum salary, though, is less than
$300,000, and team salary caps are $2 million for the total player
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   No other soccer league in the world has salary caps. In fact,
instead of colluding to suppress salaries, the top leagues are
spending more than ever. The recent transfer of Portguese star Luis
Figo from Barcelona cost Real Madrid $56.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though MLS owners such as Los Angeles's Phil Anschutz
could compete with the riches of Lazio and Manchester United, they
are choosing to play it safe with the MLS. Among the first steps
for the league is to build stadia such as the Crew, a $28 million
project with a capacity of 22,555.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz has unveiled plans for a $100 million, 29,000-capacity
stadium in Carson, Calif., for the Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee it will be a model not only for facilities in this
country but a model for facilities anywhere in the world,'' Garber
said.
</P>
<P>
   But building stadia and pouring money into soccer does not
guarantee success. Bolivia, for instance, has a third-world
economy, poor infrastructure and a small population, yet has
produced two of the most inspiring and successful players in the
MLS, Marco Etcheverry and Jaime Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not producing those players, but eventually we will,''
Hudson said. ``That is the type of thing that can't be rushed. You
can't create magic. That is something that can never be
manufactured. You don't know where the next (Diego) Maradona is
going to come from. George Best came from a shanty town in Ireland.
The next one (phenom) might come from El Salvador or Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming clear, though, that the creative players will not
be produced within the US system. In fact, the system appears to be
stifling creativity, discouraging individual enterprise. The US
will have athletes and goalkeepers, but creativity and skill will
have to be imported. And, until players begin capturing the
imagination, soccer will struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I graduated from college in 1987, John Kerr had gone to
Portsmouth and everyone thought it was great that he made the
team,'' Noonan said. ``A generation later, John Harkes goes to
England and is in the starting lineup for Sheffield Wednesday and
scores the goal of the year against Peter Shilton. Now you have
Kasey Keller and Claudio Reyna as important cogs on their teams.
The next generation, hopefully, will produce the best one or two
players on teams, whether it is Landon Donovan (Bayer Leverkusen)
or whoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last six years, we have had two World Cups in the US,
and a professional league which is getting better. We are sending
players like Eddie Lewis (Fulham) and Joe-Max Moore (Everton) to
Europe, but at some point players are going to want to stay home.
If we can make everything equal.''

TCU USES WEB TO WIN HEISMAN VOTES FOR LaDAINIAN TOMLINSON 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ ``He loves his momma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves his Big Uglies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, and he also loves to run.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, those three sentences pop up on your computer screen
at the launch of LaDainian Tomlinson's cyberspace home in perfect
sequence with the radio call of a 70-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatic stuff to be sure. The kind of stuff that scares up the
goose bumps on any fan of the record-setting TCU running back who
led the nation in rushing last season.
</P>
<P>
   But those same three lines are more than just the Web site intro
at www.LTfor2000.com. They are the essence of a campaign aimed at
having Tomlinson join Davey O'Brien on TCU's Heisman Trophy mantel.
\Nsubheds:THE CAMPAIGN Work on Tomlinson's 2000 Heisman bid
seemingly began moments after TCU knocked off East Carolina in
December in the Mobile Alabama Bowl. A TCU committee of four worked
diligently developing, preparing and launching Tomlinson's bid for
college football's most prestigious award.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson has been involved in every stage of the campaign,
offering suggestions and giving his blessing on each aspect. Frogs
coach Dennis Franchione also is kept aware, making sure his star
isn't spread too thin and the whole to-do doesn't become too much
of a distraction for the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's Web site has received more 5,000 visitors since the
June 30 launch, the site's organizers said, and more than 1,000
people have registered for e-mail updates. And TCU's season doesn't
start until Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione said Tomlinson's renown brings welcome attention to a
program on the upswing the past two seasons. Tomlinson's
willingness to credit his teammates, especially the offensive
linemen, keeps everyone happy.
</P>
<P>
   So the TCU machine charges ahead, not only wanting to educate
the sports world on Tomlinson's numbers _ and there are many _ but
also seeking to go beyond and humanize the 21-year-old senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know LT not just as a football player, but as
a person,'' said Trey Carmichael, TCU's assistant media relations
director. ``A big part of our Web site is to focus him off the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can pick up the paper on Sunday and see what his stats
are, but you don't know LT the person by reading the stats. We
wanted to get that smile out there; the importance of family to LT.
Granted, that won't win you the Heisman, but you could lose the
Heisman if you don't have the great background.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Peter Warrick might have lost the Heisman last
season for that reason. Warrick's arrest for grand theft in a
Florida department store raised questions about his character and
negated his on-the-field feats.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson had a legal scare last summer when he and two other
men were arrested on suspicion of marijuana possession, but the
charges were later dropped. Tomlinson, however, admitted great
embarrassment, and from that point the self-confessed mama's boy
has tried to act like an Eagle Scout.
</P>
<P>
   TCU wanted to make sure that image _ and that smile _ are the
lasting impressions on Tomlinson's Web site, the cornerstone of its
Hesiman campaign, privately financed at a cost of $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Go online and peek into ``LT's World'' to catch video
highlights, such as the 70-yard run, and sound bytes from postgame
interviews. Did you know the first time Tomlinson touched the ball
as a peewee football player, he scored a touchdown? It's in ``LT's
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallpaper your PC with pictures of No. 5 diving into the end
zone or throwing out the first pitch at The Ballpark in Arlington.
Register and receive weekly e-mail updates on Tomlinson's latest
stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Web site,'' Tomlinson said. ``I never thought I'd
have one. It is fun to show people you have a Web site. People can
keep up with me even though they don't come to games.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cyberage, Web sites are necessary to any Heisman
campaign. Purdue's Drew Brees and Virginia Tech's Michael Vick, the
preseason Heisman favorites, each have their own. Carmichael and
Victor Neil, director of new media, studied other sites and
borrowed certain facets for Tomlinson's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Brees' and Vicks', and they have a lot of stuff
dealing with football, and everybody does that,'' Tomlinson said.
``We did a great job trying to do something different. It's nice to
know I have a different Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael also contacted different media relations departments,
such as Texas, Georgia Tech, Wisconsin and Marshall, to get a
better understanding of Heisman campaigns at those schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find out what they did, to see what they did
right and what they did wrong,'' Carmichael said. ``That's why I
called schools that won the Heisman and schools that didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire campaign _ posters, billboards, bumper stickers and
mailouts, including a letter from respected sportswriter Dan
Jenkins, a TCU alumnus _ is focused to reach two groups, identified
by TCU as the media and, appropriately, the non-media _ or everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see bumper stickers on the back of cars and posters, and
it's fun to see that,'' Tomlinson said. ``You're thankful for the
support, but there's also an embarrassing side. Sometimes I'm with
my friends or a cousin and they see that stuff and make fun of it.
I don't want to seem like I'm better than anyone else, but I enjoy
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The TCU media relations office is out to blanket influential
media types at organizations such as ESPN and ``Sports
Illustrated'', as well as reporters, columnists and commentators
across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When ESPN's Chris Fowler visited Fort Worth recently to film a
promo spot at Amon Carter Stadium, Carmichael arranged a lunch
meeting with Tomlinson. The purpose: the host of ``College
GameDay'' and the Heisman hopeful have a history. It might lead to
an on-air personal anecdote. \Nsubheds:THE RESULT All the bells and
all the whistles won't mean a thing if Tomlinson doesn't get it
done on the field and the Frogs fail to fulfill their promising
season.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson probably needs to rush for at least 2,000 yards to
have a shot at the Heisman _ as long as TCU finishes 9-2 or better
in their last Western Athletic Conference season.
</P>
<P>
   ``LaDainian has been told this many times,'' Carmichael said,
``you can't win the Heisman if your team isn't any good.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to take the boffo combo of stats and team ranking for
Tomlinson to nose out the likes of Brees, Vick and others. But that
doesn't mean it can't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson rushed for 1,850 yards last season and set an all-time
single-game Division I-A record with 406 yards against UT-El Paso.
The Frogs are a certain preseason top 25 pick in the major polls _
they are in every preseason magazine _ and their schedule has a
cake walk quality.
</P>
<P>
   If all falls into place, TCU hopes to see Tomlinson at least
invited to the New York Downtown Athletic Club in December. But if
Tomlinson isn't a Heisman finalist, it doesn't mean the campaign
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to show that LaDainian is very typical of the kind
of student we have here at TCU,'' said Kelli Horst, TCU's director
of communications. ``This is LT the person, behind the helmet. We
are all very proud of him and that pride is fostered throughout
campus.''
</P>
<P>
   And like Tomlinson's smile, that can't be bought or taken away.

PROTESTS START ON EVE OF REPUBLICAN EVENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Kelly Carlisle of Houston joined thousands of
demonstrators Saturday in a campaign almost as well organized as
the Republican National Convention they are protesting.
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle was among those rallying near the Liberty Bell for
tougher gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters placed thousands of shoes in Independence Park
before starting a silent march to send a message to Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the expected Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a governor that wants to be president,'' Carlisle
said. ``Texans need to make our voices heard.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention starts Monday, but several demonstrations were
held over the weekend, including an anti-abortion rally at a
Planned Parenthood clinic and a health care march through an area
called Center City that drew about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have planned events throughout the week on a variety
of issues, such as gun violence, abortion rights, poverty, health
care and corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the demonstrators have united under an umbrella group
called the R2K Network. The leaders of R2K are the same
anti-government organizers who coordinated demonstrations during
the world trade talks in Seattle last year and in Washington this
spring, when hundreds were arrested near the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinators say demonstrators have agreed to a nonviolence
pact. They plan to use marches, rallies and other peaceful
disruptions, like sit-ins and human blockades, to draw attention to
their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers concede, however, that some may stray from
nonviolence. If so, police say they are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are security experts that think we're not
prepared,'' said Philadelphia police Commissioner John Timoney. ``I
beg to differ. I think we can handle whatever comes our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two animal rights activists were detained Saturday after police
found them at a gas station with a rental truck filled with manure.
Police said the men planned to dump it at the First Union Center,
where the convention is being held. Officers had to release them
because they had not committed a crime, however.
</P>
<P>
   Another man was arrested for possession of a device that could
launch potatoes. Police described the device as a weapon and said
the man could face unspecified criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said his 7,000 officers have been trained to keep their
tempers in check. Although any violence will be dealt with swiftly,
he said, civil disobedience will be handled with what he called an
``understanding of the philosophical underpinnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Timoney denies that his department is bent on using tear gas on
crowds. That would happen only if there is an ``extreme''
situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With tens of thousands of hits on its member organizations'
Internet sites each month, the R2K Network has had little trouble
organizing what one site says will be the ``shenanigans'' in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   One site gives tips on what protesters should bring _ sleeping
bags, bowls, utensils and water jugs. Helpful hints include using
sunscreen lotion sparingly because it can trap pepper spray in skin
pores.
</P>
<P>
   A contingency of lawyers is on standby to help protesters who
are arrested. And a group of legal observers will be at each
demonstration to watch for improper arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The city issued permits for the weekend events. But political
observers and thousands of journalists will be watching Monday as
the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, the city's largest advocacy
group for the poor and homeless, marches without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney said his department has tried to reach a compromise with
members of the group, promising them safe escort if they use
sidewalks, which do not require a permit.

Long before Web sites, TCU's Swink almost connected with Heisman

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram Frogs Fab Four Four TCU players have finished in the top five in
Heisman voting. TCU quarterback Sam Baugh had his greatest
collegiate season in 1935, the first year of the Heisman, but
players west of the Mississippi weren't eligible to win the award.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There were no Web sites to update, no ESPN highlights to
overnight, no goofy publicity pictures to arrange. When TCU
halfback Jim Swink made his 1955 run for the Heisman Trophy, he did
so on the momentum of his incredible statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really push him,'' recalled Jim ``Hoss'' Brock,
former TCU sports information director. ``He came out of nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Swink gave hints of his greatness as a sophomore in 1954,
reeling off touchdown runs of 79, 67 and 68 yards. But, with a
powerful team returning and a plethora of stars, few outside the
TCU coaching staff knew what the Frogs had.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 80-yard touchdown run early in the 1955 opener vs.
Kansas. Three weeks later came the three touchdowns in a 21-0 upset
of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   And on and on Swink ran.
</P>
<P>
   In a 47-20 whipping of Texas, Swink ran for 235 yards on 15
carries and scored four times.
</P>
<P>
   He led the nation in scoring (125 points) and yards per carry
(8.1). He was second nationally in rushing with 1,283 yards for a
9-1 team that won the Southwest Conference and finished No. 6 in
the final Associated Press poll. It was almost enough to land him
the Heisman, but ``The Rusk Rambler'' was edged out by Ohio State
running back Howard ``Hopalong'' Cassady, who ran for 958 yards and
15 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still say he had the best balance and vision of any running
back I've ever seen,'' Brock said. ``He could see the whole field.
And anybody hitting him high he would shake them like a bowl of
jelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Swink's amazing junior season prompted Brock to mount a
``pull-out-all-the-stops'' publicity campaign for the 1956 season,
much like TCU is doing this year for senior LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Brock beefed up the TCU media guide from a 55-page
mimeographed handout to a full-fledged brochure with a cover photo
of Swink and three-page story on him inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to the chancellor's office and told him I need to
put out a fancy book. He said, `What's it going to cost?' I said I
think it'll cost $1,200. He said, `You've got $1,500 and don't
spend a penny more or you'll be looking for work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brock, who helped get Swink on the cover of ``Sports
Illustrated'' and almost every preseason football magazine that
year, went to work getting the name of every prominent college
football writer so he could mail them weekly updates each Sunday
night. But the publicity didn't get Swink into Heisman contention.
</P>
<P>
   TCU used a more balanced offensive attack co-starring halfback
Ken Wineburg to counteract defenses targeting Swink. He still led
the conference in rushing but broke few of the long runs that had
become his trademark a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody set up their defense to stop him,'' Brock said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as TCU's opponents undoubtedly will try to do against LT.

THE STATS DON'T LIE AT HEISMAN TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the statistics, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy campaigns do not win the Heisman Trophy. The
player who winds up clutching college football's most famous trophy
in the Downtown Athletic Club in December typically has the numbers
_ statistics, victories _ to back up his election. Winning the
Heisman these days requires more steak than sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it should be; you should be rewarded for
performance,'' said Wisconsin sports information director Steve
Malchow, who staged a low-key campaign for 1999 Heisman winner Ron
Dayne. ``You don't win with a unique campaign. You win being a
productive player on a productive team.''
</P>
<P>
   For TCU's LaDainian Tomlinson to make a serious run at the
Heisman, he needs to have the numbers, and the Frogs need to have a
nearly perfect season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many good quarterbacks on too many good teams,''
said Don Borst, a senior college writer with CBS Sportsline.com.
``TCU probably has to go 12-0, and he'll have to get more than
2,000 yards and lead the nation in rushing for him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   There might be debate about whether the Heisman consistently
goes to the best college player, but the numbers rarely mislead in
the Heisman balloting. The past 10 years, the Heisman winner has
either been among the statistical leaders at his position or played
for a national championship contender. Those 10 Heisman winners
played for teams that averaged a won-loss record of 10-2.
</P>
<P>
   For running backs such as Tomlinson, numbers are even more
important. Of the past 10 Heisman-winning running backs, Eddie
George finished the lowest on the rushing charts (fifth in 1995).
Six of those Heisman winners won the rushing title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to wow people,'' said Rick Campbell, the
NCAA's football statistician. ``Barry Sanders was like that. His
numbers were so staggering. After just two or three games, he was
the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Heisman campaigns have evolved into
noncampaigns. Sports-information directors have discovered that
with so many information streams flowing there is no need to
publicize a player with good ``highlights'' and no way to hide a
player who isn't performing.
</P>
<P>
   Clever campaigns have had little effect on Heisman voters. Notre
Dame sports-information director Roger Valdiserri advised his
quarterback to change the pronunciation of his name to rhyme with
the trophy. Joe ``Thees''man became Joe ``Theis''man ... and
finished second in the 1970 Heisman voting to Jim Plunkett.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State tried to promote offensive tackle Orlando Pace for
the 1996 Heisman. They sent out refrigerator magnets that resembled
a stack of pancakes. The idea was to link Pace and the ``pancake''
blocks for which he was becoming famous. A good try, but Pace
couldn't keep pace with Danny Wuerffel, Troy Davis and Jake
Plummer, who finished 1-2-3 in the Heisman voting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington State publicists kept it simple in 1997. They mailed
envelopes containing a single leaf to remind voters to consider
Cougars quarterback Ryan Leaf. He finished third behind Charles
Woodson and Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win with performance,'' Malchow said. ``There's a real
bond between team success and the player having a good year.''

HISPANICS, WOMEN, BLACKS HAVE HIGHLY VISIBLE POSTS FOR GOP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LETITIA STEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Hoping to present an image of diversity, Republicans
have named Hispanics, blacks and women to highly visible posts for
this week's GOP National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Henry Bonilla of San Antonio, Jennifer Dunn of Washington
state and J.C. Watts of Oklahoma will serve as deputy permanent
chairs of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two other Texans _ Railroad Commission member Tony
Garza and Dallas businessman Alphonso Jackson _ were named
assistant secretaries for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments are part of a continuing effort by Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush to counter images lingering
from his appearance at a conservative Christian college during the
South Carolina primary campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see a convention that is more the softer side
of the conservative image than you usually see from Republicans,''
Dunn said, referring to the Republican effort to appeal to women
and minorities during the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, like Bonilla and Watts, is more than window-dressing. She
prides herself on being one of the more visible members of
Congress. Dunn made history as the first woman to run for a top
leadership post with her 1998 challenge against Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Irving, for House Majority Leader.
</P>
<P>
   Although she lost that bid, Dunn led many GOP initiatives,
including her recent work to repeal a tax penalty on married
couples.
</P>
<P>
   She got involved in the Bush campaign in its early stages and
considers the Texas governor a ``soul mate'' in how he addresses
national problems. She also supports his efforts to reach out to
voters who have not been aligned with the Republican Party in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla's relationship with Bush goes back to the days before he
ran for governor in 1994. Bush campaigned in San Antonio to help
win his first election to Congress in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bonilla was among those who urged Bush to seek
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that our party really needed someone like him, who
understood the importance of reaching out and communicating to
every ethnic group,'' said Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   When Bonilla came to Washington in early 1993, he was the first
Hispanic Republican elected to Congress from Texas. He has served
on the House Appropriations Committee since his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   Watts has always been known as a team player, from his days as
star quarterback for the University of Oklahoma Sooners to his
current role as co-chairman of the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my real lessons in life have come from, I think,
understanding the team concept,'' he said. ``In the team concept,
you're never concerned about who gets the glory and who gets the
credit. You're just concerned that the team wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his election to Congress in 1994, Watts has championed the
Community Renewal Project, a measure that aims to revitalize poor
communities by helping citizens invest in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Watts became the fourth-highest ranking Republican in
the House with his election to chairman of the House Republican
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Watts also spoke at the 1996 Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   Garza was elected to the Railroad Commission in 1998, the first
Hispanic Republican to hold statewide office. Garza served as
Bush's secretary of state from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, an African-American and native of Dallas, has been a
Republican for the past 25 years. A member of the Texas Southern
University Board of Regents, Jackson is president of the American
Electric Power Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP convention secretary is Linda Shaw, a North Carolina
Republican. &QL;

CUNNINGHAM ACCEPTS BACKUP ROLE WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Settling in more and more as Troy
Aikman's backup with the Cowboys, Randall Cunningham maintains an
inner peace that almost defies what he is capable of doing with a
football held majestically in his right hand, even at age 37.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the timing down with the receivers yet,'' said
Cunningham, who will make his Cowboys debut tonight against the
Pittsburgh Steelers in a preseason opener at Texas Stadium. ``I'm
still about one or two feet off on the timing routes right now. It
all takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing routes? There was a time when a much younger Randall
Cunningham, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, couldn't _ or
wouldn't _ stay in the pocket. He didn't become the NFL's all-time
leading rusher at quarterback (4,799 yards) by being a dropback
passer all his life.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point about Cunningham, who passed over Tampa Bay and
Detroit to sign with the Cowboys a week after his June 1 release
from Minnesota. He is willing to learn on the run, even in his 15th
NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't just grow old. He evolves.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want him to be the quarterback who makes opposing
defensive coordinators devise two distinctly different games plans:
one for Aikman and another for Cunningham, just in case he comes
into a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a `set plan' for Randall in a lot of
ways,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said. ``But, at the same time, we
want him to learn the offense and be effective \Rwith what Aikman
runs\S as well.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sense that Cunningham is cramming off the field (he
has the Cowboys' new numbering system down pat) but that he is
taking it one throw at a time on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Randall is just about where I thought he would be,''
Campo said, ``but not where I think he will be when the season
rolls around'' Sept. 3 vs. Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham could play several series tonight. Much depends on
how many series it takes Aikman and the first-team offense to get
in their 10 snaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get totally comfortable with the Vikings, it took me about
a year and a half,'' said Cunningham, who joined Minnesota in 1997
and was the NFL's MVP a year later, when he replaced an injured
Brad Johnson in Week 2. He ended up passing for 3,704 and 34
touchdowns against only 10 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always harder on myself than anyone else is,'' Cunningham
said.
</P>
<P>
   His signature easygoing smile and total acceptance of his role
as Aikman's backup make him a pleasant addition in the eyes of
coaches and teammates alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm past the stage where I get really frustrated or where it
becomes overwhelming,'' he said. ``I'm at the point now that I
learn from my mistakes and I'm thankful for what I've done.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hole in Cunningham's rsum is a Super Bowl, something
that he hopes can come with the Cowboys. It's much easier for
Cunningham, 3 1/2 years Aikman's senior, to sit behind someone who
owns three more Super Bowl rings than he does.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham was supposed to be in the second year of a five-year,
$28 million contract with the Vikings right now. He signed that
deal in December 1998. But six games into the '99 season (2-4),
Vikings coach Denny Green benched Cunningham and turned to his
backup, Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   When Green committed to second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper
during the off-season, Cunningham declined to have his contract
reworked without a chance to be a starter again. He did stay around
long enough to collect a $1 million roster bonus on March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's working with the Cowboys' second group of receivers _
Chris Brazzell, Wane McGarity and Jason Tucker _ trying to get his
timing down in this Jack Reilly offense.
</P>
<P>
   The whole concept is new to Cunningham. Neither at Philadelphia
(1985-95) nor at Minnesota (1997-99) did he get work in a
timing-route offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're late with the ball here, you definitely can throw an
interception,'' Cunningham warned. ``Troy has the system down. I'm
still adjusting to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham is 79-50-1 in his career as an NFL starter, including
8-4 against the Cowboys. In his last appearance at Texas Stadium _
Thanksgiving Day 1998 _ he threw for 359 yards and four touchdowns
in a 46-36 Vikings victory.
</P>
<P>
   After all of Cunningham's seasons as a Cowboys nemesis, it will
be understandable if it takes awhile for fans to get used to
rooting for No. 7 _ even if he is wearing a star on his helmet.

TEAM SUCCESS GIVES PITCHER FINE SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Jim Parque was sitting in the clubhouse
working on a crossword puzzle before a recent game when a teammate
sat down beside him and tried to help.
</P>
<P>
   Parque's Chicago White Sox teammates are giving him plenty of
help on the field, too, making him confident there won't be a
repeat of his 1999 second-half slide and giving the left-hander a
chance to establish a career high for wins when he starts today's
series finale against the Angels at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Six years removed from his days as a standout at Crescenta
Valley High near Los Angeles and three years after the White Sox
drafted him out of UCLA, Parque is 9-4 with a 3.95 ERA for the team
with the best record in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, the key is we're all playing as a team and pulling for
each other,'' Parque said. ``We've pretty much eliminated every
stat except the one that goes on the scoreboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Parque went 9-6 in the first half of 1999 but was 0-9 with four
no-decisions in his final 13 starts. He calls the numbers
deceiving, because many of the runs he gave up were unearned. His
teammates scored more than two runs for him just twice.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the team's record as proof that he wasn't the only
one suffering in the second half. Although the White Sox remained
in second place, they dropped from 12 games back at the end of June
to 21 games back and 11 games under .500 by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anything different this year,'' Parque said.
``Last year, the second half, the media really blows it out of
proportion. . . . In most of those games, I didn't give up a lot of
runs. If you look at my ERA, it was below the American League
average. But the team didn't play as well. There were a lot of
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Chicago is the team with the large lead in the AL
Central and flirting with the best record in the majors, so Parque
isn't feeling the need to do everything himself even though the
White Sox defense again ranks among the league's worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me personally, the key is just keeping an even keel,''
Parque said. ``Last year was up and down. The key is just not to
really worry if something goes wrong behind me and not get too high
or too low.''
</P>
<P>
   Parque, 24, has had plenty of highs in his career. After an All-
American junior season in which he helped UCLA reach the College
World Series, Parque was the only White Sox player selected in the
1997 draft to play above the Single-A level that year. He was in
Triple-A by the end of 1997 and in the majors the following May.
</P>
<P>
   He is on track for his first season with an ERA less than 5.00
as well as improving other stats, but with this year's team-first
attitude Parque almost didn't notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking over my stats the other day,'' he said. ``It was
the first time it dawned on me that I was doing better than last
year. I know things have been going well, but I wasn't really
paying attention to my own stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you play for a better team, you can't help but do
better. This team has surprised a lot of people and the success
comes from being a total team.''

REPUBLICANS CONFIDENT AS CONVENTION NEARS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALAN BERNSTEIN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The city will break ground soon on a new downtown
pavilion to house the Liberty Bell.
</P>
<P>
   A few neighborhoods away, the Republican Party will embark on a
grand restoration project of its own.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP wants its 37th annual national convention, which starts
Monday, to help restore a Republican to the presidency after eight
years of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In the last half-century, two Republican presidents have served
two complete four-year terms: Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan.
But in the same period, Clinton is the only Democrat to keep the
presidency out of the opposition's hands for that long.
</P>
<P>
   And, to the compounded frustration of his foes, Clinton did it
with less than 50 percent of the national vote in both elections
when independent candidate Ross Perot siphoned votes away from the
leading contenders.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican victory in the November election would also restore
the Bush name to eminence.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP will use its convention to nominate Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, son of the president beaten by Clinton in 1992. President
Bush, who has never matched Reagan as an inspirational giant of his
party, will be officially honored at the convention. He will also
have the chance to watch in person as his son officially accepts a
slot on the national ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican ticket offers to restore Bush's running mate,
Dick Cheney, to familiar turf, too. Cheney was chief of staff for
President Ford. Later he was a Republican congressional leader and,
under President Bush, secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   With Perot out of the picture and this year's alternative
candidates posing less of a threat in the early polls, Republicans
are gleefully eyeing voter-survey numbers. They show Bush leading
the Democratic pick, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in my memory have we been so united on the eve of
a great election,'' Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson told
national party leaders here. ``We are almost at the mountain top.''
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, the vantage point Nicholson has in mind is a
mirror image of the 1988 election. The vice president, Republican
George Bush, vied to succeed a two-term president, Reagan, against
a challenger-governor, Democrat Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts.
Now Gore is in the elder Bush role and the younger Bush is in the
Dukakis role.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that now it's the challenger's turn to win. Gore
says the Bush ticket will take the country back to failed policies
of the Republican past.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it's part of a familiar plot, the four-day
performance here is designed to be unfamiliar.
</P>
<P>
   In line with Bush's ``compassionate conservative'' pitch, party
leaders have drafted a platform that softens the built-in
Republican opposition to government.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the platform that will be submitted to the
delegates for approval Monday drops the long-running call for the
U.S. Department of Education to be dismantled. It also says,
``There should be a strong federal role in environmental
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the platform does not dilute the party's opposition
to abortion. Delegates are expected to preserve the platform plank
that calls for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the platform committee rejected efforts by the Bush
campaign to remove a provision calling for elimination of school
counseling programs that tell students about birth control and
other forms of family planning. Instead, the committee said,
schools should teach only sexual abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   On the convention stage at the Comcast-Spectator First Union
Center, a basketball/hockey arena in south Philadelphia,
Republicans will present their version of a catchy variety show
geared toward a national television and Internet audience. House
Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois is expected to gavel the
gathering to attention from a remote location in Philadelphia _
perhaps a historical one related to the American Revolution _ while
his image is shown on the stage's video screens.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, vanquished by the Texas governor in
the Republican primaries, is a featured speaker. So are two retired
generals from the Persian Gulf War, Colin Powell and Norman H.
Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainers will include movie stars Bruce Willis and Bo Derek
and country singer Hank Williams Jr. And presentations that relate
to Bush's core issues, such as education reform, will come from
regular folks _ including minority students from KIPP Academy in
Houston and a significant number of women.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, convention planners said, is for voters to see a
punchier, friendlier, unprecedented convention that relies less on
insults against the Democrats and policy pronouncements by veteran
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the party will give at best a low-key role to
its more combative leaders, such as House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
of Texas, and more divisive approaches to issues, such as the GOP
opposition to gun control and resistance to campaign finance
reform.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cheney will give his first major speech of the
campaign as he accepts the vice-presidential nomination. It will be
a major test for a politician who, after serving as a guiding force
in government for decades, nevertheless has yet to establish an
identity on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will deliver his acceptance speech Thursday night under the
same intense spotlight _ not only in the presence of his parents,
but at the conclusion of a convention in which his family is
elevated to near-dynasty status.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Laura, is scheduled to give a featured speech on
Monday night. His brother, Jeb, reigns as governor of Florida, a
key state in the presidential election. Jeb's 24-year-old son,
George P. Bush, will help introduce the Texas governor to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the arena will be 2,066 delegates, 2,066 alternates and
many more guests, observers and news media personnel. The cost for
the extravaganza starts at $70 million, most from corporations and
other financial backers tapped by the city of Philadelphia; some
from the Presidential Election Fund stocked by $1 check box on
federal income tax forms.

STAKES SOAR IN SUIT OVER WRESTLER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   A legal battle royal has erupted in the
case of Owen Hart, the professional wrestler who fell to his death
from the rafters of Kemper Arena last year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defendants in the negligence lawsuit filed by Hart's parents,
wife and children have accused the family's lawyers of trying to
buy off witnesses by agreeing to share with them the proceeds of
any recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The family is represented by the husband-and-wife legal team of
Gary and Anita Robb, two of the best-known personal injury lawyers
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants include the World Wrestling Federation and the
city of Kansas City, owner of Kemper Arena. They and other
defendants contend that an agreement the Robbs entered into with
some of Hart's 10 siblings amounts to witness tampering. That's
because the siblings could be key witnesses in the case but have no
right to share in any recovery under Missouri's wrongful-death
statute.
</P>
<P>
   The statute allows only the dead person's surviving parents,
wife or children to be plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs have vehemently denied any wrongdoing and have said
the agreement was nothing more than an effort to secure unity among
members of Hart's extended family. The Robbs rescinded the
agreement after the defendants uncovered it.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, the Robbs said ``nothing in the (agreement)
even hints that the signatory siblings are under any obligation to
testify falsely or evasively. It merely provides that they shall
help the plaintiffs and not help the defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs noted that the spouses of two of Hart's siblings were
under contract or associated with the WWF and might have an
interest in undermining a large settlement with the family.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs also said the WWF has been trying to reach a separate
settlement with Hart's parents, Stu and Helen Hart. That, they
said, would expunge any further claims by Hart's widow and
children, because Missouri's wrongful-death law treats all of them
_ parents, children and widow alike _ as a single class. A
settlement with one member of the class would bind the others to
the settlement amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that the WWF wants to settle this case,
preferably without involving plaintiffs' counsel, who have some
idea what it's worth, and it's perfectly willing to pull on
whatever family ties it can,'' the Robbs stated in court filings.
</P>
<P>
   The incendiary allegation of witness tampering has raised
serious ethical questions that cut to the heart of the integrity of
the judicial process. Legal experts say the charge, if proved,
could lead to disciplinary sanctions, including disbarment. It
could result, they say, in the Robbs being removed from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Legal authorities not involved in the litigation expressed
surprise at the existence of a side agreement with potential
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a remarkable document,'' said Charles Wolfram, a law
professor at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y. ``I've never heard
of anything like it _ and perhaps with good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle has been waged in documents that were sealed by
court order at the request of the Robbs, who said the agreement is
protected by attorney-client privilege and was improperly obtained
by the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star obtained a copy of the agreement from an
open file at the Missouri Court of Appeals, where the Robbs filed a
petition urging the court to bar the trial judge from unsealing the
document and to prohibit the defendants from asking the siblings
about it in depositions. The trial judge, Douglas Long Jr., had
ordered the document unsealed and authorized the defendants to
inquire about it after a hearing May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court temporarily granted the Robbs' petition July
5, pending further review.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs declined to comment on the agreement, saying the
court's order barred them from talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``About all I can tell you is that this case is about the tragic
death of Owen Hart,'' said Anita Robb. ``And from the beginning,
the WWF has tried to divert attention from their responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``...The entire Hart family deeply resents the hardball tactics
that the WWF has used against their family in this case. They've
even sued the widow and minor children for breach of contract for
filing this suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the defendants also cited the court's order and
declined to comment on the agreement with the siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs rescinded the agreement after the defendants uncovered
it, saying they didn't want it to become a ``red herring'' that
would distract from the underlying issues of the case. But the
agreement remains a bone of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, Your Honor, to have given these siblings a financial
interest in the outcome of this case and then to have tried to keep
it from the court, from my client and from myself is something that
seriously undermines the potential for a fair trial in this case,''
said Kent Sullivan, a lawyer for the riggers who helped set up
Hart's harness system, in the May 31 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Key provisions of the agreement:
</P>
<P>
   - Called for the Robbs to represent the interests of the
siblings who signed it.
</P>
<P>
   - Stated the siblings would be entitled to their ``allocable
share'' of the recovery due Hart's parents, who also signed the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   - Required the siblings to cooperate with one another _ and to
refrain from cooperating or even communicating with the defendants
_ in pursuing the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   - Provided that any siblings who cooperate with the defendants
would not share in any recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hart brothers and sisters shall cooperate with and
participate with the above-referenced counsel in all respects to
ensure and enhance the prospects of success in this legal action,''
one of the agreement's provisions stated.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Hart siblings was present when a stunt went awry and
Hart fell more than 70 feet to his death on May 23, 1999. But their
testimony could prove crucial on the key issue of how many more
years Hart planned to work as a professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how much longer Hart planned to wrestle bears on
the issue of lost earnings, which could figure prominently in any
compensatory damages awarded in the case. And because the U.S.
Supreme Court has ruled that punitive damages must bear a
reasonable relationship to compensatory damages, the question also
has a bearing on overall damages.
</P>
<P>
   After Hart's death, several Hart family members were quoted in
the media as saying Hart had planned to retire in the next year or
two, after his contract with the WWF expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs have indicated in court proceedings that they will say
Hart, who was 34 years old when he died, planned to wrestle
professionally for eight to 15 more years. At $750,000 per year,
the amount they say Hart earned, that amounts to $6 million to
$11.25 million in lost income.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the agreement with Hart's siblings smacked of
an illegal inducement of witness testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lubet, a law professor at Northwestern University in
Evanston, Ill., said that in most jurisdictions ``it would be
considered wrong to provide that sort of an agreement to a witness,
because it gives witnesses a financial interest in the outcome of
the litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   David Achtenberg, a law professor at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City School of Law, said an agreement to pay a
witness ``contingent on the witness testifying in a particular way
raises serious ethical questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Rules of Professional Responsibility specifically
state that a lawyer ``shall not ... offer an inducement to a
witness that is prohibited by law.'' In Missouri, as in most
states, that means only expert witnesses can be paid for their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfram of Cornell said the provision calling for the siblings
not to cooperate with the defendants _ without making any exception
for subpoenaed testimony _ ``is written in a way that a nonlawyer
who signs it might think he can't even speak truthfully when called
as a witness.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants only found out about the agreement with the
siblings when a copy was sent to the WWF's attorneys in Pittsburgh
by Ellie Neidhart, one of Owen Hart's sisters. Ellie Neidhart's
husband, Jim ``The Anvil'' Neidhart, used to be a WWF wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs learned that the defendants had a copy _ which was
signed by five of the siblings _ when lawyers for the WWF marked it
as an exhibit at a deposition of Owen Hart's mother, Helen Hart.
</P>
<P>
   After angry protests by the Robbs, who said the document was
protected by attorney-client privilege and should have been
returned by the WWF, Long ordered the agreement sealed. But the
WWF, intent on asking witnesses whether they had been promised any
financial interest in the case, moved for an order compelling
witnesses to answer questions about the agreement. The WWF
simultaneously asked that the agreement be unsealed.
</P>
<P>
   Long granted the WWF's motions after the May 31 hearing,
prompting the Robbs to file their petition with the Missouri Court
of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In their petition, which was filed earlier this month, the Robbs
contended the agreement simply allowed Hart's siblings ``to retain
some interest'' in the proceeds of any recovery if both parents
died before the case was resolved. That way, they said, ``they
would be less likely to be tricked into pursuing a quick and cheap
settlement by the WWF.''
</P>
<P>
   But as noted by lawyer Leonard Frischer, who represents the city
of Kansas City, the agreement did not condition the siblings'
recovery on their parents' death. Rather, the agreement stated that
the siblings would be entitled to recover ``irrespective as to
whether Stu Hart or Helen Hart, or both, may predecease the
ultimate resolution of this action.'' The agreement amounted to
witness tampering in any case, the defendants allege.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the defendants note, the agreement invoked a
nonexistent Missouri statute to justify the sharing of any damages
with the siblings. The statute in question, which had to do with
juries, was repealed in 1989. The Robbs said they mistakenly
invoked the wrong statute number, but they failed to specify what
statute they meant to invoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no statute that supports this particular kind of
agreement,'' Frischer told Long at the May 31 hearing. ``That is
bothersome (that) they would put that in this agreement _ say to
the people, `Here, sign it. Here's how we are going to do it. It is
OK under Missouri law.' But the statute doesn't exist. That is very
troublesome to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court is expected to decide soon _ possibly within
days _ whether to unseal the agreement and allow the defendants'
attorneys to pursue information about it with Hart family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to know what is going on,'' WWF attorney Craig
O'Dear told Long at the May 31 hearing. ``Otherwise it subverts the
process.''

INTERNET PICKS UP CONVENTION COVERAGE WHERE TV LEAVES OFF &HT;     

</HEADLINE>

   PHILADELPHIA _ When Republican Party activists gathered in
Philadelphia in 1948, fledgling television viewers in nine East
Coast cities fought with their rabbit ears and tuned in a fuzzy
black-and-white picture of Thomas Dewey accepting the party's
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   This week, 52 years after that first live broadcast of a
political convention changed the nature of politics and TV forever,
the GOP returns to this city. But the major TV networks have
abandoned gavel-to-gavel coverage, citing lack of viewer interest.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Justin Friedland, an Emmy-award-winning former
senior producer at ABC News' ``World News Tonight'' and ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the future,'' said Friedland, a consulting producer for
Pseudo.com, one of the first two Internet TV sites to be granted a
skybox at a political convention. ``The TV networks are getting out
of the business, and we are here. With the Internet, you can have
input into the process. It allows you to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four days, as speaker after speaker takes the
podium at the First Union Center and as GOP members argue about
whether to soften their position on abortion or gay rights, most TV
viewers will be watching sports or their favorite sit-coms,
squeezing in a political speech or two during prime time or
catching the convention highlights on late night news.
</P>
<P>
   But for those willing to dial up and log on, Internet TV sites
such as Pseudo.com and aol.com, as well as a host of other sites
run by newspapers and TV stations, independent nonprofit
organizations and the political parties themselves, will provide a
torrent of information.
</P>
<P>
   With about 150 Internet sites providing coverage of the
convention, Internet users from around the world will be able to
take a virtual tour of the convention floor, watch a Webcast and
read text on the proceedings, participate in political polls, rate
speakers' performances and voice their opinions through chat rooms
set up with convention delegates and Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can imagine CNN and MTV, combined with these
interactive features, on crack, you basically have what we're
doing. It's irreverent and fun,'' said Jeanne Meyer, senior vice
president of Pseudo.com. ``If you want something that's
couch-potato fare, turn on your TV. If you want to dive in, and if
you have any voyeuristic tendencies, this is going to be your
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet Web site, www.speakout.com, expects about 5,000
people to participate in opinion surveys as speeches are being
televised on MSNBC. The idea is to target Internet users who have a
computer in the same room as their TV.
</P>
<P>
   Political pundits interviewed on MSNBC after the speeches will
have the benefit of a sort of ``opinion EKG'' on how the speech
went over in cyberland.
</P>
<P>
   Speakout.com's Rekha Chalasani hopes the Internet coverage will
encourage more young people to get involved in politics and to vote
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have pretty low voter turnout, and part of the
reason is that people don't have a voice in the process,'' she
said. ``The Internet gives them that voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bailey, who founded The Hotline, an Internet site packed
with news geared mostly toward political junkies and the media,
agreed. Bailey, who is now president and CEO of the nonprofit
FreedomChannel.com, said he hopes to reach a wider audience by
October, when most people really begin to focus on the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, FreedomChannel will join a network of 17
organizations to create a rolling cyberdebate among the candidates
themselves (if they choose to participate), their campaigns and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone will be able to log on to any of the 17 sites to ask a
question or offer an opinion. And in the weeks preceding the Nov. 7
election, about 10 million elementary and high school students are
expected to vote online in a ``youth e-vote,'' the first, although
obviously unofficial, national test of online voting.
</P>
<P>
   Tami Buhr, research coordinator for Harvard University's Joan
Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, which
manages the Vanishing Voter Project, isn't so certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, so far, I'm kind of a pessimist,'' Buhr said. ``The
research so far shows that only about 20 percent of the electorate
has taken an interest in the campaigns, and the number of people
following politics on the Internet is still much smaller than those
getting their information from traditional news sources. So people
are not flocking to the Internet to gain information.'' &QL;

HART FAMILY LAWYERS' REPUTATION GROWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN MARGOLIES  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Gary and Anita Robb have built one of
the most successful personal injury practices in Kansas City, often
taking on corporate giants and besting them in court.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The husband-and-wife legal team, both graduates of the
University of Michigan School of Law, established Robb &AMP; Robb in
1984. Three years later, they won their first million-dollar jury
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Robbs have won at least a half-dozen
multimillion dollar verdicts or settlements for their clients.
Among them:
</P>
<P>
   - A $20 million jury verdict in March 1991 on behalf of an
11-year-old Kansas City girl who came out of minor surgery blinded
and permanently brain-damaged. A Missouri law capping medical
malpractice awards limited the recovery to about $3 million. The
award eventually was reduced to $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   - A $70 million jury verdict in 1995 on behalf of a patient
killed in the crash of a LifeFlight helicopter in 1993. An appeals
court later reduced the award to $29 million and the defendant,
Turbomeca SA of France, eventually paid the patient's family $39.2
million. Evidence at trial indicated that Turbomeca, the
helicopter's manufacturer, knew a defective engine part could cause
the helicopters to crash.
</P>
<P>
   - A $350 million jury verdict in 1995 _ at the time thought to
be one of the biggest product liability verdicts in U.S. history _
on behalf of the pilot of the LifeFlight helicopter. An appeals
court later reduced the award to $30 million. With interest, the
total paid came to $40.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   - A $14 million pretrial settlement in 1997 on behalf of the
mother of 14-year-old Ryan Sayles, who was dragged and crushed to
death when his clothing snagged in the handrail of a school bus
door.
</P>
<P>
   - A $25 million jury verdict in 1998 on behalf of the family of
Jackson County Circuit Judge Michael Coburn, a neighbor of the
Robbs who died after he fell into a pit while inspecting a
dangerous building.
</P>
<P>
   - A $23.4 million verdict last December on behalf of the
families of Cecil and Tracy Stowers, who were killed along with
their infant daughter by a drunken driver on Christmas Day 1998.
The defendant, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison in a
separate criminal proceeding, isn't thought to have had the
insurance to cover the award.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs prefer to go it alone. They are the only lawyers in
their firm, although they employ several paralegals. Typically, the
defendants they sue are represented by big law firms, often chosen
by defendants' insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs live in one of Kansas City's biggest houses, a mansion
at the southwest corner of 55th Street and Ward Parkway that was
built by lumber baron M.B. Nelson in 1915 and that is valued by
Jackson County at $3 million. The Robbs frequently host parties and
fund-raisers at the house for charitable causes such as the Kansas
City Ballet and for political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs are active in Democratic Party politics and are major
donors to Democratic candidates at the local, state and national
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Robbs recently underwrote the cost of a technology center at
the downtown headquarters of the Kansas City Metropolitan Bar
Association. The center, known as the Robb &AMP; Robb Technology
Center, provides association members and staff with technology
training and includes a classroom, seminar room, exhibitor area and
other space.

   ANAHEIM _ There is no mistaking the power in the Anaheim Angels'
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With 172 home runs, they have already eclipsed last season's
total of 158 and are on pace to smash the club record of 192.
Furthermore, the Halos have a legitimate shot of becoming the first
team in major-league history to have five players hit 30 or more
round-trippers.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus took over the Angels' lead Saturday with his 31st
homer, followed by Garret Anderson's 30, Mo Vaughn's 26, Tim
Salmon's 22 and Darin Erstad's 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice (to be part of the group),'' Vaughn said. ``We are
going to keep swinging and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   To set the mark, the Angels will have to beat the Toronto Blue
Jays to the punch. The Blue Jays are also on pace to have five
players hit more than 30 homers, led by AL home run leader Carlos
Delgado (32) and Tony Batista (31).
</P>
<P>
   __ Leading man: Erstad has shown the mettle of a leadoff hitter
this season, leading the majors with 167 hits, 80 runs scored, 18
stolen bases and a .427 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   While he is chasing George Sislers' all-time single-season
record of 257 hits set in 1920, Erstad could become the first
major-leaguer to drive in 100-plus runs from the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   With 77 RBI _ second on the club behind Vaughn's 81 _ Erstad
needs just 22 more to surpass Boston's Nomar Garciaparra's mark of
98 in his Rookie of the Year season of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad also has the chance to break the all-time single-season
mark for homers by a leadoff hitter. Baltimore's Brady Anderson and
former San Francisco Giants great Bobby Bonds hold the record with
35.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mercker rehab: After missing more than two months
recuperating from a cerebral hemorrhage, left-hander Kent Mercker
will make his first scheduled rehab start Monday for Lake Elsinore
at Modesto.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who suffered the injury May 12 and has missed 68 days
on the disabled list, threw a simulated game earlier this week and
was originally set to make the rehab start Saturday, but it was
pushed back two days because of extended bullpen work Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is fine,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``His
velocity is great, but he is going to have some command issues that
you'd expect with a guy who has been off so long.''

ANALYSIS: SPRINT IS REWRITING GROWTH STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER and ERIC PALMER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   When Sprint Corp. Chief Executive
William T. Esrey recently sought to reassure employees that
``Sprint is not for sale,'' he briefly donned a red baseball cap
emblazoned with the slogan: ``Mapping the Future.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't clear whether the slogan was coined especially for the
event, or for the transition in the failed merger attempt with
WorldCom Inc. But the implication was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint needs a new plan, and it needs one fast.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments that regulators rejected in suing to block the
Sprint-WorldCom deal _ that the two needed to merge to compete _
were swallowed whole on Wall Street. And with prospects fading that
another company will step in quickly to buy Sprint, investors are
pounding the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint's FON stock has plummeted to its lowest level in 18
months, well below what it traded at before its merger
announcement, and less than half what WorldCom offered. The shares
closed Friday at $34.81, down $1.06.
</P>
<P>
   The company's flagship long-distance business, under attack from
new competitors and new technologies, is seeing its growth and
profitability wither. Sprint's earnings are under pressure from
as-yet unprofitable investments in wireless, broadband and Internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey has outlined a bare-bones strategy for Sprint, but it
sounds a lot like his old ``go it alone'' strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, he said when the merger was abandoned, will adopt a
laserlike focus on high-growth areas of the business such as
wireless, Internet and broadband data services, and increase
revenue 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that strategy is all well and good, but some contend
it will lead nowhere but back to the bargaining table and another
merger.
</P>
<P>
   With two competing themes at work in the industry _ one to get
bigger and broader, the other to specialize _ Sprint may be caught
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, the Westwood company may not be big enough to
compete over the long haul with the emerging behemoths of the
communications industry. On the other hand, it may be too big to
take on more nimble start-ups that are concentrating on specific
market niches and emerging technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am quite sympathetic with Bill Esrey and Sprint,'' said Reed
Hundt, who was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission
during the writing of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which set
competitive forces loose in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint is No. 3 in a long-distance business that is an
artifact of history, and one of a bunch of wireless competitors. It
needs deeper pockets and international scale. He can remake the
company, but it is a big challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy of telecom consolidation is being driven by the
notion that it's no longer enough to provide just local, or just
long-distance, service. Carriers need to offer the whole package _
local, long-distance, Internet, data and wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   The risk faced by traditional, single-service carriers is that
``once anybody has everything, everybody needs everything,'' said
Tod Jacobs, an industry analyst now with J.P. Morgan who testified
before Congress in the wake of the Sprint-WorldCom merger
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   As carriers offer multiple services over integrated pipes, they
save on network and marketing costs, creating the opportunity for
further discounting for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So the rush is on to get big and broad fast. Examples include
AT&AMP;T's purchase of cable giants TCI and MediaOne; SBC
Communication's purchase of fellow local monopolies Pacific
Telesis, Ameritech and SNET; and Deutsche Telekom's offer to
purchase VoiceStream.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike AT&AMP;T, WorldCom and SBC, Sprint has no local connections
to businesses and consumers in most cities.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said his company can lease fiberoptic rings to reach
businesses in most cities, and put its own equipment into Bell
company wire centers in selected markets to target high-value
residential customers with integrated voice and data service.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has tried that strategy once, however.
</P>
<P>
   One rationale for the WorldCom deal, Esrey told Congress, was
that ``it became clear to us at Sprint that our future should no
longer hinge on a plan that depended upon cable companies or Bell
companies to reach our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new strategy does just that, leaving Sprint dependent on
third parties for the reliability and availability of its last-mile
connections to customers, potentially with higher costs than
competitors who own the underlying networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use leasing strategically,'' said Mel Marten, an
analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. ``But pretty much everyone
who has tried that for a major part of their business ends up
buying. It's the only way to control the quality of the service and
drive down costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint also lacks international reach to serve multinational
corporations. Such businesses are flagship accounts, and they
increasingly look to one carrier to provide seamless, end-to-end
service around the globe, and be accountable for quality of service
all along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint could go out and buy one of the parts it doesn't have.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's depressed stock is not valuable currency to
use in an acquisition, so any big buyout would lead to further
dilution of its earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company faces increasing competition, lower
prices and slower growth in the long-distance business, which is
responsible for almost half its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer long-distance is a dying business, Esrey says. And the
segment's attractiveness will fade further as the regional Bell
companies get permission to offer long-distance and more customers
turn to the Internet for free or minimal cost service.
</P>
<P>
   Many carriers are acknowledging that the parts of their business
are worth more than the whole by spinning off slow-growth divisions
or issuing tracking stocks for others.
</P>
<P>
   If Esrey is truly interested in maximizing the company's value
for shareholders, some experts say, pressure may build to break it
up and sell the parts to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, with investors paying for growth businesses,
Sprint could choose to spin off its slow-growth consumer
long-distance business. Indeed, WorldCom announced Thursday that it
is considering such a plan.
</P>
<P>
   But long-distance still pays the freight at Sprint, and Wall
Street might get nervous about the effect on revenue and cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulling yourself out of the consumer market and concentrating
on the high-end business market may be a wonderful plan,'' said Bob
Rosenberg of Insight Research. ``But Wall Street would shoot you
right now for trying to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend there is a major change coming that will
favor companies that become either retailers or wholesalers. They
see Sprint as a prime retail specialist that could buy the
connections it doesn't have from a wholesaler.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to be big on integrated carriers, but in the last six
to eight months our perception has changed,'' said Steve Kamman, an
analyst with CIBC World Markets. ``The thing to stress for WorldCom
and AT&AMP;T and Sprint is they have very valuable customers.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom's decision to get out of consumer long-distance and
serve business clients exclusively is a move in that direction,
Kamman said.
</P>
<P>
   CIBC sees parallels to computing in the late 1980s, when desktop
computer power doubled and prices dropped every 12 months,
exploding demand for computer use. CIBC thinks the same thing will
happen with demand for broadband services as companies continue
upgrading optical fiber lines, throttling up speed and power, and
pushing down prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such rapid speed and price changes, Kamman said,
the big telecom firms will have to decide whether to ``focus on
economies of scale or economies of scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundt, the former FCC chairman, doesn't buy it. He thinks large
international players will rule the industry.
</P>
<P>
   A combined Sprint and WorldCom could have been one of those
players, Hundt said. He thinks there is going to be regret in
regulatory agencies that the merger was opposed when they see how
the market develops.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, ``the market is regrettably hazy for Sprint,''
Hundt said.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey said he's heard such dire forecasts since he took over as
chief executive of Sprint 15 years ago. All along, he said, the
company has competed, grown and delivered big returns for
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But as Esrey returns to the course he was on before the merger
was announced, outside skepticism of that strategy may have reached
a new peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much up in the air right now,'' said Marten, the
analyst with Edward Jones. ``They certainly have the ability and
assets to perform for the next year or two, but beyond that you
really have to see some new strategy. It probably involves a
merger.''

Sparks fly in 84-74 victory over Comets
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ On a day when the Comets became the first WNBA team to
retire a player's jersey, they found they could have used the
inspirational leadership of the late Kim Perrot against the Los
Angeles Sparks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without the fiery point guard, who died from cancer last August
and had her No. 10 jersey hung from the rafters at Compaq Center on
Saturday, the Comets took a nine-point, second-half lead only to be
outscored by 17 points down the stretch en route to an 84-74 defeat
before a national television audience and a sellout crowd of
16,285.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (24-3), who won for the first time ever in Houston,
increased their Western Conference lead over the Comets (22-5) to
two games with five games remaining in the regular season. In the
process, the Sparks became the first team to sweep a season series
(3-0) from the three-time defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd walk in here today
and LA would beat us three times in a year,'' Comets coach Van
Chancellor said after the Comets' second loss in six days. ``But
they're doing a marvelous job of taking it to us. They're playing
well. They really beat us in the second half. Unbelievably.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Comets lead the league in total defense, they were
torched for 48 points by the Sparks in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets also shot poorly, hitting only 26 of 64 attempts from
the field (40.6 percent) and missing 11 of 12 field-goal tries at
one point in the second half to spark LA's decisive, second-half
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five Sparks starters scored in double figures, led
by Tamecka Dixon with 19 points, including 13 in the second half.
And LA shot 30-for-58 (51.7 percent) from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game had been much anticipated since July 14 when the
Comets blew a 15-point lead with 11:42 to play and lost 63-58 at
the Forum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Comets guard Cynthia Cooper was missing from action
because of a sprained right ankle suffered three days before. She
was back on the floor Saturday _ although not at full strength _
and led all scorers with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheryl Swoopes, the league's leading scorer who was playing
with a sprained right index finger, scored only eight points, 13
below her average.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson added 14 points but was 0-for-4 from three-point
range as the Comets were shut out from beyond the arc (0-for-8) for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Though emotionally moved during the pre-game jersey-retirement
ceremonies, Cooper shot 6-for-12 and scored 14 points in the first
half as the Comets took a 43-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after a pair of Cooper free throws gave the Comets a 56-47
lead at 14:25 of the second half, the Sparks caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's only points during LA's 21-4 ensuing blitz came on a
pair of free throws and a field goal from Swoopes with 9:48
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like LA really wanted it,'' Chancellor said. ``I
really think, if you want my honest opinion, where we've got to get
better, we've got to get somebody to inspire us when things are
going bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Perrot, who took an in-your-face approach to
motivate her teammates whenever the occasion warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's loss cannot diminish, in my mind, the thought that Kim
Perrot's jersey was retired and that we honored a wonderful
person,'' Chancellor said. ``That won't detract in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   An obviously inspired Cooper looked like the Cooper of 1997
during the first 12 minutes of the game in which there were five
ties. Cooper drove the lane for layups or passed off to Tiffani
Johnson and Janeth Arcain for easy buckets. One of Cooper's
patented moves broke the final tie and put the Comets up 29-27.
</P>
<P>
   Four consecutive free throws by Thompson and another Cooper
layup closed out the Comets' first-half scoring and gave Houston a
seven-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were still coasting when LA's Mwadi Mabika fouled
Cooper, whose two free throws made it 56-47. But a layup by DeLisha
Milton, who had 17 points on the afternoon, fueled the Sparks'
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half,
followed with a three-point play, and the Comets' lead was down to
56-52.
</P>
<P>
   After Ukari Figgs nailed a 3-pointer to give the Sparks their
first lead of the half at 57-56, a Milton basket gave LA the lead
for good 59-58. Two free throws by Figgs made it 68-60 and
completed the 21-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   A layup by Dixon later pushed the Sparks' lead to 76-66 before
Arcain gave the Comets and their fans cause for hope. She completed
a three-point play to trim the deficit to 76-69. After being fouled
by Lisa Leslie as she tried to launch a three-point shot, Arcain
made all three of free-throw attempts and to get the Comets within
78-72.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as they would get.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had no answer as to why the Comets went stale after going
ahead by nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is they outscored us, they outplayed us the second
half, they won,'' she said. ``It's all well and good to play well
the first half, but you've got to come out and play hard the second
half. You've got to close out the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thompson, ``We'll have to go back and figure out what (the)
answer is. If not, we're going to be in a really big hole from now
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, with their loss in Los Angeles two weeks ago, gave
up the homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs to the Sparks.
Saturday, they ceded a huge psychological edge to the team they
beat 2-1 in the Western Conference finals a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only our fifth loss,'' Swoopes said. ``We have five games
to go. And hopefully, we can go into those games and play better.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ A day after the Angels' heavy hitters took a
toll on the Chicago White Sox, their little guns made a big noise.
</P>
<P>
   The only players in the Anaheim lineup with single-digit homer
totals _ Benji Gil, Adam Kennedy and Matt Walbeck _ each hit solo
homers as the Angels came from behind once again to beat the White
Sox 6-5 before 25,881 on Saturday at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't always wait for the middle of our lineup to carry
us,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ``When guys who we look
for to place balls come through with home runs, it's great. Those
guys gave us a big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was Anaheim's 26th come-from-behind victory of the year
and the second in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been behind more than what we have been comfortable
with,'' Scioscia said. ``We are very resilient and that's
indicative of how we've been able to come back. . . . I sound like
a broken record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing what we have to do,'' said Mo Vaughn, who had the
winning blast Friday but went hitless Saturday. ``We have lots of
heroes every night.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent heroes weren't the usual suspects, but the trio
of light-hitting Gil (fourth homer), Kennedy (seventh) and Walbeck
(sixth) was enough to rescue starter Kent Bottenfield (7-8) and
make him a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield cruised through the first two innings before the
White Sox knocked him around for five runs on six hits _ the key
blow being Paul Konerko's two-out, bases-loaded double in the third
_ over the next two to take a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Bottenfield, who gave up nine hits with three walks and
three strikeouts, managed to hold off Chicago until help arrived
from the bullpen with two outs in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think his outing was as bad as his line score shows,''
Scioscia said. ``He put some zeroes up after and kept us in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers Al Levine, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Troy Percival, who
picked up his 25th save with a 1-2-3 ninth inning, combined to
no-hit the White Sox the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys in the bullpen are doing a great job,'' Scioscia
said. ``I can't say enough about them. They are the reason why we
are where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   While it wasn't its usual self, the meat of the Angels' lineup
didn't go unnoticed against the AL Central-leading White Sox, who
fell a game behind Atlanta for the best record in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus smacked his team-leading 31st homer, a solo shot in
the second inning to give Anaheim a 1-0 lead off Chicago starter
Mark Buehrle, who also surrendered leadoff homers to Gil in the
third and Walbeck in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Tim Salmon stroked an RBI double off loser
Lorenzo Barcelo (0-1) to score Gil and made it 5-5 when he scored
on Garret Anderson's ensuing double.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's homer just inside the right-field foul pole off in the
fifth inning proved to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what,'' Gil said, ``and it's not just me saying
it, but the big guys have said all along that it's a team effort.
It just seems like everyday it's someone else.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some professional tennis players play better after
losing their cool.
</P>
<P>
   Not Justin Gimelstob.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the first set against Michael Chang in Saturday's
Mercedes-Benz Cup semifinal, Gimelstob began acting out midway
through the second set, and he was never the same in a 3-6, 6-3,
6-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Up 3-2 in the second set, Gimelstob was bothered by a ringing
cellular phone during his serve. He stopped and loudly screamed,
``Shut off your phone!''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd laughed and cheered, but it was the beginning of the
end for Gimelstob, who never regained his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand it. Turning off your cell phone is not a
very difficult concept,'' Gimelstob said. ``Obviously I'm a prima
donna.
</P>
<P>
   After Chang won the next two games, Gimelstob tossed his racket
_ this time the crowd booed _ and the umpire issued a warning for
racket abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob punctuated losing the set by tearing off his shirt _ a
la Hulk Hogan entering a wrestling ring.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the match, Gimelstob, a UCLA graduate, had a lot
less fan support than when he started.
</P>
<P>
   He punched a locker after the match and bruised his right hand.
He was too busy getting it examined to talk immediately to the
media, because he had to play a doubles match _ losing in straight
sets _ in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After the doubles loss, Gimelstob briefly appeared with a
heavily bandaged hand in front of reporters. He didn't elaborate on
how it happened, and no one asked. But Gimelstob did admit his
emotions got the best of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got flustered, scattered and distracted,'' he said. ``That's
exactly why the result was what it was. I'm obviously
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chang was asked if Gimelstob's behavior was the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's difficult to say,'' Chang said. ''Part of the way
Justin is is to be intense and show his frustration. It's just a
part of his personality. I know John McEnroe always played better
when he got fired up. I don't know if Justin does or he doesn't.
Everyone handles it differently.''!dlim!!end!
</P>
<P>
   __ Clawing ahead: Jan-Michael Gambill raises baby tigers at the
Cat Tails park near his home in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking stock: Gimelstob, who recently surpassed $1 million in
career prize money, said he enjoys following the stock market _ his
best friend is a stockbroker _ but only as a ``hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bringin' the heat: Late in the second set of the
Chang-Gimelstob match, play was halted when a fan fell ill and was
carried off by attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Identified as Phyllis Adler, she was taken to UCLA's emergency
room for dehydration and heat exhaustion, according tournament
officials.
</P>
<P>
   She was reported in good condition shortly after the match.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fast start: No one was hotter than Arnaud Clement this week.
He hadn't lost a set through the first three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Celebrity sighting: Dustin Hoffman, who participated in a
charity match here Monday, sat in the first row for Chang's
victory.

   HOUSTON _ On a day when the Comets became the first WNBA team to
retire a player's jersey, they found they could have used the
inspirational leadership of the late Kim Perrot against the Los
Angeles Sparks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Without the fiery point guard, who died from cancer last August
and had her No. 10 jersey hung from the rafters at Compaq Center on
Saturday, the Comets took a nine-point, second-half lead only to be
outscored by 17 points down the stretch en route to an 84-74 defeat
before a national television audience and a sellout crowd of
16,285.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (24-3), who won for the first time ever in Houston,
increased their Western Conference lead over the Comets (22-5) to
two games with five games remaining in the regular season. In the
process, the Sparks became the first team to sweep a season series
(3-0) from the three-time defending champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd walk in here today
and LA would beat us three times in a year,'' Comets coach Van
Chancellor said after the Comets' second loss in six days. ``But
they're doing a marvelous job of taking it to us. They're playing
well. They really beat us in the second half. Unbelievably.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Comets lead the league in total defense, they were
torched for 48 points by the Sparks in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets also shot poorly, hitting only 26 of 64 attempts from
the field (40.6 percent) and missing 11 of 12 field-goal tries at
one point in the second half to spark LA's decisive, second-half
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five Sparks starters scored in double figures, led
by Tamecka Dixon with 19 points, including 13 in the second half.
And LA shot 30-for-58 (51.7 percent) from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game had been much anticipated since July 14 when the
Comets blew a 15-point lead with 11:42 to play and lost 63-58 at
the Forum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Comets guard Cynthia Cooper was missing from action
because of a sprained right ankle suffered three days before. She
was back on the floor Saturday _ although not at full strength _
and led all scorers with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheryl Swoopes, the league's leading scorer who was playing
with a sprained right index finger, scored only eight points, 13
below her average.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson added 14 points but was 0-for-4 from three-point
range as the Comets were shut out from beyond the arc (0-for-8) for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Though emotionally moved during the pre-game jersey-retirement
ceremonies, Cooper shot 6-for-12 and scored 14 points in the first
half as the Comets took a 43-36 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   But after a pair of Cooper free throws gave the Comets a 56-47
lead at 14:25 of the second half, the Sparks caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's only points during LA's 21-4 ensuing blitz came on a
pair of free throws and a field goal from Swoopes with 9:48
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like LA really wanted it,'' Chancellor said. ``I
really think, if you want my honest opinion, where we've got to get
better, we've got to get somebody to inspire us when things are
going bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Perrot, who took an in-your-face approach to
motivate her teammates whenever the occasion warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's loss cannot diminish, in my mind, the thought that Kim
Perrot's jersey was retired and that we honored a wonderful
person,'' Chancellor said. ``That won't detract in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   An obviously inspired Cooper looked like the Cooper of 1997
during the first 12 minutes of the game in which there were five
ties. Cooper drove the lane for layups or passed off to Tiffani
Johnson and Janeth Arcain for easy buckets. One of Cooper's
patented moves broke the final tie and put the Comets up 29-27.
</P>
<P>
   Four consecutive free throws by Thompson and another Cooper
layup closed out the Comets' first-half scoring and gave Houston a
seven-point halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were still coasting when LA's Mwadi Mabika fouled
Cooper, whose two free throws made it 56-47. But a layup by DeLisha
Milton, who had 17 points on the afternoon, fueled the Sparks'
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, who scored 13 of her 19 points in the second half,
followed with a three-point play, and the Comets' lead was down to
56-52.
</P>
<P>
   After Ukari Figgs nailed a 3-pointer to give the Sparks their
first lead of the half at 57-56, a Milton basket gave LA the lead
for good 59-58. Two free throws by Figgs made it 68-60 and
completed the 21-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   A layup by Dixon later pushed the Sparks' lead to 76-66 before
Arcain gave the Comets and their fans cause for hope. She completed
a three-point play to trim the deficit to 76-69. After being fouled
by Lisa Leslie as she tried to launch a three-point shot, Arcain
made all three of free-throw attempts and to get the Comets within
78-72.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as close as they would get.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper had no answer as to why the Comets went stale after going
ahead by nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is they outscored us, they outplayed us the second
half, they won,'' she said. ``It's all well and good to play well
the first half, but you've got to come out and play hard the second
half. You've got to close out the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thompson, ``We'll have to go back and figure out what (the)
answer is. If not, we're going to be in a really big hole from now
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, with their loss in Los Angeles two weeks ago, gave
up the homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs to the Sparks.
Saturday, they ceded a huge psychological edge to the team they
beat 2-1 in the Western Conference finals a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only our fifth loss,'' Swoopes said. ``We have five games
to go. And hopefully, we can go into those games and play better.''

COWBOYS COACH'S MOVIE MESSAGE: ROAD SUCCESS POSSIBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Either Cowboys coach Dave Campo is a master
psychologist or an expert jockey.
</P>
<P>
   After two intense weeks of training camp workouts, Campo eased
up on his team heading into tonight's preseason opener against the
Pittsburgh Steelers at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Practices on Thursday and Friday ended at least 30 minutes
early. He canceled team meetings Friday night and instead treated
the team to a ``Mission Impossible'' movie, and ``some popcorn.''
After the movie, Campo moved the players' curfew back to 1 a.m.,
extra time many used to partake in the Wichita Falls night life.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on the home game against Steelers and the
Cowboys' paltry 1-9 preseason record the past two years, Campo used
the movie to teach the Cowboys about playing on the road. The
Cowboys are 10-24 on the road, including playoffs, since the start
of the 1996 season, including a 1-8 mark last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to them about playing on the road and being a team
like the Mission Impossible team that goes out and takes missions
that people don't think they can handle, but they get the job
done,'' Campo said after the team's easy walk-through practice
yesterday at training camp in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Campo said he has talked to his team about playing well against
the Steelers and playing to win. However, given that quarterback
Troy Aikman and many of the starters will likely not play much more
than a series or two, Campo said the Steelers' game is most
important for evaluating players, especially the young players who
are trying to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   He said he impressed upon them that it's important to play well
because ``you make the football team in games, not practice.'' And
since the individual intensity will be at a high level, he expects
it to result in a favorable showing.
</P>
<P>
   Two areas that will draw much of Campo's attention are the
offensive line and secondary, because of the injuries and absences
at guard and cornerback. He said he is eager to see how the rookie
cornerbacks, Mario Edwards, Kareem Larrimore and Dwayne Goodrich,
play in a game. \Nsubheds:Staff evaluations, too The coaches will
be evaluating themselves against the Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer is trying to discern whether
it's best for him to coach on the sideline or be up in the booth.
Zimmer, who prefers to be on the sideline looking at his players in
their eyes, will be on the field against the Steelers. He will go
in the booth at a later game.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Jack Reilly will be in the booth along
with consultant Ernie Zampese, while Dave Campo, who has been in
the booth the past four years as a defensive coordinator, tries to
get used to being on the field and listening to both the offensive
and defensive play calls. \Nsubheds:Injury updates Running back
Emmitt Smith (sprained toe), safety George Teague (strained
gluteus) and tight end David LaFleur (strained groin) are
considered game-time decisions for tonight's game against the
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo said if the players aren't 100 percent healthy at
game time, they will not play. If the three can't go, Chris Warren,
Jason Kaiser and Jackie Harris will start in their places.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive guard Tony Hutson, linebacker Brandon Tolbert and
receiver James McKnight, who all underwent off-season knee surgery,
will not play tonight for precautionary reasons.

CONVENTION COVERAGE MOVES FROM MAINSTREAM TO THE UNCONVENTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Ted Koppel may not be gracing the
Republican National Convention with his presence. But Gideon Yago
will.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 21-year-old New Yorker is covering the convention for
cable's MTV network. In contrast to the ``Nightline'' anchor, who
made a highly publicized exit from the GOP gathering in 1996, Yago
thinks the conventions are worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this isn't going to be the most contentious of political
happenings,'' Yago said, ``but there are going to be people outside
the convention trying to force issues onto the convention floor.
Protests are planned. Shadow conventions are going on. This isn't
just a coronation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yago is more than the voice of a new generation. He's part of a
new wave of convention coverage that has rushed in to fill the void
left by the three traditional television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, ABC, CBS and NBC have continually scaled back the
airtime they devote to the political conventions. During that time,
Nielsen ratings for the conventions have declined every year but
one.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, no fewer than eight cable channels will be
in Philadelphia for the GOP gathering. And even more Internet sites
will be devoted to the convention, dishing out more information and
analysis to political junkies than the networks ever imagined
doing.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows if any of this will spark voter interest in the
conventions. A recent survey conducted by the Vanishing Voter
project at Harvard University found that 66 percent of Americans
plan to watch ``little'' or ``none'' of the convention coverage.
That's up from 47 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, the number of people tuning in to see what
Gov. George W. Bush will say in his acceptance speech Thursday will
be smaller, probably much smaller, than the number tuning in
Wednesday to see which castaway gets kicked off ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than on the night of Bush's speech, network coverage of
the GOP convention will be minimal. ABC and CBS each plan only five
hours in prime time all week. NBC will broadcast only half that
amount; its cable arm, MSNBC, will shoulder most of the convention
coverage. Of the broadcast networks, only PBS will carry the
conventions in generous portions each evening.
</P>
<P>
   On the cable side, however, the trend is toward giving viewers
more convention coverage, not less. Not only will C-SPAN offer
uninterrupted coverage of the entire convention, but visitors to
its Web site, www.c-span.org, will be able to watch the proceedings
on streaming video from one of four cameras positioned around First
Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   There are three cable news channels at the convention this year
instead of two: Fox News Channel joins CNN and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   And the role of specialty cable channels is larger than ever,
because these niche providers have realized that the political
process offers a unique way to connect with their viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime, a cable channel aimed at women, will focus on women's
issues and plans to interview former GOP presidential candidate
Elizabeth Dole on Monday. Nickelodeon is sending a young actor,
Josh Peck, to tape reports from Philadelphia for a series later
this year, ``Kids Pick the President.''
</P>
<P>
   And Comedy Central has signed up former presidential nominee Bob
Dole and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich to supply
tongue-in-cheek accounts from the convention.
</P>
<P>
   MTV kicks off what will be a very busy week from Philadelphia
with ``Choose or Lose,'' a report broadcast at 9 p.m. today
(Sunday, Central time) that features Yago and three other MTV
correspondents. The cable network has sponsored voter turnout
drives in the past, notably its ``Rock the Vote'' campaign. Yet
MTV's research found that twice as many people from Ted Koppel's
age group (45 and up) went to the polls in 1996 as those in the MTV
generation (30 and under).
</P>
<P>
   That's a trend Yago hopes he can help reverse.
</P>
<P>
   A European history major, Yago came to MTV with no political or
journalistic background. But while studying at Columbia University,
he was energized by the writings of Czech Republic President Vaclav
Havel, notably ``The Power of the Powerless,'' an essay Havel wrote
in 1978 while resisting his country's communist rulers.
</P>
<P>
   Yago thinks that people his age have something in common with
oppressed people: They're not apathetic so much as disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are very politically engaged and have fully
formed political views,'' Yago said. ``But they don't connect that
with going to the voting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   This week the MTV reporters will roam the convention floor and
the streets of Philadelphia carrying lightweight camcorders. They
will report live each day on MTV and shoot video for several
election-related programs that will be broadcast on MTV this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a rundown of broadcast convention coverage (times
Central Standard):
</P>
<P>
   - ABC and CBS will broadcast convention highlights at 9 p.m.
Monday and Tuesday. They will be joined by NBC on Wednesday, also
at 9 p.m. On Thursday, ABC and CBS will begin their coverage at 8
p.m., NBC at 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   - PBS will offer three hours of convention coverage each
evening, beginning at 7 p.m. Viewers with digital TV reception will
be able to watch the sessions in high definition from PBS.
</P>
<P>
   - Gavel-to-gavel coverage on C-SPAN will begin at 9 a.m. each
day. When the convention is not in session, C-SPAN will either show
taped highlights or carry convention-related activities around
Philadelphia. C-SPAN also will carry today's ``Shadow Convention''
at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   - All-day coverage from the convention floor and
convention-related activities will be on CNN, Fox News Channel and
MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   - Comedy Central will broadcast ``The Daily Show'' from
Philadelphia at 10 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, with analysis from
Robert Dole, Robert Reich, John McCain, Rep. Mary Bono and others.
</P>
<P>
   - MTV presents a half-hour special, ``Choose or Lose: Why
Care?'' at 9 p.m. today and a wrap-up special at 8 p.m. Thursday.
In Philadelphia, MTV correspondents will file live reports all week
during news breaks (50 minutes past the hour) and ``Total Request
Live'' (2 p.m.). The Web site ChooseOrLose.com will feature online
chats each day around 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   - Lifetime will carry updates from Philadelphia on ``Lifetime
Live'' (11 a.m. weekdays).
</P>
<P>
   - Many Internet convention-related events will be listed at
Yack.com. Streaming video works best with a high-speed cable or DSL
modem and a newer computer.

TWINS BEAT YANKS, 6-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The question for most of Saturday night's duel
between the Yankees' Roger Clemens and Minnesota's Eric Milton was
whether anybody would get a hit. But in the bottom of the eighth
inning, the question was whether the usually sterling Yankees'
bullpen would get anybody out.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens turned over a two-run advantage to the relievers for the
bottom of the eighth, but it required five pitchers and five trips
to the mound by Manager Joe Torre and the pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre to get three outs. By then, the Twins had pieced
together a 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza (7-4), who allowed the tying and go-ahead hits,
was charged with the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Milton did not allow a hit until the sixth inning, while the
Twins mustered their first hit against Clemens with two outs in the
fifth. Clemens had five consecutive victories before Saturday
night's no-decision and has compiled an earned run average of 1.91
in his last six outings. He allowed just four hits over seven
shutout innings Saturday night, and his pitch count was just 109
after seven innings. There had been 12 previous occasions this
season when he threw more pitches than that.
</P>
<P>
   But with the score 2-0, Clemens was relieved for the eighth
inning by Mike Stanton, who had not allowed an earned run in 11
straight appearances. Matt Lawton singled to lead off, and with one
out, David Ortiz smashed a double that bounced over the wall in
right-center field. The switch-hitting Denny Hocking was announced
as the pinch-hitter for Corey Koskie, and Torre called for Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mendoza's first appearance since June 24 _ he was placed
on the disabled list the next day _ and he walked Hocking to load
the bases. Mendoza struck out pinch-hitter Midre Cummings. Two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacque Jones laced a single to right, scoring the tying
runs. Chad Moeller followed with a sinking liner to left, where
Ryan Thompson charged and dove for the ball, trying to make the
catch that would end the inning and keep the score tied.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson missed the ball, however, and it rolled to the wall.
Moeller sprinted around the bases and crossed home plate before the
relay from the outfield for his first major league home run and a
5-2 Minnesota lead. The Twins went on to add another run in the
inning, and Milton (10-6), who allowed two hits and two walks and
struck out 10 in eight innings, won his duel with Clemens, because
of the Yankees' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have won two championships and are contending for a
third with Chuck Knoblauch as their second baseman and leadoff
hitter; they felt Knoblauch would make them a better team and he
has, in spite of his intermittent throwing jitters.
</P>
<P>
   Time has vindicated Minnesota General Manager Terry Ryan as
well. Along with $3 million in cash and a couple of minor leaguers
who have not panned out, the Twins received two very good players
in return for Knoblauch _ Cristian Guzman and Milton. Guzman, a
shortstop, is 22 years old and although he has not yet developed
into a big-time hitter, everything he does seems to give the Twins
a better chance of winning the game, in a manner similar to that of
the Mets' Edgardo Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Milton is left-handed, throws very hard, and last Sept.11, he
pitched a no-hitter against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch and Scott Brosius were out of the starting lineup with
injuries, and David Justice was given the day off by Torre, whose
bating order had an unusual look. Jose Vizcaino was the leadoff
hitter, Glenallen Hill was the designated hitter, Thompson started
in left field and Clay Bellinger played third.
</P>
<P>
   Milton reigned over the Yankees in the first three innings, like
a Little Leaguer who had reached puberty faster than his opponents,
striking out two in the first, two in the second and three more in
the third. All of the strikeouts were on swings and misses, on
failed attempts to hit his 94-mile-an-hour fastball. Milton reached
a two-ball count just once in the first three innings. He had
no-hit stuff, similar to the left-handed repertory David Wells had
when he pitched against the Twins on May 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was almost as good, his fastball sizzlin, his splitter
diving, his slider spinning tightly and veering. He struggled with
his control in the second inning, walking back-to-back hitters with
one out. After he struck out Torii Hunter, he walked Jones to load
the bases. But Clemens whirled a chest-high, 93-mph fastball past a
swinging Moeller to end the inning. He, too, had not allowed any
hits after three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Milton walked Derek Jeter with one out in the fourth, but
whiffed Paul O'Neill and retired Bernie Williams on an easy fly.
Clemens issued a two-out walk in the bottom of the fourth, then
struck out Jones to end the fourth inning. It was still early, it
was a double no-hitter in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Before each pitch, Clemens stood erect on the mound, looming
like a skyscraper. He holds his pitching hand and glove in front of
his face as he prepares to throw each pitch. His cap, drawn low on
his forehead, casts a half-moon shadow over that part of his face
the hitter can see, the area around his eyes; it looks as if
Clemens has donned war paint.
</P>
<P>
   Milton stood slightly to the third-base side of the pitching
rubber, turned at a 45-degree angle to the hitter, his glove held
at his right hip, his Popeye forearms covered in sweat. A gold neck
chain often escaped his jersey, hanging over the collar of his
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Milton retired the Yankees easily in the top of the fifth,
needing only 10 pitches. Moeller and Jay Canizaro made outs for the
Twins to start the bottom of the fifth. Thirty-five batters had
come to the plate in the game and there had not been a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman fouled off a two-strike pitch with two outs in the fifth,
and Clemens responded by pumping a fastball high and inside, 94
mph. Ball 3. Then Guzman laced a single to center, the first hit of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless after five innings. Milton had thrown
only 65 pitches, but he managed to walk the free-swinging Thompson
to open the sixth. Finally, with one out, Vizcaino skittered a
single through the middle, the ball skipping along the artificial
surface. On a grass field, it would perhaps have been a double
play. Thompson stopped at second on the hit.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter then looped a single into right-center field, where right
fielder Lawton approached the ball conservatively, worried that it
might bounce over his head, and he had no chance to throw out
Thompson at the plate. Vizcaino, reading the hit perfectly, took
third and eventually scored the Yankees' second run when O'Neill
flied out to center.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: TESTAVERDE MISSES A SEASON, BUT NOT A BEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Vinny Testaverde's first completion
happened hours before Saturday night's exhibition against New
Orleans, the first game for Testaverde since his Achilles' tendon
exploded in the season opener last September. He walked into Giants
Stadium with his pal Wayne Chrebet. That's what a smart quarterback
does _ stay close to your best wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde stuck to that philosophy once the game began. On the
first play of the Jets' third possession, Chrebet faked out both
safeties with a cut move inside, then darted the opposite way. Not
bad for a guy who supposedly has no speed. Testaverde lobbed a
perfect bomb, complete with tight spiral. Chrebet caught the pass
near midfield and cruised into the end zone for a 75-yard
touchdown. The only thing missing from that scene was a Hollywood
slow-motion shot and the score from ``Chariots of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Or Keyshawn Johnson breaking down the play with one of those
Telestrator gizmos. But we digress.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown was especially important because on the previous
series, Testaverde, while trying to lob a screen pass to fullback
Richie Anderson, underthrew the ball by a few inches. Safety Sammy
Knight made an outstanding athletic play by picking off the pass
and running 65 yards for the touchdown. Testaverde was in pursuit
of Knight the entire time, and you can bet Coach Al Groh was
screaming inside for Testaverde to cease his Michael Johnson
imitation.
</P>
<P>
   Two important things about that play: During it, Testaverde was
not shy about testing his Achilles' tendon by sprinting down the
field chasing after Knight. That no body parts fell off can only be
encouraging. And on the very next series, Testaverde rebounded
strong from that embarrassing interception with the Chrebet
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes were on Testaverde for this game, and he did not
disappoint. In many ways he looked like a quarterback who had
missed no time. In fact, the entire Jets offense clicked. Chrebet
was sharp, running back Curtis Martin ran through obscenely large
holes and the play calling of Dan Henning was smart.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had a solid night. He completed 5 of 9 passes (with
one drop and one pass he threw away under a heavy pass rush) for
130 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised if Testaverde looks like he has
barely missed a beat when the Jets open against Green Bay on Sept.
3. A quarterback, of course, needs to be in sync with his team, and
that is what Testaverde fears losing the most. When the season
begins, will his passes sail north when his receivers skate south?
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde is a veteran, with 13 years in the league. Those
synapses inside his head will again begin firing quickly, and he
will recapture that delicate flow. It's already happening.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Miami quarterback Dan Marino had an injury similar
to Testaverde's, and after it, Marino was never quite the same. The
difference is that Marino had more knee surgeries than zeroes on
his fat paychecks. His legs were gone. Testaverde showed Saturday
night that his legs were still strong. His drop backs were crisp,
his mechanics smooth, his arm still a cannon.
</P>
<P>
   His Achilles' tendon should not be a concern. I officially give
him a clean bill of health. Yet his future with the Jets, and the
team's future at the position, well, that is a different story.
</P>
<P>
   This off-season, Testaverde told a former Jets teammate that he
wanted to finish his career near his Florida home, preferably with
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, either after this season or the next.
Sports Illustrated reported last week that Testaverde had a similar
conversation with a friend.
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde's contract with the Jets runs through the 2005
season. Chances are that Testaverde, who turns 37 this year, will
not complete his contract anyway. So whether he leaves New York or
retires from football altogether, he will be gone in a few years,
maybe less. That is where things will get quite cloudy for the
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets made a smart move in drafting a quarterback to replace
Testaverde, and Chad Pennington, one of their four first-round
picks, was judged by most league scouts to be the best available in
this year's draft. He had better be. Because once Testaverde
leaves, the team will be Pennington's. General Manager Bill
Parcells and Groh apparently think _ mistakenly _ that the backup
Ray Lucas is only that, a backup. Lucas will most likely leave the
Jets after this season.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to tell if Pennington is a franchise player
based on a few throws in a preseason game against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   One concern has to be Parcells' record as a talent evaluator,
which is lukewarm at best. When he was with the New England
Patriots, Parcells at first favored picking Rick Mirer over Drew
Bledsoe. Thank goodness he was talked out of that potential
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   There is the distinct possibility that after this season,
Testaverde and Lucas could be gone. That would leave the most
critical position on the field in a major state of flux.
</P>
<P>
   For now, all Testaverde and his teammates care about is the
present. The Jets still don't have a pass rush, they had four
turnovers against the Saints, and the schedule is brutal. But their
biggest concern coming into this game, Testaverde's health, is a
concern no more.

REEVES' POOR DRAFTING FOR FALCONS IS A WORRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 1995 and Giants Coach Dan Reeves informed the front
office he wanted to bring the free-agent quarterback Tommy Maddox
to New York. When several team scouts heard the news, they rolled
their eyes. They had viewed Maddox on film and thought he had a
weak arm, played nervous and had bad aim. Other than that, he was
fine.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves insisted. As coach and general manager of the Denver
Broncos, he had drafted Maddox with a No.1 pick, and even though
Maddox was a disaster there, Reeves still wanted to give the player
another chance. Maddox got it. On Oct. 15 of that year, against
Philadelphia, Maddox went 6 of 23 for 49 yards and 3 interceptions.
His passer rating for the game was zero.
</P>
<P>
   Experiment over. Maddox was gone soon after that horrid
afternoon and is now out of the league, but Reeves' stubbornness
about Maddox started a rift between the coaching staff and the
front office.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was fired as the Giants' coach, with the main issue being
control over personnel decisions like picking the players in the
draft. Now, as head coach and general manager of the Falcons,
Reeves has taken the once joke of a franchise to new heights, a
Super Bowl berth. His coaching ability was the main reason the
Falcons upset the Minnesota Vikings in the National Conference
title game two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves has also continued to demonstrate that he is one of
the worst talent evaluators in football. Except now there are no
checks and balances as there were with the Giants. He makes the
picks and there is no one in the Falcons organization willing to
challenge him. Thus, considering the questionable nature of Reeves'
recent selections, it is not an overstatement to say that the
franchise could soon take several large steps back.
</P>
<P>
   That is already beginning to happen. Atlanta is only two years
removed from the Super Bowl, and St. Louis has passed the Falcons
in the division, as most likely has Carolina. Both teams added
depth and speed with smart drafts.
</P>
<P>
   What some coaches do not seem to understand is that coaching and
evaluating talent are two different animals. Personnel men and
scouts log tens of thousands of miles going to college games and
watch more film than a movie critic. There is no such thing as a
part-time scout, just like there is no such thing as a part-time
coach.
</P>
<P>
   The examples of good coach/bad talent scout are everywhere: Mike
Ditka, the former New Orleans Saints coach, traded his entire draft
for running back Ricky Williams, which may end up being one of the
biggest draft blunders of the last 15 years. That move helped get
Ditka fired, yet he had been a good enough coach to have led the
Chicago Bears to the Super Bowl XX championship in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1997, 1998 and 1999 drafts under Bill Parcells as general
manager of the Jets, he selected 22 players total, but only 8 have
started with the team, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. None
of his draft picks have made the Pro Bowl. Parcells was recently
named coach of the decade. So, great coach plus mediocre talent
evaluator does not always add up to a great draft.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves is one of only three coaches in league history to take
three different teams to the playoffs (Parcells and Chuck Knox are
the others). His coaching job with Atlanta the season of Super Bowl
XXXIII was among the best of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Reeves has done a poor job of replenishing talent, to the
point where it is conceivable that a few years from now, when aging
stars like running back Jamal Anderson and quarterback Chris
Chandler move on, there will be mediocre talent, or less, waiting
to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 draft, Reeves' first for the Falcons, stands as a
symbol for his troubles in picking players. He traded down eight
spots in the first round to take Nebraska cornerback Michael
Booker, passing a better player at the position in Shawn Springs,
and also passing tight end Tony Gonzalez, now one of the league's
best.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Booker, after several years of struggling, bolted
training camp without an excuse (he hung out at a local waffle
house) and questioned whether he wanted to play football. Booker
has returned to camp, but his future is cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine players from that draft, three at one point or
another left the team. Quarterback Tony Graziani was also in that
class, and he has been a total bust.
</P>
<P>
   The recent picks of Reeves have not been much better. His
first-round pick in 1998 was Keith Brooking out of Georgia Tech, in
1999 it was Patrick Kerney out of Virginia. Also in that draft,
Reeves traded his 2000 No.1 pick to Baltimore so he could draft
Mississippi State tight end Reggie Kelly, despite the fact few
teams had Kelly rated as a first-rounder and the Falcons had a
surplus of tight ends.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe those players will turn out to be Pro Bowlers, but so far,
none has shown much potential. In other words, the cupboard is
running bare.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics Question on Pickens
</P>
<P>
   The bizarre trip of wide receiver Carl Pickens ended last week
when he signed a multiyear, incentive-laden contract with the
Tennessee Titans. Both Pickens and his old team, the Cincinnati
Bengals, were happy he was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Late during the negotiations, Pickens dumped his second agent
and was being advised by a third, Marvin Demoff, who is also the
agent for Titans Coach Jeff Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Teams that were interested in Pickens last week questioned the
ethics of that situation. But there have been a number of instances
when an agent represented both a player and the head coach on the
same team.
</P>
<P>
   The team officials complaining about the arrangement are simply
upset that they lost out on acquiring the wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts Can See Redskins
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Redskins' decision to charge $10 for admission to
training-camp practices has scouts from competing teams taking
advantage of a little-known league rule. It states that if a team
charges admission to practices, then scouts from competing teams,
normally prohibited from attending, can go.
</P>
<P>
   So scouts from about a dozen teams have paid their 10 bucks and
watched the Redskins go through their summer drills, several said
last week. Teams do not gain a huge tactical advantage by doing
this because teams rarely work on secrets in such a public setting.
But it does give scouts the chance to get an early start on looking
at the Redskins' personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Around the League
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' potential defensive line: Eric Swann and Sean
Gilbert at tackle and Reggie White and Chuck Smith at defensive
end. That could be, if their conditioning holds out, a formidable
foursome. ... Eric Moulds, the excellent Buffalo wide receiver, is
having his best camp ever, a scary thought for the rest of the
division. ... The Redskins will use cornerback Deion Sanders and
Champ Bailey together in a few of there special-teams situations.
... Look for Oakland cornerback Charles Woodson to be involved in
the offense this season. ... New England Coach Bill Belichick on
wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, who was traded from the Jets to
Tampa Bay: ``I have a lot of regard for him. I'm glad he is out of
our division. When we first met, he straightened out some
misconceptions I had about him, and I straightened out some
misconceptions he had about me. We had a good working
relationship.'' &QL;

ON BASEBALL: INSTANTLY, BORDICK IS A FINE FIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Bordick had not even found the appropriate belt
Saturday, but Robin Ventura had already outfitted the savior
shortstop with an interesting addition to his new Mets uniform.
Ventura dug up a name tag, scribbled Bordick's identity across it
for any Mets who were as oblivious as Rickey Henderson and then
stuck it on his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, my name is Mike,'' read the name tag, ``but you can
call me Bordy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was simple, it was silly, but it was the perfect welcoming
for the 35-year-old Bordick, who is the reason the Mets went from
suspect to much more secure in 24 hours. If the Mets want their
aspirations about October to remain serious, they needed a tested,
reliable shortstop. Not Melvin Mora and not a player who would have
been an improvement in experience only, like Mark Loretta.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Mets desperately needed Bordick, who will make every
play and will make players around him better. Mora is energetic,
but he is a utility player and his presence at shortstop would have
eventually helped doom the Mets. Bordick was the best player on the
Orioles and, after the Barry Larkin disaster, General Manager Steve
Phillips responded quickly and cleverly to give the Mets a
necessary boost on the field and in their minds. Bordick will
provide the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick displayed his value in major and minor ways as the Mets
quieted the St. Louis Cardinals, 4-3, a day on which Bordick
hammered a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Met, cued a
single during a decisive rally and played shortstop like he rented
office space at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much emotion,'' a sweaty Bordick said. ``It was
so exciting. For me, it was so exciting to be back in a pennant
race. Every pitch matters. Every play matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Ventura gave Bordick a name tag and Bordick listened
to advice from his teammates, his stomach was gurgling. Bordick
felt like he was in his first day in kindergarten, trying to fit
in. He gets nervous before every game, but Bordick's nerves were
more jangled Saturday. The Mets wanted him and needed him, and
Bordick knows the hefty expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Before he batted in the third inning, there was a faint ``Let's
Go, Bordick'' chant. It lasted around 10 seconds, but it would have
been drowned out anyway because Bordick drilled Andy Benes'
fastball for a towering home run. Hello, Bordy. Welcome to
Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   After Bordick's fly ball caromed off the retired numbers above
the left-field fence, he scooted around the bases to a standing
ovation. When Bordick returned to the dugout, the fans continued
howling, so the Mets nudged him out for the second curtain call of
his career. Bordick sheepishly said that he was the type of player
who had to be watched for a lengthy period to be appreciated, but
that was false Saturday. It took one game for Bordick to have an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was incredible, certainly one of the biggest highlights of
my career,'' Bordick said about his homer and the reaction. ``It
was very exciting. This whole thing was exciting. Obviously, the
victory was most important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick helped set up the winning run, too. With Ventura on
first base and the score tied at 3-3 in the eighth, Bordick smacked
a grounder that bounced seven times before hitting the lip of the
infield where the dirt meets the grass and hopping over second
baseman Fernando Vina's glove. It sent Ventura to third, and he
eventually scored the winning run on Lenny Harris' pinch-hit
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``The homer was spectacular,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said.
``The rest is the type of stuff you'll see often. He makes the
plays without the flash.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets played the Montreal Expos last Wednesday, they
started Mora at shortstop and Harris at third base in place of
Ventura, who was still injured. Think about those names. Harris and
Mora are best suited for coming off the bench, as Harris showed
Saturday. Valentine started Bordick and Ventura Saturday, two
players who allow the Mets to think about improving on what they
did last season, when they reached the National League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said Bordick and Ventura brought ``instant stability to
the left side of the infield'' and, even if the general manager
does not obtain a leadoff hitter or another reliever, the Mets are
in a strong position. Bordick said the Mets were ``right on the
edge of where they want to be'' and, though he would not admit it,
Bordick can put them over that edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be the ingredient we need to get to the next level,''
Jay Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick smoothly and seamlessly replaced Cal Ripken at shortstop
in Baltimore, a much more daunting task than diving into a pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   He has increased his off-season workouts and focuses on hitting
to all parts of the field, which is why he has a career-best 17
homers.
</P>
<P>
   What Bordick learned from replacing Ripken is that the team will
also dictate the success of his transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``What helped me the most that year is the fact that we won,''
Bordick said.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick loved Ventura's playful approach to introducing him to
the other Mets and wore the name tag as proudly as a Boy Scout
wears his first merit badge. Ventura also stuck a name tag on the
new reliever Rick White and was looking for Bubba Trammell, the
outfielder who was also just acquired, to give him a name tag, too.
The Mets have won five straight games and have renewed hopes,
especially because of the new shortstop called Bordy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't believe this, to tell you the truth,'' Bordick
said. ``It's incredible.''

NEW YORK AIRPORT HIJACKER PUZZLES NEIGHBORS IN MILWAUKEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The residents of a red-brick apartment building here
say they have been in disbelief since a neighbor, Aaron Amartei
Commey, was accused of boarding a National Airlines flight at
Kennedy International Airport with a 10mm handgun and a knife and
ordering the pilots to fly to Miami, Argentina and then Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   They have been searching for answers since word first spread in
northeast Milwaukee that Commey had been arrested and charged with
attempted air piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Commey, 22, a native of the Bronx, N.Y., who moved to Milwaukee
several years ago with his mother, was arrested after a five-hour
standoff in which the plane's passengers escaped and one pilot was
freed with a list of demands.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Commey has been described as a violent, calculating
and brazen man who spent weeks planning the attempted hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   But here, although most people who knew him say he had problems,
assessments have been more gentle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't seem like he was too crazy,'' said Damon Eastern,
24, who lives on the same floor as Commey in this working-class
black neighborhood on the northernmost border of Milwaukee, near
its more affluent suburbs of Shorewood, to the east, and Glendale,
to the north.
</P>
<P>
   To observers in New York, Commey's actions seem delusional. In
interviews with FBI agents, he confessed to trying to hijack the
plane, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As Commey sits in a federal holding cell in New York awaiting
trial, the case has become a topic of discussion in churches and
saloons here.
</P>
<P>
   The events in New York, those who knew Commey said, appeared to
be the culmination of a long series of events that troubled
relatives and friends. Commey dropped out of high school and moved
to Milwaukee in 1996, when his parents divorced. His father,
Samuel, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., said he had not seen his son
in about four years. ``He was not responding to the help that I was
trying to give him,'' Samuel Commey said.
</P>
<P>
   Commey said he was trying to get his son to finish high school,
but, judging from recent telephone conversations, feared that his
son was suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered a knock at Aaron Commey's apartment on Friday
said his mother, Tina, and brother Benjamin would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives said that Aaron Commey had long been
quiet, but had become more reclusive after the move. They said he
began working odd jobs at factories in the Milwaukee area, and in
1997 moved out of his mother's home and lived temporarily with
Benjamin, his older brother, in a house in Kenosha, a southern
suburb of Milwaukee. Less than a year later, neighbors said, Commey
moved into his $325-a-month apartment here on North Sixth Street.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his friends, neighbors said, were from outside the area.
They included many whites _ somewhat unusual in this area,
neighbors said, who worked with him at several factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been around a little while, but did not come in here
much,'' said Houton Wilson, 55, the owner of one of two bars a
block away from the apartment building. ``Things have been up and
down here and we are back up,'' Wilson said of the neighborhood.
``This is all we need.''
</P>
<P>
   His room was sparsely decorated and filled with bags of trash,
neighbors said. Although reclusive, he did not stand out, said Tony
Parker, 22, a neighbor, though noting that Commey often seemed like
a social misfit and a conspiracy theorist.
</P>
<P>
   Those conspiracies began to dominate his life in recent years,
said one relative who did not want his name used.
</P>
<P>
   He began to talk about how the government had been cloning
humans for decades, offering theories seeming to mirror those on
``The X-Files,'' a television show. Indeed, investigators said
Commey told the pilots and negotiators that he believed that humans
were being cloned. Later, he told them he wanted to go to
Antarctica, the site of several secret government bases and landing
strips for human-alien hybrid cloning in ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks ago, officials say, he began planning to hijack a
plane in New York. He quit his job at a factory a week later. ``He
told us about that,'' Eastern said, ``that he was looking for a new
job, he was not making enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials said Commey never found a new job and spent much
of his time planning the hijacking and collecting weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The next week, Milwaukee police detectives appeared at the
apartment building looking for someone who fit Commey's
description. ``The detectives pulled me over outside,'' Eastern
said. ``They asked me if I knew somebody a little shorter than me
with an Afro who lived in the building. I lied and told them I did
not know anything. But he was the only one who fit the
description.''

   Milwaukee police officials declined to comment on why they were
looking for Commey.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday morning, Commey took a city bus near his home to
the bus terminal in downtown Milwaukee. Parker said he remembered
seeing Commey leave that morning _ in the same white shirt and
black pants he was arrested in _ carrying a brown paper bag and a
large duffel bag. Commey caught a Greyhound bus for a 20-hour ride
to New York, arriving Wednesday about 10:20 a.m., according to the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:25 p.m., Commey boarded National Airlines Flight 19, a
Boeing 757 bound for Las Vegas, after pointing his handgun at
security workers. After police negotiators persuaded him to get off
the plane they immediately began retracing his steps, and found his
duffel bag _ with a shotgun, about 20 shells and two additional
knives _ in a locker at the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

   &UR; MOST OF THE MOST OF S.J. PERELMAN &LR;  (Modern Library, $15.95.)
These essays by the cranky, urbane humorist, first published
between 1930 and 1958, zing targets large and small, from Hollywood
to Raymond Chandler and Groucho Marx. ``Perelman misses no mad word
we write or say, and its image and essence he translates back to us
with an artistry acute, brilliant, devastating and ... funny,''
Eudora Welty wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1958.

   &UR; SPINNERS &LR;  By Anthony McCarten. (Harper Perennial, $13.) In this
first novel, a 16-year-old girl discombobulates a small town in
rural New Zealand when she claims to have been abducted and
molested by space aliens. ``McCarten is part barker, part juggler,
part aerialist,'' David Finkle wrote last year. ``He hangs
attributes on his characters as if they were caps and bells, and he
has these unwitting jesters say and do thigh-slapping things.''

   &UR; APPOINTMENT AT THE ENDS OF THE WORLD: Memoirs of a Wildlife
Veterinarian &LR;  By William B. Karesh. (Warner, $13.95.) The author,
who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society, describes his
harrowing, often hazardous, job making house calls around the world
and helping the society in its far-flung research efforts. In 1999
the reviewer Marcia Bartusiak called this an ``engaging memoir''
that ``puts the need for conservation on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELEPHANT MEMORIES: Thirteen Years in the Life of an Elephant
Family &LR; , by Cynthia Moss (University of Chicago, $18), follows the
histories of 25 or so elephants in Amboseli National Park in Kenya,
detailing their daily lives and close family bonds. ``Moss tells
the story in a style so conversational, so free of academic jargon,
that I felt like a privileged visitor riding beside her in her
rickety Land Rover as she showed me around the park,'' Sarah
Blaffer Hrdy wrote in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PUSHKIN'S BUTTON &LR;  By Serena Vitale. (University of Chicago,
$16.) An Italian scholar mines family archives, diplomatic records
and letters in this meticulous account of the impulsive Russian
poet's death in a duel in 1837 and of the society that allowed
people to settle grievances in such a way. The result ``is a
delightful combination of retrograde pleasures (court balls, the
demise of a doomed genius) and primary sources,'' Richard Lamb
wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRUE HISTORY OF PARADISE &LR;  By Margaret Cezair-Thompson.
(Plume, $13.95.) Set in Jamaica in 1981, this ambitious first novel
uses the experiences of a young woman trying to flee her homeland
during a time of political upheaval to explore the island's vibrant
history and culture. Last year the reviewer Madison Smartt Bell
admired the author's ``talent, grace and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOOK OF BLAM &LR;  By Aleksandar Tisma. (Harvest/Harcourt, $13.)
This novel, originally published in Yugoslavia in 1972, traces a
family history of Hapsburg Jews migrating across Eastern Europe in
the 19th century and describes in chilling detail the massacre of
thousands of Jews and Serbs in the city of Novi Sad by the
Hungarian military in 1942. ```The Book of Blam' offers a literary
memorial to the former Jews of the former Yugoslavia,'' Larry Wolff
wrote in The New York Times Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIAR'S MOON: A Long Story &LR;  By Philip Kimball. (Plume, $12.95.)
This neowestern, in which two toddlers fall off a wagon and are
raised by coyotes, ``explores the horizon where the West of myth
and the West of reality merge,'' Alanna Nash wrote in 1999.
``Kimball's bold use of character and language puts a new jingle
into the step of an often hoary genre.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CAN YOU WAVE BYE BYE, BABY?: Stories &LR;  By Elyse Gasco. (Picador
USA, $12.) These seven interwoven tales, each dealing with
contentious issues of adoption and parenthood, feature mothers who
are biologically or emotionally uncertain and fathers who, while
absent or unhelpful, have no such doubts. ``Moments of insight are
one of the strengths of Gasco's collection,'' Margot Livesey wrote
in 1999. ``Another is its zany humor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CODE BOOK: The Science of Secrecy From Ancient Egypt to
Quantum Cryptography &LR;  By Simon Singh. (Anchor, $14.) The author
uses a series of historical incidents, including a plot to
assassinate Queen Elizabeth I and put Mary, Queen of Scots on the
English throne, in this survey of code making through the ages.
``The almost universal fascination with codes undoubtedly derives
from the extraordinary feats of ingenuity that have gone into
devising and breaking them, as well as their enormous impact on
world events,'' Robert Osserman wrote last year. ``Singh's book
offers more than its share of both.''
