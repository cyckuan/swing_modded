<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Tyson's Bid to Reduce Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A request to have the jail
setence of former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson
reduced was rejected in Rockville, Maryland on Friday by a
district court judge.
</P>
<P>
Judge Stephen Johnson, who imposed the original sentence last
month, denied the request by Tyson's lawyers that would have
reduced the sentence to eight months from a year.
</P>
<P>
"The court feels the original sentence is fair and appropriate,
" Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, who had waived his right to be present at the hearing,
had been brought to the courthouse before the hearing began. But
jailers realized their error and immediately took him back.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Monica, was present when the judge announced his
decision.
</P>
<P>
Tyson must still serve 60 days for violating terms of his
probation for a 1992 rape conviction in the American midwestern
state of Indiana.

<HEADLINE> Pak, US End Talks on Nuclear Technology Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and the United States
Friday concluded their second round of expert-level talks on
measures to control export of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
The expert-level talks between the two countries on export
control of nuclear technology is part of a process which was set
rolling as the countries, concerned over nuclear proliferation,
wanted to ensure that sensitive technology was not transferred to
a third country.
</P>
<P>
Similar experts delegations from Japan and European Community
have also come to Pakistan to see its import and export
procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported Friday that
during the talks which began here on March 15, the Pakistani side
reiterated that it would not transfer nuclear technology to a
third country.
</P>
<P>
APP said the U.S. experts, during their talks with Pakistani
officials, appreciated Pakistan's measures to block export of
sensitive material.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side, however, said it would not accept any
suggestions which were not relevant to its system.
</P>
<P>
The first round of expert-level talks between Pakistan and the
United States was held in November last year.

<HEADLINE> Albright Acknowledges Milosevic Does Not Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright acknowledged on Friday that there was no
evidence of being knuckled down of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic despite of two days of severe bombing by NATO's missiles
and bombs.
</P>
<P>
She told CNN that "nothing positive " was coming from Milosevic
through diplomatic channels that remain open. But she insisted the
United States was satisfied with the military operation going.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody expected that there would be a turnaround in five
minutes, or in 24 hours," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright played down differences among NATO members, saying
the whole NATO was united in their bid to continue air strikes
and dismissed reports of waning Italian and Greek support.
</P>
<P>
In Athens, NATO member Greece called on Friday for the
Western alliance to stop bombing Yugoslavia and to go back to
the negotiating table. Political parties making up Italy's
ruling majority have also urged their government to work with
the allies toward a halt to military action.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy announced that it was dispatching
from Norfolk, Virginia, the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt,
with nine tactical aircraft squadrons aboard, and related
warships to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
A navy spokesman said the purpose of the aircraft carrier
Roosevelt was to relieve the carrier Enterprise in the Arabian
Gulf, but the Roosevelt battle group could be diverted to the
Mediterranean to help the NATO effort against Yugoslavia. It
will take about 10 days to get there.

<HEADLINE> NATO Attacks Serb Army, Police Facilities in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO forces have seriously
damaged Yugoslavia's Serb army and police facilities in
Yugoslavia, top U.S. officials claimed Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We've taken down a substantial proportion" of Yugoslavia's air
defenses and command and control assets, said U.S. Army Gen.
Wesley Clark, supreme NATO military commander.
</P>
<P>
But Clark, speaking on U.S. NBC's "Today" show, said Yugoslavia
still has forces out in the field and Serb military activity in
Kosovo was intensifying despite the NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and allied forces have suffered no losses and encountered
little resistance during two days of air attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clark said a third day of airstrikes against Yugoslavia would
begin later Friday, focusing on further reducing Yugoslavia's
formidable air defenses, which have, as yet, been withheld from
the battle.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, also on NBC,
insisted the 19-member allied coalition against Yugoslavia remains
united behind the air campaign -- despite pressure from Italy to
return to negotiations -- and that Russia is more concerned with
Serb intransigence than with the key U.S. role in a campaign
against one of Moscow's traditional allies.
</P>
<P>
Albright expressed concern about possible continued violence
against U.S. embassies as a result of the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Thursday night on CNN's "Larry King Live" program, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, said the "targets that we were after we
successfully hit."
</P>
<P>
Cohen wouldn't reveal the targets. But defense officials said
they included anti-missile batteries, command, control and
communications sites, ammunition and fuel dumps, bases, barracks
and other military structures across Yugoslavia -- from near the
capital of Belgrade to the Kosovo capital of Pristina to
Montenegro, which with the state of Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.

KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- About 2 million Muslims
Friday gathered at Mount Arafat, Saudi holy city of Mecca, marking
the climax of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 pilgrims, cloaked in white cloths, prayed inside
the Namira Mosque on top of the holy mount while others prayed
outside the mosque or in their tents.
</P>
<P>
Saudi First Deputy Prime Minister Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz, Prince of Mecca Majed Ibn Abdul-Aziz as well as some
heads of state, prime ministers and senior officials from the
Islamic world were among the worshippers.
</P>
<P>
Before the rituals began, Saudi Arabia's Mufti Sheikh
Abdul-Aziz Ibn Baz urged Muslims to adhere to Islam's teachings
and cooperate among each other.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2 million pilgrims, 1.4 million are from outside Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Police forces, deployed along all of the main roads, used
helicopters to monitor the movement of the pilgrims in the area,
according to reports reaching here from Mecca. No security or
traffic problems were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
On Friday evening, the pilgrims will start to head back to
Mina, where they will perform their first ritual of Hajj by

<HEADLINE> India, Russia Discuss NATO Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh had a conversation with Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov over telephone Friday evening on the NATO
strikes against Yugoslavia, an official press release said.
</P>
<P>
Singh received the telephone call from his Russian counterpart
for a detailed exchange of views on the situation in Yugoslavia,
according to the release issued by the External Affairs Ministry
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers reiterated their serious concern over the
recent developments, particularly the unilateral use of force by
NATO and agreed that the two countries would continue to consult
with each other and coordinate their positions on this issue in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the press here this evening, Singh said his country had
been in close and constant touch with members of the Non-Aligned
Movement and all the other nations that have expressed concern
over NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued on Thursday, the External Affairs
Ministry urged NATO to stop the air strikes immediately, saying,
"This demonstration of its extra territorial engagement is a
development that can only cause anxiety."
</P>
<P>
The statement said such unilateral moves seriously undermine
the authority of the entire U.N. system, are in violation of the
U.N. Charter and amount to interfering in the internal affairs of
a country.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government reiterated that the Kosovo crisis could
only be resolved through peaceful means and a solution found
within the framework of the national sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Parties Heap Praise on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- In sharp contrast to usually
harsh criticism on the government, opposition party leaders Friday
paid warm tribute to President Nelson Mandela as parliament
formally bid him farewell.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the chief opposition New National Party, Marthinus
van Schalkwyk, said one of the freedoms all South Africans had to
cherish was that they were free to recognize greatness in somebody
who might sometimes have a different political outlook. Mandela
had the ability to be everybody' s president.
</P>
<P>
"You understood the intricate makeup of our nation and its rich
 diversity. You understood the need to heal the wounds of the
past," van Schalkwyk said.
</P>
<P>
"You are living proof that no jail can ever keep an idea
imprisoned. Ideas are stronger than any man-inspired barrier.
Convictions cannot be held captive forever."
</P>
<P>
Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said South
Africans could pay a fitting tribute to Mandela by ensuring that
the June 2 general election was free of violence, intimidation and
social tensions.
</P>
<P>
"If we manage to conduct the elections without violence and
intimidation, this will be the best tribute we can pay to
President Mandela's monumental contribution to the liberation of
our country.
</P>
<P>
"He lent his full self to perform the heavy and demanding role
of the positive forces which have worked to make South Africa
succeed and overcome some of its many difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party leader Tony Leon said: "Our respect and
admiration for him is unconditional. He graces this house. He
graces this country. He graces humanity."
</P>
<P>
Pan Africanist Congress parliamentarian Patricia de Lille,
speaking on behalf of party leader Stanley Mogoba, said Mandela's
legacy would remain for years to come.
</P>
<P>
She said Mandela's hard work and dedication had been an
inspiration to all.
</P>
<P>
African Christian Democratic Party leader Kenneth Meshoe said
Mandela is the greatest leader Africa has produced, and thanked
him for his exemplary leadership and commitment to reconciliation.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
suspended its session, originally scheduled for 10:30 a.m. EST,
and it will have a closed-door meeting at 11:00 a.m. EST to
discuss a draft resolution presented by the Russian Mission to
the United Nations, U.N. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door session will be followed by an open meeting,
which is expected to put the draft resolution to vote, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution asked the 15-member Security Council to
slam the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia as "a violation of
the U.N. Charter" and "a threat to the international peace and
security," and recommended the Council call for "an immediate
cessation" to the illegal and unilateral military action.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, strongly rejected by Britain and the
United States which are two permanent members having veto power on
the Council, will virtually have not any chance of being adopted.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Welcomes EU's Support for Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt on Friday expressed welcome
to the support offered by the European Union (EU) to a future
independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the day, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa spoke highly of EU's assertion that the right of the
Palestinians to self-determination should not be vetoed by any
party.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European organization released a statement
Thursday after a summit in Berlin that the Palestinians have an
"unqualified right to self-determination, including the option of
a state."
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced EU's readiness to "consider recognition of
a Palestinian state in due course."
</P>
<P>
The EU "is convinced" that the creation of a "democratic,
viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state" on the basis of
existing agreements and through negotiations would be "the best
guarantee to Israel's security," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has announced to declare an
independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule
period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord signed with Israel
expires. Arafat has been trying in recent weeks to win
international support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Moussa stressed the importance of EU's assertion of the
implementation of the land-for-peace principle in the Mideast
peace process and the "prompt and complete execution" of the Wye
peace accord signed last October between the Palestinians and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He hailed EU's call for a halt to all measures that undermine
the peace process, the Israeli settlement policy in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been stalled since
December when Israel shelved the Wye accord after carrying out the
first of the three-phased withdrawal from another 13 percent of
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Use Current Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Friday said the country might continue to use the Lancaster
Constitution as it is a perfect legal document.
</P>
<P>
"We have had in existence since 1980 a perfectly legal
constitutional document called the Constitution of the Republic of
Zimbabwe, on the basis of which this country has been functioning
as a state. It is a legal document perfectly in order and
therefore can remain like that," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on the occasion of the 37th session of the
ruling Zanu (PF) Central Committee held in Harare, the Zimbabwe
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe accused certain groups, which he said were mistaken, of
viewing the constitutional review exercise as an opportunity to
seek immediate political and legal empowerment.
</P>
<P>
He said these groups were coming together with a common
political purpose to empower themselves with full legal and
Constitutional authority to effect changes they conceived would
enable them to replace the Zanu (PF) government.
</P>
<P>
He said such members should be informed that the only valid way
of effecting change to that Constitution was through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Justice Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Emmerson
Munangagwa told Parliament on Thursday that Mugabe would announce
this week the 150 MPs would be in the national constitutional
commission and an equal number would be appointed from outside to
represent organizations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
The 300-member commission is set to be announced this weekend
but by Thursday afternoon the government and opposition National
Constitutional Assembly (NCA) had not agreed on who was to be in
that committee.
</P>
<P>
The NCA and the National Convention for Change have rejected
the proposed presidential commission on constitutional reform on
the argument that that body would be answerable only to the
President who decides who to appoint as well as whether to accept,
reject or modify its recommendations as he deems fit.
</P>
<P>
NCA Chairman Morgan Tsvangirai has said his organization was
not happy with the powers vested in the President as he might
change the results of the commission.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Promoting Disarmament Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
address made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva on March 26.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Ambassadors, Ladies and
Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament, located along Lac Lemon in
Geneva, is the single multilateral disarmament negotiating body in
the world today, and as such, it plays an indispensable role in
safeguarding world peace and security. What you are doing is an
arduous but lofty work.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on the 20th century, we see a century of
unprecedented wars and calamities and of the tenacious struggle by
people of all countries to achieve and safeguard world peace. The
two world wars and the Cold War, which lasted for more than four
decades, inflicted untold sufferings and pain on mankind and also
left behind profound lessons.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, major and profound changes have
taken place in the international situation. The world is moving
deeper toward multi-polarity and economic globalization, which is,
on the whole, conducive to the relaxation of international
situation and world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The turn of the century affords us a good opportunity to sum up
historical experience and lessons and shape a lasting peace for
the future. An overview of the current global reality reveals that
the Cold War mentality still lingers on an hegemonism and power
politics manifest themselves from time to time. The tendency
towards closer military alliance is on the rise. New forms of "
gunboat policy" are rampant. Regional conflicts have cropped up
one after another.
</P>
<P>
When air strikes and armed intervention were launched against
Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia two days ago, I promptly
expressed my deep concern and worry, and called for an immediate
cessation of military strikes, so as to bring the Kosovo issue
back to the track of political solution. I hereby solemnly
reiterate that the military actions against Kosovo and other parts
of Yugoslavia violate the norms governing international relations
and are detrimental to the peace of the Balkan region. The
international community, therefore, should make joint efforts to
defuse the crisis as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of arms reductions, I have to point out with
regret that military powers have not cut down their state-of-the-
art weaponry, not even a single piece. Furthermore, they are still
developing it. International efforts against nuclear proliferation
are faced with severe challenges. Under these circumstances, the
question of how to advance the disarmament process and safeguard
global security cannot but become an important and pressing task
that demands attention of all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that the old security concept based on
military alliances and build-up of armaments will not help ensure
global security, still less will it lead to a lasting world peace.
This then requires the cultivation of a new security concept that
meets the need of the times and calls for vigorous efforts to
explore new ways to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
We believe that the core of such a new concept of security
should be mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation.
The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and
peaceful co-existence and other universally recognized norms
governing international relations make up the political foundation
underpinning world peace. Mutually beneficial cooperation and
common prosperity constitutes the economic guarantee for world
peace. Dialogues, consultations and negotiations by parties
concerned on an equal footing are the correct approach to
resolving disputes and safeguarding peace. The establishment of a
new concept of security and a new just and fair international
order is the only way to fundamentally promote a healthy
development of the disarmament process and provide the guarantee
for international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The aim of disarmament is to increase security. And that must
be universal security for all countries to enjoy. All countries,
regardless of their size, strength and wealth, should have an
equal right to security. If the great majority of developing
countries cannot have security, there will never be tranquillity
in the entire world. Disarmament should not become a tool for
stronger nations to control weaker ones, sill less should it be an
instrument for a handful of countries to optimize their armament
in order to seek unilateral security superiority. To reduce the
armament of others while keeping one's own intact, to reduce the
obsolete while developing the state-of-the-art, or even to
sacrifice the security of others for one's own security and to
require other countries to scrupulously abide by treaties while
giving oneself the freedom of action by placing domestic laws
above international law, all these are acts of double standards.
They are a mockery of international disarmament efforts and run
counter to the fundamental purposes and objectives of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Historical experience shows that unrestrained arms build-up
will surely hamper economic growth and will not help maintain
peace and security. Disarmament should also serve to free up more
resources and create better conditions for the economic
development of all countries, developing countries in particular.
One of the criteria to judge a disarmament treaty is to see
whether it facilitates economic growth of various countries,
especially that of developing countries, and whether it helps to
strengthen international cooperation in science and technology. No
disarmament measure will be able to garner universal support or
have lasting viability if it is taken at the expense of the
economic or scientific development of most countries.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament is not the prerogative of the few. All countries
have the right to participate therein on an equal footing.
Multilateral disarmament treaties are the results of negotiation
through universal participation and therefore reflect the common
will of the international community. Some export control regimes
by a small group of countries can in no way compare with these
international treaties either in impartiality or in universality.
To maintain bloc arrangements after conclusion of multilateral
treaties and even place the former above the latter will only lead
to the weakening of the authority and universality of multilateral
treaties and subsequently affect the healthy development of the
international cause of disarmament. Therefore, vigorous efforts
should be made to strengthen the role of disarmament bodies of the
United Nations so that multilateral treaties may gradually replace
bloc arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Mr. President,
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years and more, hanging like a Damocles sword
above mankind, nuclear weapons have never ceased threatening the
survival of humanity. The end of the Cold War has not brought
about the disappearance of nuclear weapons. The nuclear reduction
process by the U.S. and Russia has bogged down in stalemate after
a brief period of progress. Nuclear weapon tests were again
conducted even after the conclusion of CTBT. These developments
have demonstrated clearly that today and for a long time to come,
nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament remain an
important task for the international community. To accomplish this
task calls for joint unremitting efforts by the international
community. We believe that at this stage, efforts should be made
to achieve progress particularly in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
I. As countries possessing the largest nuclear arsenals in the
world, the U.S. and Russia shoulder greater responsibilities for
nuclear disarmament. The two countries should effectively
implement the nuclear reduction treaties they have concluded and
on that basis continue to substantially cut down their respective
nuclear arsenals, thereby paving the way for the other nuclear-
weapon states to participate in the multilateral nuclear
disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
II. The NPT is both the basis of the international nuclear non-
proliferation regime and the prerequisite for progress in the
nuclear disarmament process. The NPT must be observed in full and
in good faith. Otherwise, international efforts for nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation would be seriously harmed. Those
countries which have not yet joined the NPT should do so at the
earliest possible date so as to make the treaty truly universal.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation and the
complete and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons are mutually
complementary. The complete elimination of nuclear weapons is the
objective that we are all striving for, while the prevention of
nuclear weapons proliferation is an effective means and a
necessary stage to that end. It was in line with this
understanding that China supported the indefinite extension of the
NPT. However, the indefinite extension of the NPT has by no means
given nuclear-weapon states the prerogative to permanently retain
their nuclear weapons. On the contrary, nuclear-weapon states
should faithfully fulfill their nuclear disarmament obligations so
as to promote, with concrete action, an early realization of
complete nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
III. Nuclear-weapon states should, as soon as possible,
undertake unconditionally and in a legally-binding manner not to
be the first to use nuclear weapons or use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states. On the first day when China entered
into possession of nuclear weapons, it openly announced that it
would never be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and
under any circumstances. It has also pledged in an unequivocal
manner thereafter that it will not use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states. Since the non-nuclear-
weapon states have explicitly forgone the development of nuclear
weapons, it goes without saying that they should be free from the
threat of nuclear weapons. Now that the Cold War has ended and the
relations between nuclear-weapon states have improved, the
conditions are ripe for them to commit themselves to mutual no-
first-use of nuclear weapons. China is ready to actively push for
the early conclusion of an international legal instrument on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
IV. Efforts should be made for early entry into force of the
CTBT according to the CTBT provisions. The recent nuclear tests
have made the early entry into force of the treaty a more pressing
task. As one of the first countries to have signed the treaty,
China will continue to work for the early entry into force of the
treaty. The Chinese Government will soon officially submit the
treaty to the National People's Congress for ratification.
</P>
<P>
V. Negotiations should be conducted as soon as possible for the
conclusion of a universal and verifiable Fissile Materials Cut-off
Treaty. Once concluded, the FMCT will be yet another major
achievement after the CTBT in the promotion of nuclear disarmament
and prevention of nuclear proliferation. All of you present here
are making intensive efforts to this end and I wish you success.
</P>
<P>
VI. On the basis of the above efforts, a convention on the
comprehensive ban of nuclear weapons should be negotiated. In view
of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of
biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively
prohibited, there is no reason why nuclear weapons which are of
greater destructive force should not be comprehensively banned and
thoroughly destroyed. What it takes to reach this objective is no
more than a strong political will.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate nuclear weapons and root out the dangers of
nuclear war is the common wish of the people throughout the world.
It is also an objective that the Chinese Government and people
have been unswervingly striving for. Let us all work together for
the ultimate realization of a nuclear-weapon-free world.
</P>
<P>
Progress in nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved without a
global strategic equilibrium and stability. The research,
development, deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti-
missile systems and the revision of, or even withdrawal from, the
existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic
equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative
impact on international security and stability and trigger off a
new round of arms race in new areas, thereby seriously obstructing
or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and
nuclear non-proliferation. The international community should pay
close attention to this and adopt necessary measures to preempt
such dangerous developments.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation. The tapestry of
the Hall of Prayer for Harvest in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing,
which is on display in the Palais des Nations as a gift from china
to the United Nations, gives expression to the wish of the Chinese
people for good weather, bumper harvests, national stability and
happiness of all peoples throughout the world. To work for peace,
stability, cooperation and development is the common proposition
of all the peace-loving countries and peoples, and the planet we
are living on should become a home where people can live together
in amity and peace and can enjoy their life and work. We should
never forget the bitter lessons of the two world wars and never
waver in our efforts for world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
As a famous Tang dynasty poet Li Bai had written: "A time will
come to ride the wind and cleave the waves, I will set my cloud-
white sail and cross the sea which raves." I am confident that
with common efforts of the world's people, a genuine will of all
statesmen of all countries and the hard work of all of you, the
disarmament cause will surely overcome one obstacle after another
and achieve continuous progress and the world will have a better
future.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Quiet After Second Night of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav capital appeared
calm following Thursday night's NATO bombings over the country,
but residents are busy stocking food and other daily necessities.
</P>
<P>
Road traffic was very thin Friday as many chose to stay at home
to save gas -- almost all gas stations around the city have
stopped dispensing oil.
</P>
<P>
Many opt to take public transport, but few buses are running
and at longer intervals.
</P>
<P>
Several Red Cross helicopters could be seen roaring across
overhead, whisking casualties from Thursday night's NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army General Staff said NATO attacked many army
barracks, in an apparent objective to inflict biggest possible
casualties.
</P>
<P>
He did not say how many were killed or wounded during the
raids, which targeted some 40 sites that included airports, air
defense systems, telecommunications centers, and command points.
</P>
<P>
People rarely talked with each other, but the NATO airstrikes
are in everybody's mind and the outrage is enormous.
</P>
<P>
Dejan, 23, said,"The Americans are committing the most
barbarous crimes in the world by bombing us." "Kosovo is our land
but the Americans, the so-called world cop, are trying to meddle
in our own matters."
</P>
<P>
Dejan said his home is located just 15 meters from a military
command facility that he believes would be eventually hit by the
air raids.
</P>
<P>
"We won't go anywhere. Only in here can I feel like a man. I am
ready to defend my country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Bombed in Third Wave of NATO Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Several suburban areas of
Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, were bombarded Friday in the
third wave of NATO air raids, the city's municipal information
center said in a radio report.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said that "enemy aviation is in action in the
zones of Mali Mokri Lug, Avala, Vozdovac and Topcider."
</P>
<P>
Studio B television in Belgrade reported that emergency
services were rushing to the scene.
</P>
<P>
Before the reported bombing, the sirens lasted about 40 minutes
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the sirens sounded, a U.S. television said that
the NATO had launched third round of airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage to Worsen in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the latest issue of a weekly review by the UCAH
available here Friday, despite plentiful rainfall in Angola this
year, it is very difficult to increase agricultural output as a
result of degenerating fighting in the north, east and the central
highland which are the country's major agricultural areas.
</P>
<P>
The renewed civil war has found a great number of farmers
giving up farming and joining the ever-increasing refugees, some
even fleeing to the neighboring countries for shelter.
</P>
<P>
The UCAH predicted that Angola's grain output in 1999 will not
be higher than 435,000 tons. In the meantime, the national demand
for grain will be at least 1.3 million tons. Therefore, the food
shortage will worsen.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Angola's food production was as high as 590,000
tons, but it still needed a total of 120,000 tons of international
aid, including 90, 000 tons of emergency assistance.
</P>
<P>
Although humanitarian institutions have sufficient food reserve
in Angola, it is very difficult to send it to the areas in ne, there have been f
ew responses.

<HEADLINE> EU Applicants to Forge Common Policy on Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Chief Negotiator on EU
Membership George Vassiliou said on Friday that the six applicants
for EU membership would try to forge a common policy to accelerate
the accession process.
</P>
<P>
Vassiliou made the remarks on the sidelines of the fifth
meeting of chief negotiators of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Poland and Slovenia. The two-day meeting opened on Friday
in Limassol, a Cypriot southern coastal town.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the six negotiators reviewed issues concerning
competition policy, free movement of goods and capital, the
financial aspects of the Agenda 2000 and potential coordination of
timetables.
</P>
<P>
The budget reforms agreed to by European Union (EU) leaders on
Friday is of paramount importance for the applicants, "because if
there was no agreement, then it is almost certain that there would
have been a delay in the accession process," said the Cypriot
chief negotiator.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed on a compromise package on budget reforms
after marathon talks during their Berlin summit.
</P>
<P>
The Agenda 2000 package aims to stabilize EU spending on farm
and regional aid programs that swallow most of its 94 billion
dollar annual budget.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990. It signed with the EU
an association agreement in 1972 and a customs union protocol in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Says Agenda 2000 Successful And Balanced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s Agenda
2000 reform package that worked out at the Berlin summit was a
successful compromise and a balanced one, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder told parliament in Bonn on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary debate only five hours after the reform
bill was finally passed at an all-night summit session in Berlin,
Schroeder said,"nevertheless all the partners, including us, can
be pleased with the result."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement that we achieved in Berlin is a clear signal to
European citizens, to the market and to the (EU) membership
candidates, that all of us in the end have put our common
responsibility before respective individual interests," Schroeder
told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor stressed that the Berlin summit succeeded in
restricting Brussels' spending to just 1.27 percent of the EU
gross national product, with Germany's net bill paid to EU to be
restricted then be cut down.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has set the two as top goals to reach during the first
half of year 1999, when it serves as EU rotating president.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also praised the stability of EU after the mass
resignation of EU executive earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"Because of mass resignation of the EU Commission, the united
Europe has been in the danger of a serious institutional crisis,"
he said, "Europe has in that situation showed its determination
and capability of action,"
</P>
<P>
At the Colognen summit scheduled for June, an employment
package for Europe and a plan for the necessary EU institutional
reform will be determined, Schroeder told the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Afghan Envoy Ends Peace Mission Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy for
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi concluded his peace mission and
returned Friday to New York after failing to secure a time frame
for the next round of intra-Afghan peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's mission, launched in mid-February this year from
Saudi Arabia, took him to Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Central
Asia and Russia where he held extensive talks with leaders of
these countries as well as the Afghan warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy is expected to present a report about his visit
to Secretary General Kofi Annan in New York next week.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the good offices of the countries in the region,
Brahimi's peace mission once appeared to be a success as the
warring factions in Afghanistan agreed to share power during talks
held from March 11 to 14 in Ashgabad, capital of Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Peace efforts were remarkably intensified in the region during
the past three months as Afghanistan's close neighbors like
Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan exchanged high-level
visits, culminating in Brahimi's trip to Afghanistan late
February for talks with the Taliban and the anti-Taliban alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, the decisive catalyst to Ashgabad talks seemed to be
the visit of Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris Shiekhmoradov to
Kandahar, the headquarters of the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The militia was observed to be ready to show respect to the
peace proposal of the Central Asian state, which had taken a
neutral stand on the Afghan civil war, and adopt a flexible
posture to improve its image in the international community.
</P>
<P>
In the presence of U.N. representatives, the Taliban and their
rival anti-Taliban alliance agreed in their three-day talks to
release 20 prisoners of war each and to form a shared executive, a
shared legislature and a shared judiciary.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to hold the next round of talks inside
Afghanistan at a mutually-agreed venue after Eid Kurban, a holy
Muslim festival which falls on March 28, in order to address the
other issues and implement the decisions already reached.
</P>
<P>
Their agreements were hailed by acting chief of the U.N.
special mission for Afghanistan, Andrew Tesoriere, who took part
in the talks, as "a very important first step."
</P>
<P>
But the following developments in the war-ravaged country were,
to some extent, beyond Brahimi's expectations: New fighting
erupted almost simultaneously in the three Afghan provinces of
Parwan, Bamyan and Saripul only several days after the talks.
</P>
<P>
What's more, when he again rushed to Afghanistan and met with
opposition commander Ahmad Shah Masood on Tuesday and held talks
with Taliban supreme leader Mulla Omar the following day, Brahimi
was disappointed with his failure to secure a time frame for the
proposed second round of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
All seemed to have changed in as short as 10 days and the two
sides both went back on the accord.
</P>
<P>
Masood refused to accept the leadership of the Taliban while
Omar ruled out the possibility of sharing power with Masood,
saying other factions would also demand representation if Masood
was given a share.
</P>
<P>
Omar is also reported to have told Brahimi that a decision on
whether or not to hold fresh talks with Masood will be taken only
after consultations with the Taliban Council, religious scholars
and Taliban commanders.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot decide about the negotiations with Masood's faction.
I will only float my suggestions in the proposed meeting of Shura
(council) members, religious scholars and commanders and they
would be the real authority to decide," Omar was quoted by chief
Taliban representative in Islamabad Saeed Haqqani as saying.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi now finds it difficult to proceed with the arduous
Afghan peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Haqqani who had participated in the meeting
between Brahimi and Omar in Kandahar Wednesday, Brahimi told Omar
that the United Nations favored continuation of the Afghan peace
talks between the Taliban and its rival factions.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. envoy had to go back to New York with deep
worries about possible resumption of large-scale fighting in the
war-torn country as the harsh winter is over.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Continue AIDS Sensitization Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said his country will continue AIDS sensitization campaign
through various means.
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge when addressing a national conference of
Islamic Medical Association of Uganda here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He attributed Uganda's success in drastically reducing the
number of HIV- positive or AIDS people to the sensitization
efforts the government and non- governmental organizations have
made so far.
</P>
<P>
More people should be educated about the dangers of this
incurable pandemic to increase the productivity of the people
across the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's HIV/AIDS rate has dropped from 30 percent in 1996 to
the present level of nine percent, said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is regarded as one of the few countries where AIDS was
discovered in early 1980s. The first case of AIDS was reported in
1982 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Now about 1.5 million of Ugandans are HIV positive and about
500,000 people have died of this epidemic ever since.

UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is expected to vote on a draft resolution on the ongoing NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, co-sponsored by Belarus and Russia,
Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is with the Security Council,

The draft resolution said that the Security Council affirms
that "such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant
violation of the United Nations Charter."
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution reaffirms the Council's "commitment to
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia," and "demands an immediate cessation of
the use of force against the Federal Republic Republic of
Yugoslavia and urgent resumption of negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Due to U.S. rejection, the draft has virtually no
chance of being adopted. The United States, a Council permanent

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Promoting Disarmament Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of the
address made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva on March 26.
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary-General, Ambassadors, Ladies and
Gentlemen,
</P>
<P>
The Conference on Disarmament, located along Lac Lemon in
Geneva, is the single multilateral disarmament negotiating body in
the world today, and as such, it plays an indispensable role in
safeguarding world peace and security. What you are doing is an
arduous but lofty work.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on the 20th century, we see a century of
unprecedented wars and calamities and of the tenacious struggle by
people of all countries to achieve and safeguard world peace. The
two world wars and the Cold War, which lasted for more than four
decades, inflicted untold sufferings and pain on mankind and also
left behind profound lessons.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the Cold War, major and profound changes have
taken place in the international situation. The world is moving
deeper toward multi-polarity and economic globalization, which is,
on the whole, conducive to the relaxation of international
situation and world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The turn of the century affords us a good opportunity to sum up
historical experience and lessons and shape a lasting peace for
the future. An overview of the current global reality reveals that
the Cold War mentality still lingers on an hegemonism and power
politics manifest themselves from time to time. The tendency
towards closer military alliance is on the rise. New forms of "
gunboat policy" are rampant. Regional conflicts have cropped up
one after another.
</P>
<P>
When air strikes and armed intervention were launched against
Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia two days ago, I promptly
expressed my deep concern and worry, and called for an immediate
cessation of military strikes, so as to bring the Kosovo issue
back to the track of political solution. I hereby solemnly
reiterate that the military actions against Kosovo and other parts
of Yugoslavia violate the norms governing international relations
and are detrimental to the peace of the Balkan region. The
international community, therefore, should make joint efforts to
defuse the crisis as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of arms reductions, I have to point out with
regret that military powers have not cut down their state-of-the-
art weaponry, not even a single piece. Furthermore, they are still
developing it. International efforts against nuclear proliferation
are faced with severe challenges. Under these circumstances, the
question of how to advance the disarmament process and safeguard
global security cannot but become an important and pressing task
that demands attention of all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that the old security concept based on
military alliances and build-up of armaments will not help ensure
global security, still less will it lead to a lasting world peace.
This then requires the cultivation of a new security concept that
meets the need of the times and calls for vigorous efforts to
explore new ways to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
We believe that the core of such a new concept of security
should be mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation.
The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and
peaceful co-existence and other universally recognized norms
governing international relations make up the political foundation
underpinning world peace. Mutually beneficial cooperation and
common prosperity constitutes the economic guarantee for world
peace. Dialogues, consultations and negotiations by parties
concerned on an equal footing are the correct approach to
resolving disputes and safeguarding peace. The establishment of a
new concept of security and a new just and fair international
order is the only way to fundamentally promote a healthy
development of the disarmament process and provide the guarantee
for international peace and security.

Kosovo and other parts of Yugoslavia two days ago, I promptly
expressed my deep concern and worry, and called for an immediate
cessation of military strikes, so as to bring the Kosovo issue
back to the track of political solution. I hereby solemnly
reiterate that the military actions against Kosovo and other parts
of Yugoslavia violate the norms governing international relations
and are detrimental to the peace of the Balkan region. The
international community, therefore, should make joint efforts to
defuse the crisis as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of arms reductions, I have to point out with
regret that military powers have not cut down their state-of-the-
art weaponry, not even a single piece. Furthermore, they are still
developing it. International efforts against nuclear proliferation
are faced with severe challenges. Under these circumstances, the
question of how to advance the disarmament process and safeguard
global security cannot but become an important and pressing task
that demands attention of all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
History tells us that the old security concept based on
military alliances and build-up of armaments will not help ensure
global security, still less will it lead to a lasting world peace.
This then requires the cultivation of a new security concept that
meets the need of the times and calls for vigorous efforts to
explore new ways to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
We believe that the core of such a new concept of security
should be mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation.
The five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and
peaceful co-existence and other universally recognized norms
governing international relations make up the political foundation
underpinning world peace. Mutually beneficial cooperation and
common prosperity constitutes the economic guarantee for world
peace. Dialogues, consultations and negotiations by parties
concerned on an equal footing are the correct approach to
resolving disputes and safeguarding peace. The establishment of a
new concept of security and a new just and fair international
order is the only way to fundamentally promote a healthy
development of the disarmament process and provide the guarantee
for international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Smoke Rises Above Belgrade After Air Strike: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Clouds of smoke rose above the
southwest skyline of Belgrade on Friday after local independent
television reported several suburbs had been hit by NATO
warplanes, a Reuters reported said.
</P>
<P>
A local television in the Yugoslav capital said emergency
services were rushing to the scene. Air raid sirens had blared in
Belgrade about 40 minutes before the reported bombing.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed, it would be the first attack in daylight on the
Belgrade area since NATO launched air raids on Wednesday night.
The television reported the air raid at 4.55 p.m. (1555 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"The attack on our capital has started," said the televiion
report.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Promoting Disarmament Process (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The aim of disarmament is to increase security. And that must
be universal security for all countries to enjoy. All countries,
regardless of their size, strength and wealth, should have an
equal right to security. If the great majority of developing
countries cannot have security, there will never be tranquillity
in the entire world. Disarmament should not become a tool for
stronger nations to control weaker ones, sill less should it be an
instrument for a handful of countries to optimize their armament
in order to seek unilateral security superiority. To reduce the
armament of others while keeping one's own intact, to reduce the
obsolete while developing the state-of-the-art, or even to
sacrifice the security of others for one's own security and to
require other countries to scrupulously abide by treaties while
giving oneself the freedom of action by placing domestic laws
above international law, all these are acts of double standards.
They are a mockery of international disarmament efforts and run
counter to the fundamental purposes and objectives of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Historical experience shows that unrestrained arms build-up
will surely hamper economic growth and will not help maintain
peace and security. Disarmament should also serve to free up more
resources and create better conditions for the economic
development of all countries, developing countries in particular.
One of the criteria to judge a disarmament treaty is to see
whether it facilitates economic growth of various countries,
especially that of developing countries, and whether it helps to
strengthen international cooperation in science and technology. No
disarmament measure will be able to garner universal support or
have lasting viability if it is taken at the expense of the
economic or scientific development of most countries.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament is not the prerogative of the few. All countries
have the right to participate therein on an equal footing.
Multilateral disarmament treaties are the results of negotiation
through universal participation and therefore reflect the common
will of the international community. Some export control regimes
by a small group of countries can in no way compare with these
international treaties either in impartiality or in universality.
To maintain bloc arrangements after conclusion of multilateral
treaties and even place the former above the latter will only lead
to the weakening of the authority and universality of multilateral
treaties and subsequently affect the healthy development of the
international cause of disarmament. Therefore, vigorous efforts
should be made to strengthen the role of disarmament bodies of the
United Nations so that multilateral treaties may gradually replace
bloc arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Mr. President,
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years and more, hanging like a Damocles sword
above mankind, nuclear weapons have never ceased threatening the
survival of humanity. The end of the Cold War has not brought
about the disappearance of nuclear weapons. The nuclear reduction
process by the U.S. and Russia has bogged down in stalemate after
a brief period of progress. Nuclear weapon tests were again
conducted even after the conclusion of CTBT. These developments
have demonstrated clearly that today and for a long time to come,
nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament remain an
important task for the international community. To accomplish this
task calls for joint unremitting efforts by the international
community. We believe that at this stage, efforts should be made
to achieve progress particularly in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
I. As countries possessing the largest nuclear arsenals in the
world, the U.S. and Russia shoulder greater responsibilities for
nuclear disarmament. The two countries should effectively
implement the nuclear reduction treaties they have concluded and
on that basis continue to substantially cut down their respective
nuclear arsenals, thereby paving the way for the other nuclear-
weapon states to participate in the multilateral nuclear
disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
II. The NPT is both the basis of the international nuclear non-
proliferation regime and the prerequisite for progress in the
nuclear disarmament process. The NPT must be observed in full and
in good faith. Otherwise, international efforts for nuclear
disarmament and non-proliferation would be seriously harmed. Those
countries which have not yet joined the NPT should do so at the
earliest possible date so as to make the treaty truly universal.
</P>
<P>
The prevention of nuclear weapons proliferation and the
complete and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons are mutually
complementary. The complete elimination of nuclear weapons is the
objective that we are all striving for, while the prevention of
nuclear weapons proliferation is an effective means and a
necessary stage to that end. It was in line with this
understanding that China supported the indefinite extension of the
NPT. However, the indefinite extension of the NPT has by no means
given nuclear-weapon states the prerogative to permanently retain
their nuclear weapons. On the contrary, nuclear-weapon states
should faithfully fulfill their nuclear disarmament obligations so
as to promote, with concrete action, an early realization of
complete nuclear disarmament.

<HEADLINE> DRC Rebel Leader Denies  Rwanda's involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of the Congolese
Democratic Coalition (RCD), the rebel movement in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) has told the press that the Rwandan
government was not involved in the recent massacre of 100
civilians in eastern Uvira in the DRC as reported.
</P>
<P>
Moise Nyarugabo, first vice president of the Coalition, said
the absurd and ludicrous allegations that the Mai Mai warriors who
were involved in the massacre were hired by the government of
Rwanda are aimed at tarnishing the good image of both the Rwandan
government and the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA), the Rwanda News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Under absolutely no circumstances would the Rwandan government
or its army sponsor a criminal gang to perpetrate the same type of
crimes as the Interahamwe whom the RPA is in pursuit in Congo,"
Nyarugabo highlighted.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyarugabo, the report by an international news
agency is a total fabrication by a small section of the
Banyamulenge who have been separated from the Coalition's
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
They were separated some time ago because they were responsible
for several crimes, including human rights violations, in eastern
Congo which were not compatible with the principles of the
Coalition and their allies, he said.

<P>
III. Nuclear-weapon states should, as soon as possible,
undertake unconditionally and in a legally-binding manner not to
be the first to use nuclear weapons or use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states. On the first day when China entered
into possession of nuclear weapons, it openly announced that it
would never be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and
under any circumstances. It has also pledged in an unequivocal
manner thereafter that it will not use or threaten to use nuclear
weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states. Since the non-nuclear-
weapon states have explicitly forgone the development of nuclear
weapons, it goes without saying that they should be free from the
threat of nuclear weapons. Now that the Cold War has ended and the
relations between nuclear-weapon states have improved, the
conditions are ripe for them to commit themselves to mutual no-
first-use of nuclear weapons. China is ready to actively push for
the early conclusion of an international legal instrument on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
IV. Efforts should be made for early entry into force of the
CTBT according to the CTBT provisions. The recent nuclear tests
have made the early entry into force of the treaty a more pressing
task. As one of the first countries to have signed the treaty,
China will continue to work for the early entry into force of the
treaty. The Chinese Government will soon officially submit the
treaty to the National People's Congress for ratification.
</P>
<P>
V. Negotiations should be conducted as soon as possible for the
conclusion of a universal and verifiable Fissile Materials Cut-off
Treaty. Once concluded, the FMCT will be yet another major
achievement after the CTBT in the promotion of nuclear disarmament
and prevention of nuclear proliferation. All of you present here
are making intensive efforts to this end and I wish you success.
</P>
<P>
VI. On the basis of the above efforts, a convention on the
comprehensive ban of nuclear weapons should be negotiated. In view
of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of
biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively
prohibited, there is no reason why nuclear weapons which are of
greater destructive force should not be comprehensively banned and
thoroughly destroyed. What it takes to reach this objective is no
more than a strong political will.
</P>
<P>
To eliminate nuclear weapons and root out the dangers of
nuclear war is the common wish of the people throughout the world.
It is also an objective that the Chinese Government and people
have been unswervingly striving for. Let us all work together for
the ultimate realization of a nuclear-weapon-free world.
</P>
<P>
Progress in nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved without a
global strategic equilibrium and stability. The research,
development, deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti-
missile systems and the revision of, or even withdrawal from, the
existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic
equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative
impact on international security and stability and trigger off a
new round of arms race in new areas, thereby seriously obstructing
or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and
nuclear non-proliferation. The international community should pay
close attention to this and adopt necessary measures to preempt
such dangerous developments.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation. The tapestry of
the Hall of Prayer for Harvest in the Temple of Heaven in Beijing,
which is on display in the Palais des Nations as a gift from china
to the United Nations, gives expression to the wish of the Chinese
people for good weather, bumper harvests, national stability and
happiness of all peoples throughout the world. To work for peace,
stability, cooperation and development is the common proposition
of all the peace-loving countries and peoples, and the planet we
are living on should become a home where people can live together
in amity and peace and can enjoy their life and work. We should
never forget the bitter lessons of the two world wars and never
waver in our efforts for world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
As a famous Tang dynasty poet Li Bai had written: "A time will
come to ride the wind and cleave the waves, I will set my cloud-
white sail and cross the sea which raves." I am confident that
with common efforts of the world's people, a genuine will of all
statesmen of all countries and the hard work of all of you, the
disarmament cause will surely overcome one obstacle after another
and achieve continuous progress and the world will have a better
future.
</P>
<P>
Thank you.

NICOSIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus top legislator Friday
called for an immediate end to NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Yugoslav Ambassador in Nicosia Ivan

<P>
He called for fresh and "sober" negotiations between the

<P>
The peoples of the European continent must realize that "at

He said that if the role of the European Union (EU) is confined
to strengthening economic ties among its member states, it "will

In order to survive, the EU must choose "to defend itself and

HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain are
destabilizing Zimbabwe because of their stance over its land
reform program, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said this in his address to members of the Harare Zanu
province at the ruling party's headquarters. They were
demonstrating in support of the sovereignty of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said American and British imperialists were well aware
that after the land issue was won the next target would be the
mines where the mineral wealth of the country was being exported
for the benefit of the few white people, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration follows the arrest of three Americans on
charges of illegal possession of firearms, and plotting to commit
acts of terrorism and sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The three Americans, Gary Blanchard, Joe Pettijohn and John
Dixon, were being charged under the Law and Order Act. They
appeared in court for the second time on Friday in Harare and were
remanded in custody to April 9.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe applauded the demonstrators for taking such a stance of
protesting in defence of the sovereignty of the country.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators led by ruling Zanu Harare Provincial Chairman
Tony Gara had intended to hand over a petition to the U.S.
Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The petition to the U.S. Embassy said it was a shame that the
country claimed to be a champion of human rights when its citizens
were busy committing terrorist acts in independent countries.
</P>
<P>
The petition said the U.S. wanted to remove President Laurent
Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) so that it would
put a puppet president because of its interests in the country's
diamonds.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Cultivation of New Security Concept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Friday stressed importance to cultivate a new security
concept that meets the need of the times and calls for vigorous
efforts to explore new ways to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Conference on Disarmament, he said that since
the end of the Cold War, major and profound changes have taken
place in the international situation and the world is moving
deeper towards multi-polarity and economic globalization, which is,
on the whole, conducive to the relaxation of international
situation and world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that an overview of the current global
reality reveals that the Cold War mentality still lingers on an
hegemonism and power politics manifest themselves from time to
time. The tendency towards closer military alliance is on the rise.
New forms of "gunboat policy" are rampant. Regional conflicts have
cropped up one after another.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that military powers have not cut down their
state-of-the-art weaponry, not even a single piece. Furthermore,
they are still developing it. International efforts against
nuclear proliferation are faced with severe challenges. Under
these circumstances, the question of how to advance the
disarmament process and safeguard global security cannot but
become an important and pressing task that demands attention of
all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "The old security concept based on military
alliances and build-up of armaments will not help ensure global
security, still less will it lead to a lasting world peace. This
then requires the cultivation of a new security concept that meets
the need of the times and calls for vigorous efforts to explore
new ways to safeguard peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"The core of such a new concept of security should be mutual
trust, mutual benefit, equality and cooperation. The five
principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial
integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful co-
existence and other universally recognized norms governing
international relations make up the political foundation
underpinning world peace. Mutually beneficial cooperation and
common prosperity constitutes the economic guarantee for world
peace. Dialogues, consultations and negotiations by parties
concerned on an equal footing are the correct approach to
resolving disputes and safeguarding peace. The establishment of a
new concept of security and a new just and fair international
order is the only way to fundamentally promote a healthy
development of the disarmament process and provide the guarantee
for international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of disarmament is to increase security. And that must
be universal security for all countries to enjoy. All countries,
regardless of their size, strength and wealth, should have an
equal right to security. If the great majority of developing
countries cannot have security, there will never be tranquillity
in the entire world. Disarmament should not become a tool for
stronger nations to control weaker ones, sill less should it be an
instrument for a handful of countries to optimize their armament
in order to seek unilateral security superiority.
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament is not the prerogative of the few. All countries
have the right to participate therein on an equal footing.
Multilateral disarmament treaties are the results of negotiation
through universal participation and therefore reflect the common
will of the international community."
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting. Vietnamese Ambassador Nguyen Quibinh, who
is the rotating president of the conference, welcomed Jiang on
behalf of all member states. He said Jiang's presence at the
conference demonstrated his support to disarmament and efforts in
the field by these countries.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting were Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
Minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Shi Guangsheng, Director of the Policy Research Office of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Teng Wensheng,

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Orders All to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye Friday directed all districts in Tanzania to carry out
HIV/AIDS prevention and control activities and integrate them with
local development plans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the launching of Medium Plan 111 for prevention
and control of HIV/AIDS in Tanzania, the Prime Minister said the
plans must be multi-sectoral in nature so that all stake-holders
could participate in the activities.
</P>
<P>
He said the districts must set aside resources and that the
Ministry of Health, regional authorities and other ministries
should assist in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also called on all ministries and
parastatals to formulate HIV/AIDS plans and incorporate the plans
in their development activities.
</P>
<P>
It is sad to note that most affected group by AIDS in Tanzania
is the youth, Sumaye said.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS is mostly affecting the sexually active age group between
15 and 50 years who are also members of the labor force critically
needed for socio-economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 1.5 million people in Tanzania, with a total
population of 30 million, have been infected with HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister appointed Tanzanian former president, Ali
Hassan Mwinyi, to be the chairman of the National Advisory
Committee on issues pertaining to prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Health, the Medium Term Plan 111
is aimed at preventing further spread of HIV and minimizing its
impacts on the society.
</P>
<P>
The function was attended by senior government officials,
foreign envoys, and people from non-governmental organizations
(NGOs).

and challenging the authority of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United

challenging the authority of the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"We would like to repeat our strong calls for an immediate

<P>
Qin made the statement after he voted for a draft resolution,

</P>

"China has always stood for peaceful settlement of disputes

"Settlement of the Kosovo issue should be based on the respect
for sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY and guarantee
of the legitimate rights and interests of all the ethnic groups in

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Wishes to Cooperate With China in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Agriculture and Fishery
Minister Carlos do Rosario said here Friday that his country would
like to cooperate with China in agriculture, stressing the
necessity of cooperation between the agricultural sector and
farmers in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during talks with the visiting trade delegation from
southwestern China's Chongqing City, Rosario said Chinese farmers
can form joint ventures with their Mozambican counterparts in
growing rice, cotton and other crops, as China is a big producer
of rice and cotton.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he wishes Chinese enterprisers can
participate in Mozambique's rural land development and
agro-sciences, saying that China is a world-level agricultural
power.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said Mozambique should learn from China in growing
cotton, though its cotton production has been raised from 20,000
tons in 1992 to 90, 000 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique, which has enough land for rice planting, is still
depending on imported rice, he said, so China should play its role
in helping Mozambique improve its rice production.
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture has, with the help of the Mozambican
government and the efforts of the farmers, developed very fast in
recent years, Rosario said, especially in maize which is now more
than self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Delin, head of the Chinese delegation and Secretary of
Chongqing City, said Chongqing has great potential of cooperation
in rice-planting and pig- raising, and wished both governments to
encourage its enterprisers to run joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Chongqing delegation arrived in Maputo Thursday for
an eight- day visit.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Outlines Priorities for Nuclear Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin Friday outlined six priorities for nuclear non-proliferation
and nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Conference on Disarmament, Jiang said that
efforts should be made to achieve progress particularly in the
following areas.
</P>
<P>
First of all, as countries possessing the largest nuclear
arsenals in the world, the U.S. and Russia should effectively
implement the nuclear reduction treaties they have concluded and
on that basis continue to substantially cut down their respective
nuclear arsenals, thereby paving the way for the other nuclear-
weapon states to participate in the multilateral nuclear
disarmament process.
</P>
<P>
Second, the NPT must be observed in full and in good faith.
Otherwise, international efforts for nuclear disarmament and non-
proliferation would be seriously harmed. Those countries which
have not yet joined the NPT should do so at the earliest possible
date so as to make the treaty truly universal.
</P>
<P>
Third, nuclear-weapon states should, as soon as possible,
undertake unconditionally and in a legally-binding manner not to
be the first to use nuclear weapons or use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear-weapon states.
</P>
<P>
Forth, efforts should be made for early entry into force of the
CTBT according to the CTBT provisions.
</P>
<P>
Firth, negotiations should be conducted as soon as possible for
the conclusion of a universal and verifiable Fissile Materials Cut-
off Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Sixth, on the basis of the above efforts, a convention on the
comprehensive ban of nuclear weapons should be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
"Progress in nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved without a
global strategic equilibrium and stability," Jiang said. "The
research, development, deployment and proliferation of
sophisticated anti-missile systems and the revision of, or even
withdrawal from, the existing disarmament treaties on which global
strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive
negative impact on international security and stability and
trigger off a new round of arms race in new areas, thereby
seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of
nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Saying that the Chinese nation is a peace-loving nation, Jiang
pointed out, "The planet we are living on should become a home
where people can live together in amity and peace and can enjoy
their life and work. We should never forget the bitter lessons of
the two world wars and never waver in our efforts for world peace
and security."
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting. Vietnamese Ambassador Nguyen Quibinh, who
is the rotating president of the conference, welcomed Jiang on
behalf of all member states. He said Jiang's presence at the
conference demonstrated his support for disarmament and efforts
made in the field by these countries.
</P>

Also present at the meeting were Vice Premier Qian Qichen,
Minister in charge of the State Development Planning Commission
Zeng Peiyan, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Shi Guangsheng, Director of the Policy Research Office of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Teng Wensheng,

<HEADLINE> AIDS Sensitization Booklet Launched in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A booklet on AIDS sensitization
was launched here Friday afternoon as another community effort to
warn the Ugandans on the dangers of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The booklet, entitled AIDS Education Through Imans, was
launched in the Islamic Medical Association of Uganda (IMAU) in
conjunction with United States Agency for International
Development.
</P>
<P>
The book contains IMAU's main programs launched in Uganda,
giving emphasis on changing people's behavior and educating and
empowering women communities.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its foundation in 1988, IMAU has trained and
supervised over 8,000 religious leaders and their teams of
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
These spiritually motivated community members have made
repeated home visits to over 100,000 families in 11 districts in
Uganda, offering accurate information on HIV/AIDS and motivation
for behavior change.
</P>
<P>
With its original aim of providing support to Moslem health
professionals, IMAU has laid the foundation for an Islamic
hospital, supported family planning services in 17 Islamic health
centers, organized conventions on topics related to Islam and
medicine and pioneered the first AIDS prevention program for
Uganda's Moslem community.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest population figures, 16 percent of
Uganda's 20 million people are Moslem. Moslem leaders feel this
number is underestimated and cite figures between 20 percent and
30 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
There are certain Moslem practices that have the potential to
increase the risk of exposure to the HIV virus. These practices
include male circumcision, abolition of the dead and possibly
polygamy.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is regarded as the source of AIDS. The first case of
AIDS in the country was recorded in 1982 and one tenth of the
population are said to be HIV positive, including 500,000 AIDS
cases.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of effective sensitization measures,
Uganda is now known for its innovative approaches to HIV
prevention. The HIV/AIDS rate dropped from over 30 percent in 1996
to nine percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Fails to Adopt Draft on NATO </HEADLINE>

UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday failed to adopt a draft resolution, co-sponsored by Russia,
Belarus and India, to blast the ongoing NATO unilateral military
action against Yugoslavia and demand an immediate end to the
illegal action.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution failed to pass the 15-member Security
Council after the vote of 3 to 12. China, Russia and Namibia
voted in favor and the other 12 members voted against the draft
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the beginning of the vote, Sergey Lavrov,
Russian permanent representative to the United Nations, told a
Security Council meeting that NATO's unilateral military action
violates the U.N. Charter and constitutes a threat to the
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"What's in balance is between the law and the lawless," he
said. "Today's vote is not only about the problem of Kosovo, it

They lashed out at the power politics and hegemony in the NATO
use of force against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent
country and also a member of the U.N. family.

<P>
Representatives of Canada, Slovenia and the Netherlands spoke

intervention in Kosovo, which has been regarded as an internal
affairs of Yugoslavia.

Peter Burleigh, charge d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the
United Nations, tried to defend the NATO military action against
Yugoslavia, which goes ahead without the authorization of the U.N.

It can encourage (Yugoslav) President (Slobodan) Milosevic to

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO forces bombed the southern
parts of Belgrade Friday afternoon in the third consecutive day of
air raids on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Missiles hit the outskirts of the city at the foot of Mt Avala,
higher parts of Vozdovac and the suburb of Mali Mokri Lug, Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the bombings caused any casualties, but
Tanjug said ambulances were standing ready to extend first aid
assistance to all citizens who might have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO struck targets near Belgrade
during the daytime. On Thursday morning, the Batajnica military
airport and an aircraft plant in Pancevo were bombed at around 9:
15.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army General Staff said earlier Friday that NATO
planes and cruise missiles attacked some 40 "objects and populated
areas" around the country Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The targets hit were predominantly army barracks, where
soldiers were housed, with an evident objective to inflict the
biggest possible casualties, Tanjug quoted the Army General
Staff's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose how many people, military and otherwise,
were killed or wounded in Thursday's raids, but Red Cross
helicopters could be seen flying to the southeast part of the city
at around noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
By targeting the living quarters of soldiers and striking also
during the day, NATO is apparently trying to wear down the
Yugoslav army's effective strength and weaken their morale.
</P>
<P>
But the Army General Staff press service said the servicemen
were defending their homeland with honor and courage and had
successfully overcome what it called the psychological phase of
the initial air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Sirens sounded again early Friday evening and the intervals
were much shorter than the previous night.

A press release issued Friday evening by the President's Office
said that the president called on all Ugandans to join together in
the spirit of Idd Adhuha when those who are better off share what
they have with the poor.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans are urged not to let this spirit end after the day but
to continue in that spirit throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
This festival should serve as a reminder to all of us to live a
life of sharing in order to uplift the living standards of those
poor people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Extending his good wishes to the Moslem community, Museveni
said he hoped they can achieve more in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
According to latest population figures, over 20 percent of the
20 million Ugandans are Moslems. This Idd Adhuha is coming to be
regarded as a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
Islam is the first religion in Uganda. It came to Uganda in
1852 together with Arab traders. But it was not widespread in the
country at that time. Some 25 years later, Christianity arrived in
Uganda and began to spread to the kingdoms here.

<HEADLINE> Southern Parts of Belgrade Bombed by NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO forces bombed the southern
parts of Belgrade Friday afternoon in the third consecutive day of
air raids on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Missiles hit the outskirts of the city at the foot of Mt Avala,
higher parts of Vozdovac and the suburb of Mali Mokri Lug, Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the bombings caused any casualties, but
Tanjug said ambulances were standing ready to extend first aid
assistance to all citizens who might have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO struck targets near Belgrade
during the daytime. On Thursday morning, the Batajnica military
airport and an aircraft plant in Pancevo were bombed at around
9:15.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army General Staff said earlier Friday that NATO
planes and cruise missiles attacked some 40 "objects and populated
areas" around the country Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The targets hit were predominantly army barracks, where
soldiers were housed, with an evident objective to inflict the
biggest possible casualties, Tanjug quoted the Army General
Staff's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose how many people, military and otherwise,
were killed or wounded in Thursday's raids, but Red Cross
holicopters could be seen flying to the southeast part of the city
at around noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
By targeting the living quarters of soldiers and striking also
during the daylight, NATO is apparently trying to wear down the
Yugoslav army's effective strength and weaken their morale.
</P>
<P>
But the Army General Staff press service said the servicemen
were defending their homeland with honor and courage and had
successfully overcome what it called the psychological phase of
the initial air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Sirens sounded again early Friday evening and the intervals
were much shorter than the previous night.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Build 40,000 Classrooms in 3 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Museveni made the announcement in the eastern town of Palisa
Friday afternoon, a press release from the President's Office
said.
</P>
<P>
The government will embark on an accelerated program of
classroom construction using pre-cast materials so that they can
be completed on schedule.
</P>
<P>
The UPE project provides free primary education for four
children in each family and pushes primary enrolment up to 5.2
million, representing doubling of the pre-UPE figure.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to maintain and improve the quality of primary
education, in the face of increased demand, focused on increasing
the number of trained teachers and classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Uganda aims at achieving the target of a pupil:classroom ratio
of 55:1 by 2002/2003 as compared with the 40:1 ratio that existed
before the UPE program.
</P>
<P>
To reach this target will require the construction of 26,000
permanent classrooms, the replacement of another 15,000 temporary
structures with permanent classrooms and the refurbishment of a
further 11,000 classrooms. This is expected to cost 200 billion
shillings (1.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although the budget for primary education increased by 49
percent in this fiscal year, Uganda still needs lots of donors'
money to construct the classrooms.

<HEADLINE> Blair Rationalizes NATO Strikes in Televised Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
took the unusual step of making a televised appeal to the British
people on Friday, saying that NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia were
"the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
"Fail to act now and the conflict would not stop at the borders
of Kosovo. We would have to deal with the consequences of
spiralling conflict and hundreds of thousands of refugees," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose appeal was carried on television and radio
stations, said "Nobody has tried harder than us. We tried for six
long months to keep (Yugoslav leader Slobodan) Milosevic to the
agreements he made."
</P>
<P>
"Those agreements were modest enough -- to stop killing
innocent people and driving them from their homes. Even now, if he
stopped, we could talk again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arguing the case for British involvement in the NATO attacks,
he said: "Do nothing and Milosevic will feel free to do as he
likes with the civilian population. They will be ground under his
heel."
</P>
<P>
"Of course there are risks. All military action has its risks
but taking action is the only chance justice has got," he said,
apparently eager to win public support for the air strikes
involving British naval and air forces.

<HEADLINE> Russian General Condemns NATO Attack on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- General Vladimir Lobov, former
Chief of General Staff of the Warsaw Pact forces and the Soviet
troops, Friday condemned the NATO attack on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Figaro, Lobov said
that NATO wants to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its founding
in triumph on the eve of the 21st century through the military
attack on Yugoslavia, the last stronghold in Europe which resists
U.S. expansion.
</P>
<P>
"But it will turn its jubilee in April into tragedy for all the
countries of the NATO bloc. Because Yugoslavia will not allow it
do it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lobov said that if NATO troops dare to penetrate into the
territory of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavs would surely resist.
</P>
<P>
He also accused French President Jacques Chirac, who has signed
many documents with Russian President Boris Yeltsin on European
security, of "treason" by associating France with the NATO
operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia has the resources to help any country in a
situation like that of Yugoslavia, but Belgrade has not asked for
it and Moscow does not want to impose it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Concerned About Russian Threats to Arm Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States, convinced
that Russia's angry reaction to the NATO attack on the Serbs is
geared to a domestic audience, expressed the hope Friday that
President Boris Yeltsin's suspension of ties to the alliance will
be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
"We will just have to watch and see what decisions Russia
makes," Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told The
Associated Press. "That depends on them."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin suspended cooperation with NATO to protest the attack.
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, meanwhile, hinted Russia would try
to get the U.N. arms embargo against Yugoslavia lifted, which
President Clinton said would be "a terrible mistake."
</P>
<P>
Russia ordered NATO's two top representatives in the country
Friday to leave. "We cannot now have any contact with the leaders
of NATO, including the secretary-general of the alliance, until
the aggression against Yugoslavia has stopped," Ivanov was quoted
as saying by the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is checking reports the Russians
already were providing Belgrade with weapons to resist the NATO
cruise missile and bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
"We are watching that closely with our eyes open," said another
senior U.S. official, who asked not to be identified. "We have
seen nothing definitive."
</P>
<P>
Russia joined with the United States and four European
countries in framing the proposed settlement for Kosovo that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has rejected. But Russia
also consistently has opposed the use of force against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin Wednesday called the NATO attack "naked aggression." He
added that if the fighting spread, Russia reserved the right to
take measures, "including those of a military character," to
defend itself and the security of Europe. However, he backed off
on that threat Thursday, as did Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Agenda 2000 Summit Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN March 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Agenda 2000
reform package that was worked out at the Berlin summit was a
successful compromise and a balanced one, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder told parliament in Bonn on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary debate only five hours after the reform
bill was finally passed at an all-night summit session in Berlin,
Schroeder said, "nevertheless all the partners, including us, can
be pleased with the result."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement that we achieved in Berlin is a clear signal to
European citizens, to the market and to the (EU) membership
candidates, that all of us at the end have put our common
responsibility before respective individual interests," Schroeder
told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor stressed that the Berlin summit succeeded in
restricting Brussels' spending to just 1.27 per cent of the EU
gross national product, and Germany's net bill to EU will have a
tendency to be restricted and then be shut down.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has set the two as top goals to reach during the first
half of year 1999, when it serves as EU's rotating president.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also praised the stability of the EU after the mass
resignation of EU executives earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"Because of en mass resignation of the EU Commission, the
united Europe has been in the danger of a serious institutional
crisis," he said. "Europe has in that situation showed its
determination and capability of action."
</P>
<P>
At the Colognen summit scheduled for June, an employment
package for Europe and a plan for the necessary EU institutional
reform will be decided, Schroeder told the parliament.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 3-Year Loan Arrangement for Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) approved on Friday a three-year loan arrangement
amounting to 349 million U.S. dollars for Zambia to support the
government's 1999-2001 economic and financial program.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian economy contracted by an estimated 2 percent last
year amid poor weather conditions, lower copper prices and a steep
fall in domestic revenue. The kwacha currency depreciated by 39
percent and the international reserves tumbled to 44 million
dollars by the end of 1998, or less than two weeks of import
cover.
</P>
<P>
"The government's 1999 program aims at restoring macroeconomic
stability and promoting sustainable growth by reducing inflation,
strengthening the external position and emphasising the critical
role of the private sector," the IMF said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said it expected Zambia to record 4 percent growth in
1999, rising to 4.5 percent in 2000 and 5.0 percent in 2001.
Inflation would fall to 21.6 percent this year and 11.6 percent in
2000, from 24.4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The gross reserves are expected to rise to 165 million dollars
by the end of 1999 and to 306 million dollars by end-2000.
</P>
<P>
"Steadfast implementation of the program for 1999 would
contribute to the restoration of private sector confidence and lay
basis for sustained economic growth over the medium term," the IMF
said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the loan to Zambia would be available in six
instalments, provided the economy met targets agreed with the IMF.
The first payout will be made on March 31.

French shares also finished the day in the red, despite
strength in oil stocks. The benchmark Cac 40 index was 21 points

<P>
Leading UK shares rose again on the day as investors became
more optimistic about the outlook for world markets.

The FTSE-100 index pulled ahead over the morning after Thursday
night's strong performance on Wall Street. A sharp mid-afternoon

BUCHAREST, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian government decided
Friday to take in 3,000 t0 4,000 Kosovo refugees who fled to
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile told foreign reporters that
the decision was made at Macedonia's request.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has been ordered to provide accommodation
and daily necessities to the refugees and a refugees center will
be set up in Caras-Severin County.
</P>
<P>
Expecting an influx of refugees from Yugoslavia after the NATO
launched airstrikes against Serbian targets Wednesday night, the
three Romanian counties bordering Yugoslavia and the nearby Arad
County turned schools and culture centers into temporary refugee
homes.
</P>
<P>
Many Romanians donated money and clothes to local Red Cross
societies and some Romanian cities invited Yugoslav children to
come and take refuge.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Prime Minister Ljupco Georgievski Thursday
criticized European countries for talking much but doing little on
what they called the humanitarian problem created by Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
He called on European countries and the United States to
provide assistance for the 20,000 Kosovo refugees presently in
Macedonia and those who are coming in from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Georgievski said that Macedonia will not allow NATO forces to
attack its neighboring countries including Yugoslavia from its
soil.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces currently in Macedonia will be allowed to enter
Kosovo only under the condition that Serbia and the ethnic
Albanians sign the peace deal and Yugoslavia invite the NATO force
into the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the NATO launched missiles from Macedonia
in military operations against Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia is ready to hold
discussions with anybody, anywhere, any time, said on Friday the
ambassador of Yugoslavia in Bucharest, Desmir Jevtic, citing that
Belgrade had always pronounced itself for a peaceful solution to
the problem in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed in a press declaration that his country was now
exposed to the air bombing only because it did not agree to giving
up a part of its territory and history.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ambassador said that NATO airstrikes
against Yugoslavia were tantamount to a premeditated destruction
of the United Nations Organization and that the new international
order, which certain big states wanted to impose with the help
from NATO, entailed the mandatory giving-up by the small states to
their own sovereignty, identity and liberty.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador expressed hope that Romania's balanced stand
would be central to its long-term orientation in the relations
with Yugoslavia. He said he was convinced that a NATO member state
can have, at the same time, good neighborliness relations with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we are witnessing the existence of friendship and
historic ties between the Romanian and the Yugoslav peoples at the
level of the ordinary citizens of Romania who are sending us daily
messages of support".

DOHA -- Qatar will cut its expenditures in the 1999-2000

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Overall Sino-European Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, Switzerland, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin addressed the Swiss business community here
Saturday, calling for the development of overall China-Europe
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-European relations occupy a very important
position in China's foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
Last year China and the European Union established a mechanism
for annual meetings between their leaders and agreed to build a
long-term and stable China-EU constructive partnership oriented
towards the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
West Europe has become China's third largest trade partner with
their two-way trade volume reaching over 50 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998, he said, adding that it has also been a key source of
foreign capital and advanced technology for China.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s Swiss investment in China has
grown rapidly, he noted, adding quite a number of big Swiss
companies have enjoyed great popularity in China and conducted
fruitful cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an ever-increasing number of small and medium-sized
Swiss enterprises have begun to enter into China's market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said it is imperative that the two sides
continue to work to maintain the sound momentum of the bilateral
relationship as it serves the common interests of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprising that China and European countries have
differences in social system, development level, cultural
tradition and values and hold divergent views on some issues," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, "These differences and divergent views should
not become elements impairing the Sino-European relationship."
</P>
<P>
"Instead they should serve as a driving force for promoting
Sino-European dialogue and enhancing mutual understanding and
cooperation," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Flying Eagles Ready for Battles at Youth Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's under-20 football team
Flying Eagles is ready for battles at the forthcoming 10th World
Youth Soccer Championship (WYSC) tagged Nigeria '99 following a
week-long training tour in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The team is expected to be back home Saturday and to embark on
last minute training before the opening of the WYSC on April 3 at
the National Stadium in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily Times quoted a source close to the team as saying
Friday that chief coach Tunde Disu had addressed the lingering
problems of attack, midfield and defence.
</P>
<P>
Disu has already beefed up the attack with tested hands who,
the source said, received special training on marksmanship which
prepares the team physically and technically for action.
</P>
<P>
"I have, in collaboration with the technical crew, made the
right selection and put the right men at the right places," the
coach noted.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that Disu is very optimistic his boys
have the capability of overcoming any opposition, based on the
Flying Eagles' current top form.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, arrangements have been concluded for the friendly
tie between Paraguay and South Korea scheduled for Lagos on March
31.
</P>
<P>
Football analysts noted that Disu will learn some lessons from
the encounter between South Korea and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Before their training tour, the team had studied video tapes of
some likely opponents from South American countries including
Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, and other information on the teams
which may present strong opposition to the Flying Eagles'
intention of hosting to win.
</P>
<P>
Determined to host and win the championship, the technical
department of the Nigerian Football Association has made a
decision to dispatch some of its seasoned coaches to all the eight
designated venues for the championship in the country.
</P>
<P>
The coaches are assigned to compile technical data on likely
opponents the Flying Eagles may face in the course of the
championship.
</P>
<P>
According to coach Disu, all the lapses identified during the
just concluded African Youth Championship (AYC) in Ghana, where
the Flying Eagles lost to the host team, have been addressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that his boys are in high spirit and have learnt a
great lesson from the AYC and firmly resolved to be businesslike
at every match during the coming championship.

<HEADLINE> China to Open Wider to Outside World: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, Switzerland, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China will adhere to
its opening up policy and further improve the environment for
overseas investment, visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here Saturday while addressing the Swiss business community.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "We are firm in opening wider to the outside world
and carrying on its external economic ties, trade and technical
cooperation by further improving the environment for overseas
investment, expanding the sectors open to such investment step by
step and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of
overseas-funded enterprises."
</P>
<P>
By doing so, China will be able to achieve new growth in
foreign trade and overseas investment utilization, he said, adding
this is conducive not only to the stability and development of
China's economy but also to the stability and development of the
finance and economy of Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Jiang believed that "As much as China cannot develop in
isolation from the world, the world needs China for its
development."
</P>
<P>
China's stability and prosperity will open up a broad vista for
its friendly cooperation with Switzerland and the rest of Europe
and make greater contributions to peace, development and stability
of the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades since the introduction of reform and
opening-up, China has achieved progress attracting worldwide
attention, the president told his audience.
</P>
<P>
He said China's national economy has made a sustained and
steady development with an average annual growth rate of 9.8
percent, a manifold increase in the income for both urban and
rural residents and remarkable improvement in the material and
cultural life of the people in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China has leapt to the seventh place in the world in terms of
economic aggregates and the 10th in world trading status, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also said China now has a foreign exchange reserve
amounting to 145 billion U.S. dollars, and has, on an annual basis,
become the second largest recipient of foreign investment in the
world.

DHAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Denmark will provide assistance to
Bangladesh in strengthening a seed pathology laboratory at
Bangladesh Agricultural University, the official BSS news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed here Saturday, the Danish government

<HEADLINE> Jiang Puts Forward Proposals On New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, Switzerland, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Saturday urged the international community to
establish a new world order to meet the changes of the times, and
put forward five fundamental principles for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Swiss business community, Jiang said that
first it was essential to adhere to the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-
aggression and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Second, it was essential to adhere to the principle of the
peaceful settlement of international disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Disputes between countries and conflicts within a
region should be fairly and rationally resolved step-by-step
through peaceful negotiations and consultation based on equality,
rather than through frequent resort to force or threat of force on
the strength of one's military advantages."
</P>
<P>
He called for a complete abandonment of the Cold War mentality
and various forms of power politics.
</P>
<P>
Third, it was essential to adhere to the principle of sovereign
equality of all countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong
or weak, were equal members of the international community and had
the right to participate in world affairs on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"No country or bloc of countries have the prerogative to
override the international community," he note. "It is essential
to fully respect and give play to the positive role of the United
Nations in safeguarding world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Fourth, it was essential to adhere to the principle of
respecting the national conditions of each and every country and
seeking common ground.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president stressed that "Every country is entitled
to choose its social system, road to development and way of life
independently in line with its own national conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said that the differences between countries in historical
background, cultural tradition, social systems and values should
be respected and should not become obstacles to the development of
normal state-to-state relations, even less should they become
excuses for interfering in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, it was essential to adhere to the principle of mutually
beneficial cooperation and common development.
</P>
<P>
He called on both developed and developing nations to work
together for their common development on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also warned that no country should make use of its
economic, technological and financial advantages to damage the
economic security and development of other countries.

<HEADLINE> France Rules Out Escalation of War in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Saturday that he did not believe there was any risk
of an escalation of the war in Yugoslavia, after Russia reacted
strongly to NATO's Operation Deliberate Force.
</P>
<P>
"Is there a risk of escalation? I don't think so," said Vedrine
at a national convention of the Socialist Party in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that although some people in Russia had called for an
intervention in Yugoslavia, the Russian leaders had not changed
their fundamental policy.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental axis of the Russian leaders has not changed,
their objective is to develop their country, whatever difficulties
they meet they will work with us, notably with Europeans," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purpose of the NATO operation against
Yugoslavia was to "break the machine of repression" and then "
return to the field of political solution" for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He echoed an appeal by President Jacques Chirac to Yugoslavia,
saying that President Slobodan Milosevic can stop "this chain of
things whenever he wants", if he agreed "to work within the
framework of the agreements of Rambouillet".

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Far from stopping the Serb violence in Kosovo, the bombings
of NATO seem to have intensified it. As Kosovo is almost closed to
the outside world, reports and testimonies on massacres of ethnic
Albanians are coming out little by little.
</P>
<P>
-- The warplanes of the allied forces of NATO were faced with
the dilemma as for what targets they should strike on Friday, the
third day of bombings in Yugoslavia. It became a question whether
NATO should only bomb anti-air defense system of the Serbs while
the Serb forces continue their attack on Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO has admitted the limit of its power to stop Serbs from
attacking Kosovo Albanians through bombing. The NATO Supreme
Commander in Europe, General Wesley Clark, said on Friday that so
far NATO planes and missiles have attacked 40 targets in
Yugoslavia, but only one was destroyed and 10 severely hit. He
also said that NATO ``does not have any means to stop the Serb
forces or prevent the killings'' in the field.
</P>
<P>
-- After less than one year of negotiations, the second largest
Japanese automaker Nissan and the biggest French automaker Renault
have struck a deal on alliance. Renault will buy one third of the
capital of Nissen with 30 billion francs (5 billion U.S. dollars)

<HEADLINE> Macao Sets Up Committee for Handover Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A committee for the celebrations of
Macao's return to the motherland was established here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Wang Qiren,
director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch; and Chen Ziying,
deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under
the Chinese State Council, were present at the inaugural ceremony
of the committee.
</P>
<P>
The 880 committee members, coming from industrial and
commercial, labor, women, youth, cultural, athletic, educational,
art and other areas, form a general assembly under which are a
presidium, an advisory committee and an executive committee.
</P>
<P>
Ma, also deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the
Macao Special Administrative Region, said at the ceremony that the
celebrations committee will focus on taking the advantage of the "
one country, two systems" policy, absorbing those who love the
country and Macao and creating a bright future.
</P>
<P>
He said the task of the committee is to organize grand
celebrations to be participated mainly by the local people, but
people from the mainland and from abroad will also be welcome. The
committee will also coordinate non-government activities.
</P>
<P>
Ma said the committee hopes to make people of both the mainland
and abroad learn more about Macao and to seek more friendly
cooperation and support.

<HEADLINE> Trial on Bridge Case Attracts Public Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Court hearings on the bridge
that collapsed in southwest China's Chongqing Municipality killing
40 people are drawing wide attention across the country as they
are broadcast live nationwide by China Central Television (CCTV).
</P>
<P>
The Rainbow Bridge disaster happened on January 4 and was
blamed on poor engineering. Apart from the dead, 14 people were
injured and the damage was estimated at 6.31 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the hearings, many shops are closed and most local
residents stay at home to watch the live broadcast from Qijiang
County.
</P>
<P>
A women shop owner who asked for anonymity, told Xinhua, "The
people of Qijiang were hoping that this open trial would be
influenced by public opinion."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yuanhong, a 22-year old girl whose fiance died in the
accident, was watching TV reports of the hearings from her
hospital bed, while many other relatives of victims have traveled
to Chongqing from as far afield as 100 km to await the court's
judgment.
</P>
<P>
The mother of Xu Yuanping, a man killed in the bridge collapse,
said, "I never thought the trial would be broadcast live across
the country," adding that she is very much at ease now and
believes those responsible will be punished in accordance with the
law.
</P>
<P>
The municipal procuratorate has already ordered the prosecution
of five government officials for dereliction of duty and taking
bribes, and of another eight people, including government
officials and businessmen, for causing the major engineering
accident by producing subquality products and embezzling funds
which should have been used to make the bridge safer.
</P>
<P>
The hearings on these two groups will be conducted separately
from March 26-27 and from April 1-3.
</P>
<P>
The county government of Qijiang has deemed it a good
opportunity for local people, especially government officials, to
learn about the law. "It is the best form of legal education,"
said Deputy Magistrate Xu Tingjiang, "And it also shows how China
has taken major steps forward in its efforts to enhance the rule
of law and make the judiciary more open."
</P>
<P>
The trial has caused great concern in the construction industry
and many companies have instructed their staff to watch the live
TV broadcast, while construction workers on the Three Gorges Dam
project have also been recommended to watch the program.

<HEADLINE> Floods Hit Somalia's Balad Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy floods caused by the bank
burst of River Shabelle hit the town of Balad, some 30 kilometers
north of Mogadishu Friday night.
</P>
<P>
One local traditional leader, Wabar Hussein Islaw Osman, told
Xinhua on telephone Saturday that three out of the four
residential quarters of the town have been affected.
</P>
<P>
Wabar said the residential quarter of Waberi in Balad town, the
worst affected, has been totally inundated.
</P>
<P>
According to him, hundreds of families from Waberi, Halgan and
Horsed residential quarters have evacuated whatever they could
from their houses to the only safer area of the town.
</P>
<P>
The flooding water of the river has also crushed several
mosques. "The water is as high as one meter and even going up and
up as the time passes by," said Wabar.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities of the town said the flooding was not
expected to happen overnight since the river had been somehow dry
before Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The river became full only last night owing to the rains that
have fallen into the Shawa mountains of Ethiopia." said Wabar
Hussein. "Our river usually becomes full at this time of the year
but it would gradually do so, thus giving us an early warning."
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have attributed the reason for the
unexpected flooding to the closure of the main dam of the town
about three kilometers east of the town .
</P>
<P>
Wabar said the dam has been closed since last year after the
rains and floods and the keys were taken away by clannish gunmen
who sold the water to the poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
The dam, built in 1974, has since been used as a water
reservoir for some businessmen who sold the water to the
subsistence farmers during the dry seasons.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities of the town have expressed concern that
the situation will even go worse unless something is done against
the flow of the water.
</P>
<P>
Waber also said the main bridge of the town is being
endangered as the level of the water is getting higher and
higher.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nokia Company has set up six
joint ventures in China, indicating its booming business in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The company held an exhibition here on Friday displaying its
developments over the past 13 years since it set up the first
China branch in Beijing in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, Nokia has hired over 3,000 employees, 90 percent
Chinese, 20 representative offices working in its 20 customers'
service centers, three technical training centers and 30
maintenance centers.
</P>
<P>
The company's major products in China include mobile telephones,
GSM stations and digital transferring systems and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Now many kinds of Nokia products, such as mobile phones which
can display short messages in Chinese, are very popular in China.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the company developed a number of world-
advanced telecommunications products for the Chinese market
including a mobile office system and a new variety of mobile
phones which can link with the Internet anywhere easily.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Involved in Salt Production Over 3,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Researches show that the Chinese
were the earliest and most prolific salt producers in the world in
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
An excavation team composed of Chinese and U.S. archeologists
recently worked on a number of ancient salt wells and other salt-
making facilities in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that these ancient salt mills are more than 3,
000 years old and were more technologically advanced than those in
North America and other parts of the world in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is known as the "home of salt produced from wells", but
people used to believe that Sichuan's salt industry only started
some 1,000 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Overall Sino-Europe Cooperation, New International Order (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In retrospect of the outgoing century, the world has gone
through great vicissitudes. It is in this century that mankind has
created tremendous material wealth and advanced results of
civilization unparalleled in history. However, mankind also
suffered the unprecedented scourge of the two world wars
unimaginable to the forefathers. The wheels of history continue to
roll on after traversing tortuous and rugged road. Significant
changes are taking place on earth at the threshold of the new
century. Peace and development have become the common desire of
the people of all countries and an irresistible historical trend.
The trend towards a multipolar world and economic globalization is
growing in depth, exerting an unprecedented and profound impact on
the political, economic and cultural life of mankind. The
development and progress of history bring new hopes as well as new
challenges to the people of all countries.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, the international situation continues to move
towards relaxation. The forces for world peace and stability keep
growing. Nevertheless, regional tension and many destabilizing
factors still linger on. There exists a widening gap between the
rich and poor countries, new developments of hegemonism and power
politics, and the danger of escalation of armed conflicts in
certain regions. The world is still not a tranquil place. The
military strikes launched these days against Kosovo and some other
parts of Yugoslavia are a fitting example in this regard. The
world is still far from tranquil. A typical case in point is the
military strikes against Kosovo and other regions of Yugoslavia in
recent days. All this shows that the lofty mission of maintaining
world peace and promoting common development remains an uphill and
protracted battle.
</P>
<P>
World multipolarization is an inevitable trend independent of
man's will. The relations between major countries and even the
international relations as a whole are undergoing readjustment. A
historic breakthrough has been made in the European integration
process. The vast number of developing countries are playing an
ever greater role in international affairs. Various regional
organizations are more active than ever. Countries have further
enhanced their awareness of being independent. Hegemonism and
power politics have become more and more unpopular. The trend
towards multipolarity serves the interests of world peace and
development but at the same time, the evolution process is fraught
with contradictions and struggles.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization is the product of economic development
and scientific and technological advancement of the world of today.
It brings new risks as well as new opportunities to the
development of all countries. The extensive spread of the
financial crisis that originated in some East Asian countries has
not only reflected the close links between the economies of
different countries in the context of economic globalization, but
also the serious drawbacks and defects of the current
international financial system and economic order. It is
imperative to reform the old international financial system and
economic order so as to guard against financial and economic risks
and promote the financial and economic security of all the
countries.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis can not only hurt developing countries,
but also hit and leave an impact on developed countries. All the
members of the international community should step up cooperation
and work together to maintain the steady growth of the world
economy in a spirit of sharing responsibilities and risks. The
developed countries that occupy a leading position in the world
economy should undertake more obligations and take practical and
effective measures to help the cash-strapped and crisis-afflicted
developing countries out of the predicament at an early date. Only
when all the members of the international community join forces
and conduct mutually beneficial cooperation can the world enjoy
real prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
A globalized economy calls for globalized coordination and
cooperation. A changed world requires the establishment of a
corresponding new international order. To push for the
establishment of a peaceful, stable, just and equitable new
international political and economic order has become a pressing
subject facing all the countries.
</P>
<P>
Here, I would like to share with you China's basic propositions
on the establishment of a new international political and economic
order.
</P>
<P>
In our view, the new international political and economic order
should be established in the light of the actual conditions of the
world today and should give expression to the universal
aspirations and common interests of the people of all countries
and reflect the historical development and meet the needs of
future progress. The well-known Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence which came into being in the 1950s and other generally
recognized norms governing international relations should underpin
the new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
First, it is essential to adhere to the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-
aggression and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
Compliance with these principles is duly required by peaceful
coexistence and constitutes its prerequisite.
</P>
<P>
Second, it is essential to adhere to the principle of peaceful
settlement of international disputes. Disputes between countries
and conflicts within a region should be fairly and rationally
resolved step-by-step through peaceful negotiations and
consultation based on equality, rather than through frequent
resort to force or threat of force on the strength of one's
military advantages. The Cold-War mentality and various forms of
power politics arising therefrom should be completely abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Third, it is essential to adhere to the principle of sovereign
equality of all the countries in the world. Countries, big or
small, rich or poor, strong or weak, are equal members of the
international community and have the right to participate in world
affairs on an equal footing. No country or bloc of countries have
the prerogative to override the international community. It is
essential to fully respect and give play to the positive role of
the United Nations in safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, it is essential to adhere to the principle of
respecting the national conditions of each and every country and
seeking common ground while shelving differences. Every country is
entitled to choose its social system, road to development and way
of life independently in line with its own national conditions.
The differences between countries in historical background,
cultural tradition, social system and values should be respected
and should not become obstacles to the development of normal state-
to-state relations, even less should they become the excuses for
interfering in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, it is essential to adhere to the principle of mutually
beneficial cooperation and common development. Developed as well
as developing countries should cooperate with each other and
develop together on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The
irrational old international economic order should be rectified to
the benefit of the rights and interests of all the countries, the
vast numbers of developing countries in particular. No country
should make use of its economic, technological and financial
advantages to damage the economic security and development of
other countries.
</P>
<P>
We will soon ring in the 21st century. Let us work together
with the people of all the countries for the establishment of a
peaceful, stable, fair and equitable new international, political
and economic order and the creation of a new world of lasting
peace and universal prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Muslims in Malaysia Urged to Maintain Close Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Saturday called on Muslims in the country to
strive to maintain close ties among themselves.
</P>
<P>
They should remain united and would always strive to uphold the
dignity of Islam and avoid tarnishing the sanctity of the religion
by giving in to temptation or resorting to irresponsible actions,
he said in his message on Aidiladha which falls on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the peaceful situation in the country had enabled
the government to ensure the progress of the Muslim community to
be on par with the non-Muslims in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He said Muslims in the country should refrain from placing
emphasis on their own personal interest or the interest of certain
groups which could lead to disunity and quarrels among them.
</P>
<P>
"It is our effort to restore the dignity of Muslims who have
for so long been looked down at by some others," Mahathir said,
adding that the Muslim community in the country should be grateful
for being able to enjoy progress and comfort.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed to thwart their evil intentions and defend our
country's independence. And what was most important is that the
government's measures to balance the economic disparity among the
various races have succeeded in preserving peace and harmony among
us Muslims and our non-Muslim friends," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said such peace and harmony had allowed peoples of different
religions in the country to freely practice their religions.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the celebration this year was more meaningful
because due to the sacrifices and cooperation of the people who
supported the government's policies, the government had been able
to gradually overcome its economic problems.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Urges Overall Sino-Europe Cooperation, New International Order (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, Switzerland, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin addressed to the Swiss business community
here Saturday, calling for the development of overall China-Europe
cooperation and promotion of the establishment of a new
international order. The full text of his speech runs as follows.
</P>
<P>
It gives me great pleasure to come to Switzerland, a
picturesque country, and meet friends from the Swiss business
community in Basel, a place of strategic economic importance and
an industrial center. I would like to take this opportunity to
extend cordial greetings and good wishes to personages from all
quarters of Switzerland who have contributed to the development of
Sino-Swiss friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland was among the first European countries to recognize
the People's Republic of China and is China's important
cooperation partner in West Europe. Over the past 50 years, the
two countries have made steady progress in multi-sphere exchanges
and cooperation. The economic cooperation and trade, in particular,
have displayed a momentum of constant improvement with the two-way
trade volume going up year by year. Since the beginning of the
1990s, Swiss investment in China has grown rapidly. Quite a number
of big Swiss companies have enjoyed great popularity in China and
conducted fruitful cooperation with their Chinese counterparts.
Meanwhile, an ever-increasing number of small and medium-sized
Swiss enterprises have begun to enter into China's market.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that our two sides continue to work to
maintain the sound momentum of the bilateral relationship as it
serves the common interests of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the process of West European integration has
been constantly deepening. The launch of euro, in particular, has
been a focus of world attention. West European countries are
playing an important role in international affairs. China has all
along supported European countries in their efforts for world
peace and common development.
</P>
<P>
Sino-European relations occupy a very important position in
China's foreign relations. There have been an increasingly
frequent exchange of high-level visits between China and European
countries, enhanced political consultations and dialogues and
growing mutually beneficial cooperation in various areas. Last
year China and the EU established a mechanism for annual meetings
between their leaders and agreed to build a long-term and stable
China-EU constructive partnership oriented towards the new century.
West Europe has become China's third largest trade partner with
their two-way trade volume reaching over 50 billion U.S. dollars
in 1998. It has also been a key source of foreign capital and
advanced technology for China. We are gratified with the
development of the Sino-European relationship.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, we see a huge potential for the
furtherance of Sino-European relations. China and European
countries are important forces on the international stage and
share wide-ranging interests in safeguarding world peace and
stability and promoting common economic development, etc. China is
dedicated to reform, opening-up and the modernization drive while
West Europe is working hard to build on its integration. This has
given a new impetus to increased friendly exchanges and
cooperation. Being the biggest developing country in the world,
China has rich human resources and an enormous market. As a region
with the largest number of developed countries, West Europe boasts
abundant capital and advanced technology. The two sides enjoy a
high degree of complementarity in the economic, trade, scientific
and technological fields. China and West Europe, both with a long
history and a brilliant culture, have made outstanding
contributions to human civilization and progress. They may learn
from each other and make improvement together in such fields as
the natural science, social science, culture and arts. These
common points have provided a solid foundation for the
establishment and development of the Sino-European constructive
partnership.
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that China and European countries have
differences in social system, development level, cultural
tradition and values and hold divergent views on some issues.
These differences and divergent views should not become elements
impairing the Sino-European relationship. Instead they should
serve as a driving force for promoting Sino-European dialogue and
enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation. As long as our two
sides handle pragmatically and prudently our relations from a
strategic and long-term point of view and in a spirit of mutual
respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences, mutual
benefit and complementarity as well as common development, we can
very well bring a dynamic Sino-European constructive partnership
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades since the introduction of reform and
opening-up, China has achieved progress attracting worldwide
attention. The national economy has made a sustained and steady
development with an average annual growth rate of 9.8 percent, a
manifold increase in the income for both urban and rural residents
and remarkable improvement in the material and cultural life of
the people in 1998. China has leapt to the seventh place in the
world in terms of economic aggregates and the 10th in world
trading status. It has a foreign exchange reserve amounting to 145
billion U.S. dollars, and has, on an annual basis, become the
second largest recipient of foreign investment in the world. Full
of confidence, the Chinese people are pressing forward along the
path initiated by Mr. Deng Xiaoping, a path of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Asian financial crisis sent a strong shockwave
to China, and the disastrous floods also inflicted a heavy loss on
its national economy. In face of such a domestic and external
economic environment, the Chinese government has resolutely
introduced a proactive fiscal policy to ensure steady economic
growth and maintain a stable RMB by increasing input and expanding
domestic demand. While persisting in the basic state policy of
reform and opening-up and vigorously implementing the strategies
of revitalizing China through science and education and ensuring
sustainable development, we will focus on the expansion of
domestic demand as an important leverage for economic growth so as
to continue to maintain the rapid, sound and sustained growth of
the national economy.
</P>
<P>
We are firm in opening China wider to the outside world and
carrying on China's external economic ties, trade and technical
cooperation by further improving the environment for overseas
investment, expanding the sectors open to such investment step by
step and protecting the legitimate rights and interests of
overseas-funded enterprises so as to achieve new growth in foreign
trade and overseas investment utilization. This is conducive not
only to the stability and development of China's economy but also
to the stability and development of the finance and economy of
Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
As much as China cannot develop in isolation from the world,
the world needs China for its development. China's stability and
prosperity will open up a broad vista for its friendly cooperation
with Switzerland and the rest of Europe and make greater
contributions to peace, development and stability of the world. (

<HEADLINE> Corrupt Bankers Sentenced in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Two bankers have been given
heavy sentences for embezzlement and misuse of nearly 200 million
yuan in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The court in the city handed down the death sentence with a two
year reprieve on Ma Jiangping while his colleague in crime Dong
Yaguang was sent to prison for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Ma, former head of a local business office of the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), was also deprived of his
political rights for life and had 100,000 yuan of his property
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Dong, former head of a branch of the Zhengzhou City Cooperative
Bank, was deprived of his political rights for five years and had
100,000 yuan of his personal assets confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Three other people were also punished for giving assistance to
the two corrupt bank officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the city's intermediate court, since 1995 the twin
grifters joined forces in a series of criminal activities and made
use of their professional status to embezzle and misuse the huge
amount of funds.
</P>
<P>
During the 1995-98 period, they handled deposits and loans,
purchased stocks and conducted investment activities with public
money for their own gains.
</P>
<P>
Ma and Dong fled after their criminal activities were uncovered
taking with them 400,000 yuan and 300,000 yuan of public money,
respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks in Shanghai,
authorized to carry out Renminbi business, have reported smooth
operations over the past two years, a Bank of China official has
said here.
</P>
<P>
The official from the BOC Shanghai Branch revealed that there
are now 13 foreign banks doing RMB business in Shanghai. By the
end of last year, they had accumulated deposits of 1.5 billion
yuan and loans of one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the first group of nine foreign banks were
allowed to run Chinese currency business in China, including the
Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corp. and Citybank. In August last
year, another eight banks entered the business.
</P>
<P>
Four more foreign banks in Shanghai and nine in south China's
financial center of Shenzhen are also applying for the right to
deal in RMB.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of local currency dealing has improved the quality
of our banking business in China," said Toru Mitarai, head of the
Shanghai Branch of Japan's Sanwa Bank Limited. Over 90 percent of
the bank's customers have set up yuan bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Compared with their local competitors, the foreign banks offer
better customer services, although they usually have a smaller
number of network outlets and staff, added a senior official from
the Shanghai and Hong Kong Banking Corp.
</P>
<P>
The banks hope China will make bigger strides to open up its
financial sector. The Sanwa Bank is applying to the Bank of China
for a larger quota of RMB dealing, from its current 30 million
yuan to 100 million.

<P>
KATHMANDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A total of 953 children went
missing in Nepal in the 1997/98 fiscal year and their whereabouts
are still not known yet, the official RSS news agency reported
Saturday, quoting a survey by police.
</P>
<P>
During the period, reports filed with the police on missing
children involved 1,577 girls and 610 boys aged above 16 and 558
children aged between 1 and 12, RSS said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missing children have been found. But the figures
are in no way complete because many cases of lost children went
unreported, it said, quoting the police.
</P>
<P>
The news agency said growing population pressure, general lack
of education, unemployment, disputes with parents, sheer
negligence and abductors are the main reasons for children to go
missing.
</P>
<P>
It said that due to limited means and resources, the search for
lost children is not very effective.
</P>
<P>
The central development region, where the capital city
Kathmandu is situated, last year recorded the largest number of
missing children, RSS said.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Saturday afternoon inaugurated a large-scale modern
industrial park in the country's Western Province in a bid to
create jobs and speed up industrialization.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of this industrial park with modern state of
the art facilities will enable the industrialists to upgrade their
products and compete successfully in the local as well as in
international markets," said President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the opening of the Seethawaka Industrial
Park at Avissawella, about 36 kilometers east of the capital of
Colombo, Kumaratunga said the park has attracted a large number
of local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The park, which has cost 3.6 billion rupees (52 million U.S.
dollars) to build, covers an area of 168 hectares, of which 77
hectares have been developed with 70 factory lots and 35 projects
have been approved with an employment potential of 15,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
It has infrastructure facilities of international standards,
including wide roads, water treatment plants, a high-capacity
power substation, transport facilities and telephone
communications.
</P>
<P>
"The setting up of this park also signifies the government's
commitment toward the creation of employment opportunities,
provision of infrastructure facilities and the promotion of
regional industrialization," said President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
The park utilizes indigenous raw material like rubber, fruit,
tea, vegetables, minerals, wood, gems and fabrics. There will be
both hi-tech and labor-intensive industries.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to generate direct and indirect employment
opportunities for more than 40,000 persons when all the 70
factories are fully operational.

<HEADLINE> China Opposes U.S. Decision to Table Anti-China Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China is strongly opposed to the
decision of the United States to table an anti-China bill in the
upcoming 55th United Nations Conference on Human Rights, according
to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Sun Yuxi here today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the U.S. bill, Sun said that the move "not
only violates the basic principles of the U.N. Charter, but also
goes against the historical trend of the international community
toward engaging in cooperation and opposing confrontation."
</P>
<P>
It is well known that the Chinese government has always be
committed to the protection and promotion of human rights, and
that the Chinese people have enjoyed an increasingly higher level
of human rights in recent years, he added.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. side, in total disregard of facts, attempts to
interfere in China's internal affairs under the pretext of the
human rights question, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China maintains that the difference in
human rights between nations should be resolved through dialogue
on the basis of equality and mutual respect. Facts have shown that
confrontation gets nowhere in this regard, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the U.S. side reverse its erroneous decision
immediately, and abandon its practice of interfering in China's
internal affairs," the spokesman stated.

MAPUTO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Mozambique
and Indonesia have signed an accord for reciprocal promotion and
protection of investment, the Noticias newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony in Maputo Friday, Mozambican Foreign
Minister Leonardo Simao said that the accord provides legal basis
for the private investors in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Simao disclosed that the two sides are working hard so that an
agreement could be reached soon to address the issue of double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian investors are interested in agriculture, fishery
and industry in Mozambique, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister also noted that Mozambique will soon set up a
diplomatic representative office in Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The two states established diplomatic relations in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, attended
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legal Aid Lawyers Reach Out to Poor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese talent for adapting
foreign practices has once again been underlined by the successful
introduction of a legal aid system.
</P>
<P>
In the West, governments usually offer legal aid to people
unable to pay the costs which are usually very high.
</P>
<P>
Five years after a similar system was introduced to China, the
government has dispatched legal-aid attorneys to ask government
bodies handling public complaints to indicate people who need such
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"With the increase in social contradictions, the government
complaint offices have become a focus for the poor who need legal
means to protect their legitimate rights and interests," said Gong
Xiaobing, deputy director of the Legal Aid Center under the
Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The legal aid practice which is marked here by its particular
Chinese characteristics is of great significance, he said, because
the poor who approach government officials to highlight their
problems do not know there is free legal aid available.
</P>
<P>
Hao Yaoyuan, a beneficiary in north China's Shanxi Province,
said after she won her case, "I never expected that the government
could hire a lawyer for me to protect my rights and interests."
Her case was taken up by a legal aid lawyer at a government
complaints office in the Jinzhong Prefecture of Shanxi.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, the legal aid program
funded 50,000 cases and provided legal consultations to 400,000
people in 1997. With the introduction of new practices, the
numbers skyrocketed to 80,000 and 1 million respectively last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
The government complaint offices are also delighted with the
presence of legal aid lawyers in their offices.
</P>
<P>
"They are not only helping the poor, they are also helping the
government," a deputy commissioner of Jinzhong Prefecture
Complaint Office said, pointing out that lawyers solved a great
deal of legal problems that can't be solved through administrative
means.
</P>
<P>
The large number of redundant workers from state-owned
enterprises, the heavy financial burdens put on farmers by local
governments along with rampant corruption have fueled the rush to
public complaints departments in many places.
</P>
<P>
Another official with the Legal Aid Center of the Justice
Ministry, Liu Nanzheng, said that legal aid lawyers could be more
persuasive than government employees, because they are not hired
to defend the government.
</P>
<P>
The penetration of legal aid attorneys into government offices
in China has also caught the attention of Western legal experts.
</P>
<P>
"This shows China is making positive efforts in expanding the
legal aid system for the protection of human rights," said Eileen
Skinnider, director of Human Rights at the International Center
for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice in Canada.
</P>
<P>
She was in Beijing this week attending a international
conference on legal aid legislation hosted by China's Justice
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Robert Spanenberg, president of the Spangenberg Group in MA,
USA, said that China has made "extraordinary" progress in
implementing its legal aid system.
</P>
<P>
There are over 500 legal aid centers in China and many
localities have established legal aid through administrative
regulations or local legislation.
</P>
<P>
A national work conference on legal aid is now being held in
Beijing today to discuss national legislation on expanding the new
system, which is aimed at defending the rights of all citizens,
even the poor.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji declared that the
government should start to handle public complaints through legal
means.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry official Gong said that the legal aid
institutions, with the cooperation of government offices, are
handling a rising number of public complaints and as a result
could make a greater contribution to China's social stability and
further improve its human rights record.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Only by joint action, can
the African states win the war against drug trafficking in the
continent, said a senior Tanzanian anti-drug official.
</P>
<P>
Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted Tanzania's Director of
Criminal Investigation Adadi Rajabu as saying Friday that there is
need for shared responsibilities to face the drug problem which
has been spreading like wild fire.
</P>
<P>
"Only concerted efforts from the individual family to the
international levels can help subdue the illicit drug business,"
Rajabu said.
</P>
<P>
He listed the types of drugs that are prevailing in Africa as
cocaine, cannabis resin (hashish), morphine, mandrax, khat, and
cannabis saliva (bhang).
</P>
<P>
The official said that the drug problem, which knows no
boundaries, will continue consuming the fabric of the society if
it is not fully addressed now by all countries.
</P>
<P>
He praised the efforts by many African states in forming a
strong coalition to collectively wage war against drug trafficking
in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The Heads of National Law Enforcement Agencies (HONLEA) of
African countries have been meeting regularly to exchange
information on their efforts against drugs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is a problem that should involve all well meaning people of
all walks of life before it is too late," Rajabu said. "We should
work together to stop the menace."

<HEADLINE> Boeing Works Closely with Chinese Clients to Solve Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Boeing Company is working
closely with its Chinese clients to tackle the problem of the Y2K
computer 'bug' problem by providing technical assistance to ensure
that all Boeing jetliners in China are able to fly safely well
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
One of Boeing's major customers, China has more than 470
jetliners including over 320 Boeing jetliners, more than 68
percent of its total fleet.
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Y2K problem ( also known as the '2000 bug )
refers to the trouble expected to be caused by the fact that
computers will only recognize the last two digits in the current
computer systems' year recognition programs.
</P>
<P>
Jim Wigfall, system supervisor for the Y2K problem in the
Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, said that in order to ensure
that airplane operations are not affected by the "2000 bug", two
years ago Boeing divided all aircraft systems into 12 categories
such as flight control, avionics, flight deck, display/indication
and fuel and employed its computer experts to solve any potential
snags.
</P>
<P>
 " We have prepared the updates for the computer software
and hardware which may be influenced by the date change. Either at
the beginning of the new century or as we move into it we are
attempting to ensure that Boeing jetliners will not be affected."
said Wigfall.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has distributed technical documents for solving the
Y2K problem to its Chinese clients. And to further ensure the
problem is tackled properly it will also sponsor special seminars
for its Chinese customers and provide follow-up consultations.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia has refused to receive a
group of U.S. Pentagon experts scheduled to visit Moscow on
Saturday, the Russian Defense Ministry said, citing unfitting
atmosphere for such visits as the U.S.-led NATO alliance continued
air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Under the previous schedule, the Pentagon group was due in
Moscow on Saturday for discussions with the Russian military on
nuclear security, the ITAR-TASS reported.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the Russian Defense Ministry said that as
NATO's aggression against Yugoslavia went on, it would be improper
to have contacts with representatives of a NATO member state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
announced that Russia has completely frozen its relations with
NATO and asked NATO's press representative in Moscow to leave
Russia. He stressed that as long as NATO refused to stop
aggression against Yugoslavia, Russia would not have any contacts
with NATO leaders including NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.

<HEADLINE> Tooro Prince Assassinated in Western Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Prince of Tooro Kingdom in Uganda
Charles Happy Kijanangoma has been shot dead by unidentified
gunmen in a bar in the town of Fort-Portal, Uganda's leading daily
New Vision reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tooro Prime Minister's Office expressed shock at the murder in
a statement Friday, condemned in the strongest terms this act of
inhumanity and appealed to the government to double its vigilance
toward the protection of lives and property in Tooro.
</P>
<P>
Tooro, located in western Uganda, is one of the several kingdoms
in Uganda where the traditional systems were maintained.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of republicanism in 1967, kingdoms were
embedded in the new state. However the institution of kingdom was
reinstated in 1993 albeit without the former political and
administrative powers.
</P>
<P>
According to the New Vision report, the shooting incident took
place at the Palace View Bar at 8:45 p.m. Thursday. Seven people
in the pub survived with injuries.
</P>
<P>
The assailant, who are said to have been trailing him, got out
of a white salon car and opened fire on Kijanangoma, pumping him
with about 12 bullets in the back.
</P>
<P>
Power in the town had just gone off before the attack, the
witnesses were quoted as saying. The cause of the blackout has
not been established.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Banks Face Extracting Task of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 results reports of
major local banks show that they are facing an extracting task of
coming out the woods after their earnings in the year were
horribly bashed for a second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
Combining the 26.7 percent fall in the 1998 earnings announced
Friday by the United Overseas Bank, the net profit for the five
major banks in the city state sank by 32.4 percent to 1.25 billion
Singapore dollars in 1998 from 1.8 billion Singapore dollars in
1997, which was itself down by 30 percent from 2.56 billion in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The five big banks -- the Bank of the Development Bank of
Singapore, the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd., the
United Overseas Bank, the Overseas Union Bank and the Keppel
TatLee Bank -- top the bank list in Singapore in terms of size and
assets.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the net earnings fall to sharply higher
non-performance loans (NPL) both in regional and domestic loans.
</P>
<P>
The regional NPLs hit 7.77 billion Singapore dollars out of the
total regional loans of 29.6 billion Singapore dollars in 1998
while the domestic NPLs jumped to 10 billion Singapore dollars in
1998 from 3 billion Singapore dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The banks were forced to raise up provisions for NPLs to comply
with stricter provisioning criteria by the regulator for
classifying NPLs. As a result, the provisions shot up to a record
high of 3.2 billion Singapore dollars, up 72 percent over 1997 for
the five banks.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Keppel TatLee Bank was the only bank which saw a
dip in its provisions because prior to the merger late last year
TatLee Bank had made further charges of 487 million Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of bankers and analysts believe the Singapore
economy will recover in the second half of 1999 and the worst is
over. However, some analysts still hold that recovery is not
certain for Singapore banks in 1999 as they see lower provisions
as the main factor for earning growth in the year.
</P>
<P>
In attempting to forecast 1999 profits, analysts again put
forth the question whether NPLs have peaked, because NPLs, like
employment levels, always lag behind economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
A banker has said that only when NPLs have peaked and the
economy has clearly turned around would it be possible to gauge
how the banks would perform.
</P>
<P>
Noting that local banks benefited from strong net interest
income for about three quarters in 1998, analysts expect net
interest income to come under pressure by the high level NPls.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted a banker as saying that banks would have
the full 12-month impact of the NPLs.
</P>
<P>
Analysts are also taking a "wait-and-see" attitude toward the
recovery story in regional financial industry, saying it is too
early to say regional banks have bottomed out. It would take time
to see the moving current for recovery in regional bank industry,
they added.
</P>
<P>
To local banks, analysts said, 1999 might be a year for
restructuring and consolidation of their bad loans.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Plans to Create 1.3 Million New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has worked
out a plan to create about 1.3 million new jobs in line with its
new economic stimulus package to be implemented next week, Thai
News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The new 53-billion-baht (1.4-billion-U.S.-dollar) package, to
be announced on March 30, would enable the government to create
90,000 skilled jobs and over 1.2 million semi-skilled and
unskilled jobs.
</P>
<P>
Since the financial crisis erupted in July 1997, a total of
30,000 Thai enterprises have closed down and about 2 million
people have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Other measures expected to be included in the new stimulus are
reductions in personal income tax, value-added tax and excise tax
on bunker oil, as well as a cut in power charges.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for
greater fiscal leeway to spend its way out of its worst-ever
recession under its seventh quarterly commitment to the IMF
approved by the cabinet earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The commitment includes a request for a 1998-99 budget deficit
of six percent of gross domestic product (GDP) compared to five
percent currently.
</P>
<P>
Widening the deficit, a feature of past quarterly agreements
with the IMF, would allow for tax cuts and a spending spree under
the economic stimulus package.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Forex Reserves Stand at $1642m </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's foreign exchange
reserves stood at 1,642 million U.S. dollars on March 27, Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Sharif said the increase in the
foreign exchange reserves reflects his government's successful
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves had once dived to less
than 500 million dollars since the United States and other Western
countries imposed sanctions on the country as a result of its
nuclear tests last May.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar in the open
market has also come down to 51.44 Pakistani rupees and the
Karachi Stock market closed at 1,056 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rate in the open market touched 67 rupees in
September, 1998 and the Karachi Stock Index fell to a low of 765
points last July.
</P>
<P>
He said inflationary pressures had been contained and there
were no shortages of any essential commodity despite all financial
and foreign exchange difficulties.

TIRANA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia has withdrawn all its
members from the verification mission of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo in protest
against NATO's airstrikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The 135 Russian verifiers had a brief stopover at a Greece
airport before flying to Moscow, the Macedonian Information Agency
reported from Skopje Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to NATO's air strikes late Wednesday, all OSCE verifiers
had been withdrawn from Kosovo to Macedonia's capital of Skopje
and resort town of Ohrid.
</P>
<P>
The ground mission, part of an agreement reached between the
OSCE and Belgrade in October last year, had been sent to Kosovo to
verify the compliance of cease-fire by the conflicting sides in
the troubled Yugoslav province. It comprised of some 1,400 unarmed
observers, including those from Russia.

<HEADLINE> Nissan, Renault Sign Capital Tie-up Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan's second largest automaker
Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA of France on Saturday struck an
accord on capital tie-up which will allow the French automaker to
buy a substantial stake in Nissan and send its own executives to
join Nissan's board.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Nissan President Yoshikazu Hanawa
and Renault's Chairman Louis Schweitzer in Tokyo, after Nissan's
executive board endorsed a capital tie-up motion earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Renault will make an equity investment
totaling some 643 billion yen (5.4 billion U.S. dollars) to help
Nissan reduce its huge consolidated debt.
</P>
<P>
The investment covers a 36.8 percent stake in Nissan, a 22.5
percent stake in its truck-making affiliate Nissan Diesel Motor Co.
, the firms said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Renault will be the largest shareholder of Nissan and will be
allowed to control Japanese automaker as its stake is above 33.4
percent, a level that under the Japanese law accords the stake
holder right to veto strategic decisions at shareholders' meetings.
</P>
<P>
With the combined annual output totaling around 4.8 million
units, the Nissan-Renault alliance will become the fourth largest
automaker group in the world.
</P>
<P>
With the French automaker's help, Nissan will reduce its
consolidated debt of more than two trillion yen (16.7 billion
dollars) and undertake restructuring initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Nissan has been suffering from sluggish domestic sales and
faltering operations in North America.
</P>
<P>
Renault will appoint an executive vice president as number two
at Nissan Motor after President Yoshikazu Hanawa, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Two other executives in charge of business planning and finance
will also be sent by Renault, it said.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Motor has been engaged in talks with Renault since
negotiations collapsed with German-U.S. auto giant Daimler
Chrysler AG in early March.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Stresses Palestinian Right to Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid stressed Saturday that declaration of an
independent state is the legitimate right of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
Abdel-Meguid maintained that all Arabs fully support Palestinians'
right to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
But he advised the Palestinian leadership to choose an
appropriate timing for the declaration of a state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has said that he will declare
an independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule
period under the 1993 Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes the Palestinian plan, threatening to take tough
actions against the step, including annexation of the parts of the
West Bank under its control
</P>
<P>
Several countries have also advised Arafat to postpone the date
for statehood declaration to avoid complicating the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the 22-nation pan-Arab forum urged the Arab
countries to get prepared for a possible re-election of Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the country's general
elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs have accused Netanyahu of freezing the peace process
by adopting intransigent policies since he assumed office in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also lashed out at Israel's confiscation of
Palestinian land, settlement activities and deprivation of
Palestinians' rights and resources.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Laud EU's Support for Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinians have lauded the
the European Union's (EU) support for the establishment of an
independent state, describing the EU's stand as "a big stride
reflecting the political reality" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator with Israel Saeb Erekat made the
remarks Saturday in an telephone interview with Egypt's Voice of
Arab.
</P>
<P>
Erekat's comment came in response to a statement issued by the
EU Thursday after a summit in Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Palestinians have an "unqualified right
to self-determination, including the option of a state," which
showed EU's readiness to "consider recognition of a Palestinian
state in due course."
</P>
<P>
The EU "is convinced" that the creation of a "democratic,
viable and peaceful sovereign Palestinian state" would be "the
best guarantee" to Israel's security, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who is also Minister of Local Government of the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), said the Palestinians will
continue to exert efforts to win the support of the U.S. for their
statehood.
</P>
<P>
PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat has announced that he will declare
an independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim self-rule
period enshrined in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been trying in recent weeks to rally international
support for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Israel opposes the Palestinian plan, threatening to take tough
actions against the possible step, including annexation of parts
of the West Bank under its control.
</P>
<P>
Erekat dismissed Israel's threats as "extremism and political
blindness."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Further Cuts Custom Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Saturday announced
more cuts of the maximum rate of custom duty on all items
excluding motor vehicles from 45 percent to 35 percent from March
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The announcement made by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
at a press conference here came as the country appears to be
surviving an economic crisis after the United States and other
Western countries imposed sanctions on Pakistan following its
nuclear tests last May.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,239 items are covered under the new tariff
regulation. Tariffs for 2,089 items of consumer goods will be
slashed from 45 percent to 35 percent, 363 items of intermediary
goods from 35 percent to 25 percent, 196 items of chemicals and
components from 25 percent to 15 percent and 591 items of basic
raw materials from 15 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sharif also said his government decided to lift the
restrictions imposed on sale of foreign exchange by the banking
system for travel, education and health and to restore the normal
facility of buying foreign exchange at the composite rate through
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani citizens will be saved from inconvenience of buying
foreign exchange from the open market and will also save money as
it will be cheaper for them to buy required foreign exchange on
the composite rate, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had reduced the maximum rate of custom duty from 65
percent to 45 percent in March 1997, and subsequently exempted
import of machinery for export-oriented and high-tech industries
from custom tariff.
</P>
<P>
"Our government believes in a deregulated and liberalized
economy," he said. "Self-reliance remains our goal."
</P>
<P>
"We have deregulated and simplified the investment and business
procedures and will continue to take further measures whenever
necessary," he said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Report on Last Year's Tanzania Bombing Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) report on the bombing at the United States
Embassy in Dar es Salaam on August 7, 1998, has finally been
released to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's Assistant Commissioner of Police, Leonard Mashaka,
the prosecutor in the case, said Friday that the report has been
submitted to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
The office is expected to study the report which provides more
strong evidence, and determine whether or not the accused persons
should be transferred to the High Court for hearing, The Guardian
newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two accused persons, Mustafa Mahmoud Ahmed, who has dual
nationalities of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Egypt, and
Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Zanzibar resident of Arab origin, are
currently tried by the Dar es Salaam-based Kisutu Resident
Magistrate's Court.
</P>
<P>
They were charged with murdering 11 people in a bombing attack
on the U. S. embassy in Tanzania on August 7 last year. More than
70 people were injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Another bomb rocked the U.S. embassy in Kenyan capital Nairobi,
just 30 minutes ago the same day, killing more than 240 people and
injuring 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing at the court Friday, Mashaka requested for the
adjournment of the case again, saying the office needs to study
the expert report of FBI. The court decided to adjourn the case
to April 9.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Creates 3 Agencies for Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has created three
semi- autonomous agencies as part of civil service reforms, media
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They are the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority, Drilling and
Dam Construction Agency and the National Bureau of Statistics,
said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Launching these new agencies here Friday, Martern Lumbanga,
chief secretary of the Civil Service Department, said that the
objectives behind the reform are to improve the effectiveness and
the delivery of the public services through better business.
</P>
<P>
He said the agencies will be free to conduct their business and
provide services to the public in a more practical manner,
shedding the bureaucratic way.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a plan to convert 27 government departments into
such agencies in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Most agencies will develop their revenue generating

<P>
CANBERRA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The swimming sensation Grant
Hackett failed to hit a world record double as he ended up outside
a 1500-meter race mark at the Australian swimming championships at
Brisbane on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The eighteen-year-old Australian, who set the world 200-meter
freestyle record on Tuesday, timed 14 minutes, 48.63 seconds,
almost seven seconds outside the double Olympic gold medalist
Kieren Perkins' mark of 14:41.66 set at the Commonwealth Games in
Victoria, Canada in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But the winning time catapults Hackett above 1991 Perth world
champion Jorg Hoffmann of Germany, whose time was 14:50.36, as the
second-fastest swimmer over 30 laps.
</P>
<P>
Perkins, who qualified second-fastest for the race Saturday,
came in third in a time of 15:27.27, while teenager Craig Stephens
placed second on a time of 15:21.16 in the race.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests Yugoslavia over Killings in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Friday
summoned Yugoslav Charge d'Affaires to Tehran to protest the
killings of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported Saturday that the
ministry informed the Yugoslav envoy of Tehran's concern over the
suppression of Muslims in Kosovo by the Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also called on the Yugoslav Charge d'Affaires to
convey its concern to his government over the killings and urged
Belgrade to put an end to the massacre of Muslims in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The summon came after reports said that Serbian forces killed
50 Albanians in the towns of Suva Reka and Orahovac, two bastions
of the separatist Kosovo Albanian Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Serb-led government and ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo intensified in February last year after the Albanians
sought independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Liberation Army have intensified its military
offensives against the Serb troops after North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) began to launch air strikes on Serb targets
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Thursday expressed regret and grave concern over the
NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia, stressing that military attacks
will only complicate the situation in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi underlined
the need to continue political efforts to solve the Kosovo
issue. However, he also blamed Belgrade for its stance over
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> China Protests to United States About Anti-China Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China on Saturday protested to
the United States about its decision to sponsor an anti-China
resolution at the on-going meeting of the United Nations Human
Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington,
told reporters that "we're firmly opposed to the U.S. practice"
since it has "interfered with the internal affairs of China."
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin announced the U.S.
decision at a regular news briefing. "The United States will
introduce a resolution on China's human rights practices at the
United Nations Commission on Human Rights which is currently
meeting in Geneva," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Shuning described the U.S. decision as "going backward,"
because China and the United States have re-opened dialogue on
human rights not long ago and promised to continue consultation on
the issue later this year.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 90s, the United States has supported
anti-China resolutions at the Geneva human rights conference for
seven years in succession, but each time it failed.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States takes the issue over again, it will
inevitably follow the disastrous road of the old days," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision came at a time when its military forces were
firing cruise missiles against Yugoslavia, causing casualties and
property damages to many innocent civilians there.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was seeking support from its
allies for censuring China.
</P>
<P>
The European Union's foreign ministerial meeting decided on
March 22 not to submit any resolution concerning China's human
rights record and to continue dialogue and cooperation with China
in this sphere.

LUSAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has approved the second phase of the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF) for Zambia which will enable it to have
access to 14 million U.S. dollars before the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The African Development Bank has also approved 15 million
dollars in balance of payments support for the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Saturday quoted Finance and
Economic Development Minister Edith Nawakwi as saying that the
development was an important endorsement of the Zambian economy.
The paper did not say when the two institutions made the
approvals.
</P>
<P>
The gesture shown by the two multilateral organizations was
valuable acknowledgment of the Zambian government's commitment to
restructure the economy, the minister said in Lusaka Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was also a demonstration of the government's capacity to
effectively manage any challenge that might arise in the country,
she added.
</P>
<P>
She also thanked the IMF and the African Development Bank for
the support they had given to the reform program in Zambia,
describing the two institutions as partners in its national
development.

The first phase of the ESAF ended last December and Zambia was
qualified for another which was approved early this year after an

<P>
When he was seriously ill, Chinese leaders Zhu Rongji, Li

<HEADLINE> Abu Dhabi to Expand Port Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Abu Dhabi Seaport Authority of
the United Arab Emirates has set an 15-year ambitious program to
build new ports and renovate berths, the English daily Gulf News
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that, among other projects, a new container
terminal at the Mina Zayed port and new ports for service
industries at Sadr and Mussaffah will be built.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saeed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of the authority
said the program also includes renovating berths, increasing the
depth of navigation lanes from 13 to 15 meters, acquiring handling
equipment and reclaiming land near the port areas.
</P>
<P>
He said Mina Zayed saw robust growth in 1998 amid world
economic doldrums, with general cargo handling volume rose by 25
percent and container alone by 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
A major development this year will be the opening of Mussaffah
Port, which will complement Mina Zayed.
</P>
<P>
"The Mussaffah port will ease the pressure on Mina Zayed and
extend more facilities to the growing number of international
shipping lines calling at Abu Dhabi," he said.
</P>
<P>
The authority will buy six new quay cranes next year, raising
their number to 11.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the newly-opened Salalah port in Oman will
attract new shipping lines, sharpening competition.
</P>
<P>
"But one does not have to fear about the impact of such
competition as long as one is capable of competing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that shipping lines are looking for the
shortest and most cost-effective ways as well as the easiest and
fastest in terms of services and facilities provided," he added.

JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma Friday appointed two unionists to deputy ministership in a
cabinet reshuffle after a new political party was launched this
week, South Africa's Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The appointments are being interpreted as a preemptive move to
stem the flow of labor support to the Congress of Democrats,
launched by a former leading figure of the ruling South West
African People's Organization (Swapo), Ben Ulenga.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted observers as saying that the bringing in of
two unionists was a sign that Swapo isn't taking the new party
lightly.
</P>
<P>
Walter Kemba, a Swapo parliamentarian who held a top position
in the Mine Workers Union of Namibia, was appointed deputy
minister of Labor, and former secretary-general of the National
Union of Namibian Workers, Bernhardt Esau, became deputy minister
of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
A third union leader, Deputy Labor Minister John Shaetonhodi,
was moved to the Ministry of Works, Transport and Communication.
Renowned Swapo veteran Andimba Toivo ya Toivo was moved from the
mines and energy ministry to head the labor ministry.

WELLINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew has predicted that Asia will recover in three to five
years and "will resume its surge forward as the fastest growing
emerging region of the world."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a dinner on Friday in Auckland hosted by Asia 2000
Fund for the on-going Festival of Asia, Lee said the fundamentals
of Asia's economies have not been knocked.
</P>
<P>
"Asia may not repeat past high growth rates of 8-10 percent but
can sustain rates between 3-6 percent. Growth rates will vary
across the region, but they will still exceed average of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development rates," the
New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) Saturday quoted Lee as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Lee said New Zealand's resource-based economy would find
ever-expanding markets in an industrializing and densely populated
East Asia.
</P>
<P>
No major multinationals have walked away from Asia, although
they have downsized, and many American investment groups are
buying up companies to participate in the expected recovery, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I suggest it would be foolhardy not to remain engaged in
Asia," Lee said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Criticized for Restricting Imports of NZ Lamb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith Saturday criticized the United
States for restricting imports of New Zealand lamb.
</P>
<P>
In a media statement, Smith said New Zealand will strongly
object to the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC)
recommendation to introduce "safeguard measures" to protect the
U.S. sheep meat industry from imports of New Zealand lamb.
</P>
<P>
The ITC has recommended a range of measures, including a tariff
of around 20 percent on all lamb imports over 1998 level and a
quantitative restriction of 52 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned by the punitive remedies recommended by the
ITC," said Smith.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is a leading proponent of free markets and trade
liberalization, he said, adding that it would be extraordinary to
impose trade restrictions or reduce the competitiveness of New
Zealand producers.
</P>
<P>
According Smith, the ITC's final report will go to the U.S.
government and President Bill Clinton will have 60 days to
respond.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's lamb exports to the U.S. were worth more than 54
million U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Allow Use of Satellite Hand-phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been making
arrangements to allow use of the Iridium Satellite Communication
Hand-Phone System in the country, official newspaper the New Light
of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Communications, Posts and Telegraphs
(MCPT) reached an agreement with Iridium Southeast Asia Co Ltd of
Thailand (ISEA) on November 27 last year to install the system
that would enable round-the-world communication and that it would
fill the communication gap in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
At a presentation on the system held here Friday, Minister for
MCPT Brigadier General Win Tin said that the new telephone
communication system would become useful in remote areas, tourism,
rural health and in cases of emergency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in March 1998, Singapore's Ucom International
Company agreed with state-run Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications
to add 20,000 more CDMA mobile phones, manufactured by Qualcomm
Inc of the United States, in Yangon to boost the city's local and
international direct dialing capacity.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the CDMA telephone system in Yangon
followed the extensive use of cellular phones in the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, foreign companies involved in
the installation of new telephone systems in Myanmar in recent
years include those from Australia, Israel, Germany, Japan,
Singapore and the United States.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more quotes Deputy PM: Nine NATO Planes Downed or Damaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister
Zoran Lilic said here Friday that the country's air defense forces
have shot down or damaged nine NATO planes.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua Friday night, Lilic said
so far, 11 Yugoslav servicemen have been killed and 60 others
wounded in NATO bombings that started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of missiles fired at Yugoslav targets in the
previous two days was even higher than half the total that hit
Iraq in the past one year.
</P>
<P>
Lilic said the essence of the air raids was that the United
States wants to establish its hegemony in the Balkans and serve
its own strategic aims.
</P>
<P>
In reality, he said, the NATO bombings have nothing to do with
the Kosovo problem, neither do they have any relationship with the
ethnic Albanians' strong inspiration to seek independence.
</P>
<P>
The only thing that matters in these bombings is, in U.S.
President Bill Clinton's words, to maintain Washington's strategic
interests in the region.
</P>
<P>
By wreaking havoc under pretexts, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization is only trying to find a reason to justify its
survival, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO attacks on Yugoslavia were much worse than the act
of Hitler. "The saddest thing is that it is the very countries
that fought Nazi Germany together with us are now bombing us,"
Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
"What the United States has done has encroached upon the
interests of a sovereign state," Lilic said. "Who else could use
bombs to hit innocent civilians, let alone to note that the use of
force was neither sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, nor by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)?"
</P>
<P>
He said the Serbs fully understand that if Kosovo was lost, its
Serbian identity would be gone.
</P>
<P>
Lilic vowed to safeguard Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity at any cost.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton and NATO have made a big mistake in thinking
that the use of force can resolve problems. They will pay a price
for this fallacy, Lilic said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction over the strong international
reaction to NATO bombings on Yugoslavia and that protests and
demonstrations were held in countries that took part in the air
raids.
</P>
<P>
Many big powers keep professing humanitarianism and democracy
but they themselves are committing the most inhumane and the most
undemocratic deeds.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that justice will eventually be
served and subpoenas will be sent from the International Court at
The Hague to these countries.
</P>
<P>
Lilic reiterated Belgrade's readiness to sit down for
negotiations anywhere at any time to find a solution through
political means.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 Serbian-Americans
held a demonstration in Chicago city of the United States Friday
to denounce the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air
attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators waved Yugoslav, Serbian and Kosovan flags,
held signs with caricatures of U.S. President Bill Clinton as
Adolf Hitler and chanted "Zivela Serbia!" -- Long Live Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of NATOs can bomb us. They cannot bomb us enough,"
bellowed Slavko Panovich, president of the Serbian National
Defense Council of America, which helped organize the
demonstration. "We can endure any bombing."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 350,000 ethnic Serbs live in the Chicago area.
Many of the demonstrators were bused downtown from the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
To the protesters, Serbia and its province of Kosovo are one: "
Kosovo is Serbian," they chanted.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators repeatedly expressed an allegiance to the United
States but a hatred of what America was doing in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"They're killing innocent people. It's shameful," said Lana
Denic, 45, of suburban Northbrook. "I love the United States. I
love the American people. But I hate Clinton. I hate the
government."
</P>
<P>
Vesna Mojsic, 14, has lived her entire life in the United
States but visits relatives in Kosovo every summer.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's horrible. I think Bill Clinton is starting World
War III, and Americans should open their eyes and see that,"
Mojsic said. "My whole family is back there. I'm just extremely
worried."

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Saturday held a grand
military parade, participated by more than 5,000 military men and
members of the Police Force, the Fire Brigade and the Red Cross,
to mark the 54th anniversary of the Armed Forces Day or Resistance
Day.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, attended by Myanmar leaders, high
officials, military officers and foreign military attaches,
Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defense Services Senior-General
Than Shwe said "It is necessary that the Tatmadaw (defense forces)
keep abreast of the changing world. That is what we call modern.
History has taught us a great lesson that our nation was
subjugated because we lacked a modern Tatmadaw."
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe, who is also chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council and prime minister, stressed that the
government is still magnanimously keeping doors open and
welcoming the remaining armed groups with open arms for the sake
of peace.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups as
well as the former drug trafficking Mong Tai Army have returned to
the legal fold and made peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
On the national economy, he pointed out "We must strive for
food sufficiency for generations without being dependent on
anybody."

QUITO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The oil exports of Ecuador in 1998

million dollars, according to a report issued by the Ecuadorian
Central Bank Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has recorded a balance
of payment (BoP) surplus of 2394 million rupees (37 million U.S.
dollars) last year, the official Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the oil prices in the world market has greatly
contributed to the BoP surplus, the paper quoted central bank
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's total exports grew by 2.1 percent, recording 306
billion rupees (4.73 billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
"In order to boost the country's exports, the government
offered industrialists alluring incentives while giving all other
support during the last four years," a central bank official said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that taking advantage of the reduction of
duty on capital goods imports by 40 percent, local industrialists
have imported machinery and equipment to refurbish the existing
industries and to start new industries.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's trade deficit in 1998 was 1.183 billion dollars
against 1.225 billion dollars in the previous year. Its annual
trade deficit has been declining since 1994 which saw a deficit of
1.56 billion dollars.

<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government has
repaid 50 million U.S. dollars of its multilateral foreign debt
this year, despite the destruction caused by hurricane Mitch to
this Central American country, official sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 47 million dollars of this sum were donated by
the international community and the remainder was from internal
resources.
</P>
<P>
This donation is part of the contributions of several nations
to the Trust Fund created by the World Bank for the Central
American countries devastated by Mitch to pay their multilateral
debt.
</P>
<P>
Most of the almost 200 million dollar foreign debt to be paid
by Honduras this year will be contributed by the donor countries,
most of them members of the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
"Honduras has no (internal) capability to fulfill this
commitment of paying off the compulsory commitment, so the
international community has promised to continue its cooperation,"
said official sources.

<HEADLINE> More Countries Voice Objection to NATO Bombing of Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine, Kyrghyz and Uzbekistan on
Friday joined the international chorus of criticizing NATO's
military intervention in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Inspecting a training center of the interior force in the
suburb of Kiev, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma told reporters
that bombing can not bring about any favorable results and more
efforts should be made to resume peace negotiations on the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said that Ukraine will not stand aloof if Yugoslavia
asks Ukraine to come to help. But he added that Ukraine will not
provide military aid to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk and Defense
Minister Alexander Kuzmuk were sent to Belgrade Friday to meet
Yugoslav leaders.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Sweden Thursday, Kuchma reportedly said he
was willing to act as a mediator in the Kosovo crisis and meet
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
In Minsk, the Kyrghyz Foreign Ministry expressed "grave concern
" and "deep regret" over NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia and
urged NATO to cease its air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the ministry said the Kosovo crisis should be
solved in compliance with the United Nations Charter and
principles of the international law within the U.N. framework.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference, a spokesman for the Uzbek Foreign
Ministry said it has been Uzbekistan's position that any
international dispute should be solved through political means
rather than resort to the use of force.
</P>
<P>
In the Kazakh capital of Alma Ata, a group of political parties
and organizations held demonstrations around the U.S. embassy,
protesting against the "invasion" of Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led
NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-U.S. slogans, protesters condemned the U.S. and
other Western countries for "meddling in Yugoslavia's internal
affairs" and staging "an aggressive war" against Yugoslavia under
the pretext of "democracy and progress."
</P>
<P>
NATO's military action in Yugoslavia also drew criticisms from
President of the Austrian National Council Heinz Fischer who
rapped NATO for attacking Yugoslavia, a sovereign country, in
violation of international law.
</P>
<P>
In Vienna, Fischer told reporters Friday that bombing can not
put an end to the Kosovo conflict and its mid- and long-term
impact on this region is "incalculable."

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of
Cuba's Popular Power National Assembly Ricardo Alarcon Friday
reaffirmed his country's support to Colombia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement after holding talks with Colombian
President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
He said that Colombia's peace process is a noble endeavor that
deserves the backing of all the international community.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks "are something that must be resolved by
Colombians themselves," Alarcon said, because the international
community should limit its role to facilitating the process of
understanding between the government and the guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had met with guerrilla leaders during his visit to
Colombia, he said that his agenda was prepared in advance by the
Colombian Congress, which invited him to visit the country.
</P>
<P>
President Pastrana recently visited Havana, where he obtained
President Fidel Castro's promise to do his best to facilitate the
peace process, although he warned that it is an effort that
demands a great deal of patience.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Friday that the Russian people support the
Yugoslav people suffering NATO air strikes and the Russian
government has decided to provide Yugoslavia with humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov told a press conference that Russia had fully frozen its
relations with the U.S.-led Western military alliance and demanded
the withdrawal of the chief of NATO's press office from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia would not have any contact with NATO
leaders including its Secretary-General Javier Solana until NATO
stops its "invasion" of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Except the United States, Ivanov said, foreign ministers of
other members of the international Contact Group on the former
Yugoslavia have given an "active response" to Russia's proposal
for a meeting on seeking a political settlement of the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group is composed of Russia, France, Germany, the
United States, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Condemning NATO's air campaign as "a sheer aggression of a
sovereign country and an ethnic cleansing of the Yugoslavs",
Ivanov reiterated that Moscow would take advantage of all
political and diplomatic means to halt NATO's military action in
Yugoslavia which entered its third day Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said he firmly believed that those who gave orders to
bomb Yugoslavia should bear criminal responsibility and stand
trial by the international tribunal on the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But the minister said Russia treasures its relationship with
the United States and will continue to make efforts for the full
development of their ties.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same press conference, First Deputy Chief of
the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff Baluyevsky said NATO's air
strikes failed to seriously weaken Yugoslavia's military strength
and its air defense systems but the civilian casualties from the
air strikes were 10 times more than those of the military.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if Yugoslavia's nuclear power plants were
mistakenly hit, the entire Europe would be plunged into a nuclear
disaster.
</P>
<P>
If NATO's military intervention enters the stage of ground
combat, he said, NATO "invaders" would be dogged down in a
guerrilla war. But the defense minister said the government would
not agree to any suggestion that its citizens form volunteer
forces to help Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, the Russian parliament mounted their objection to
NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia where many civilians were killed
and wounded as NATO warplanes unleashed tons of bombs on their
country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, legislators
in the State Duma (the lower house of parliament) reaffirmed their
strong support for the government's firm stance against NATO's
bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party,
called for continuous protests around the U.S. embassy in Moscow
and a unilateral lifting by Russia of the United Nations arms
embargo on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The lower house has decided to postpone its discussions on the
SALT Treaty on the limitation of strategic offensive arms signed
by the United States and the former Soviet Union. The parliament
had planned to discuss the ratification of the treaty next week.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the upper house urged legislators
around the world to do what they can to stop NATO's "invasion" and
bring the Kosovo issue back to the course of a political
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the excuse that NATO's bombing is to prevent "a
humanitarian catastrophe" as "totally groundless", the statement
warned that NATO's bombing could cause serious consequences and
destroy the current world structure established by the efforts of
several generations.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Promote State Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian government
will endeavor to promote the exports of its state-owned firms to
reach the goal of 11 billion dollars of trade surplus demanded by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Foreign Minister Luiz
Felipe Lampreia said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lampreia told businessmen from the American Chamber of Commerce
that the Brazilian government will increase the exports of state-
owned firms through measures taken by the Foreign Trade Chamber of
Commerce and the Exports Promotion Agency of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Brazil must accelerate the free trade talks with Mexico and the
European Union, as well as consolidating trade with the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur), said Lampreia.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the target of achieving an 11-billion-dollar
trade surplus is ambitious, because the world trade as a whole can
only increase less than four percent this year and the demands in
the international market are weak due to the lingering global
financial crisis that began in June 1997 in Southeast Asian.
</P>
<P>
The growing protectionism by the United States and the European
Union is another obstacle to Brazilian exports, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the devaluation of Brazil's currency the real will
help to achieve the ambitious foreign trade goal. The real has
lost 40 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Brazil registered an export of 51.12 billion dollars
and an import of 57.55 billion dollars, with a trade deficit of 6.
43 billion dollars.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Sisters Venus and Serena
Williams finally meet in the Lipton Tennis Championships to turn
an unprecedented family-only women's final into reality.
</P>
<P>
The all-sister final set for Sunday will be the first time
since the Open era began in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Serena moved into the final Friday after bouncing back to oust
top-ranked Martina HIngis of Switzerland 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) and three
hours later Venus thrashed five-time Lipton champion Steffi Graf
of Germany 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Both Serena and Venus showed new dimensions in their powerful
games. Serena toyed with the far more experienced Hingis by a
variety of shots from scorching return-of-serve winners to clever
drop shots, while Venus played patiently and waited for the
veteran Graf to make mistakes, taking a 3-0 lead in each set.
</P>
<P>
But when asked who will be the winner of the all-Williams final,
Venus said that it will be her younger sister Serena although the
older Williams won each of their previous meetings in straight
sets.
</P>
<P>
But Serena proved she is by far the hottest ticket in the WTA
tour as she claimed her 16th straight victory and stay on course
for her consecutive titles after she won at the Indian Wells and
Paris.
</P>
<P>
Serena is shorter than her sister but more muscular and
athletic. Venus has a longer reach and a bigger serve as well as
an edge in experience, winnng Lipton last year and reaching the
final of U.S. Open in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Scholarships for Indonesia's Asiad Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) will hand over scholarships to 800 athletes and 200
coaches to groom them for the 2006 Asian Games, the Jakarta Post
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
KONI's outgoing vice chairman Arie Sudewo said after a meeting
to discuss the matter that the scholarships were provided by the
office of the coordinating minister for people's welfare and
poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
"We are prioritizing for athletes and coaches who will join our
Golden Garuda project," he said.
</P>
<P>
Golden Garuda is an ambitious project, designed by KONI, to
raise Indonesia to sixth position in the Asian Games rankings. The
program also includes KONI's campaign to host the 2006 games,
which has sparked controversy among sports organizations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare
and Poverty Eradication Haryono Suyono approved the proposal to
provide the scholarships following Indonesia's achievement of six
gold, 10 silver and 11 bronze medals at the 13th Asian Games in
Bangkok last year.
</P>
<P>
Haryono promised to financially help KONI and the office of the
state minister of youth affairs and sports to groom young talents
by providing the scholarships.
</P>
<P>
The scholarship recipients, who will receive 60,000 rupiah (6.8
U.S. dollars) every month, are divided into two categories: 500
athletes and coaches who will get the money for 10 years starting
from July and 500 regular recipients starting from November.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Garuda recipients are from 19 sports. They are
archery, badminton, beach volleyball, boxing, cycling, fencing,
gymnastics, judo, karate, pencak silat (k.o. system of self-
defense), rowing, sepak takraw, shooting, swimming, taekwondo,
tennis, track and field, weightlifting and windsurfing.
</P>
<P>
Last year, athletes received only 35,000 rupiah while coaches
earned 40,000 rupiah per month.
</P>
<P>
Arie said KONI would observe the achievements of athletes and
coaches for one year.
</P>
<P>
"If they can use the scholarships well, we'll extend the
program, but if they fail we'll give it to other athletes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arie explained that recipients did not have to attend a formal
education program but they could take short courses such as
computer operating, English and other courses.

He also voiced "profound respect" for those who for "religious,
political or moral" reasons are against the use of force.
</P>

"Our place is in the European Union," he added in reference to

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Drug tests of American Olympic

summer, a senior official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) executive director Dick Schultz

the testing, which is currently taken by the Olympic panel,

The USOC will reduce the companies to 2-3 finalists with the
choice made in time for the first tests by mid or late summer
using International Olympic Committee-approved labs in

A USOC task force suggested last year that the drug testing of
U.S. Olympic athletes be removed from the committee.

The task force stressed that no other national Olympic

D'Alema said Friday Italy would like to make efforts to solve the

</P>
<P>
D'Alema said his government wanted a return to diplomacy

</P>
<P>
He urged an end to the airstrikes against Yugoslavia,
suggesting that the six-nation Contact Group meet to discuss the

</P>
<P>
He said stability and peace could be ensured only when the
conflicting sides reach an agreement.
</P>

Also Friday, the lower house of the Italian parliament voted
for a motion which called on the government to make concerted

<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of people protested against the attacks on

Although it has not directly joined the NATO airstrikes, Italy
is the forward position of NATO's military actions since NATO has

SOFIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Fragments of an air-to-air missile
launched over Yugoslav territory fell west of Trun near the border
early Friday morning, the Bulgarian Interior Ministry's press

<P>
The incident posed no risk to the population in the region and

It was a self-destroyed air-to-air missile, the office said,

they miss their targets, they automatically explode in the air.

<P>
In another development, the opposition Bulgarian Socialist

Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second biggest city, in protest of NATO
strikes against Yugoslavia.

<P>
He voiced sympathy and moral support for the victims of the
bombings by NATO planes regardless of their nationality.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary majority is attempting to revise the
country's hitherto stance of non-interference in the events in
Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
His words were followed by shouts: "National Traitors" and "
Peace in the Balkans". "We refuse to pay for Bulgaria's
membership in NATO with the peace in the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
In his view, the voiced readiness for logistic support for the
operations against Yugoslavia is a betrayal of the national
interests.
</P>
<P>
With numerous police standing by, the protesters chanted
slogans like "No to War" and "No to Air Corridors."
</P>
<P>
Sixteen young Socialists made an attempt to walk past the U.S.
embassy in Sofia but were stopped by the police.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Sends More Forces to Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
dispatched 100 "combat-equipped" Marines Friday to guard the
besieged U.S. Embassy in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton informed Congress that additional military
personnel were needed to guard against Serb attacks on NATO forces
already deployed in the country neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
As NATO airstrikes seek to weaken Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's "ability to wage war on Kosovo," the Clinton
administration has repeatedly said it would not send ground troops
to Kosovo unless a peace agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
But given the violence directed at the U.S. Embassy in the
Macedonian capital of Skopje and concerns that the fighting in
Kosovo could spread, Clinton said prudence called for a greater U.
S. presence in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's message to Congress came in two letters Friday, one
officially informing lawmakers under the War Powers Act of the U.S.
military's involvement in the NATO mission and the other telling
them of his decision to send U.S. forces to Macedonia.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Michael
Johnson of the United States defeated other rivals to win the
men's 200 meters race in the Engen Grand Prix series in Cape Town
on Friday night, when a capricious wind made it a difficult night
for sprinters.
</P>
<P>
Johnson clocked 20.41 seconds ahead of South African C. du
Plessis.
</P>
<P>
Johnson ran 20.01 seconds over the same distance in
Johannesburg last week as he prepares for the world championships
in Seville, Spain, in August.
</P>
<P>
The wind played havoc with Namibian Frankie Fredericks' attempt
to squeeze under the 10-second barrier in the 100 meters, but the
world indoor 200 meters champion registered 10.38 seconds for the
champion. South Africa's Matthew Quinn was second in 10.54 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400 meters, American Jerome Young repeated last
week's victory over South African Arnaud Malherbe, clocking 45.1
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Noted American Marion Jones won the women's 100 meters, but she
was disappointed with her 11.06 seconds.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 400 meters hurdles, Llewellyn Herbert of South
Africa beat American Derrick Adkins to win the title with 55.59
seconds.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
said Friday that it intends to sell 50 F-16 fighters to Israel for
two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal includes radars and navigation-targeting systems,

<P>
"The F-16 can enhance Israel's ability to defend itself and
supports U.S. regional objectives for Israel's national security,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
F-16 fighters are capable of firing AIM-20 advanced medium-
range air-to-air missiles, AIM-9 Sidewinder heat-seeking air-to-
air missiles and a wide variety of air-to-ground munitions.

<HEADLINE> Serena Upsets Hingis at Lipton Semi-final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The picture for an all-sister
dream final became clearer as Serena Williams fought back to
eliminate top-ranked Martina Hingis of Switzerland in the semi-
finals at the Lipton Tennis Championships in Key Biscayne, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Serena now awaited a possible match-up with her older sister
Venus, the defending champion, who was to play five-time Lipton
champion Steffi Graf of Germany on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
A victory by Venus would result in an family-only women's final
Sunday, the first since the Open era began in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Williams got off a poor start after losing the first four games,
but used her trademark power strokes to keep her in the match
before she finally thrashed Hingis 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) for her 16th
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 2-0 previously against Williams, exposed her weakness
in service when the muscular Williams took advantage by repeatedly
ripping return winners.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Dutchman Richard Krajicek will try
for his first U.S. tournament title since 1993 when he plays
unseeded Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean on Saturday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and Italian science
satellites detected the ever-observed most powerful gamma ray
burst in January, the Science magazine reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted researchers from the California Institute of
Technology saying that the burst occurred 9 billion light-years
from Earth, and its energy is equal to billions of years of light
from thousands of suns.
</P>
<P>
What caused the explosion is still a mystery, said S. George
Djorgovski, astronomer at the Institute.
</P>
<P>
"It is probably something to do with massive stars," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gamma ray bursts were discovered in 1967. This phenomenon
occurs across the sky several hundred times a year, lasting only a
few milliseconds to a few minutes.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Portugal went atop the group seven
standings as they routed 10-man Azerbaijan 7-0 at Guimaraes on
Friday at the European Championships qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Sa Pinto headed a cross from midfielder Luis Figo to open the
scoring spree and offered a fine pass to Joao Pinto who grabbed
the Portugal's second just before the halftime.
</P>
<P>
The visitors had a chance to save their face in the 51st minute
but Portuguese goalkeeper Vitor Baia spoiled their effort by a
fine save.
</P>
<P>
The marching order defender Rasim Abushev received for two
bookable offences in the 66th minute added the insult to injury
for Azerbaijan who were overwhelmed so that they rarely ventured
out of midfield.
</P>
<P>
Portugal did not relax as defender Paulo Madeira made it 3-0
just a minute later in a goalmouth skirmish.
</P>
<P>
In the last 20 minutes Joao Pinto headed the fourth goal and
Sergio Conceicao was finally on target as he hit the wood for two
times ten minutes into the match.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Pedro Pauleta completed the slaughter as he
contributed his first two goals for the national squad in the 82nd
and 83rd minutes.
</P>
<P>
Portugal led after earning nine points from four games, two
points ahead of Romania who have a game in hand. Azerbaijan
languished at the bottom of the group after losing all four games
and conceding 16 goals.
</P>
<P>
Portugal will visit Liechtenstein on Wednesday when Azerbaijan
are at home to Romania.

<HEADLINE> Japan, IMF, WB Extend New Loans to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Japan,
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Friday agreed
to extend new loans to Indonesia, the Jakarta Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of Japan agreed to extend 210 billion
yen (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) to Indonesia, while the IMF offered
another one billion U.S. dollars to help with the rehabilitation
and restructuring of Indonesia's devastated economy.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank also announced a 31.5 million U.S. dollar
technical assistance loan to help the Indonesian government with
its corporate restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of Japan said in a statement that the
loan was part of the 2.4 billion U.S. dollar equivalent aid
package to Indonesia under the New Miyazawa Initiative, announced
in Japan in February.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa announced a
30-billion-dollar initiative for Asia named after him when he
attended a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in
Washington in October. The aid package was initially proposed for
five Asian countries hit by the current economic crisis, including
Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IMF's first managing director Stanley Fischer said
in a statement from Washington that the fund's executive board had
approved Indonesia's request to increase its existing 11.3 billion
U.S. dollar loan facility by a further one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Indonesia would receive 460 million U.S. dollars
immediately, bringing total payments to 9.3 billion U.S. dollars
since the IMF first approved a massive loan in November 1997.
Indonesia could receive an additional 3 billion U.S. dollars by
November 2000.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said in a statement that the approved 31.5
million U.S. dollar technical assistance loan was designed to help
the government support the corporate restructuring activities of
Bank Indonesia and the Indonesian Debt Restructuring Agency, and
to enhance the work of the Jakarta Initiative Task Force in
facilitating and accelerating debt and overall corporate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The bank added that over 125 companies and their creditors with
aggregate external debts of over 17 billion U.S. dollars have
begun to use the Jakarta Initiative's facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek
reshuffled his cabinet Saturday by appointing four new ministers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Agriculture Jacek Janiszewski was replaced by Artur
Balazs while Minister of Health and Social Welfare Wojciech
Maksymowicz was replaced by Franciszka Cegielska.
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Zakrzewski took the post of minister of culture and art
to replace Joanna Wnuk-Nazarowa while Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications Marek Zdrojewski was replaced by Maiej Srebro.
</P>
<P>
And two ministers without portfolio were also removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle was reported to be the most drastic one since the
Solidarity Trade Union came to power in October 1997. Officials
who are considered incompetent in carrying out duties or redundant
cabinet departments are likely to go.
</P>
<P>
Buzek replaced some other senior officials around him early
March including the chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Buzek was prompted to make the move as the
Polish economy had slipped dramatically and the reforms in
administration, health care, social welfare and education turned
haywire during the past year.

<HEADLINE> Italian, Russian Foreign Ministers Discuss Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini talked with his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov by phone
Friday as Russia stepped up pressure to halt NATO attacks on
Yugoslavia, including the freezing of ties with NATO.
</P>
<P>
According to the Italian news agency ANSA, Dini's talks with
Ivanov were aimed at creating conditions for the return of a
political perspective for resolving the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Dini said there was as yet no signal from
Belgrade that might lead to the resumption of peace talks on the
basis of the accord reached at Rambouillet near Paris restoring
Kosovo autonomy and putting an international peacekeeping force in
place.
</P>
<P>
Dini also denied reports that Italy agreed with Russia it was
time to stop the attacks and resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his talks with Ivanov, Dini had a long
conversation with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana to assess
the first phase of the attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema on Thursday said that after the
first stage was completed it might be the time to try to return to
the negotiating table, a statement that was received frostily in
London and Washington.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Dini, Ivanov declared in Russia that
Belgrade was ready to resume negotiations, but he did not state on
what terms.
</P>
<P>
Russia Friday froze ties with NATO and expelled the NATO
permanent representative in Moscow, who has been working with the
Russian government under the Partnership for Peace program.
</P>
<P>
Two days ago, Russia recalled from Brussels its permanent
representative at NATO, General Viktor Zazarzin.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details NATO Bombs for Third Night, Belgrade Signals Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO forces continued its
bombings on Yugoslavia for the third night Friday as Belgrade
signaled its readiness to talk.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen loud explosions were heard from southeast Belgrade
at around 10:30 p.m. local time (21:30 GMT).)
</P>
<P>
Orange clouds lit the sky following the raids, which lasted
more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A window of the townhouse where Xinhua correspondents stay was
shaken open.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported later that the NATO
missiles hit the chemical storage near the Belgrade suburb
Sremcica, sending toxic fumes into the air.
</P>
<P>
A fuel storage was also hit in Lipovica, setting fire to the
nearby forests.
</P>
<P>
A transformer station was hit in Batajnica and the suburb has
been left without electricity. The pharmaceuticals factory Gal
inkawas was also hit in the same suburb.
</P>
<P>
This was the first known power outage in Belgrade since NATO
started its bombing campaigns Wednesday night. Without electricity,
many homes would have difficulty cooking as most of Belgrade's
households are fitted with only electricity-powered stoves.
</P>
<P>
Pristina, capital of the breakaway Kosovo province, was hit by
three NATO missiles, two at about 11:30 p.m. (22:30 GMT) and the
third at 00:05 a.m. Saturday (23:05 GMT Friday), Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic
said Belgrade was ready to talk but insisted that the negotiations
must be preceded by an end to NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Serbia are in favor of a peaceful and political
settlement of the Kosovo issue, but talks are impossible while
NATO bombs are falling, Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that negotiations can continue any time and
anywhere once the NATO aggression ceases, and a political
agreement can be reached if the provisions granting to Kosovo the
status of a third republic or independent state are deleted from
the Rambouillet final document.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade believes the provisions grant Kosovo more power than
its Serbia and Montenegro republics.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic said as soon as such an agreement is reached,
negotiations can start on the best ways of implementing it, "
including international presence", Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
NATO's first bombing of Belgrade on Friday came in the
afternoon when missiles hit the outskirts at the foot of Mt Avala,
higher parts of Vozdovac and the suburb of Mali Mokri Lug, Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the bombings had caused any casualties, but
Tanjug said ambulances were standing ready to extend first aid
assistance to all citizens who might have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO struck targets near Belgrade
during the daytime. On Thursday morning, the Batajnica military
airport and the Pancevo aircraft plant were bombed at around 9:15
a.m. (8:15 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army General Staff said earlier Friday that NATO
planes and cruise missiles attacked some "40 objects and populated
areas" around the country Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The sites hit were predominantly army barracks, where soldiers
were housed, with an evident objective to inflict the biggest
possible casualties, Tanjug quoted the Army General Staff's press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose how many people, military and otherwise,
were killed or wounded in Thursday's raids, but Red Cross
helicopters could be seen flying to the southeast part of the city
at around noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
By targeting and striking the living quarters of soldiers
during the day, NATO is apparently trying to wear down the
Yugoslav army's effective strength and weaken their morale.
</P>
<P>
But the Army General Staff press service said the servicemen
were defending their homeland with honor and courage and had
successfully overcome what it called the psychological phase of
the initial air strikes.
</P>
<P>
State television showed footage of damage such as shattered
windows, cracked walls and felled trees caused by NATO bombings in
civilian quarters such as residential apartments and schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
With an ironic undertone, pictures of a damaged ancient church
was followed by footage of American envoy Richard Holbrooke and
French President Jacques Chirac visiting its interior and viewing
the icons on the wall.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade severed diplomatic ties with the United States, France,
Britain and Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At around midnight, the TV stations started to show "Wag the
Dog," a movie depicting a U.S. president who sought Hollywood help
to create a war to divert people's attention from a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
Despite the bombings, residents remained calm. Power and water
supplies functioned normally. Stores were well stocked except for
some items.
</P>
<P>
However, petroleum is no longer available to civilian vehicles.
Only very few taxis could be seen running in the streets, most
probably carrying family members or friends rather than customers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fighters Shoot Down Yugoslav Jets Over Bosnia: Pentagon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Air Force F-15
fighters shot down two Yugoslav MiG-29 jets in Bosnia Friday in
the first spillover of NATO's air war with Yugoslavia beyond its
borders, a U.S. Defense Department official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said it was not immediately clear why the Russian-built MiGs
had crossed into Bosnian airspace, but he said it was possible
they had intended to attack NATO peacekeeping troops in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"A second possibility is that they were involved in some sort
of a Serb scheme to shoot down one of our planes," he said, "And
obviously if this was the scheme, it backfired egregiously on the
Yugoslavs."
</P>
<P>
The shootdowns brought to five the number of Yugoslav MiG-29s
destroyed since NATO's air campaign began Wednesday. Bacon said
Yugoslavia has only 15 such planes, which are the best in its air
force.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to initial reports by NATO officials, Bacon said the
two MiG pilots had not been captured.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the pilots are alive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon claimed the incident was a "serious challenge" to NATO,
but said the alliance had been prepared for possible efforts by
the Yugoslavs to retaliate for NATO's severe airstrikes, which
entered a third day Friday. As an extra security precaution, the
American peacekeepers in Bosnia have been ordered to wear flak
jackets whenever they are outdoors, even at their main base in
Tuzla, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The F-15 fighters that shot down the MiGs were conducting
routine air patrols over Bosnia as part of NATO's enforcement of a
"no-fly" zone over Bosnia, a mission that has been going on since
1995 and is separate from the NATO air offensive against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It was not yet clear what kind of weapon the American jets used
to bring down the MiGs, but they normally are armed with three
kinds of air-to-air missiles, Bacon said.

to China, which will be the only Asian country that he visits
during the period when he serves as European Union's rotating
president.
</P>
<P>

economy, and culture, Schroeder said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Cuts Rates Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
adjusted its policy rates for the seventh consecutive time Friday
and set it 12.5 basis points loser effective Monday next week, a
local newspaper The Journal reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel C. Singson said Friday that the
overnight borrowing rate will be at 11.875 percent and lending
rate at 13.875 percent from the previous 12 percent and 14
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The decision reflected the lowing of the benchmark 91-day
treasury Bill rate set at the auctions last Monday at only 11.917
percent, Singson said.
</P>
<P>
The latest reduction in policy rates is consistent with
relentless efforts by both Singson and Finance Secretary Edgardo
B. Espiritu to lower the cost of doing business and spur economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Singson noted the banks had consistently pointed to the lack of
good borrowers as the reason for the slowdown in credit growth.
</P>
<P>
Borrowers, on the other hand, have been complaining about the
refusal of banks to lend because of the greater risks involved.
</P>
<P>
"This latest reduction should again encourage the banks to
lend. I ask them all to be less timid in extending credit,"
Singson said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombs for Third Night, Belgrade Signals Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- NATO forces attacked Yugoslavia
for the third night Friday as Belgrade signaled its readiness to
talk.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen loud explosions could be heard from southeast
Belgrade at around 22:30 (21:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Orange clouds radiated in the sky following the raids, which
lasted more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A window of the townhouse where Xinhua correspondents stay was
shaken open.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vuk
Draskovic said Belgrade was ready to talk but insisted that the
negotiations be preceded by an end to NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia and Serbia are in favor of a peaceful and political
settlement of the Kosovo issue, but talks are impossible while
NATO bombs are falling, Draskovic said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that negotiations can continue any time and
anywhere once the NATO aggression ceases, and a political
agreement can be reached if the provisions granting to Kosovo the
status of a third republic or independent state are deleted from
the Rambouillet final document.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade believes the provisions grant Kosovo more power than
its Serbia and Montenegro republics.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic said as soon as such an agreement is reached,
negotiations can start on the best ways of implementing it, "
including international presence", the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
NATO's first bombing of Belgrade on Friday came in the
afternoon when missiles hit the outskirts at the foot of Mt Avala,
higher parts of Vozdovac and the suburb of Mali Mokri Lug, Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the bombings had caused any casualties, but
Tanjug said ambulances were standing ready to extend first aid
assistance to all citizens who might have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO struck targets near Belgrade
during the daytime. On Thursday morning, the Batajnica military
airport and the Pancevo aircraft plant were bombed at around 9:15
a.m. (8:15 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army General Staff said earlier Friday that NATO
planes and cruise missiles attacked some "40 objects and populated
areas" around the country Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The sites hit were predominantly army barracks, where soldiers
were housed, with an evident objective to inflict the biggest
possible casualties, Tanjug quoted the Army General Staff's press
service as saying.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose how many people, military and otherwise,
were killed or wounded in Thursday's raids, but Red Cross
helicopters could be seen flying to the southeast part of the city
at around noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
By targeting and striking the living quarters of soldiers
during the day, NATO is apparently trying to wear down the
Yugoslav army's effective strength and weaken their morale.
</P>
<P>
But the Army General Staff press service said the servicemen
were defending their homeland with honor and courage and had
successfully overcome what it called the psychological phase of
the initial air strikes.
</P>
<P>
State television showed footage of damage such as shattered
windows, cracked walls and felled trees caused by NATO bombings in
civilian quarters such as residential apartments and schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
With an ironic undertone, pictures of a damaged ancient church
was followed by footage of American envoy Richard Holbrooke and
French President Jacques Chirac visiting its interior and viewing
the icons on the wall.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade severed diplomatic ties with the United States, France,
Britain and Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At around midnight, the TV stations started to show "Wag the
Dog," a movie depicting a U.S. president who sought Hollywood help
to create a war to divert people's attention from a sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
Despite the bombings, residents remained calm. Power and water
supplies functioned normally. Stores were well stocked except for
some items.
</P>
<P>
However, petroleum is no longer available to civilian vehicles.
Only very few taxis could be seen running in the streets, most
probably carrying family members or friends rather than customers.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details NATO Launches Third Night of Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-led NATO forces
launched a third night of airstrikes against Yugoslavia on Friday,
targeting Serb military sites with air-launched cruise missiles
and U.S. stealth fighter jets, the U.S. Defense Department said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO attack began at about 9 p.m. in Yugoslavia with cruise-
missile equipped B-52 bombers leading the assault, Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Also in the mix were F-117 stealth fighter jets equipped with
laser-guided munitions, Bacon said, adding that the fighter jets
are able to evade radar that Serb anti-aircraft missile operators
may use to target them for shoot down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Belgrade radio said NATO was hitting numerous
targets in the Yugoslav capital's suburbs in what appeared to be
the strongest attack so far.
</P>
<P>
"The allied air force is large," Bacon told reporters about two
hours after the evening operation began.
</P>
<P>
He said allied planes had taken off during the daylight hours
Friday. Other defense officials, who asked not to be identified,
said they did not attack until after nightfall.
</P>
<P>
In all, about 400 NATO aircraft are part of the bombing
campaign launched Wednesday to "punish Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for waging war against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and
refusing to sign a peace deal to grant them autonomy."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, NATO forces launched their first daylight
attack, firing a lone cruise missile from a U.S. ship based in the
Mediterranean Sea, according to Bacon.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Friday night's NATO bombing campaign would continue
to focus on attacking the formidable Serb air defense system
throughout Yugoslavia and Kosovo, which hasn't yet been used
against allied planes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, alliance forces will also be targeting Serb
military targets, such as ammunition and fuel dumps and command
and control centers, in order to "reduce the ability of the army
and police to attack ethnic Albanians," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuing to focus on... the integrated air defense
system throughout Yugoslavia and Kosovo," he said. "But as we have
made progress... we are gradually increasing the emphasis on
attacking targets in Kosovo itself," where the Serbs have stepped
up attacks on Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also confirmed that NATO warplanes shot down two Yugoslav
MiG-29 jet fighters that tried to attack peacekeeping troops in
neighboring Bosnia. He said the aircraft were picked up on radar
by allied airplanes and they were shot down Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping troops were searching for the planes' two pilots,
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said earlier from the alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: We Can Beat Anyone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- England rookie coach Kevin Keegan
named his first team Friday and declared: "We're capable of
beating anyone."
</P>
<P>
England's part-time coach has gone for an attacking strategy,
naming David Beckham of Manchester United and Liverpool's Steve
McManaman as his two wingers.
</P>
<P>
There are no real surprises from Keegan, with Martin Keown
replacing Arsenal team-mate Tony Adams who pulled out this morning
with a back injury, while there is a first cap for Tottenham's Tim
Sherwood and Andy Cole makes his full debut alongside Alan Shearer
in attack.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "This is an excellent team who are capable of
beating anyone. I was very excited when I was drawing it up and I
still am."
</P>
<P>
Keegan's decision to name his team a day before the match is in
stark contrast to the policy of former coach Glenn Hoddle, who
liked to indulge in mind games by refusing to announce his line up
until the last possible moment. But Keegan feels it is important
that the players know they are bound to be involved.
</P>
<P>
"You can play games too much. These mind games are fine but
sometimes they can end up having an adverse effect on your own
players," said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"They wonder 'Am I playing, am I not'. If I've got a youngster
playing and I'm going to give him a game then I go and tell him. I
pull him to one side and say: 'Get your mind right because you are
in.'
</P>
<P>
"Then I can work with him in a different way and he's focused
on what is going to happen. It is important to tell the players
because there are things you want to work on such as set pieces,
free kicks for and against, and your general pattern of play.
</P>
<P>
"If you have got players who haven't played there before then
it's only fair to them that you let them know. This is just my way
and I think it is right," he added.

<HEADLINE> Russians Wins Ice Dance Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russians Angelika Krylova and
Oleg Ovsiannikov kept alive the Russian golds sweep as they took
the ice dance titles with a wager-thin victory over the French
challengers at the World Figure Skating Championships Friday.
</P>
<P>
Krylova and Ovsiannikov earned a 5-4 close decision in the head-
to-head match against Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, who
had led after the original dance program. Shae-Lynn Bourne and
Victor Kraatz of Canada placed third.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Russia its third straight title of these
championships after Yelena Berzhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze took
the pairs and Alexei Yagudin captured the men. All the Russians
were defending champions.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian Maria Butyrskaya also led the women's events
after titleholder Michelle Kwan fell on the jump and slipped to
fourth in the short program.
</P>
<P>
Following Butyrskaya are Russia's Julia Soldatova and Vanessa
Gusmeroli of France, both of whom are surprising to find
themselves ahead of Kwan.
</P>
<P>
If Kwan regains her top form on Saturday, even Butyrskya would
be unlikely to beat her in the long program. But under the new
scoring system this year, in which the qualification round counts
for 20 percent, Butyrskaya could win the title even if she places
second behind Kwan in the free skating.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Coach Rix Jailed for Underage Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea Football Club coach and
former England star Graham Rix was sentenced Friday to a total of
12 months imprisonment for having unlawful sex with a 15-year-old
girl and indecently assaulting her.
</P>
<P>
The former player, who was capped for England 17 times and is
regarded as one of the country's top coaches, was sentenced at
London's Knightsbridge Crown Court.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier hearing, Rix, a 41-year-old father of four,
pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sex and a second charge of
indecent assault.
</P>
<P>
Rix, of Richmond, south-west London, is believed to have met
the girl and had sex with her at a west London hotel on the eve of
Chelsea's Premiership match with Manchester United in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
Sentencing him, the judge told Rix that in the circumstances of
the case, there was "no realistic alternative" to an immediate
sentence of imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that Rix would be released after serving
half of his sentence and then remain subject to the terms of
licence. Rix will also have to remain on the sex offenders'
register for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The judge made it clear that the circumstances of the case made
it very difficult to impose a fair sentence.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged Rix to be "a mature man of previous impeccable
character and soundness of reputation, with an impressive career
in his field of professional expertise, held in high regard by his
colleagues and the public alike".
</P>
<P>
Although the young girl had not been abducted or been subjected
to violence, her welfare had to be protected.
</P>
<P>
The judge told the court: "These offences took place when she
was only weeks short of her 16th birthday, the age of consent, yet
at the time of the offences she was a virgin, plainly a girl who
was undoubtedly like any other fascinated and flattered by the
attentions of a man who was to her knowledge a celebrity, attended
by the glamour of fame and success."
</P>
<P>
She was, he said, a well brought up girl from a "wholly
respectable and decent family".
</P>
<P>
He added: "It is all too easy for a grown man to say 'She
looked older, she said she was 16 and I believed her'."
</P>
<P>
The judge went on: "It is precisely because young girls barely
beyond puberty are so likely to appear and to present themselves
as very much older than they actually are that the courts have the
clearest duty to protect them against seduction and sexual abuse."
</P>
<P>
Although the judge accepted the girl made no strong protests to
Rix's advances, he deemed his behaviour irresponsible. "There was
in my view a significant amount of irresponsibility in your
behaviour, illustrating a determination to have sex irrespective
of her feelings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The judge pointed out that Rix had refused to use a condom
despite the girl's requests and his knowledge that she was a
virgin at the time.
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Chelsea's chief executive, Colin Hutchinson,
said that although the club disapproved of Rix's behaviour it
would keep his job open.
</P>
<P>
"Chelsea do not condone what Graham Rix did, but he is paying a
very, very heavy price for one mistake and he will serve the
sentence and the stigma will stay with him for the rest of his
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He is probably unemployable in football, but the job will be
kept open and he will return to his post. That is the wish of the
club, the wish of the manager, Gianluca Vialli and the wish of the
players."
</P>
<P>
Rix's agent, Dennis Roach, said: "It's a severe sentence for a
moment of weakness."

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) --The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has launched a third night of airstrikes in
Yugoslavia, the U.S. Defense Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said the NATO attack began at about 9 p.m. in Yugoslavia
with cruise-missile equipped B-52 bombers leading the assault.
Also in the mix were F-117 stealth fighters jets equipped with
laser-guided munitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon called the allied operation against Serb targets large,
involving air-launched cruise missiles and U.S. stealth fighter
jets.
</P>
<P>
The fighter jets are able to evade radar that Serb
anti-aircraft missile operators may use to target them for shoot
down, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Air operations began about two and one-half hours ago and they
are ongoing," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
In all, about 400 NATO aircraft are part of the bombing
campaign launched on Wednesday to "punish Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for waging war against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and refusing to sign a peace deal to grant them autonomy."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, NATO forces launched their first daylight
attack, firing a lone cruise missile from a U.S. ship based in the
Mediterranean Sea, according to Bacon.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said Friday night's NATO bombing campaign would continue
to focus on attacking the formidable Serb air defense system
throughout Yugoslavia and Kosovo, which hasn't yet been used
against allied planes.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, alliance forces also will be targeting Serb
military targets, such as ammunition and fuel dumps and command
and control centers, in order to reduce the ability of the army
and police to attack ethnic Albanians, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Bacon also confirmed that NATO warplanes shot down two Yugoslav
MiG-29 jet fighters that tried to attack peacekeeping troops in
neighboring Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping troops were searching for the planes' two pilots,
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said earlier from the alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: NATO Can Not Act Above U.N. Charter  by Gu Zhenqiu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Once again, the U.N.
Security Council Friday became a stage of the struggle between war
and peace, between the law and the lawless.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, the Council, by the vote of 3 to 12, failed to
adopt a draft resolution, co-sponsored by Russia, Belarus and
India, which calls for an immediate end to the ongoing NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, a sovereign and independent member of
the U.N. family.
</P>
<P>
Belarus and India later joined Russia, a permanent member of
the 15-country body, in sponsoring the draft resolution, a move to
defend the U.N. Charter and the authority of the Security Council,
which, under the Charter, has the primary responsibility for the
maintenance of peace and security worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Council's failure in the draft adoption,
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent member to the United Nations,
said, "the NATO members sitting on the Council must bear all the
responsibility for the undermining of the principle of the U.N.
Charter and the authority of the Security Council as the primary
body in the area of maintaining peace and security" in the world
at large.
</P>
<P>
First of all, it should be reminded that NATO members are U.N.
members, and they should abide by the principle of the U.N.
Charter and the norms guiding the international law.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the NATO strikes has sent a clear-cut signal to
the world community that NATO would not listen to the Security
Council. It appeared that NATO believes itself above the Charter
and the international law.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it did not try, not even by a single symbolic gesture,
to seek the authorisation of the Security Council. This is very
dangerous as the world is poised to brace for the new century.
</P>
<P>
Seeing this dangerous trend, Kamalesh Sharma, Indian permanent
representative to the United Nations, told the Security Council,
"Those who took the law into their own hands had never improved
civic peace within nations; neither would they help in
international relations."
</P>
<P>
In essence, Friday's vote is not only on the issue of Kosovo,
an internal affairs of Yugoslavia, but goes directly to the
Council's authority, in the eyes of the whole world community.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what was in balance now was law and lawlessness, of
either reaffirming the commitments of one's people to the U.N.
Charter, or tolerating a situation where gross force was the norm.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia in
the name of "the international community." However, the
international community could hardly be said to have endorsed
their actions, when representatives of China, Russia and India,
who already stand for half of humanity, had said that they did
not accept what NATO had done in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt Sets N. Irish Talks Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam on Friday gave politicians in the province until the middle
of next week to resolve the weapons stumbling block that is
holding up power transfer.
</P>
<P>
She said she would call a meeting of the new Assembly for next
Wednesday or Thursday to initiate the procedure which would bring
about devolution.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam, speaking at Stormont after another round of talks with
the political parties, said: "None of the party leaders, I
believe, want to see all that we have achieved in the past year
collapse. Quite the reverse.
</P>
<P>
"All parties have to take responsibility to resolve the present
impasse. Everyone has to take another step to find an
accommodation," she added.
</P>
<P>
This would mean all parties would have to decide whether to go
ahead and form an executive and appoint ministers.
</P>
<P>
But the First Minister-designate and Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble said he would not back down from his position that
the IRA had to begin decommissioning before he would agree to Sinn
Fein taking part in the executive.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein have said they cannot begin to move towards a weapons
handover. The IRA continues to refuse to disarm.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart
Bertie Ahern are due to meet in Belfast on Monday and join the
intensive negotiations to try to break the deadlock.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bombs Belgrade for Third Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade came under NATO bombing
for the third night Friday and over a dozen loud explosions could
be heard from the city's southeast at around 22:30 (21:30GMT).
</P>
<P>
Orange clouds radiated in the sky in the wake of the raids,
which lasted more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A window of the townhouse where Xinhua correspondents stay was
shaken open.
</P>
<P>
Sirens started to wail at 20:25 (19:25GMT) and the intervals
were much shorter than the nights before.
</P>
<P>
NATO's first bombing of Belgrade Friday came in the afternoon,
when missiles hit the outskirts at the foot of Mt Avala, higher
parts of Vozdovac and the suburb of Mali Mokri Lug, Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the bombings had caused any casualties, but
Tanjug said ambulances were standing ready to extend first aid
assistance to all citizens who might have been hurt.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that NATO struck targets near Belgrade
during the daytime. On Thursday morning, the Batajnica military
airport and the Pancevo aircraft plant were bombed at around 9:15.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Army General Staff said earlier Friday that NATO
planes and cruise missiles attacked some 40 "objects and populated
areas" around the country Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The targets hit were predominantly army barracks, where
soldiers were housed, with an evident objective to inflict the
biggest possible casualties, Tanjug quoted the Army General
Staff's press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
It did not disclose how many people, military and otherwise,
were killed or wounded in Thursday's raids, but Red Cross
helicopters could be seen flying to the southeast part of the city
at around noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
By targetting the living quarters of soldiers and striking also
during the day, NATO is apparently trying to wear down the
Yugoslav army's effective strength and weaken their morale.
</P>
<P>
But the Army General Staff press service said the servicemen
were defending their homeland with honor and courage and had
successfully overcome what it called the psychological phase of
the initial air strikes.
</P>
<P>
State television showed footage of damage such as shattered
windows, cracked walls and felled trees caused by NATO bombings in
civilian quarters such as residential apartments and schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
With an ironic undertone, pictures of a damaged ancient church
was followed by footage of American envoy Richard Holbrooke and
French President Jacques Chirac visiting its interior and viewing
the icons on the wall.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade severed diplomatic ties with the United States,
France, Britain and Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the bombings, residents remained calm. Power and water
supplies functioned normally. Stores were well stocked except for
some items but petroleum was no longer available to civilian
vehicles.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock indexes moved
lower Friday as investors made profits while showing unease about
prospect of the NATO bombings on Yugoslavia over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,822.24, down 14.15
from a gain of 169.55 points Thursday. The index was down 89
points in early trading before trimming most of its losses.
</P>
<P>
The technology heavy Nasdaq index was down 15.63 at 2,419.17
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 7.19 at 1,282.80.
</P>
<P>
Investors sold their stocks to lock in profits after a strong
rally in the market thursday.
</P>
<P>
The market was also affected as investors got worried about the
future of NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia. They believed
earlier that one or two air strikes would solve the Kosovo problem
but now the fightings continued between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
in the Yugoslav province after two days of the NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
Many were concerned with whether or not the United States will
have to send its troops into Kosovo, AP said.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 2.51 to 602.35. But the American Stock
Exchange index rose 6.34 to 718.74 and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 0.93 to 393.92.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,370 up, 1,628 down and 527
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 689.97 million shares from 777.62
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Businessmen Concerned by Yugoslav Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Romanian businessmen are
becoming more and more concerned about losses that might occur in
Romania's exports, as a result of the state of insecurity
generated by the airstrikes against target-areas such as Belgrade
and Novi Sad, as well as of restrictions on road, sea and air
traffic.
</P>
<P>
"Very few Romanians are still venturing across the border with
Yugoslavia, following the airstrikes launched against the areas
where they were doing business", Mihai Popovici of the Pop Trans
SRL company was quoted by a local daily as saying. "The
circumstances are forcing us to switch onto other market sectors,
but this is a difficult undertaking, as long as such sudden moves
result immediately in a drastic drop in earnings", Mihai Popovici
added.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav harbour master's office released a traffic ban
following closure of the Serbian harbour lock, said Nicolae
Urdareanu, director general of the Romanian Danube port of Orsova.
"Neither passenger nor freight traffic is operational any longer.
Although there are still several operational ships, they are not
allowed to leave harbours any more", Urdareanu added.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in Yugoslavia causes serious trouble to business
run by SC Celrom SA director general Laurentiu Patraoanu as well.
"It is well-known that western Romania's economy has interfered
with eastern Yugoslavia's one, so that the crisis in our immediate
neighbourhood can cause nothing but confusion and concern",
Patraoanu said.
</P>
<P>
Romanian businessmen hope that the trades could be resumed as
soon as the arms fall silent.
</P>
<P>
Volume of trade between Romania and Yugoslavia is estimated at
179.8 million U.S. dollars last year. Romania's main staples were
common metals, mineral products, as well as cars and transport
equipment. More losses are estimated to exceed those suffered by
Romania following the embargo imposed by UNO, worth about seven
billion U.S. dollars. The embargo had also led to closure of SC
Solventul SA detergent maker of the city of Timisoara.
</P>
<P>
Besides predictable losses, there is also a risk for Romania to
nourish again fuel smuggling across the Danube River, due
particularly to the cut in petrol sales in Yugoslavia.
