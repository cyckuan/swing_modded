 ANALYSIS: SOARING ECONOMY ALWAYS A TRUMP CARD FOR CLINTON  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  WASHINGTON _ As his former paramour and alleged co-conspirator
talked to prosecutors just four blocks away, President Clinton
stood before cameras Monday and offered his strongest defense _ a
surging U.S. economy.
<P>
   Outside the Mayflower Hotel, seven satellite trucks, 18 news
cameras and a pack of chilled reporters waited in the cold to
chronicle the details of Monica Lewinsky's testimony: Did Clinton
ask her to lie about their affair under oath, to hide gifts, or
offer her a job in return for her silence?
</P>
<P>
   Inside the White House, there was no evidence of even the
slightest concern. It was another day in the split-screen
presidency, with a humiliating display of his weaknesses tempered
by a very public showing of his strength.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Lewinsky was completing her second hour of
questioning, Clinton was addressing a self-congratulatory crowd of
cabinet secretaries, economic advisers and other administration
officials, proudly discussing the world of economic possibilities
into the century ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It was less a budget presentation than a celebration. A string
quartet played Mozart in the White House East Room as guests and
media filed in for what is typically a more sober exercise. A
military band burst into ``Hail to the Chief'' as Clinton walked
into the room to a prolonged standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the commander in chief showing off the highlights of
his domestic agenda, and what he hopes will be the cornerstone of
his legacy. Here was Clinton trying to prove that even if he is
operating under the cloud of impeachment, he is also _ as Vice
President Al Gore introduced him _ ``one of the greatest economic
stewards this nation has ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took office, we charted a new course,'' Clinton said in
front of a bank of cameras that rivaled the setup outside
Lewinsky's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited his first budget in 1993 _ which Congress passed
by a single vote _ his promotion of free trade, and the spending
programs he refers to as ``investments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, following that path, Americans have created the longest
peacetime expansion in our history _ nearly 18 million new jobs,
wages rising at twice the rate of inflation, the highest
homeownership in history, the lowest welfare rolls, the lowest
peacetime unemployment since 1957,'' Clinton crowed.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are unimpeachable, even with a dispute over who
deserves the credit. Whether it is the result of fiscal discipline
and sensible policies (as the White House maintains) or blind luck
for being in office during an unprecedented period of growth (as
Republicans insist), Clinton has the unquestioned good fortune to
be overseeing a new era of surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic house is in order and strong,'' Clinton insisted,
in comments he will take on the road beginning this morning, with a
trip to the Northeast. ``This is especially important now with all
this financial turmoil around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the political turmoil at home.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that about half of the country does
not believe Clinton is honest or trustworthy enough to be
president. One poll released over the weekend found that more than
3 out of 4 Americans do not believe that Clinton shares their own
moral values.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the same poll _ conducted by the Los Angeles Times _ found
that 73 percent approve of the job he is doing with the economy,
including more than half of the Republicans polled. And that
explains why the L.A. Times polls, like scores of others since the
Lewinsky scandal first broke, found that about two-thirds of
America approves of the job he is doing overall as president, and
does not want to see him removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is in the enviable position of being able to shower the
public with goodies: $536 billion for new retirement accounts; $33
billion in tax breaks; $1.5 billion to fight AIDS; $1.4 billion for
new teachers; $1.2 billion for child care; $1 billion to buy new
parkland, and even $50 million to demolish abandoned buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It explains why most Americans scowl at independent counsel
Kenneth Starr when he talks of seeking a criminal indictment
against the president, an act that several observers this weekend
likened to Captain Ahab's relentless pursuit of Moby Dick.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, Clinton had a private conversation with an aide,
John Podesta, and assured him _ as he did the entire nation _ that
he had not had sex with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, now his chief of staff, seemed completely unconcerned
Monday, as he compared Clinton's economic announcement in the East
Room to Dolley Madison's effort to save George Washington's
portrait during the War of 1812.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' Podesta said before the assembled crowd,
``thank you for your vision and your leadership that have taken
America so far.''

<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ A thunderous explosion, followed by a fire
that burned for several hours, killed one worker and injured at
least 30 on Monday at the Ford Motor Co.'s River Rouge complex,
long a symbol of American industrial strength that put the nation
on wheels by building the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion and fire heavily damaged the complex's power
plant, which normally produces enough electricity to supply the
residential needs of a city the size of Boston. Ford and Rouge
Steel, a subsidiary that Ford spun off in 1989, were forced to
close all six factories in the Rouge complex and send home
virtually all of the factories' 10,000 workers until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
   Art Janes, the Ford site manager here, said late Monday night
that the company was bringing in generators to reopen a parts
factory here quickly, adding that 16 of Ford's 20 North American
assembly plants depended on parts from it. Later, a Ford spokesman
said four assembly plants elsewhere were scheduled for half-shifts
on Tuesday because of a shortage of parts.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosion, which occurred in a boiler at about
1 p.m., was not known.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Jeffress, the assistant secretary of labor for
occupational safety and health in Washington, said that although
industrial accidents involving similar numbers of injuries happen
occasionally, it was extremely rare to have such a broad and
immediate economic effect from an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan is one of 23 states in which state officials, instead
of federal ones, investigate workplace mishaps, and these state
investigators will start as soon as firefighters declare the site
safe, Jeffress said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dead and injured, one worker was missing on
Monday night and might be the unidentified dead person, police
said. Many of the injured were severely burned and 12 were in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry workers have a rate of injuries and work-related
illnesses that is two-and-a-half times that of the average for all
workers in the private sector, according to the federal Bureau of
Labor Statistics. But Ford has had a fairly good record until now,
maintaining a large staff to investigate ways to improve workplace
safety, Jeffress said.
</P>
<P>
   William Clay Ford Jr., the Ford Motor Co.'s chairman, arrived at
the factory less than two hours after the explosion, as
firefighters were still trying to put out the blaze, and said that
the loss of life and injuries made Monday ``the worst day of my
life.'' A great-grandson of Henry Ford, Ford, 44, emphasized safety
and environmental issues as a member of Ford's board before
reasserting the Ford family's control of the company last fall and
becoming the chairman at the start of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor's headquarters is still located about three miles
from the Rouge complex here in this southwestern suburb of Detroit.
Started in 1918, the factory complex employed nearly 100,000
workers at its peak in the late 1940s. The complex took raw iron
ore, timber, rubber and other raw materials and turned them into
cars. While Henry Ford perfected assembly-line production and built
the first Model T's at another, smaller factory in nearby Highland
Park, Mich., it was the Rouge complex that became a symbol of
American mass production after World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent factory complexes were less ambitious, buying more of
their parts from outside suppliers. Ford now builds the Mustang and
many auto parts here.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials refused to speculate on Monday night on when the
aging factories here would reopen, saying that their first concern
was for their workers' safety. The unionized workers here will
continue to be paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the official cause of explosion was still a mystery on
Monday night, a man identifying himself as a power plant foreman
called a local radio station and said that sensors had alerted to
him a problem with a ``pressure relief valve'' on a boiler.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, flames leaped from the top floor of the
factory for several hours. The factory building is the equivalent
of 20 stories and covers most of a city block; its eight
smokestacks are 600 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   George McPartlin, a Ford employee who used to work inside the
plant and stood outside it on Monday afternoon, said that the top
floor was where coal dust was blown by powerful fans as fuel into
the boilers. He raced to the factory on Monday afternoon to make
sure that his brother, Larry, a power plant electrician, was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had soot all over his clothes and he was shaking'' but was
not injured, McPartlin said, adding that his brother had told him
that the explosion occurred in a boiler that had just been repaired
and only turned on again on Sunday night.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF you didn't know he had just completed a vigorous 2{-hour
workout, you might have thought Scottie Pippen was a leftover couch
potato in front of the big-screen TV, starting to put down roots
from Super Bowl Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He was sprawled out in the reclining chair at his locker, feet
propped up, head tilted back and arms clasped at his waist, only
the ice bags wrapped to his knees giving any indication of spent
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The door swung open, a loud noise entered the room, and there,
of course, was Charles Barkley casting a shadow above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirsty, Scottie?'' Barkley asked, holding a plastic bottle
filled with water. Then he proceeded to pour the water all over
Scottie's bare chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' said Pippen, never even flinching. ``I think I
actually needed that.'' And he put his head back again and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday night, when the Rockets open the abbreviated,
compressed NBA schedule against the Lakers at the Great Western
Forum, there will be little time for lounging around. But no matter
how wild the ride, one image of Pippen is not likely to change:
that of a contented man.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' he said, ``I didn't expect it to be
this easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not talking about wins or losses or X's and O's. Just
fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has officially been a Rocket for only 11 days now, yet in
some ways it seems like forever. He has slid into Clyde Drexler's
former locker spot at the end of one row at Westside Tennis Club
and has already become, like the carpets or a light fixture or the
paint on the walls, a regular part of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game is the kind that will allow me to blend in with a team
pretty easily,'' said Pippen. ``I play hard, and I try to get the
most out of my teammates. So I figured that eventually they would
come to accept me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this experience so far has been beyond my wildest
expectations. I feel so relaxed. So comfortable. So wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing that after 11 NBA seasons and six NBA
championships, a player with Pippen's credentials is so
appreciative of the little things. That is, until you consider he
never had them in Chicago, especially over the past three years,
when the Bulls' success had become so overwhelming that they were
more like larger-than-life rock 'n' roll or movie idols than just
another great basketball team. The Bulls had an entourage that
rivaled the pope's, which is probably to be expected considering
the number of people who worshipped Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of their success and notoriety, here is Pippen truly
enjoying his experience as being both one of the guys and a player
whom the Rockets are counting on heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference in the Rockets and any other place that I
might have considered was the level of their interest all along,''
Pippen said. ``They showed me how much they wanted me. I'm not just
talking about money. I'm talking about them reaching out to me and
letting me know they wanted me to be a part of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 11 years in Chicago, I'm not trying to take away from
the fun that I had out there on the court competing, winning
championships. That was always great. But let's face it: The
organization up there stinks. It was not the best of both worlds,
and away from the game, it just wasn't there for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I haven't even been here two weeks, and I can already
tell you that I have communicated more with (club owner) Les
Alexander than I did with (Bulls owner Jerry) Reinsdorf in 11
years. He (Reinsdorf) never came around. He didn't say hi. I never
had the feeling he cared about me. I think that atmosphere filters
down through the team eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen noted that the locker room at the Bulls' practice
facility was broken up into sections, concrete walls separating
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have four guys dressing here and four other guys
dressing there,'' he said. ``So it become little groups. Here, it's
wide-open, one room. I feel like we're all in this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon stops by the locker to deliver another gift
bottle of the oil they both wear as cologne. Barkley teases Pippen
and calls him ``The Franchise.'' To the rest of them, he is just
Scottie, as comfortable as an old pair of loafers or a favorite
sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen has been flattered by the Texas hospitality he has
received around town. He says his wife, Larsa, is smitten by our
city. They are house hunting and considering making Houston their
permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy that people here respect
my talent and have made us feel welcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen leaned back again in the chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a lot ahead of us once the season starts,'' he
said. ``But I'll tell you, this feels right.''

 NASA PLANS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  NASA chief Daniel S. Goldin outlined the Clinton
administration's imaginative $13.6 billion space budget proposal
for the fiscal year 2000 Monday, and it envisions ventures that
once filled only the heads of science fiction writers:
<P>
   More adventurous missions throughout the solar system are on the
list, and so are ``intelligent'' robotic spacecraft that would feel
emotions and think for themselves as they fly through space on
their own. Also on the list are commercial aircraft capable of
flying over Earth at seven times the speed of sound _ more than
5,000 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal, Goldin said, even includes $50
million to develop a propeller-driven unmanned plane that would fly
at low level above the sands of Mars and explore the deepest
Martian canyons in search of life-giving water frozen there
billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That flight's target date of 2003 would mark the 100th
anniversary of the Wright Brothers' first flight above Earth's
surface from Kitty Hawk, Goldin noted. A team at NASA's Ames
Research Center at Moffett Field in northern California is already
developing concepts for the Mars plane.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA budget includes $2.5 billion to continue building the
International Space Station toward its completion goal in 2004. In
a briefing for reporters, Goldin said his own agency is preparing a
``contingency system'' that could cost up to $500 million if
Russia's chaotic economy prevents the Russian Space Agency from
filling its commitments to build propulsion systems and crew-return
vehicles for the $50 billion station.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's budget proposal for NASA marks the
sixth consecutive year of decreases from its 1994 peak of more than
$14.5 billion. Last year's budget proposal totaled $13.67 billion _
$87 million more than the $13.58 billion request for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's space science missions would be financed with
nearly $2.2 billion in the NASA budget request. In NASA's ambitious
prose, it would include efforts to ``solve mysteries of the
universe, explore the solar system, discover planets around other
stars, search for life beyond Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the space science ventures are a half-dozen missions
to analyze the icy dust of comets that may be carrying the spores
of living organisms. There will be more missions to Jupiter, and
especially to its ice-encrusted moon Europa, where evidence
suggests a warm ocean may lie beneath the fractured surface.
</P>
<P>
   It's even possible, Goldin said, that one day NASA would send a
submarine to Europa to pick up samples of that ocean water in
another search for long-hidden extraterrestrial life.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the proposed budget is a series of ``micromissions'' to
Mars, with 100-pound payloads designed to collect high-priority
science data. The development of ``gossamer spacecraft'' is in the
budget, too _ ultralight craft made of thin films that could sail
through space under the thrust of the sub-nuclear particles in the
solar wind and that could serve as large antennaes or space weather
observatories.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also includes $140 million to send a crew of shuttle
astronauts up to service the Hubble Space Telescope and install a
new advanced camera on the telescope that has returned so many
spectacular images of giant stars and colliding galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   In Mountain View, Calif., Monday, the Ames Research Center's
``delighted'' director, Henry McDonald, said NASA's budget
proposals include an allocation of $625 million for Ames, with $150
million of that devoted to the new Astrobiology Institute, which
coordinates research at 11 universities and NASA centers into the
origin of life and its existence elsewhere in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Another $250 million would go for advances in information
technology _ where Ames has long developed leadership in applying
its supercomputers to the field. In that budget, $23 million is
earmarked for ``intelligent systems,'' McDonald said. Mounted
aboard spacecraft, such systems could sense dangers on their own or
home in on attractive targets rapidly, without guidance from
earthbound mission controllers. The controllers would no longer be
forced to make split-second decisions because of the lengthy travel
time for radio signals to make between home and distant planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those intelligent spacecraft,'' McDonald said, ``would be able
to think on their own and react on the fly.''

CLINTON OFFERS A BLACK-  INK FEDERAL BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Boasting of a bountiful new era of budget surpluses
and unparalleled prosperity, President Clinton presented a $1.77
trillion budget for 2000 Monday that he said will help rescue
Social Security and Medicare, offer middle-class tax breaks and
leave room for billions in new spending.
</P>
<P>
   With the documents bound in symbolic ``black ink'' covers,
Clinton declared that his budget would forge ``a progressive but
prudent path'' to the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The budget projects an astonishing $2.41 trillion surplus over
the next decade, with a $117 billion surplus in the coming fiscal
year alone _ estimates that are well in line with consensus
economic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue
moon,'' Clinton said in an elegant East Room ceremony at the White
House, replete with a string quartet. ``Fiscal discipline has
transformed the vicious cycle of budget deficits and high interest
rates into a virtuous cycle of budget surpluses and low interest
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget marked the opening shot in a battle with
Republicans over whether to use non-Social Security surplus
revenues to cut taxes or finance new programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not work so hard to get a balanced budget to see
government grow larger with the surplus and to spend it all,'' said
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, a New Mexico
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici's House counterpart, Ohio's John Kasich, called
Clinton's budget a ``lame duck'' and said Republicans will push an
across-the-board cut in income taxes of at least 10 percent and as
high as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House and Republicans both celebrated a turnaround
in the nation's finances that was unthinkable as few as two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used a litany of statistics to describe an unparalleled
economic boom, taking credit for reversing federal finances from a
$290 billion deficit in 1992 to surpluses that are expected to
accumulate over the next 15 years to a breathtaking $4.4 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The federal budget, he said, ``is on course for surpluses over
the next quarter century.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the surpluses projected for the next two years come
entirely from Social Security payroll taxes. The rest of the
government will continue to run deficits until 2001, when it will
post a small $200 million surplus. For the next five years, the
administration projects only a $22 billion non-Social Security
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton and administration officials frequently
referred Monday to Clinton's plan for a projected $4.4 trillion in
surpluses over the next 15 years, that plan was not part of
Monday's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed _ and Republicans have agreed _ to keep
$2.7 trillion of those projected surpluses that come from Social
Security payroll taxes in a ``lockbox'' rather than spending them
for other government operations, as is now the case. That would
essentially help pay down the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the federal debt, economists widely agree, will make it
easier to finance the huge deficits Social Security will begin
piling up when, in just over a decade, the 76 million-member Baby
Boom generation stops paying taxes into the program and begins
collecting benefits, sharply reversing the program's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Republicans agreed with Clinton to set aside the
$2.7 trillion in future Social Security revenues for Social
Security, proposing a ``Social Security Surplus Protection Act.''
But Republicans want to use the rest of the 15-year projected
surplus _ about $1.7 trillion _ for across-the-board tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed using that money for other programs,
including Medicare, new ``Universal Savings Accounts'' for
individuals, and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   For the current year, the administration proposes to finance new
spending and targeted tax credits by closing ``corporate tax
loopholes,'' raising cigarette taxes by 55 cents a pack and other
revenue-raising measures totaling about $46 billion. The Clinton
budget calls for no across-the-board tax cuts next year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed several selective tax credits Monday, including
credits for providers of long-term health care and stay-at-home
mothers of young children. The credits, deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers said Monday, are ``targeted at moments in
people's lives when they have the greatest need.''
</P>
<P>
   He also proposed dozens of new spending initiatives or spending
increases, many of them foreshadowed in his State of the Union
address a week ago. Officials said that all of the new programs are
``fully paid for'' by offsetting tax increases or spending cuts and
do not breach the spending caps laid down in the 1997
balanced-budget pact.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for higher military spending, including
higher military pay and a new strategic missile defense program;
new land purchases for parks and open space; more money for farm
programs; money to provide Medicare coverage for people over age
55; new school construction and other education programs; tax
credits for investments in poor communities, and various
environmental programs, including $2 billion for research on global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Some items will find strong Republican support, especially the
spending increases for defense and education. Domenici predicted a
``sea change'' in federal funding for education but insisted that
Republicans would send the money directly to school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Monday the administration
might also find common ground with Congress in reducing the
alternative minimum tax, which is now affecting more ordinary
taxpayers as well as corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Other proposals will find stiff GOP resistance. ``In all my
years in Congress, I've never seen such a kitchen-sink approach to
government,'' said House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said Republicans are united behind using future
non-Social Security surpluses for tax cuts. ``That is money that
the taxpayers of the United States sent to us that we don't now
need,'' Domenici said. ``We are going to give that back to the
American taxpayers who paid it in. They deserve it. It shouldn't be
sitting around up here to be spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whichever side prevails, however, future non-Social Security
surpluses have not yet materialized, and even if they do, they will
probably not begin accumulating in substantial amounts for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term budget projections are notoriously inaccurate. Outside
of Social Security's relatively clear demographic changes, budget
forecasts often amount to little more than informed speculation
about how the economy will perform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the budget forecasters projected a $579 billion deficit
for 2002; the administration now expects a $187 billion surplus
that year. As the administration itself noted, that is a $766
billion error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Estimates are estimates,'' said White House Budget Director
Jack Lew.
</P>
<P>
   The current surpluses are driven by the booming economy, which
is generating enormous increases in tax revenues. Tax revenues are
rising by 7 percent to 8 percent annually, while federal spending
is growing by about 4 percent a year. If that ratio is maintained,
the divergence between tax and spending growth paths will continue
to widen, yielding ever-increasing surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The surplus also reinforces itself by reducing the federal debt
and the government's enormous interest costs _ what Clinton
referred to as a ``virtuous cycle.'' Just a few years ago, interest
costs on the federal debt were nearly as large as the defense
budget and were themselves a major source of deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors are driving the economic boom, including low
inflation, which keeps interest rates low, the renewed
competitiveness of U.S. industry, which went through a painful
shakeout in the 1980s, and enormous strides in productivity driven
by technological change.
</P>
<P>
   But a recession, or changes in the ratio between government
taxes and spending, could throw the surplus projections way off and
dash the bright promises of politicians from both parties.

LAVIN RUES LOSING COOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It doesn't matter if referee Terry Christman's
judgment was impaired on the play that cut short Baron Davis'
Sunday afternoon in Seattle. Or that Christman has been the Grim
Reaper of UCLA basketball, officiating all three of the Bruins'
Pacific-10 losses.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lavin could see things oh-so-clearly on Monday, even if
his head was horribly congested and the rest of him wasn't feeling
so hot, either. Aside from the aches and discomfort associated with
the stomach virus he caught while in the Pacific Northwest, the
main thing Lavin felt was shame.
</P>
<P>
   He came down with that particular symptom shortly after drawing
a double technical foul late in the Bruins' 93-83 loss to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were trailing by seven when Christman slapped Davis
with his fifth foul for grazing Deon Luton's leg as Luton was
driving to the basket. A livid Lavin metamorphosed into a pit bull
right in front of Christman's eyes and barked ferociously enough to
get tossed from the game even as he was being collared by one of
his freshmen and one of his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed in my conduct,'' Lavin said. ``I was
a poor example, a poor model for my players, and that's what
disturbs me the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavin, who's in his third year of his first head-coaching job,
has tried to live by the maxims espoused by one of his trusted
advisers, ex-UCLA coach John Wooden. But he readily admits he made
a mockery of at least two of Wooden's truisms with his temper
tantrum:
</P>
<P>
   Discipline yourself and others won't need to;
</P>
<P>
   What is right is more important than who's right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I told the team (after the game) is that I
feel responsible for being a poor example,'' Lavin said. ``The most
powerful tool in teaching is showing by example and I failed them
by not keeping my composure.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been getting hotter and hotter under the collar since a
couple of Saturdays ago when Christman called a disproportionate
number of fouls against the Bruins in their home loss to Stanford.
The same pattern emerged in subsequent Bruins games that Christman
called, against Oregon State and USC.
</P>
<P>
   When Davis picked up his fifth foul on Sunday, Lavin's blood
boiled. It's easy for him to say now that he should have had the
good sense to change his tune (or at least his tone) the moment he
saw Davis disgustedly throw his mouthpiece on the court in response
to Christman's initial call with 4:34 left and the Bruins trailing
Washington 77-70.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the game, alongside Davis' mouthpiece lay the perfect
opportunity for Lavin to hammer home a life lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Every coach should seize these moments. That's why, if Lavin had
it all to do again, he would have taken great pains to point out to
his players that a bad call is a metaphor for the real world. You
know, where lazy people get promotions and longtime employees are
laid off and a motorist driving 55 in a 45 mph zone is stopped and
ticketed while people going 65 zoom blithely by.
</P>
<P>
   You don't spit out your gum at the officer writing your ticket,
nor do you go ballistic. Not if you know what's good for you. Same
thing with sports.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of blowing his fuse, Lavin wishes he had reminded his
players of the three R's: responsibility, restraint and resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than showing the volatility of Sprewell, Lavin would
liked to have had the patience and wisdom of Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   When Lavin, 34, stepped out of the coaching box and into the
fray, he was reminded anew that it isn't just his players who have
a lot of growing up to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to be more like Melba toast and less emotional,'' he
said. ``I'm learning that the hard way. Part of growing up is
falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   The thing Lavin really regrets about his outburst is that up
until that point, the game had belonged to the players. There were
some excellent individual efforts. How sad, then, it was for Lavin
to turn on a national sports highlight show Sunday night and see
not a single film clip of any of Davis' nine baskets or one of Todd
MacCullough's 21 rebounds but be treated to all of the temper
tantrums that got him tossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I proud of it? No. Am I glad I did it? No,'' Lavin said.
``In hindsight, it's kind of embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   By completely losing his cool, Lavin feared he might have
telegraphed a disturbing message or two to his players. Would they
start believing his laws _ which include ``play through the
officials' calls'' _ are as malleable as clay, to be molded to fit
the situation at hand?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because our team's so young,'' Lavin said, ``that's why
there's even more of a responsibility on me to be in line with the
things I ask our players to do so I'm not being hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Lavin wants is for Dan Gadzuric to grow tired of
being elbowed in the small of his back and think it's OK to level
someone with a forearm shiver. Or for Davis to think he can spit
out his mouthpiece any time he sees a grave miscarriage of justice
on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, for that matter, does Lavin want anyone to think he
condones a Pauley Pavilion crowd taking a stand on the officiating
by throwing empty Tic-Tac containers and cups on the court with a
few ticks remaining on the game clock.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there's one more Wooden maxim that everyone in Westwood
should commit to memory, just because:
</P>
<P>
   Never be disagreeable just because you disagree.

SELIG EAGER TO SHOWCASE NEW MARINER BALLPARK IN 2001 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When baseball awarded the 1999 All-Star Game to the
Boston Red Sox last summer, general manager Dan Duquette said he
looked forward to seeing Pedro Martinez and Nomar Garciaparra take
part. He did not mention Mo Vaughn, a Boston star who was not under
contract for the year the game would be played.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was joyous for the Mariners, who formally were given the
All-Star Game for 2001. Dignitaries flew in for the announcement,
and from the conference room in Columbia Tower, commissioner Bud
Selig and others could gaze warmly at Safeco Field, 76 stories
below.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to make this the best All-Star Game ever,'' said
John Ellis, Mariners chairman and CEO. ``And I can guarantee you
that Safeco Field will be the greatest baseball park in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' new home was the star Monday, the reason Seattle
got the game and the $60 million-plus Selig expects will be
generated from it. But, like the Red Sox and Vaughn, the M's do not
have their marquee players under contract for the year they take
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke brought up the topic of Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to seeing two players in that All-Star Game,''
Locke said, ``two players who will be very, very familiar with that
field: Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez.''
</P>
<P>
   Quipped Ellis, who followed Locke to the podium, ``He's not an
agent, in case you were wondering.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and Rodriguez will surely be at Safeco Field on July 10,
2001, the probable game date. What uniforms they wear will be
determined later.
</P>
<P>
   Selig can relate to the predicament. As owner of the Milwaukee
Brewers, he always wanted to keep franchise players Robin Yount and
Paul Molitor. He lost Molitor to the deep-pocketed Toronto Blue
Jays one winter and remembered being crushed, not sleeping all
night after it happened.
</P>
<P>
   But Yount never left, and when he enters the Hall of Fame this
summer, he'll have only one team on his plaque.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted desperately to (see) Yount of the Brewers going into
the Hall of Fame,'' Selig said. ``Well, as the commissioner of
baseball, I want it to be Griffey of the Seattle Mariners and Alex
Rodriguez of the Mariners going into the Hall of Fame, and it's my
job to work on it and see that that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, it will be at least partly due to revenue
generated from Safeco Field, the $498 million, retractable-roof
park opening July 15. Public funds make up $372 million of the
cost, and Ellis and mayor Paul Schell pointed to the All-Star Game
as a reason the park was a wise investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need these efforts to bring us together as a community,''
Schell said. ``Clearly, it's going to result in the first major
return on investment the taxpayers made by constructing Safeco
Field.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig was sufficiently impressed while touring the park with
American League president Gene Budig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people, before they get in the new ballpark,
understand how good these things really are,'' Selig said from a
spot in the stands behind home plate. ``I mean, they are really
good. This thing is marvelous. Just look how close (fans) are to
the players. And it's beautiful _ it's beautiful on the outside and
it's gorgeous on the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a vision Selig could hardly have imagined when he helped
lure the Seattle Pilots to Milwaukee in 1970. Baseball in Seattle
would struggle for decades, and current Mariner owners have lost
money every year since buying the team in 1992, including a $2
million loss last year that would have exceeded $11 million without
expansion payments.
</P>
<P>
   But with Safeco Field rising and fan interest strong, baseball
readily awarded the All-Star Game to Seattle. It recently pulled
one from Florida, where the Marlins decimated their World Series
championship team and fans have stayed away from mammoth Pro Player
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to celebrate new ballparks,'' Selig said, ``and
this is just a marvelous opportunity for baseball to showcase an
absolutely magnificent new ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent All-Star Games have been profitable for host cities. Last
year's game brought more than $40 million to Denver, Philadelphia
generated $55.8 million in 1996 and Boston's game is expected to
bring in $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Locke called the All-Star Game great for the region's economy,
adding that ``hundreds of millions of people will be focusing on
that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the game, the event features an interactive ``Fan Fest''
and a workout day including the popular home run derby.
</P>
<P>
   M'S IN JAPAN: Selig said that if there are regular-season games
played in Japan, the Mariners will be a participant.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it does happen, it will involve the Seattle Mariners and
they will play there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said the games could take place in 2000, but so far
nothing has been scheduled or confirmed.

ELWAY FACING NO SHORTAGE OF SUPPORT FOR ONE MORE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Even NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue is trying to find a
way to entice John Elway into returning for a 17th season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a group on our staff together (Sunday) night to figure
out what we could come up with to give John the incentive to play
another season,'' Tagliabue said Monday, just before presenting
Elway the MVP trophy he won Sunday for sparking the Denver Broncos'
34-19 victory over the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best they could come up with,'' he said, speaking to
Elway, ``was the idea that you have a chance to be the first player
in NFL history to be the Super Bowl MVP in different centuries. But
we decided not to offer that to you because it might emphasize your
age.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway laughed, along with offering one of those full-toothed
grins that have become his trademark as much as his laser passes or
his pigeon-toed scrambles.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Broncos left no question that they are the best
team in football by winning a second straight Super Bowl, the big
question remains: Will he or won't he retire?
</P>
<P>
   Elway will be 39 in June. He just completed his 16th NFL season
by doing something even he had never accomplished _ playing well in
a Super Bowl. Really well. So well that it might be tempting to
give it one more shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things that I'm going to have to sit down and
think about,'' Elway said. ``Right now, I'm cherishing the moment,
cherishing the win and everything that's happened to us this year.
Once the dust settles and I get a chance to settle down a little
bit, I'll weigh those. It would be great to come back and
three-peat. But also, it would be nice to walk away at the level
I'm playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His long night's journey to this early morning news conference
had left Elway with a gravelly voice that made him sound a little
like Jack Nicholson. And he wasn't done. The Broncos flew back to
Denver Monday for a downtown parade, and Elway will then leave for
Hawaii, where he is the AFC starter in Sunday's Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' he said. ``I still feel like it's 9 p.m.
(Sunday) night. I feel good. I haven't had a chance to lay down and
change days yet. It's still Sunday to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway has been Sunday's child for almost his entire adult life.
Before that, it was Saturdays while playing at Stanford. Before
that, it was Friday nights at Granada Hills (Calif.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows Elway, or has ever seen him play, knows he is
not the retiring type. But he knows this can't go on forever, no
matter how easy he can make it look. Elway thought long and hard
about retiring last year after the Broncos won their first Super
Bowl. This year, he hinted that he would walk away if the Broncos
won a second straight title.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Elway continues to talk about how enticing it would
be to become the first quarterback to win three straight Super
Bowls. Some of his actions, however, have spoken louder than his
words.
</P>
<P>
   Before the AFC championship game, Elway used his private jet to
fly his sisters and their families from San Jose, Calif., to Denver
for the game. That was unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, and after being coaxed by coach Mike Shanahan,
Elway took an uncharacteristic victory lap around Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Each day last week, Elway was asked if the Super Bowl would be
his last game. He said all the right things, not wanting talk of
his future to be a distraction for his team. But those closest to
him said they expected No. 7 to hang it up after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Elway reiterated Monday that he is in no hurry to make a
decision. When pressed, he offered April as a deadline. He said
that before making a choice he will talk to his wife, Janet, and
their four children; his mother and father; Shanahan; and Broncos
owner Pat Bowlen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what it will come down to is what's right here,'' he said,
pointing to his heart.
</P>
<P>
   And really, what's left? Being named Super Bowl MVP was about
the only accomplishment missing from Elway's formidable resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really never thought that I would be standing up here the
morning after a Super Bowl as the MVP,'' Elway said. ``After you
lose three in a row, you're just hoping you win. So after that,
this is all a bonus, and that's why it's a great thrill for me to
be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue joked last week that this was the first Super Bowl
hosted by an auto dealer (Dolphins owner Wayne Huizenga) for an
auto dealer (Elway). Actually, these two are in business together.
Last year, Huizenga purchased the 17 dealerships Elway owns in the
Denver area for $82.5 million, but Elway remains involved in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Elway got to choose between a black Ford Mustang and a
white Eddie Bauer edition Ford Expedition as the bigger bauble for
being named Super Bowl MVP. It was like honoring Bill Gates with a
laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that a car was incentive to win,'' Tagliabue
said. ``Now, it's clear that not even a dealership is incentive to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Elway selected the Expedition, and then shed some light on what
he might do when he finally does retire from football.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out at the room filled with reporters, he offered, ``Let
me know if you guys need a car.''

ROBINSON LEARNS PERIL OF LORDING IT OVER OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Last time I saw Eugene Robinson was in Atlanta's
victorious locker room in Minneapolis, where his Falcons beat the
heavily favored Vikings in one of the larger upsets in NFC
championship history.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperactively jabbering and gesticulating, Robinson moved among
his teammates distributing hugs and fist-bumps along with his
preferred brand of old-time religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord has favored us. The Lord has favored us,'' he said,
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   In light of subsequent events, presumably the Lord no longer
favors the Falcons, and especially Robinson. The Falcons lost the
Super Bowl, and Robinson lost integrity and credibility with his
game's-eve arrest on solicitation charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dunno why God quit on the Falcons, although the second-quarter
decision to pass up an easy field goal for a fourth-down toss sweep
that lost yardage is as good a reason as any. If God pays as much
attention to football, as Robinson, Randall Cunningham, Reggie
White and other grid proselytizers claim, God had to be thinking,
``Dan Reeves, I gave you an extra chance at life for this kind of
call?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem with linking God with athletes and results of
sports events. To listen to many of the jocks, God is a
bandwagon-jumper, always sticking with winners and abandoning
losers.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that is the impression I get after a couple of decades
of listening to locker-room invocations of deities as the source of
a game's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   I am not enough of a theologian to know whether it's true. What
I can say with certainty is the claim that God has chosen one side
in a competitive sports context carries the implication that He is
not on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me that savvy as Robinson is about analyzing
opponent offenses, I don't think he has access to the rosters of
God and Satan.
</P>
<P>
   If an athlete wants to publicly credit God with his salvation,
OK. So, too, for an athlete who prays for his good health and that
of others.
</P>
<P>
   But once there is an implication in a sports context that God's
jersey colors are your own, watch out. That's why Robinson is in a
much deeper mess than the misdemeanor charges he faces in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 11-year Seahawk career, and then on to Green Bay
and Atlanta, Robinson has trumpeted his faith as vital to his
unexpected success. Which is all right, except that Robinson
couldn't quite stop there, frequently making remarks such as those
in Minneapolis that indicate he and his side's victory was the
result of unearthly blessings.
</P>
<P>
   The problem comes when the blessed team loses, or the blessed
athlete falters. If the win is aided by God, a loss must also be so
attributed. Robinson might be discreet enough not to blame God
publicly, but he has left his audience with no other conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Same with his Saturday night trip into the Super Bowl's long
history of dubious achievements.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have much insight as to what in Robinson's makeup allows
him to sneak off from his family and teammates on the eve of
participating in the nation's biggest annual sports event for cheap
sex with a hooker.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson might indeed be legally innocent, as he proclaims. As a
big fan of civil liberties as well as a reader of many stories of
police corruption in Miami, I'm willing to give him some benefit of
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no disputing that he was arrested and handcuffed
hanging out in a dangerous part of town, and that he had to be
fetched from the cops by a club official.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there doubt he plunged his teammates and coaches into
turmoil that resulted in no sleep for him and numerous others, not
to mention the grief he caused his family. And this was from a
player acquired less for his football skills and more for his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Few among the hundreds of millions of observers will say that
Robinson had anything better than a terrible game. He and most of
the Falcons played and coached as if they had been up all night.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not possible to conclude that Robinson's foolishness
caused the defeat, it is equally silly to say that he did not
distract many who were counting on him.
</P>
<P>
   He exposed himself to the predictable charges of being a
Christian hypocrite, and the equally predictable retort that since
all Christians are sinners, God will forgive, and so should the
rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Whether God or anyone forgives him is a matter of faith and
individual conscience. What will remain bothersome is Robinson's
eager use of his jock forum as spontaneous public church, which
unnecessarily burdens him, his faith, family and teammates with an
unbearable standard.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility, enhanced that very morning with a national
award based on his citizenship, goes the way of Jimmy Swaggart, Jim
Bakker and other misguided, high-profile preachers who took a
faith, and the faith of others, to a place of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Many sportswriters, upon hearing God was allegedly at work in a
game, quit taking notes. Besides not being good copy, my
apprehension is that the athlete, far clumsier with language than
spin moves, often will live to regret the words.
</P>
<P>
   Then I'll be stuck writing the forgiveness story, all the time
knowing it's a cop-out for a guy too gutless to accept his free
will as the responsible party for the misdeed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Robinson will be smarter than that. But I already thought
he was smarter than he was.

FIRST LOSS PAINFUL FOR HUSKIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ After 10 weeks at No. 1, Connecticut probably
will fall from the top. But the Huskies after bigger concerns than
rankings and losses.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, playing without two starters, was no match for No.
16 Syracuse last night. The Orangemen (16-6, 7-5 in the Big East
Conference) used a 25-6 second-half blitz to record a 59-42 victory
against the previously undefeated Huskies (19-1, 11-1).
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hamilton, Connecticut's leading scorer, sat out with a
bruised right thigh and is listed as day-to-day. Center Jake
Voskuhl, the team's leading rebounder and shot blocker, is out
indefinitely with a stress fracture on the top of his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt sorry for ourselves, and I'm not happy about that,''
said Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, whose team shot 31 percent
(16-of-45) from the field. ``We didn't have anyone play well. This
is the hand we've been dealt and we've got to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies had trailed at halftime of their past four
victories. But they appeared to exhaust their energy in holding
Syracuse to a 25-all halftime score. Connecticut finished with more
turnovers (18) than field goals (16). It was the Huskies' lowest
point total since February 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse forward Damone Brown, who made six of his seven
second-half attempts, had 12 points during the Orangemen's decisive
spurt. Connecticut took its only lead at 18:26 when Edmund
Saunders' basket made it 27-25 before Syracuse launched its
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damone made some shots to break the game open,'' said Syracuse
coach Jim Boeheim, whose team made 32 percent of its shots in the
first half and 53 percent in the second. ``In the first half, we
just couldn't get anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, which had been No. 1 for 10 weeks, plays at No. 4
Stanford Saturday. Duke, ranked No. 2, will try to move into the
top spot when it plays host to No. 7 Maryland tomorrow night.

STARS CRY FOUL IN TIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For at least one night, the Stars were of the opinion
that maybe the NHL should go to a three-referee system.
</P>
<P>
   The league's experimental two-referee system (instead of the
normal one referee) was in effect last night, and the Stars believe
they were cheated in a 2-2 tie with the Calgary Flames when the
Stars said both senior referee Rob Shick and junior referee Bernard
DeGrace missed critical calls that allowed the Flames to score one
goal in regulation and not have to face a penalty shot in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, we got \Rrobbed\S in the end,'' said
Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk, who was involved in both plays.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk was fighting for control of a puck in the defensive
zone when Flames winger Theoren Fleury tripped him, causing
Nieuwendyk to lose control and opening up a wide open lane to the
net for Flames defenseman Derek Morris. Morris blasted a shot from
20 feet off of goalie Ed Belfour's shoulder and into the net as the
Flames tied the game at 2-2 with 1:42 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk then came up with a loose puck in the dying seconds
of overtime and skated in alone on Flames goaltender Fred
Brathwaite with an uncontested chance to scored the game-winner.
However, Flames defenseman Steve Smith flew in from behind and hit
Nieuwendyk's right hand with a two-handed baseball slash, and
Nieuwendyk never got off a shot. Shick called slashing on Smith,
but would not give the Stars a penalty-shot chance for the overtime
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never the first guy to yell at the referees, but you're
pretty frustrated when you get a penalty at one end that ties the
game and a missed call that should have been a penalty shot,''
Nieuwendyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 91(b) states that: ``When a player in control of the puck
on the opponent's side of the center red line and having no other
opponent to pass than the goalkeeper, is tripped or otherwise
fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring
opportunity, a penalty shot shall be awarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk said he was told he ``wasn't in the clear,'' by the
referees, but said he felt Smith severely affected his chance to
get off a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do a move that I like to do, which is backhand,
forehand and then flip it,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``But he slashed me
at the right time right on top of the hand and kind of threw me
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he too believed the officials
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear breakaway,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm sure the
referees had one way of looking at it, and we had another.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock added that the Stars never should have let the
Flames stay that close. The Stars were dominant in the first two
periods and took a 2-0 lead into the the final seven minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk rammed home the first goal of the game on a
first-period power play as he fished off the rebound of a Shawn
Chambers shot at the right lip of the crease and scored into a
virtually empty net. It was Nieuwendyk's 11th goal of the season
and his fourth point in four games since returning from a five-game
absence caused by tendinitis in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   Jere Lehtinen then pushed the score to 2-0 at 2:56 of the second
period when he banged in the rebound of a Brett Hull shot. Hull had
been set up by Mike Modano and both he and Modano saw their
season-best point-scoring streaks continue. Modano now has at least
one point in nine consecutive games, while Hull has at least one
point in eight consecutive.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also received strong play from Ed Belfour, gritty
forechecking by their old man line of Guy Carbonneau, Dave Reid and
Brian Skrudland and a solid performance from their six defensemen.
In fact, they basically had the game wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played very well,'' Hitchcock said. ``This one felt like a
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hitchcock said the Stars did have some deficiencies. They
failed to make Flames journeyman goaltender Fred Brathwaite break
and couldn't extend the 2-0 lead despite 33 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   They also lost six faceoffs in the defensive end in the third
period and overtime, with two of the losses contributing to the two
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Fleury won a draw straight back to Cale Hulse, who broke up
Belfour's shutout with 6:28 remaining in the game. The Stars
haven't shut out the Flames since March 3, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames, who are desperately seeking a playoff spot, then
smelled a chance to get even. Fleury took it, as he upended
Nieuwendyk and left a wide open path to the net for Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the puck and my feet just went right out from under
me,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``And he was left alone in the slot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move to 30-9-8 and are unbeaten in their past four
games (3-0-1). The Flames move to 16-27-6 and are 2-1-3 in their
past six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars now have five days off before they return to play
against the Colorado Avalanche on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing is we've got five days to think about this
loss,'' center Brian Skrudland said.

CHIMP'S BIRTH A REAL WHODUNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo made
monkeys out of their handlers _ again.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chimps gave birth over the weekend, without the
zookeepers even being aware she was pregnant. What's more
incredible: All the male chimps of siring age have been given
vasectomies, while the others are either too old or too young to
reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight months that Yoshiko was pregnant, only once did her
handler even suspect her condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at her a couple of weeks ago and said, Hmmm, she's
looking kind of heavy,'' said Vicki Bingaman, head chimpanzee
keeper. ``Then I said, Naahh, she can't be, and put it out of my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiny Toshi, a female, was discovered about 7:40 a.m. Sunday by
animal keeper Mark Atha.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful. She's as cute as she can be,'' said Bingaman.
``Yoshi cradles her and loves her. Most of the morning, it was
grandmother and mother and baby. They stayed together and groomed
and hugged.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the lucky father? Another case of monkeyshine by the
chimps.
</P>
<P>
   Befuddled last summer when the chimpanzees escaped from a newly
built exhibit, which has required tighter security to keep them
inside the Mahale Mountains, now the handlers are trying to figure
out how 8-year-old Yoshi became pregnant with her first.
</P>
<P>
   They suspect that 8-year-old Jerrard was sitting in a tree
k-i-s-s-i-n-g with Yoshiko, and there was other monkeying around.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a feisty little devil. He's just full of himself,'' said
Bingaman, who described him as one of the more handsome and
dominant of the zoo's chimps. ``He's a pistol.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests can determine the paternity of the baby, but because
mother chimpanzees tend to be very protective of their young,
Bingaman doesn't expect to be able to conduct the blood tests until
the baby is older.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, the zoo will try to use hair samples for the DNA
testing and will be checking all the vasectomized males to see
which one is Toshi's father.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the zoo's six males aren't vasectomized, but they
include 4-year-old Glenn and Ripley, 2, both of whom are too young
to reproduce, said Bingaman, who estimates that males are mature
enough to reproduce at about age 5.
</P>
<P>
   The third chimp, Toto, is a 44-year-old male who has never
produced offspring, and nobody suspected he ``had it in him,'' said
zoo spokeswoman Judy Shay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never shown any interest,'' said Shay. ``They're
assuming he's not the father _ but you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The zoo began controlling its chimpanzee births at the request
of the American Zoo and Aquarium Association. The association
oversees a nationwide species survival plan, created to control the
genetic population of animals in captivity so that certain breeds
are not overrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the zoo put the female chimps on birth control pills
and then hormonal implants, which resulted in two births. When the
chimp keepers tried the Norplant implant, Ripley was born. Finally,
the zoo resorted to vasectomies for the males shortly after
Ripley's birth two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the possibility that Yoshi might be pregnant did pass
through Bingaman's mind when she noticed the mother chimp had
gained weight recently, she explained that just as some women gain
very little weight during pregnancies, chimps can likewise hide
their pregnancies. The gestation period for chimps typically lasts
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The baby chimp, with her tiny pink feet, is healthy and spent
Monday cuddling with her mother under the gaze of zoo visitors.
Yoshiko's mother, Regina, at age 7 became the youngest female chimp
to give birth at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Toshi was named by Los Angeles resident Jeanette Vachon, a
longtime zoo supporter who contributed $25,000 on Monday through
the zoo's ``adoption'' program and will have a plaque in her name
placed at the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Ripley was named after Ripley's Believe It or Not show because
his conception when all the female chimps had the Norplant birth
control implants was such a surprise, said Shay.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's birth, 11 of the zoo's 14 chimps have been born at
the zoo. The rest were either brought from other zoos or caught in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a history with this group (of chimps),'' said
Bingaman. ``Other zoos in the United States cannot get their groups
to reproduce. Our group, they're wonderful socially. It's just the
way it should be.''

LAVIN FACES REPRIMAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pacific-10 Conference is expected to reprimand
UCLA coach Steve Lavin and perhaps sophomore guard Baron Davis
today for their conduct during Sunday's loss at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The conference reviewed the situation Monday but withheld action
because it did not speak to Lavin, who was out sick, several
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Reprimands can be public or private.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin was assessed two technical fouls and ejected after he
charged the court with 4:34 remaining. He screamed at referee Terry
Christman, pointed his finger and had to be restrained by assistant
coach Jim Saia and forward Jerome Moiso.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lavin noted a strange pattern of officiating in the
games Christman has worked, but he carefully avoided specifics and
did not mention Christman by name. Public criticism of officials is
a violation of league rules.
</P>
<P>
   In four games Christman has officiated (Oregon State, Stanford,
USC and Washington), UCLA's opponents have shot at least 40 free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Christman also slapped Davis with a technical foul _ for the
third time this season _ after he threw his mouthpiece in
fifth-foul frustration. Later, Davis mentioned Christman by name
and said he felt UCLA had been ``cheated.'' For that, he might also
receive a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching reprimands are rare, player reprimands even rarer.
</P>
<P>
   __ The fallout: Will Christman officiate future UCLA games?
Booker Turner, the Pac-10's coordinator of officials, schedules his
refs months in advance. If the conference determines UCLA's
complaint is justified, however, Christman could be pulled off
future games.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the Bruins are clearly in a no-win situation.
Because of Lavin's outburst, officials probably will be quicker to
react to his complaints and sideline gyrations. The sparkling
reputation Lavin had with officials in his closed-mouth rookie
season has vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Refs stick together, too.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lost in the controversy: UCLA sophomore guard Earl Watson
played one of the best games of his career, with 24 points on
10-of-19 shooting. He also played his usual suffocating defense,
holding Huskies guard Donald Watts to 3-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington center Todd MacCulloc grabbed 21 rebounds. UCLA's big
men, Dan Gadzuric and Moiso, combined for 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In his past four games, Gadzuric has made 25 of 33 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Matt Barnes started Sunday for the first time
in two months and grabbed four rebounds in 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore guard Ryan Bailey served a one-game suspension for
violating team rules, but he has been reinstated and is expected to
play Thursday against Oregon.

TERROR FILM PRODUCER FACES OWN HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Daniel H. Blatt, a producer whose films include
``The Howling,'' said he experienced real-life terror when two
robbers stormed his home over the weekend and beat him while
searching for valuables.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brutalized me,'' the 61-year-old TV and movie producer
said Monday during an interview at his home. ``I was seriously
worried. They kept sticking a gun in my ear.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal began about 1 a.m. Sunday, when two robbers broke
into his Sherman Oaks home, roused him from sleep, and blindfolded
and bound him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rolled me over, smacked me twice with a gun,'' Blatt
said. He required six stitches above his right eye, and both eyes
remained swollen and red Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives described the robbers as two African-American men
with a handgun. No suspects have been identified, said Detective
Ralph Huerta.
</P>
<P>
   For 90 minutes, the men rummaged through his belongings in the
three-bedroom home in suburban Sherman Oaks where he has lived for
eight years, Blatt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was bleeding but conscious,'' said Blatt, who has produced
more than 40 films and television movies including ``The Boost,''
``Cujo,'' ``Kissinger and Nixon'' and ``V.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men emptied drawers and got away with TV sets, VCRs,
luggage, cash and jewelry, including Rolex watches, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the men threw the blindfolded Blatt into his
closet.
</P>
<P>
   After the men left, Blatt freed himself and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt warned his neighbors to abandon any false sense of
security in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lock your door and get an alarm system and use it,'' Blatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt's neighbors belong to a Neighborhood Watch program and
were surprised that the robbers chose his home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why that home?'' asked one neighbor, who requested not to be
identified out of fear for her safety. ``I'm just really sad for
him. It shouldn't happen to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents said they plan to tighten security at their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrifying. It's very frightening,'' said a neighbor,
Ernie Colton. ``This will hopefully spur another Neighborhood Watch
meeting that we haven't had in years. It's very upsetting for me,
but it's a reflection of what's going on in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatt's recent focus has been on TV movies, said Rick Rosen,
Blatt's agent and friend from the Endeavor talent agency.
</P>
<P>
   Blatt is working on a movie about Edward R. Murrow, the famed
CBS-TV journalist, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was targeted. I'm just very concerned about
his well-being,'' Rosen said. ``I'm just trying to come to grips
with this. It's a horrible, horrible thing. It's a random act of
violence.''

   LOS ANGELES _ The people voted and they picked NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1.3 million ballots were cast and the results were
broadcast during Monday night's first TV Guide Awards, which
originated from 20th Century Fox Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Although five of the six broadcast networks, plus PBS, were
represented among the winners, NBC took six of the 16 awards
presented.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the shows on NBC's Thursday night lineup, which has
suffered in both ratings and creatively this season, were winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' won Favorite Comedy, ``ER'' won Favorite Drama and
Christina Applegate, the star of ``Jesse,'' won Favorite Star Of A
New Series.
</P>
<P>
   The award show doubled as an infomercial for TV Guide. In
between presentations there were promotional pieces for the
magazine. There was one segment that looked at the mention of TV
Guide on prime time series, a twist on the ``Cheers &AMP; Jeers''
feature, the TV Guide Quiz and a couple steady streams of the
magazine's cover photos.
</P>
<P>
   The show aired on the Fox Network, which is owned by Rupert
Murdoch, who also owns TV Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy theory was not lost on David Duchovny, star of
``The X-Files,'' who was named Favorite Actor In A Drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you, like me, thinking Rupert Murdoch owns TV Guide;
Rupert Murdoch owns Fox; Rupert Murdoch owns 20th Century Fox; 20th
Century Fox owns `The X-Files'; David Duchovny is on ... I wonder
who's gonna win?''
</P>
<P>
   The 20th Century Fox Studio had two winners besides Duchovny.
Jenna Elfman of ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' was Favorite Actress In A Comedy
and ``Martial Law'' won Favorite New Series.
</P>
<P>
   Elfman won the first-ever TV Guide Award presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel too young to make history,'' Elfman said, ``but I guess
it's a history-making award, which is pretty cool. I've never been
first, not even in line, because I'm so tall.''
</P>
<P>
   The synergy stopped with the award presentations. The only other
victory for Fox was football studio analyst Terry Bradshaw, who won
Favorite Sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's other winners were Favorite Late Night Talk Show (``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno''), Favorite News Program (``Dateline'')
and Favorite Soap Opera (``Days of Our Lives'').
</P>
<P>
   One by one, winners came backstage and said that the fact that
the awards were voted on by viewers (TV Guide readers) made it
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very gratifying to be on a show that is
constantly in the top 10 (of the Nielsen ratings),'' said Roma
Downey of CBS' ``Touched By An Angel,'' who was named Favorite
Actress In A Drama despite admitting to voting for co-star Della
Reese. ``It's reflected in an award like this where people took the
time to vote. I've been nominated in the industry awards, but I've
always been the bridesmaid, never the bride,'' Downey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw accepted his award, flanked by his daughters Erin and
Rachel, one day after broadcasting the Super Bowl in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is unlike an Emmy or an Oscar, truthfully, when real
fans vote for you because that's who you're doing your job for,''
he said. ``I appreciate this more than most people, probably more
than anyone, especially Tim Allen.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening, Allen won as Favorite Actor In A Comedy
for his work on ``Home Improvement,'' in its eighth and final
season. Proving Bradshaw wrong, Allen seemed genuinely touched by
his prize.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the award to the People's Choice Awards, ``only
grander because people have to make the effort to vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the trophies presented were voted on by TV Guide editors,
not their readers. Drew Carey won the ``Editor's Award'' and The
WB's ``7th Heaven'' won The Best Show You're Not Watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Venerable ``Sesame Street,'' in its 30th season for PBS, was
named Favorite Children's Show and ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show,''
took Favorite Daytime Talk Show.

ENRON TO ERECT SKYSCRAPER IN DOWNTOWN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: New Haven, Conn.)

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Energy giant Enron Corp. will begin construction this
summer on a 40-story tower in downtown Houston _ the first office
building added to the city's skyline since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is going to be a great building. We have a
world-class architect and a world-class developer,'' said Kenneth
Lay, chairman of Enron.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.2-million-square-foot building will be built on a site now
used as the parking lot for the downtown YMCA, which is working
with Enron to come up with an alternative parking plan.
</P>
<P>
   Enron will begin moving some employees into the building in the
summer of 2001, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The new building, which has not been named, will become the main
headquarters of Enron, a Houston-based firm that produces natural
gas, electricity and operates power plants.
</P>
<P>
   After the new building is completed, Enron will continue to
occupy the Enron Building, a 50-story tower in downtown.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston-based developer, Hines, will handle development of the
$200 million Enron building. Hines has developed scores of major
projects in Houston and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new Enron building will be a silvery, glass-skinned
structure designed by Cesar Pelli &AMP; Associates of New Haven, Conn.
The Pelli architecture firm is led by Cesar Pelli, former dean of
the architecture school at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Pelli designed the tallest office buildings in the world, the
Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At 1,483 feet each,
the Petronas Towers surpass the height of the 1,453-foot Sears
Tower in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-story base of the new Enron Building will contain four
55,000-square-foot trading floors, where traders will buy and sell
electricity and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Enron needs the new building because office space for big
expansions downtown is impossible to find, said Lay, in a telephone
interview from Switzerland, where he was attending an economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need a lot of additional space to accommodate our
growth,'' Lay said. ``Class A office space in Houston is really
very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Enron, which has 5,500 employees now, expects to add another
1,500 employees to its payroll by the time the building is
complete, Lay said. The company is one of the biggest employers in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Lay said Enron eventually will vacate most of the 500,000 square
feet it occupies in the Three Allen Center building in downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new office building, Enron will build a
1,300-space parking garage on a half-block it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Enron is becoming a major force in downtown Houston. In addition
to the new office tower, Enron is also negotiating with the Houston
Astros about becoming a prominent sponsor for the new downtown
stadium, which is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new Enron tower will inject a significant amount of new
momentum into downtown Houston, said veteran office broker Jeff
Black of Insite Commercial Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, big boost for downtown. It's very positive,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy rate in the major office towers in downtown is less
than 5 percent and finding space is difficult for big companies.
</P>
<P>
   With strong job growth, Houston has made considerable progress
in leasing its office space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when the Heritage Plaza, the last new downtown tower to
be built, was completed, it remained vacant for many months until a
major portion was leased by Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, when the city was coming out of its economic
doldrums, the Houston office vacancy rate was more than 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With that much space vacant, there was no need for new office
buildings in Houston for years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the citywide vacancy rate is at 12.6 percent, down from
15.2 percent at the end of 1997, according to the Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield realty firm. Companies such as Continental Airlines and
Houston Industries have leased big chunks of downtown office space
recently.
</P>
<P>
   A number of developers also have been crafting plans for
downtown office towers: Means-Knaus, TrizecHahn, Century
Development, Crescent Real Estate Equities and the Wedge Group.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those developers has broken ground yet. A
significant amount of pre-leasing will be required for a developer
to get financing for a new tower downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's suburbs are a different story. With 32 suburban
buildings under construction, Houston currently ranks third in the
nation in new office construction behind Dallas and Washington,
D.C.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A thread to the past
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ We all know how a certain scent can conjure up a
cornucopia of memories. The aroma of Avon face cream always does it
for me. Immediately, I'm 6 years old again, cuddled up by my
grandmother, listening to her bedtime stories on a sleepover at her
house.
</P>
<P>
   Certain places also can send us catapulting through time and
space on a wild, emotional ride of recollections.
</P>
<P>
   This happened to me the other day. I had stopped at a fabric
store to pick up some sewing supplies. As I strolled through the
bolts of fabric, I suddenly felt a powerful connection to my
mother. Lightly touching the bountiful textures _ here silky and
smooth, there nubby and ridged _ I was transported to the
Woolworth's Five and Dime in the small town where I grew up. I was
a little girl again, trailing behind my mother, dwarfed by the maze
of fabric bolts, entranced by the button carousel, snapping the
elastic on display.
</P>
<P>
   My mother and I spent hours in fabric stores. An excellent
seamstress, she could meticulously recreate what we could never
afford to buy ready-made. She made most of the clothes my sister
and I wore when we were growing up. It's not as easy making clothes
for boys and men, but she did manage once to make my dad a suit.
Not a leisure suit, mind you, but a fully lined, worsted wool suit.
</P>
<P>
   My mother made my dresses and formals for everything from
homecoming to prom. Every Saturday night, we watched the ``Lawrence
Welk Show'' and mother would sketch pictures of whatever dress the
Lennon Sisters were wearing. From that, she could take a similar
pattern and recreate it for me. It was an amazing skill, really,
even though I was more interested in what the Mod Squad was
wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, we'd sit with the pattern books, leafing through
the oversized pages to find just the right design.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about this one?'' she'd ask.
</P>
<P>
   With typical teen-age authority, I'd sneer, ``Yuck!'' And on
we'd look.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern, the fabric, the buttons, zippers, elastic and
thread. All these items had to be selected. It was a ritual as much
a part of my growing up as gathering eggs and bringing in the milk
cow from the pasture every evening.
</P>
<P>
   And my mother taught me her craft, although I never was as
accomplished as she, nor as patient. What she didn't teach me, my
grandmother did.
</P>
<P>
   For us girls, receiving our first Singer sewing machine was as
much a rite of passage as a driver's license or first job. My
parents gave me mine as a wedding present. It was a grand gift and
I have put it to good use through the years, despite the fact I had
all boys.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through that fabric store recently brought all those
memories flooding back. For just that moment in time, I desperately
longed to have my mother at my side, walking those aisles with me,
exclaiming over one fabric or imagining a dress from another. Those
endless, unhurried, shared moments we now no longer experience.
</P>
<P>
   What takes you back? What aroma, or sight, or situation suddenly
swoops you away to another time and place? It's a heady, almost
overpowering sensation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a gift. To be able instantly to recall in vivid detail
some happy experience from your past is far better than watching
any video, reading any story. In those mediums, the experience is
translated through the filter of another person. With these
memories, the moment is ours alone. We can savor it like a piece of
taffy, relishing every sweet drop of it.
</P>
<P>
   So, if you see me suddenly smiling inanely at a piece of taffeta
in a fabric store, just walk on by. I have gone to a place where no
one else can follow.

 &HT;    It's no lie: Voice stress tests gain favor
 &HT;    By Val Ellicott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, Fla. _ Voice stress testing, billed by a Wellington
company as the last word in lie detection, continues to impress law
enforcement officials despite poor reviews from government
scientists and a lawsuit that calls the technology ``a modern-day
Ouija board.''
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at the National Institute for Truth Verification, which
enjoys an almost total lock on sales of voice stress testing
devices to law enforcement, say 700 police agencies across the
country use their machines, an increase from about 600 two years
ago. That includes about 100 agencies in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators say the company's software, which comes
pre-installed in Toshiba laptop computers, is easy to use and
consistently accurate in detecting deception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have run over 350 tests in the past couple of years and I
have never had one test give me a false positive or a false
negative result,'' Detective Anne Burke of the Palm Beach County
Sheriff's Office said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Burke, who is certified by the verification institute as an
advanced voice stress test analyzer, says the company's software
was crucial in helping her crack a home invasion case recently in
Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machine was right on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, founded in 1988 by Charles Humble, a former
Indianapolis police officer, has more than doubled its staff since
1996, but is just keeping up with demand, David Hughes, its
executive director, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Police in South Africa and Dubai use NITV equipment, and
agencies in other countries, including Interpol, are showing
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's growing exponentially, for sure,'' said Hughes, who was a
captain at the West Palm Beach Police Department before retiring in
1993. ``Not a day goes by that I don't get an e-mail from some
country asking for information.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one lawsuit claims the technology is unproven and
even dangerous when used to influence arrest decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The federal civil rights suit, which names NITV as a defendant,
was filed by a Clark County, Nev., man who claims police in
Henderson, Nev., falsely arrested him on rape charges in 1996 based
largely on a voice stress test that indicated he had lied on key
questions. According to the suit, a judge later threw out the rape
case for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no scientific study in existence which indicates that
a voice stress analyzer is anything more than random in its
accuracy,'' the suit, filed by Vincent Sedgwick, said. It calls
NITV's machines ``nothing more than a modern-day Ouija board.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been sued once in Palm Beach County, by a Texas
law enforcement officer, Donald Swanz, who said he bought one of
the firm's machines based on pledges by Humble that the machines
could be legally used by police in Texas and that they had been
scientifically validated. The 1992 suit was settled when Humble
refunded the officer's money, according to Swanz's attorney, Jack
Bariton.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said that in 1992, NITV was unaware that Texas prohibits
the use of lie detection devices with exceptions in certain cases
for polygraph machines. As for claims that voice stress testing
lacks scientific validation, Hughes said, ``Our track record is
validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick launches a similar attack in the lawsuit he filed in
Nevada, referring to a 1996 study by the U.S. Department of
Defense's Polygraph Institute in Alabama that concluded that voice
stress testing is no more reliable than random chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preponderance of evidence indicates the polygraph is far
more accurate at detecting deception than is voice stress
analysis,'' the institute's director, Michael Capps, wrote in the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Polygraph machines measure stress-related changes in respiratory
and heart activity, blood pressure and skin response. An
examination can last three hours and requires wiring the interview
subject to the machine.
</P>
<P>
   NITV staffers say their laptop and program, which sell for
$8,815 each, measure stress-related microtremors in the muscles
around the larynx.
</P>
<P>
   As the stress level increases, they say, the muscles tighten and
the amplitude of the microtremors decreases.
</P>
<P>
   When a person lies, the pattern that pops up on the laptop's
screen shows a flattened, ``blocking'' effect _ tracings that are
almost uniform in height. Truthful responses show tracings that
peak sharply.
</P>
<P>
   NITV's laptops come with small microphones that plug directly
into the computer. The person being tested wears the microphone
while answering ``yes'' or ``no'' to questions.
</P>
<P>
   NITV's staffers say criticism of computerized voice stress
analysis by anyone with the word ``polygraphy'' in their job title
is naturally suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have is a battle by the polygraph associations to
stymie us, if not stomp us,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said the Polygraph Institute's study tried to recreate
real-life stress in a laboratory setting, which he said isn't
possible. And while the case referred to in Sedgwick's suit may
have been thrown out, that doesn't mean Sedgwick told the truth on
the voice stress test, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   NITV also blames the polygraphist lobby for keeping agencies
like the FBI and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement from
embracing voice stress testing.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said the agency still uses polygraph
machines because ``we have nothing really conclusive regarding the
validity of voice stress test analysis.'' But he said the agency is
still testing the reliability of NITV's software.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY ELIZABETH RAZZI
 FROM KIPLINGER'S MAGAZINE 
 &HT;    Sending your beloved a dozen long-stemmed red roses that you
order over the Internet may not be as romantic as going to the
florist yourself and picking out the reddest, freshest flowers in
the shop _ and then delivering them in person _ but life is full of
compromises. Still, that should not mean you have to compromise on
the quality of the roses your sweetheart finds on the doorstep this
Valentine's Day _ or any other special day.
 &HT;    On-line purchases accounted for a mere 0.2 percent of last
Valentine's Day's bouquets, according to a study by the American
Floral Endowment, a nonprofit research group. But Internet flower
sales are likely to grow as electronic commerce takes off in the
months and years ahead.
 &HT;    To see whether the Internet could deliver stunning rather than
just so-so flowers, I placed orders with four heavily advertised
on-line florists for a dozen red roses to be delivered boxed to
willing recipients in Washington, D.C., and its Maryland and
Virginia suburbs.
 &HT;    Service and quality varied a lot _ for example, half the roses
didn't arrive on time. Prices, including shipping, ranged from
$35.90 to $63.98. But that may be a bargain on Valentine's Day,
when prices at the local florist can spike to nearly $100 a dozen
in pricier cities. Even street-corner vendors can spot desperation
a block away and jack up their flower prices accordingly.
 &HT;    Some on-line florists, such as Flowerstop.com, say they expect
to hold the line on prices for Valentine's Day, but they offer no
guarantees. Lower-priced competitors, such as Proflowers.com,
expect the price of a dozen roses to go up to $40 or $50 (plus
shipping) in mid-February. Freshflowersource.com, which ships
directly from the grower, is aiming to keep its Valentine's Day
price within about $5 of its regular price of $29.95.
 &HT;    Ordering from any of the Web sites is hassle-free with a credit
card, but make sure you have the recipient's phone number _ it's
necessary for Federal Express delivery. Every site except
Freshflowersource.com advertises an unconditional guarantee. If
you're not satisfied with the quality of the flowers, they promise
to send a new bouquet or refund your money.
 THE ELUSIVE PERFECT BOUQUET 
 &HT;    Unfortunately, well before the romantic holiday we struck out on
getting what we really wanted: the classic presentation of a dozen
delicate blossoms nestled in lush, green foliage, tied with a
ribbon and laid in a crisp, white florist's box. Roses gathered
with a twist-tie and nestled in a FedEx box just don't have the
same charm.
 &HT;    Not one recipient complained _ even if I did ask all of them to
relinquish their flowers to our panel of judges. For fun I threw in
a dozen I picked up at a corner flower stand. You guessed it: The
$7 bouquet of street-corner roses was the first pick of some of the
judges.
 &HT;    Other than the street flowers, the roses from
 Freshflowersource.com  came closest to the best mix of price and
presentation. It charged $30.99 plus $11.99 for FedEx delivery
(FedEx is used by all the direct shippers), for a total of $42.98.
 &HT;    The roses, shipped from the grower in Southern California,
arrived on time. The note from the sender was handwritten on a
traditional florist's card. The roses had the longest stems (22
inches), each one ensconced in its own water tube. The greenery,
though, had no water and arrived dried-out and bedraggled.
 &HT;    Still, some judges were so impressed with the height of the
bouquet and deep red of the blooms that they were willing to
overlook the many small blemishes.
 WILTED BEFORE THEIR TIME  
 &HT;    Several judges liked the roses from
 1-800-Flowers.com  best. They cost $49.99 plus $6.99 handling, for
a total of $56.98 _ the second-priciest. The flowers came from a
local florist. The bouquet had the nicest greenery by far,
including several varieties of ferns. The stems were nice and long,
too, about 21 inches. And the sender's message was handwritten on a
traditional florist's card.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the roses were delivered a day earlier than
requested _ and they arrived in a glass vase, not boxed, as
ordered. (We weren't charged the extra $10 for the vase.) And the
flowers started to wilt by the end of the second day we had them.
 DELAYED GRATIFICATION 
 &HT;     Proflowers.com,  a company that does 90 percent of its business
over the Internet, had the cheapest price, $29.95 plus only $5.95
for FedEx shipping. Maybe it needs to charge more for shipping _
the flowers came a day late.
 &HT;    The flowers, shipped directly from growers in California,
included baby's breath but no ferns or other foliage. The bouquet
was tied with a blue fabric rose. The 18-inch stems came in
individual water tubes, and the bouquet was packed in straw and
with a cold pack. The message was laser-printed on a piece of
floral computer paper. Three of the blossoms arrived as tightly
closed buds (the Web site said several would be shipped as buds),
but they did eventually open.
 HIGHEST PRICE PER INCH  
 &HT;     Flowerstop.com  _ operated by a retail florist shop in Colorado
Springs, Colo., that ships trademarked ``Long Distance Roses''
grown by the proprietor's brother _ charged the most: $54.99 plus
$8.99 FedEx, for a grand total of $63.98. Despite the high price,
its flowers were the shortest (about 17 inches) and had the palest
greenery. The bouquet included baby's breath _ and one measly fern.
Several people singled it out as the bunch bought off the street
corner.
 &HT;    The flower stems were pushed into a moist foam cube and the box
included two reusable cold packs. But the message from the sender
was printed on the inside of a flier with the florist's logo and
``800'' number _ hardly the stuff of romance.

 SIDEBAR: GETTING THEM THERE IN TIME  
 &HT;    Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday this year, making the timing
of on-line orders more problematic than usual. Unless a Web site
contracts with local florists (as 1-800-Flowers.com often does), it
uses Federal Express to ship the flowers. On-line florists are
trying to line up options for special Sunday deliveries, but you
can expect to pay $10 or so extra _ if the service is available.
With FedEx deliveries, Saturdays usually cost more, too (up to
$10), and Monday deliveries aren't always available.
 &HT;    Place your order early _ the Monday or Tuesday before
Valentine's Day _ for the best crack at the rose color of your
choice. In fact, sites are likely to quit taking orders guaranteed
for holiday delivery several days ahead of the big day.
 &HT;    Some florists expect demand for roses to be a bit lower this
year because Valentine's Day falls on a weekend, when couples are
more likely to celebrate with a night on the town rather than roses
delivered to the office.

 &HT;    Here's to hoping the expectations of today's kids are met
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Timmy sits at one of the IBM dinosaurs in the
back of our classroom, pounding away on his essay. I watch his lips
move as he struggles to capture just the right adjective or form
the perfect phrase. Timmy loves to write, but has a long way to go
before he's competition for Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmy,'' I can't help asking, ``is that a yo-yo on the corner
of your computer?'' He nods. I ask if it's OK if I have a look at
it. He's apprehensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to take it away from me, are you?'' I assure
him I just want to look at it and hold it because it is so pretty.
He sighs his relief. ``Good, because it's my good luck charm. I
can't write without it.'' He watches me closely as I examine it. I
compliment him on his good taste in yo-yos, carefully replace it
beside his monitor, and back off. He wants me out of his
</P>
<P>
   space, so I move on.
</P>
<P>
   Jack motions me over. ``Ms. Schuett, I've got a problem. The
main guy in my story has to have his head chopped off but you won't
let us write that kind of stuff.'' I assure him he is correct and
suggest he let his protagonist live. He says it won't work.
``Somebody's gotta' die or nobody'll read my story.'' I assure him
I'll read it, but that doesn't seem to count.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is a television wrestler and I can't have him die of
a bad cold. Nobody'll believe that.'' I tell him he'll have to work
it out because gruesome won't get a grade. He huffs and puffs a bit
and goes back to beating on his keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   As I wander the room looking for signs of writer's block, I
can't help wondering what makes these eighth-graders tick and
remembering what life was like when I was their age. One obvious
difference is the way they look.
</P>
<P>
   My eighth-grade girls seldom wear dresses to school, and when
they do, it's a postage stamp-size skirt with a short sweater and a
pair of shoes that looks like some of Olive Oyl's castoffs.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 13, we had to wear dresses to school, and when I
wanted my first pair of jeans I had to trade for them with the girl
next door. She extracted a dear price _ my favorite blue-plaid
shirt. And when I decided I needed her Miami High T-shirt and
battered sailor hat to complete this cutting-edge outfit, it cost
me a musical powder box that played ``The Blue Danube,'' and a lacy
white petticoat.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in the eighth-grade, the civics teacher yelled at me
in the hall. ``Pick up your lazy feet!'' he hollered as I scuffed
past. I was mortified. I never again wore those loafers to school.
That civics teacher should see us now.
</P>
<P>
   When I was 13, I had to memorize all of the prepositions and
write a poem about an unhatched chicken. I was tapped to sing in
the choir (this one I still can't figure). ``Whispering Hope'' was
my favorite song because it was the only one where I could even
come close to singing harmony. I almost failed home economics
because my prune whip flopped and the apron I made fell apart in
the fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 13-year-olds discuss endlessly the person with whom they
are ``going out'' although not one of them ever does - go out, I
mean. That's just what they call it and when I ask why, they shrug
and remind me they're only 13 and not allowed to date.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was I when I was 13. Heck, I was still in love with Alan
Ladd and a ninth-grader named Bill. He was a track star and as ugly
as the old cleats he wore day and night. I thought he was so cool
and used to daydream about him in math class instead of trying to
catch on to percentages and word problems.
</P>
<P>
   Life, we're told, isn't as simple as it used to be, and I guess
I believe that. Life as we saw it, was still beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   When I look around my classroom, I can't help but wonder about
these kids' expectations. Will Timmy live in a peaceful world where
he can pass his yo-yo collection on to his children? And how about
Jack. Will he outgrow the blood lust fostered by a steady diet of
trash?
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope.

 &HT;    And now, we subtract?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Nothing like a hair-splitting contest between a
man with a ponytail and one with a crew cut.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Duncan, the one with less hair to split, appeared before
the Waco school board Jan. 14 to criticize committing 20 years
worth of projected surplus dollars to build an athletic complex.
</P>
<P>
   School board president Sunny Lozano, the one with the locks,
challenged Duncan's critique.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-dealer Duncan, Lozano pointed out, relies on customers to
commit projected earnings to buy his Buicks. It's the same when you
buy a $13 million athletic complex, Lozano said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan's appearance before the school board was odd, to say the
least. After all, Duncan preceded Lozano as board president. And
Duncan was the one pointing out as board president the options
available for stadium-shopping with the budget surplus the district
was accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Duncan has virtual paternal rights to this notion.
Coming to the board that night with this criticism was akin to
Thomas Edison telling New York to turn down the lights.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, however, that Duncan won the argument that night,
so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   While committing to put down $7.2 million in cash _ from two
years' accumulated surplus _ the board voted, in wording introduced
by trustee Ralph Strother, not to finance the remainder with
projected surplus dollars but to wedge annual payments of
approximately $400,000 into the district's budget.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to assuage concerns about ``deficit
financing'' raised by Duncan and trustee Dot Snyder. All it did for
me as a parent and taxpayer was raise concerns about ``debit
financing'' _ wondering what WISD must subtract to make the budget
balance now.
</P>
<P>
   Hair splitting.
</P>
<P>
   Four-hundred thou here. Four-hundred thou there. Pretty soon you
have a lot of money. It's got to come from somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County schools, in the western outskirts of greater
Denver, plan an athletic complex _ a 6,000-seat football stadium
and a 1,500-seat soccer stadium. Projected cost: not to exceed $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Waco's $13 million Veterans Field complex would include a
10,000-seat stadium for football and soccer and two additional
softball fields. Jefferson County saves some money in meeting its
own need for additional softball fields there by having an
agreement with the City of Arvada to share fields. That sounds like
something the City of Waco has recommended a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the most remarkable thing about what Jefferson County
schools have done. They've gone out and obtained corporate
sponsorships to the tune of _ are you ready for this? $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi has swung for $2.1 million. Baby Bell USWest is in for $2
million as a sponsor. Other sponsorships are being sought to cut
down on costs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Waco ISD harvested a $1 million vendor agreement with
Coca Cola. Surely, lucrative partnerships loom if WISD will pursue
them. With the budgetary bite this project takes, it darn well
should.
</P>
<P>
   Much gets said about the revenue potential of sporting venues
like this, but that's a bake-sale charade. Even at the big-time
college level athletic departments are a chronic revenue drain, and
nothing drains resources like stadiums, their empty seats gleaming
in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   With electric deregulation coming up, WISD should seize on a
revenue opportunity. Considering all the days the stadium-to-be's
seats will sit without a rump to obscure them, we should be the
first school district to install solar collectors on them and sell
the resulting wattage.
</P>
<P>
   Then truly we'd get a fraction back on a new, generally empty,
$400,000-a-year budget item.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY ELIZABETH RAZZI
 FROM KIPLINGER'S MAGAZINE 
 &HT;    Sending your beloved a dozen long-stemmed red roses that you
order over the Internet may not be as romantic as going to the
florist yourself and picking out the reddest, freshest flowers in
the shop _ and then delivering them in person _ but life is full of
compromises. Still, that should not mean you have to compromise on
the quality of the roses your sweetheart finds on the doorstep this
Valentine's Day _ or any other special day.
 &HT;    On-line purchases accounted for a mere 0.2 percent of last
Valentine's Day's bouquets, according to a study by the American
Floral Endowment, a nonprofit research group. But Internet flower
sales are likely to grow as electronic commerce takes off in the
months and years ahead.
 &HT;    To see whether the Internet could deliver stunning rather than
just so-so flowers, I placed orders with four heavily advertised
on-line florists for a dozen red roses to be delivered boxed to
willing recipients in Washington, D.C., and its Maryland and
Virginia suburbs.
 &HT;    Service and quality varied a lot _ for example, half the roses
didn't arrive on time. Prices, including shipping, ranged from
$35.90 to $63.98. But that may be a bargain on Valentine's Day,
when prices at the local florist can spike to nearly $100 a dozen
in pricier cities. Even street-corner vendors can spot desperation
a block away and jack up their flower prices accordingly.
 &HT;    Some on-line florists, such as Flowerstop.com, say they expect
to hold the line on prices for Valentine's Day, but they offer no
guarantees. Lower-priced competitors, such as Proflowers.com,
expect the price of a dozen roses to go up to $40 or $50 (plus
shipping) in mid-February. Freshflowersource.com, which ships
directly from the grower, is aiming to keep its Valentine's Day
price within about $5 of its regular price of $29.95.
 &HT;    Ordering from any of the Web sites is hassle-free with a credit
card, but make sure you have the recipient's phone number _ it's
necessary for Federal Express delivery. Every site except
Freshflowersource.com advertises an unconditional guarantee. If
you're not satisfied with the quality of the flowers, they promise
to send a new bouquet or refund your money.
 THE ELUSIVE PERFECT BOUQUET 
 &HT;    Unfortunately, well before the romantic holiday we struck out on
getting what we really wanted: the classic presentation of a dozen
delicate blossoms nestled in lush, green foliage, tied with a
ribbon and laid in a crisp, white florist's box. Roses gathered
with a twist-tie and nestled in a FedEx box just don't have the
same charm.
 &HT;    Not one recipient complained _ even if I did ask all of them to
relinquish their flowers to our panel of judges. For fun I threw in
a dozen I picked up at a corner flower stand. You guessed it: The
$7 bouquet of street-corner roses was the first pick of some of the
judges.
 &HT;    Other than the street flowers, the roses from
 Freshflowersource.com  came closest to the best mix of price and
presentation. It charged $30.99 plus $11.99 for FedEx delivery
(FedEx is used by all the direct shippers), for a total of $42.98.
 &HT;    The roses, shipped from the grower in Southern California,
arrived on time. The note from the sender was handwritten on a
traditional florist's card. The roses had the longest stems (22
inches), each one ensconced in its own water tube. The greenery,
though, had no water and arrived dried-out and bedraggled.
 &HT;    Still, some judges were so impressed with the height of the
bouquet and deep red of the blooms that they were willing to
overlook the many small blemishes.
 WILTED BEFORE THEIR TIME  
 &HT;    Several judges liked the roses from
 1-800-Flowers.com  best. They cost $49.99 plus $6.99 handling, for
a total of $56.98 _ the second-priciest. The flowers came from a
local florist. The bouquet had the nicest greenery by far,
including several varieties of ferns. The stems were nice and long,
too, about 21 inches. And the sender's message was handwritten on a
traditional florist's card.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the roses were delivered a day earlier than
requested _ and they arrived in a glass vase, not boxed, as
ordered. (We weren't charged the extra $10 for the vase.) And the
flowers started to wilt by the end of the second day we had them.
 DELAYED GRATIFICATION 
 &HT;     Proflowers.com,  a company that does 90 percent of its business
over the Internet, had the cheapest price, $29.95 plus only $5.95
for FedEx shipping. Maybe it needs to charge more for shipping _
the flowers came a day late.
 &HT;    The flowers, shipped directly from growers in California,
included baby's breath but no ferns or other foliage. The bouquet
was tied with a blue fabric rose. The 18-inch stems came in
individual water tubes, and the bouquet was packed in straw and
with a cold pack. The message was laser-printed on a piece of
floral computer paper. Three of the blossoms arrived as tightly
closed buds (the Web site said several would be shipped as buds),
but they did eventually open.
 HIGHEST PRICE PER INCH  
 &HT;     Flowerstop.com  _ operated by a retail florist shop in Colorado
Springs, Colo., that ships trademarked ``Long Distance Roses''
grown by the proprietor's brother _ charged the most: $54.99 plus
$8.99 FedEx, for a grand total of $63.98. Despite the high price,
its flowers were the shortest (about 17 inches) and had the palest
greenery. The bouquet included baby's breath _ and one measly fern.
Several people singled it out as the bunch bought off the street

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Chimps linked to start of AIDS
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Scientists from the University of Alabama at
Birmingham say they have conclusively identified a subspecies of
chimpanzee that is native to west-central Africa as the original
source of HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS in humans. The virus
probably crossed over into humans in the early part of this century
when people began hunting these chimps, named Pan troglodytes
troglodytes, for food. People likely were exposed to infected chimp
blood when bitten by them or while field-dressing killed chimps,
said Dr. Beatrice Hahn, professor of medicine and microbiology.
Hahn presented her team's findings Sunday at the Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections here, an annual meeting
of 3,400 AIDS doctors and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery could have major implications for the development
of HIV therapies and vaccines, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing aspects of the study, which involved
three Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps, is that the infected apes
remained healthy; apparently the virus did not cause AIDS-related
disease in them. Because chimpanzees share 98 percent of their
genes with humans, the relatively small genetic difference between
chimps and people could hold the secret to how chimps are able to
withstand the virus while humans cannot. In seeking the source of
the original virus, researchers analyzed all known strains of
HIV-1, including the primary strain responsible for the global AIDS
epidemic and other strains only found in west-central Africa. They
found these strains were closely related only to strains of Simian
Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV, the primate equivalent of HIV) that
infect Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The conclusive factor was that
this particular chimp subspecies is known to inhabit the precise
region of west-central Africa where the HIV strains first were
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is when the crossover from chimps to humans
occurred, but researchers know it must predate the 1940s, when HIV
first began spreading among humans.
</P>
<P>
   Early tests of anti-depressants seem promising for dogs
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ After at least a dozen trips to the veterinarian
to get stitches, Barry and Eva Vokes knew they had to do something
to keep their two Doberman pinscher dogs from continually hurting
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time Rex and Prince were loving house dogs who
couldn't stand to be apart from the other. Then, out of the clear
blue, a vicious fight would erupt and the blood would flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, there was no problem at all,'' Barry Vokes
said. ``But more often than we would like, they would go at each
other and we never have been able to figure out what set them off.
One minute they're just peacefully lying there and the next minute,
they're going at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vokeses found themselves in the emergency room of their vet,
Dr. Layne Gregory, at all hours of the day _ and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very expensive patching them up,'' Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian put the dogs on an anti-depressant drug called
amitriptyline, also known as Elavil. The drug is similar to a newly
labeled anti-depressant drug the federal government approved
recently for dogs called Clomicalm by Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a definite improvement,'' Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dogs were put on the twice-daily medication, there
have been no major fights and no midnight trips to the vet, Eva
Vokes said. The only visit the Vokes have made to the vet has been
for checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been giving it to them, the skirmishes are few and
far between,'' said Gregory, an 18-year veterinarian. ``They
haven't been depressed, sedated or changed in personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't affected them at all that we can tell,'' Barry Vokes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-depressant also has helped curb Rex's compulsive
chewing, Eva Vokes added.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gregory, veterinarians for years have been
prescribing anti-depressants such as amitriptyline and Prozac to
dogs and cats with anxiety disorders and behavior problems, such as
aggression, fear and inappropriate waste elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's five or six drugs that work well,'' Gregory said.
``All seem to have a good track record. What's good about them,
they do help these guys live a happier life. It can get them over
some rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that there's a drug labeled as an animal anti-depressant
that will help with behavioral problems, such as separation
anxiety, some fear owners and even some veterinarians will be
looking for a ``quick fix'' for an unruly pet.
</P>
<P>
   Before any drugs are administered, Barkley and Gregory agree,
that all other options should be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   If pet owners are having problems with a dog or cat, they also
need to examine any changes that might have upset the animal's
life, such as a recent move, a new baby in the household, a
divorce, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason for separation anxiety in dogs is that
owners don't spend enough time with their pet, Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   HIV diagnosis brings suit
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For six years, he lived with a diagnosis of HIV

<P>
   But when Mark Savage left Chicago and moved to Dayton in 1997,
he switched to a doctor here who told him he had never been
infected with the AIDS-causing virus.
</P>
<P>
   Now Savage has filed a malpractice lawsuit against a physician
and hospital in Chicago for allegedly misdiagnosing his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the damages are severe here, not only from the
tangible perspective of taking a potent drug for six years, but
particularly the emotional damage of being told that you have a
fatal disease,'' said Jim Bonebrake, an attorney in Chicago
representing Savage. ``This set him up to be isolated for years of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage, 43, filed his lawsuit this week in Cook County Circuit
Court against Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Triad Health
Practice and Dr. David Blatt, a specialist in internal medicine who
set up one of Chicago's first clinics for treating AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois Masonic officials said they had not seen the lawsuit
and could not comment. However, hospital spokeswoman Carmen
Esposito called Blatt ``a very fine physician who has treated many
HIV patients in his career. He's a very compassionate man.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said Savage was tested periodically for the HIV virus
and those test results were in his medical record.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, however, claims Blatt failed to test Savage before,
or after, diagnosing HIV positive in July 1990 and prescribing the
drug AZT. When Savage moved to Dayton, his new doctor continued the
treatments, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Savage showed no signs of AIDS, Dr. Robert L. Brandt
Jr. of Dayton ran new tests and told him in December 1997 that he
never had the virus, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A misdiagnosis of HIV in a male patient is very unusual, Brandt
said from his Dayton office Thursday. ``I've reversed the diagnoses
in four to six women in the last four or five years, but this is
the first man,'' he said. ``It could happen when someone jumps the
gun without complete information.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonebrake said Savage has suffered side effects by taking drugs
he never needed, including depression, tingling in his hands and
digestive and vision problems.

   $5.5 million grant to help Ohio university continue study on
human growth, obesity
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A $5.5 million federal grant to Wright State
University will enable the School of Medicine to continue the
world's longest-running study of human growth, body composition,
obesity and risk factors for heart disease for five more years.
</P>
<P>
   The Fels Longitudinal Study, called ``a national treasure'' by
the National Institutes of Health, began in Yellow Springs 70 years
ago. More than 1,100 people have been followed since birth in the
study now run by the medical school's Division of Human Biology.
</P>
<P>
   The research currently focuses on how body composition,
especially the amount and distribution of body fat, changes during
childhood and adulthood in relation to obesity, high blood
pressure, cholesterol levels and other risk factors for heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Fels study has achieved an international reputation for its
methods of measuring human bodies, which are recommended by the
World Health Organization. It has generated more than 1,500
publications in scientific journals and books.
</P>
<P>
   Wright State researchers developed a method to identify children
at high risk for obesity in adulthood by using the
height-and-weight ratio called the Body Mass Index (BMI), which has
since become the national standard for measuring obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Fels research also has found it is likely that teen-agers with
high blood pressure and cholesterol levels will carry those heart
disease risks into adulthood. With that knowledge, it becomes
possible to reduce those lifetime risks through medical
intervention during childhood, said Dr. Roger Siervogel, who heads
the human biology division in Wright State's Department of
Community Health.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the research has found that gradual increases in
adults' body fat are associated with a steady rise in harmful blood
cholesterol and a decrease in men's levels of HDL (good)
cholesterol.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Chimps linked to start of AIDS
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Scientists from the University of Alabama at
Birmingham say they have conclusively identified a subspecies of
chimpanzee that is native to west-central Africa as the original
source of HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS in humans. The virus
probably crossed over into humans in the early part of this century
when people began hunting these chimps, named Pan troglodytes
troglodytes, for food. People likely were exposed to infected chimp
blood when bitten by them or while field-dressing killed chimps,
said Dr. Beatrice Hahn, professor of medicine and microbiology.
Hahn presented her team's findings Sunday at the Conference on
Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections here, an annual meeting
of 3,400 AIDS doctors and researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery could have major implications for the development
of HIV therapies and vaccines, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing aspects of the study, which involved
three Pan troglodytes troglodytes chimps, is that the infected apes
remained healthy; apparently the virus did not cause AIDS-related
disease in them. Because chimpanzees share 98 percent of their
genes with humans, the relatively small genetic difference between
chimps and people could hold the secret to how chimps are able to
withstand the virus while humans cannot. In seeking the source of
the original virus, researchers analyzed all known strains of
HIV-1, including the primary strain responsible for the global AIDS
epidemic and other strains only found in west-central Africa. They
found these strains were closely related only to strains of Simian
Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV, the primate equivalent of HIV) that
infect Pan troglodytes troglodytes. The conclusive factor was that
this particular chimp subspecies is known to inhabit the precise
region of west-central Africa where the HIV strains first were
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is when the crossover from chimps to humans
occurred, but researchers know it must predate the 1940s, when HIV
first began spreading among humans.
</P>
<P>
   Early tests of anti-depressants seem promising for dogs
</P>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ After at least a dozen trips to the veterinarian
to get stitches, Barry and Eva Vokes knew they had to do something
to keep their two Doberman pinscher dogs from continually hurting
each other.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time Rex and Prince were loving house dogs who
couldn't stand to be apart from the other. Then, out of the clear
blue, a vicious fight would erupt and the blood would flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time, there was no problem at all,'' Barry Vokes
said. ``But more often than we would like, they would go at each
other and we never have been able to figure out what set them off.
One minute they're just peacefully lying there and the next minute,
they're going at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vokeses found themselves in the emergency room of their vet,
Dr. Layne Gregory, at all hours of the day _ and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very expensive patching them up,'' Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
   The veterinarian put the dogs on an anti-depressant drug called
amitriptyline, also known as Elavil. The drug is similar to a newly
labeled anti-depressant drug the federal government approved
recently for dogs called Clomicalm by Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a definite improvement,'' Vokes said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the dogs were put on the twice-daily medication, there
have been no major fights and no midnight trips to the vet, Eva
Vokes said. The only visit the Vokes have made to the vet has been
for checkups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we've been giving it to them, the skirmishes are few and
far between,'' said Gregory, an 18-year veterinarian. ``They
haven't been depressed, sedated or changed in personality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't affected them at all that we can tell,'' Barry Vokes
said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-depressant also has helped curb Rex's compulsive
chewing, Eva Vokes added.
</P>
<P>
   According to Gregory, veterinarians for years have been
prescribing anti-depressants such as amitriptyline and Prozac to
dogs and cats with anxiety disorders and behavior problems, such as
aggression, fear and inappropriate waste elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's five or six drugs that work well,'' Gregory said.
``All seem to have a good track record. What's good about them,
they do help these guys live a happier life. It can get them over
some rough spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that there's a drug labeled as an animal anti-depressant
that will help with behavioral problems, such as separation
anxiety, some fear owners and even some veterinarians will be
looking for a ``quick fix'' for an unruly pet.
</P>
<P>
   Before any drugs are administered, Barkley and Gregory agree,
that all other options should be exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   If pet owners are having problems with a dog or cat, they also
need to examine any changes that might have upset the animal's
life, such as a recent move, a new baby in the household, a
divorce, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reason for separation anxiety in dogs is that
owners don't spend enough time with their pet, Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   HIV diagnosis brings suit
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For six years, he lived with a diagnosis of HIV
infection, ingesting daily doses of the potent anti-viral drug AZT,
shunning new relationships and planning for his life's end.
</P>
<P>
   But when Mark Savage left Chicago and moved to Dayton in 1997,
he switched to a doctor here who told him he had never been
infected with the AIDS-causing virus.
</P>
<P>
   Now Savage has filed a malpractice lawsuit against a physician
and hospital in Chicago for allegedly misdiagnosing his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the damages are severe here, not only from the
tangible perspective of taking a potent drug for six years, but
particularly the emotional damage of being told that you have a
fatal disease,'' said Jim Bonebrake, an attorney in Chicago
representing Savage. ``This set him up to be isolated for years of
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage, 43, filed his lawsuit this week in Cook County Circuit

 &HT;    HEALTH: Severe fatigue takes toll on 4 of 5 cancer patients
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Jean Powell could not understand why she was so
tired. She figured the radiation treatments for her breast cancer
would sap some of her strength, but this? She was only 32, and it
was getting to be a productive day if she made dinner for her kids
and husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't working, so I thought I should have plenty of
energy,'' Powell says now, 5 years later. ``I was used to getting
things done in a day's time, and I couldn't get anything done. I
was too tired to think clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most cancer patients, Powell suffered silently with her
profound fatigue. This must be part of cancer, she decided. It
certainly wasn't something to bother her doctor with. ``My primary
goal was to be alive,'' she says, and if making that possible meant
she couldn't make the bed or dust the bookshelves, that was a trade
she happily made.
</P>
<P>
   Debilitating fatigue affects roughly four of every five cancer
patients undergoing radiation or chemotherapy, but it is generally
overlooked and undertreated. ``It is one of the least understood
symptoms of cancer,'' says Dr. Russell Portenoy, a pain specialist
at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9 percent of exhausted cancer patients were treated with
the medications or blood transfusions that relieve the anemia that
usually causes fatigue, according to research last year by the
Fatigue Coalition, an organization of doctors, nurses, researchers
and patient advocates formed in 1996. But patients say fatigue is
three times more likely to affect their daily routines than nausea,
the next most significant side effect, and 10 times more likely
than pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frequently prevents patients from completing therapy,''
says Jackie Matthews, who directs the new Cancer Care Center at
Upper Valley Medical Center in Troy. Even when it's not that
disruptive, fatigue often jeopardizes the career and livelihood of
a cancer patient. And it almost always erodes the attitude and
outlook that are so important in a patient's recovery, said Dr.
Valeriy Moysaenko, the cancer center's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not acceptable to tell patients that fatigue is just
something they must live with,'' Portenoy says. ``For some
patients, treating fatigue may be as important as treating the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to raise that awareness among medical professionals,
people from the worlds of cancer and business have collaborated to
create In My Steps, a virtual reality device that simulates the
effects of fatigue in cancer patients. The machine, funded by Ortho
Biotech Inc., stopped at Upper Valley last week on its national
tour of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of frustration is realistic,'' says Powell, a
registered nurse at Upper Valley who went through the 15-minute
simulation. The simulator's sponsors say more than 60 percent of
physicians who have gone through it say they plan to change the way
they treat fatigue in cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   It enhanced Dr. David Powell's empathy, he says, even though
he's an oncologist who had a close look at his wife Jean's battle.
``You still don't know what they're feeling until you get to
experience that frustration,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The simulation shows a few minutes in the life of a cancer
patient past middle age, either Grace or Ed, depending on the
participant's sex. By using a sort of sitting StairMaster, the
participant guides Grace or Ed through the mundane chores of making
toast and tea for breakfast, greeting a delivery man at the door,
answering the phone and climbing a staircase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Grace didn't get anything done that she wanted to do, and
I was perspiring at the end,'' Jean Powell says. ``She didn't even
get the phone answered.'' And she still needed a nap at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's husband tried to help by putting toast in the toaster
and water in the teakettle, but she had no idea that even that
wasn't enough when the doorbell and telephone interrupted. Her
grown daughter left an annoyed phone message because Grace didn't
call her back yesterday. ``I don't think families realize how much
the patients have to go through to do anything,'' Jean says.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Burnett Hanson, a radiation oncologist at Upper Valley,
hopes it will be possible before long to routinely put patients'
families through the simulation. Hanson already deals with
patients' fatigue every day. ``It's the No. 1 complaint,'' he says,
and he discusses fatigue with patients whenever they begin a
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanson expects the experience to make him ``even more aware
of fatigue,'' especially as the treatment progresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients don't usually bring it up unless you ask them,'' Dr.
Powell says. And doctors need to do that more often, says
Moysaenko, without feeling they're being distracted from the main
issue of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just take the time to watch them walk into your office
or sit and talk to you, you can see how difficult it is for them to
do things you take for granted,'' Moysaenko says. Cancer treatment
should also cover the nausea, pain, sleeplessness and psychological
aspects, he says, all lined up for a patient ``almost like a
checklist for an airline pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients who feel better about their treatment tend to do
better,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Powell, for example, couldn't shake her overwhelming fear.
It kept her awake nights, ``which didn't help the fatigue,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors need to ask themselves what's causing a cancer patient's
fatigue, Hanson says. It could be sleeplessness, depression,
inactivity or inadequate nutrition as well as anemia, a deficiency
of iron in the blood that's caused by cancer treatments for reasons
not fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, they all can be addressed medically. A
fairly new anemia medication from Ortho Biotech is a promising
substitute for transfusions, Moysaenko says, and probably should be
used even for cancer patients whose lowered iron levels wouldn't be
called anemia if they were otherwise healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now you have to justify that to an HMO that might say,
`He's not anemic. Why are you treating him?' '' Dr. Powell says.
``But we're all starting to realize that there's more to treating
cancer than keeping people alive. We're also giving back their
quality of life.

   Jean Powell, for example, couldn't shake her overwhelming fear.
It kept her awake nights, ``which didn't help the fatigue,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors need to ask themselves what's causing a cancer patient's
fatigue, Hanson says. It could be sleeplessness, depression,
inactivity or inadequate nutrition as well as anemia, a deficiency
of iron in the blood that's caused by cancer treatments for reasons
not fully understood.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, they all can be addressed medically. A
fairly new anemia medication from Ortho Biotech is a promising
substitute for transfusions, Moysaenko says, and probably should be
used even for cancer patients whose lowered iron levels wouldn't be
called anemia if they were otherwise healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now you have to justify that to an HMO that might say,
`He's not anemic. Why are you treating him?' '' Dr. Powell says.
``But we're all starting to realize that there's more to treating
cancer than keeping people alive. We're also giving back their
quality of life.

 &HT;    Bumper crop of Conversation Hearts at stores near you
 &HT;    By Pat Thomas
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the calendar page turns over to February and the groundhog
has been dragged from its den, it's time for another seasonal crop:
the conversation heart candy.
</P>
<P>
   For a few weeks every year, the NECCO (New England Confectionery
Co.) churns out millions of chalky, pastel heart-shaped lumps of
candy stamped with Valentine-themed words and sayings. The official
name is even a mouthful: Sweethearts brand Conversation Hearts.
</P>
<P>
   And each year, in addition to longtime favorites such as ``Be
Mine,'' ``My Man,'' ``Sweet Talk'' and ``Kiss Me,'' the company
adds what it considers trendy or thematic phrases.
</P>
<P>
   This year the company is taking its inspiration from popular
music and culture. The five somewhat eclectic musical phrases are:
``Love Me Tender,'' ``I Got U Babe,`` ``My Way,'' ``Let It Be'' and
``Walk On By,'' which pretty much seem to cover every potential
relationship stage from beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not inclined to let the music do the talking, pick out
the new pop culture phrases: ``You Rock,'' ``Let's Do Lunch,'' ``I
Wonder'' and ``As If.'' There's also ``1-800 Cupid,'' although it
seems that ``10-10 CUPID'' would have been more timely, given the
incessant long-distance ad campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the sentiment (and how come I always seem to get a
handful of ``No Way''?), each candy is fat- and sodium-free. The
small hearts have about three calories each, the big ones, about
six.

 &HT;    Can you learn in a day to make love last forever?
 &HT;    By Douglas Kalajian
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What can you learn in four hours? Forget
quantum mechanics. Same for sheep cloning and laparoscopic surgery.
It takes some of us that long just to find the on-off button on a
new camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   And that's relatively easy stuff, all reducible to math and
diagrams. Who could expect you to learn something that stumps half
the people who devote much of their lives to trying: How to stay
married?
</P>
<P>
   Well, your state government thinks you can. Starting this year,
a four-hour marriage course before they take the plunge gets
Florida residents a $32.50 discount on a marriage license. (You can
skip the class and just pay the full $88.50.)
</P>
<P>
   Edward B. Houck II thinks so, too. Houck and his partner in
Successful Unions Inc., Beth Cutler, were the first Palm Beach
County mental health counselors to register under the new law and
create a course that follows state guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Houck told their first class right off why he accepted the
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage doesn't have to be hard,'' he said. ``Relationships
can be easy.'' He got skeptical looks from the six mostly older,
mostly married-before students. But he rushed right toward the
first and most powerful lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Houck offered about 90 percent of the course's wisdom
in the first 10 minutes. Most everything that followed fell into
the category of elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The gist: Happy marriages depend largely on each partner
figuring out what the other does that's most likely to provoke
near-homicidal rage _ important things, like squeezing the
toothpaste the wrong way _ and then finding a solution.
</P>
<P>
   A good solution: Buying two tubes of toothpaste. A bad solution:
Stern lectures aimed at changing your mate's habits.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for women who expect their husbands to stop playing
golf or watching football, and for men who expect their wives to
become June Cleaver or Donna Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes double for people who expect their mates to stop
drinking, cheating or worse. ``You can't solve someone else's
problems,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   What you can change is your reaction. Houck, who lives in Delray
Beach but works in Deerfield Beach, illustrated this by explaining
the pacific pessimism that has allowed him to roll through life
without anger since a broken back consigned him to a wheelchair 31
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect things to go well,'' he said. ``I'm delighted
when they do.''
</P>
<P>
   (None of the students asked Houck, 50, if he had first-hand
experience in marriage, but the answer is twice. One ended in
divorce, the other in death.)
</P>
<P>
   Houck said he allows no one to make him angry, no matter how
rude or provocative. He claims he can smile while driving
Interstate 95, amused at how predictably other drivers live down to
his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn not to take other people's behavior personally,'' he
said. ``My parents have been married 53 years, and they don't take
each other's behavior personally.''
</P>
<P>
   He offered a hefty reading list of allusions to support his
philosophy, from Ben Franklin to the Koran to self-help author
Wayne Dyer. More than once, he recalled Epictetus, Stoic
philosopher and slave who managed to keep up the good cheer while
his master twisted one of his legs until it snapped.
</P>
<P>
   No one appeared to find this an odd blot on the picture of
marital bliss. They seemed more interested in getting a little
reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had so many people ask me why we're getting married,''
said Ilyse Hyams of Boca Raton, who held hands for very nearly the
entire four hours with her intended, Patrick Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Her answer to those ``stupid people'' is short and truly sweet:
``We're getting married because we're in love.'' But the
48-year-old hairdresser conceded that she was happy to get a
supportive thumbs up from family members who have met Anderson in
the year-plus since he moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nothing like my first husband,'' she announced proudly.
He was even a good sport about putting up with all the anger she
carried after the collapse of her 25-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, an English journalist, grinned and held on all the
while she talked about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe life should be fun, and we have an awful lot of
fun,'' he said. Enough fun to urge him toward his first marriage at
the age of 49.
</P>
<P>
   They both expressed confidence in their ability to sort through
potential problems and agree on reasonable expectations, although
they stumbled briefly when Houck brought up money management. (It
doesn't matter so much how finances are handled as that both
partners agree on how much they can spend and who is responsible
for paying the bills.)
</P>
<P>
   Houck cautioned that confidence has limits. Just over half of
all marriages end in divorce, and the rate for second marriages is
even higher. The differences between men and women are almost
always greater than they seem, and compatibility while living
together before marriage predicts nothing.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the marriage fails despite all best efforts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce isn't failure,'' Houck said, noting that Edison made
hundreds of light bulbs before he got one to work properly.

 &HT;    Ohio residents left something of value
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Arlo Dean Harris spent hours at the Montgomery
County Historical Society researching his family's genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   But the legacy he wanted to leave extended beyond his own
family's roots. He wanted to leave a treasure for the city of
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great interest in history and a real passion for
coins,'' said Brian Hackett, director of the society. ``He was
unassuming, quiet and polite, and we always helped him as we could.
Little did we know the tremendous impact he would eventually have
on us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon his death in 1997, Harris bequeathed to the society a coin
collection and other gifts whose worth likely will be measured in
six figures.
</P>
<P>
   A retired chemistry professor from California State University
in San Bernadino, Calif., Harris returned to his hometown of Dayton
and settled in Belmont some years ago to finish out his life,
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Harris had cancer, and it was a lingering type of cancer,
and he spent the last few months of his life buying objects for a
coin collection that he knew he would not live to enjoy,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was apparently a man of limited means, but he spent his
life savings building this collection with the intention of giving
it to the historical society and the people of the city of Dayton
as an investment in tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   In his final days, Harris, who was 65 when he died Nov. 27,1997,
purchased at least two of his rarest coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the coins he purchased nine days before he died,''
Hackett said. ``His attorney got a notice after his funeral that he
had bought and paid for the $25,000 coin and they wanted to know
where to ship it.'' It now is in the possession of the historical
society, along with a large collection of historical coins and
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The single most important piece he left to the society and the
city is a rare $4 gold coin called a ``stella'' which was minted in
1879. There is a star (stella) on the back and a ``Lady Liberty''
with flowing hair on the front. According to Hackett, there were
only 400 of the coins released, and collectors only know of 12
still in existence in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are told our ``stella'' is ranked best of the 12,'' Hackett
said. ``Mr. Harris paid about $45,000 for it, but when we looked it
up in the books, it could sell for as much as $70,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary L. Oliver, curator of collections and history for the
historical society, pulled the prized items out of the vault at
Bank One in the Kettering Tower Monday afternoon for inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually have some idea when a gift is in the works,'' she
said as she sorted through the items. ``But no one saw this coming.
We will be pleased to allow the public to get a look at this
marvelous collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The coins and currency will be on public display Feb. 22-26 in
the lobby of the Kettering Tower, under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
   Harris did put a condition on his gift: that the historical
society not sell any of the coins for at least 20 years. ``I think
he knew how much the value would escalate for these items in 20
years,'' Oliver said. ``This really is a generous and kind and
thoughtful gift for the people of Dayton.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the gift to the historical society of coins and
postage stamps, Harris left some Faberge eggs to the Boonshoft
Museum of Natural History and a book collection to the University
of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County Historical Society will honor Harris at
the annual fund-raising gala Feb. 20 in the Kettering Tower Lobby.
They are calling it ``Stella by Starlight,'' an evening when the
stella will be on display with the other rare coins.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the family history that Harris wrote, he concluded
with these words: ``What you do today. . . will directly affect the
course of the future. Spend your time well today.'

 &HT;    Growers consumed with world of orchids
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paul Pfenninger has it bad _ a
full-blown, delirious case of orchid fever.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 4,000 of the exotic flowering plants engulf the deep yard
behind his Boynton Beach home. Hundreds hang in rows across his
screened-in pool, their spikes of pink, yellow and purple blossoms
peeking out from roots that stream to the floor like Spanish moss.
Orchids grow on every tree, cover most of the ground, and stuff a
garage-sized ``shadehouse'' rigged with indoor sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   Pfenninger, a retired insurance agency owner, spends all day
every day grooming his prized plants, hunting for long-awaited
buds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try that one _ it's fragrant!'' he says. True, the scent is
delicious.
</P>
<P>
   But just what is it that triggers such obsession for orchids?
What makes growing them not just a hobby, but an entry into a
quirky community of thousands of local orchid devotees _ a group
that inspired the new book, The Orchid Thief? What prompts the
passion that makes the self-avowed ``orchid people'' spend
thousands on trips to Guatamala, Madagascar or Polynesia to buy
rare hybrids or catch a glimpse of orchids in the wild?
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing orchids is almost like a disease,'' Pfenninger says,
tickled. ``You just can't get enough. There is nothing in the world
as beautiful as an orchid bloom.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as rewarding to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Hang or pot one of these otherwise grotesque plants, study it,
nurture it for months, and one day _ shazam! _ it shoots up a
strand of exquisitely colorful flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he discovers something he's hot to share with orchid
friends. He points to a gray, squid-like plant lashed to the south
side of a coconut tree. A swollen green flower bud looks ready to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mt. Hood Mary,'' he declares proudly. ``If you talk to people,
they'll say cattleyas like this won't grow in full sun. But they
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``This proves it.''
</P>
<P>
   `Orchid people'
</P>
<P>
   South Florida is the orchid-growing capital of the United
States. A core of hobbyists support at least eight flourishing
orchid societies in Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties, and
the American Orchid Society is based in West Palm Beach.
Greenhouses and propagation labs are big business, with potted
tropical plants _ including orchids _ forming a $400-million-a-year
industry in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   There are even orchid-sitters here _ professionals who board and
care for snowbirds' precious flowers when they move north for the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Orchid Thief looks quizzically a t this subculture, zeroing
in on its zealots and a few oddball plant thieves. Author Susan
Orlean slogged through swamps in search of Florida's wild and rare
Ghost Orchid. Like the plants themselves, she says, orchid people
are ``hothouse flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Harvey Fountain, president of the Tropical Orchid
Society, cries foul. Every community has its deviants, he says. But
they're always the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We draw a lot of opinionated people, but few negative
people,'' Fountain says. ``Orchid people have a camaraderie that no
other plant people or society have.''
</P>
<P>
   The genius of Belle Glade
</P>
<P>
   No one embodies orchid hospitality like Milton Carpenter of
Belle Glade.
</P>
<P>
   A lanky Glades native, Carpenter has traveled the world and has
``orchid friends'' everywhere. He takes them on tours of town and
welcomes them into his stately house, not far from the country
roads where sugar trucks haul cane from smokey fields.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pfenninger's jungle-like displays, Carpenter's greenhouse
is spacious and tidy, almost gentile, with raked gravel and
perfectly kept pots of flowering orchids.
</P>
<P>
   He is deeply Christian and tries _ no, insists on _ finding
``the positive'' in a flawed world. And therein lies his
fascination with the flower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely mind-boggling how The Creator has blessed us
with all these different types of orchids,'' he says, smiling
peacefully at a spike of mottled orange flowers. ``There's always
an orchid that's new or different or unusual to pique your
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Roses? There are just so many varieties out there,'' says
Carpenter, 69, who runs a family insurance business but sells
orchids, too, to keep his collection manageable. ``I like to think
of orchids as God's greatest achievement in the plant world.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter is regarded as one of the best orchid growers in the
world, and he's now president of the American Orchid Society. But
he's no snob.
</P>
<P>
   Over a lunch of fried okra and pork chops, Carpenter
matter-of-factly tells how he and Fountain ``saved the orchids''
after Hurricane Andrew. A couple of major greenhouses were
destroyed in Dade County, he says, the orchids scattered across the
ground. So they rented trucks, picked up thousands of the plants
and sheltered them in an abandoned greenhouse outside Belle Glade.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter started growing orchids 38 years ago when he bought a
single plant for his wife, Nancy, after she gave birth to their
daughter. Soon, all the windowsills in their house were covered
with orchids.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he has hybrids named for members of his family, including
the ``Peggy Ruth Carpenter,'' after his daughter. This week he's
lecturing in San Francisco, taking a break from Everglades Orchids,
his backyard business.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have immediate entree into people's homes all over the
world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he's been cultivating hybrid orchids that can tolerate
extreme South Florida heat. He pollinates attractive flowers from
cold regions of the world with pollen from heat-tolerant orchids.
He waits, then collects the seed pods.
</P>
<P>
   What comes next takes extraordinary patience and a strong dose
of faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild, each orchid pod produces millions of tiny seeds,
like a powder. The pod opens, the powder scatters, and maybe one or
two of the drifting seeds will land somewhere _ usually on a tree
trunk _ that has just the right mix of moisture, air, temperature,
fungus and light.
</P>
<P>
   Lab technicians, not wind, will plant Carpenters' seeds. But it
takes five or six years for a hybrid orchid to grow from a sprout
in a test tube to a mature plant. Six years from the moment of
pollination to the moment you get to see what the blossoms look
like.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter has been rewarded many times over.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls dropping in on a Vanilla plantation in Tahiti (the
vanilla vine is the only orchid grown for agriculture) a few years
ago. The owner, whom he'd never met, took him to his personal
greenhouse. There, Carpenter noticed what appeared to be a
cold-weather orchid growing in the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `How can that be?' He said, `Oh, those are yours. I
got them from a guy in New Zealand who bought them from you a few
years back.''
</P>
<P>
   No big deal?
</P>
<P>
   Orchid growers like to say that caring for them is easy. ``They
thrive on neglect,'' they say, over and over. Yet the same folks
will go on for hours, rattling off scientific names, pondering the
history of this or that hybrid and advocating whichever potting
medium, moisture level or nutrients they think necessary for the
perfect blossom.
</P>
<P>
   John Opel has cultivated the flowers since he moved to Florida
from St. Louis in 1960. He and his wife, Alberta, run a garden
center west of Boynton Beach. Their most beloved genus: the
cattleya. ``It's the classic corsage flower,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Opel, like other orchid fanciers, downplays his passion. Or
deflects it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hibiscus society,'' he says, ``now that's a pretty rabid
crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   But orchids can begin to consume their time and thoughts,
growers say, making them especially popular among retirees with
lots of time.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Pfenninger, 74. He's lived alone with
few demands on his time since the divorce a few years ago. And he's
a prime example of how quickly orchid fever can rise if left
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Gordon Dillon,'' he says, pointing to a rich,
grayish-purple orchid hanging over his swimming pool. ``That's a
beautiful orchid, nearly perfect shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfenninger does have other interests _ butterflies, crafting
furniture from exotic woods. But he admits, they're just not
orchids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody else likes or what anybody else
does,'' Pfenninger says. ``I just like what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   And with his world full of orchids, Pfenninger never wonders
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Five tips from master grower Milton Carpenter:
</P>
<P>
   1. Buy an orchid in bloom. There are nearly 130,000 types of
orchids, so you should know whether you like the color and whether
it can bloom in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   2. Do your homework. Read up on orchids, join a club, or at the
very least, follow any directions that come with your plant. The
goal is to match the orchid's growing conditions almost exactly to
its natural environment.
</P>
<P>
   3. Go light on the food. Check with your garden center on what
to feed orchids, and feed it sparingly every few months.
</P>
<P>
   4. Use pure water, and go easy. In nature, orchids are ``air
plants'' that catch rain or mist that drifts their way. Use
purified water or try collecting rain.
</P>
<P>
   5. Never, ever plant in dirt. Except for a few ground-growing
orchids, most will rot and die in soil. Pot them in a crumbly,
well-drained mix such as packaging peanuts covered with dried moss.
Or grow them in a special, hanging ``air'' basket.

   KABAT-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ We all know how a certain scent can
conjure up a cornucopia of memories. The aroma of Avon face cream
always does it for me. Immediately, I'm 6 years old again, cuddled
up by my grandmother, listening to her bedtime stories on a
sleepover at her house. Certain places also can send us catapulting
through time and space on a wild, emotional ride of recollections.

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Much gets said about the revenue
potential of sporting venues, but that's a bake-sale charade. Even

empty seats gleaming in the sun. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald)

   COXNET-WHEELS 0129 _ A reminder really shouldn't be necessary,
but all the attention and praise being given the new Beetle seem to
warrant one: Volkswagen is still importing, and quite frequently
selling, the Jetta sedan. Fact is, the Jetta is the best-selling
Volkswagen in North America with 1998 sales totaling about 90,000,
prompting VW execs to call the Mexican-built car the leader here
among German sedans and the only six-cylinder European car
available for under $20,000. (DeVault, Atlanta

   ORCHIDS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Paul Pfenninger has it bad _ a
full-blown, delirious case of orchid fever. Nearly 4,000 of the
exotic flowering plants engulf the deep yard behind his Boynton
Beach, Fla. home. Hundreds hang in rows across his screened-in
pool, their spikes of pink, yellow and purple blossoms peeking out
from roots that stream to the floor like Spanish moss. Orchids grow
on every tree, cover most of the ground, and stuff a garage-sized
``shadehouse'' rigged with indoor sprinklers. Pfenninger, a retired
insurance agency owner, spends all day every day grooming his
prized plants, hunting for long-awaited buds. But just what is it
that triggers such obsession for orchids? What makes growing them
not just a hobby, but an entry into a quirky community of thousands
of local orchid devotees _ a group that inspired the new book, The
Orchid Thief? What prompts the passion that makes the self-avowed
``orchid people'' spend thousands on trips to Guatamala, Madagascar
or Polynesia to buy rare hybrids or catch a glimpse of orchids in
the wild? (Reed, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HEART-CANDY _ For a few weeks every year, the NECCO (New England
Confectionery Co.) churns out millions of chalky, pastel
heart-shaped lumps of candy stamped with Valentine-themed words and
sayings. The official name is even a mouthful: Sweethearts brand
Conversation Hearts. And each year, in addition to longtime
favorites such as ``Be Mine,'' ``My Man,'' ``Sweet Talk'' and
``Kiss Me,'' the company adds what it considers trendy or thematic
phrases. (Thomas, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MARRIAGE-CLASS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What can you learn in
four hours? Forget quantum mechanics. Same for sheep cloning and
laparoscopic surgery. It takes some of us that long just to find
the on-off button on a new camcorder. And that's relatively easy
stuff, all reducible to math and diagrams. Who could expect you to
learn something that stumps half the people who devote much of
their lives to trying: How to stay married? Well, your state
government thinks you can. Starting this year, a four-hour marriage
course before they take the plunge gets Florida residents a $32.50
discount on a marriage license. (You can skip the class and just
pay the full $88.50.) (Kalajian, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   OHIO-COINS _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Arlo Dean Harris spent hours at the
Montgomery County Historical Society researching his family's
genealogy. But the legacy he wanted to leave extended beyond his
own family's roots. He wanted to leave a treasure for the city of
Dayton. ``He had a great interest in history and a real passion for
coins,'' said Brian Hackett, director of the society. ``He was
unassuming, quiet and polite, and we always helped him as we could.
Little did we know the tremendous impact he would eventually have
on us all.'' Upon his death in 1997, Harris bequeathed to the
society a coin collection and other gifts whose worth likely will
be measured in six figures. (Huffman, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   CANCER-FATIGUE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Jean Powell could not understand
why she was so tired. She figured the radiation treatments for her
breast cancer would sap some of her strength, but this? She was
only 32, and it was getting to be a productive day if she made
dinner for her kids and husband. ``I wasn't working, so I thought I
should have plenty of energy,'' Powell says now, 5 years later. ``I
was used to getting things done in a day's time, and I couldn't get
anything done. I was too tired to think clearly.'' Like most cancer
patients, Powell suffered silently with her profound fatigue. This
must be part of cancer, she decided. It certainly wasn't something
to bother her doctor with. ``My primary goal was to be alive,'' she
says, and if making that possible meant she couldn't make the bed
or dust the bookshelves, that was a trade she happily made.
Debilitating fatigue affects roughly four of every five cancer
patients undergoing radiation or chemotherapy, but it is generally
overlooked and undertreated. ``It is one of the least understood
symptoms of cancer,'' says Dr. Russell Portenoy, a pain specialist
at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. (Lamb, Dayton Daily
News) MOVED.

 &HT;    You, too, can create your own charity
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Feeling tired and a little bit guilty about all those
appeals for charitable causes?
</P>
<P>
   Now you can set up your own charity. You can name it after
yourself, take the tax deductions right now for your contributions
and decide at leisure just where you want to send your donations.
</P>
<P>
   You can use it as a tool to get your kids involved in good
works, and you can leave it for them to manage after you're gone _
a sort of immortality on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit: Someone else will handle all the paperwork,
including tax reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Until recent years, foundations were expensive to set up and
administer. They didn't make sense unless you had a lot of money to
give away. Say, six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   But now there are two ways to set up your own charity for as
little as $5,000 to start. One is to set up a donor-advised fund
through an umbrella group such as the Community Foundation for
Greater Atlanta. The other is to open a charitable account with a
private financial institution. The best known are those that invest
in Vanguard or Fidelity mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   There are some limitations to be aware of. For one, your
contribution is irrevocable. You can't get the money back 10 years
from now, no matter how badly you may need it.
</P>
<P>
   You also give up some control. You may have some choices about
how your money is invested, but those choices will be quite
limited. You can designate those whom you want to receive your
grants, but technically the control rests with the community
foundation or mutual fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Still, private foundations are increasingly popular. Fidelity
has brought in more than $1.6 billion in assets since it created
its Charitable Gift Fund in 1991. The Atlanta community foundation
manages more than $300 million. It has 450 accounts, 86 of which
were established in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of younger donors, some in their mid-30s,
who give very large gifts,'' said Andrea Montag, who works with
donor-advised funds for the community foundation. ``We are also
seeing people who want to get their kids involved. They're saying,
`How can we teach them our values?'''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some details on the alternatives:
</P>
<P>
   _ Community foundations. The greater Atlanta organization is the
largest of about a dozen scattered around Georgia. We'll use it as
an example of an umbrella group.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta foundation will open an account for $5,000, assuming
the donor pledges to raise that amount to $50,000 within five
years. The money is invested by the community foundation or its
agents. About two-thirds goes into stocks and the remainder into
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Montag said the community foundation has turned down the grant
requests of only two account holders in 50 years. Both involved
organizations going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Private organizations. The Vanguard Charitable Endowment
Program requires a minimum of $25,000 to open an account. Donors
can pick among three investment pools, from conservative to
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard expenses are, in all likelihood, the lowest available.
The annual fees total about 0.7 percent. For more information, call
1-888-383-4483.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's Charitable Gift Fund has a minimum of $10,000. There
are three investment pools to choose from. Call 1-800-682-4438.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably a bad idea to try beating the system. Lots of
people have already tried self-serving maneuvers that can best be
described _ stripped of all the technicalities _ as shabby stunts.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite, reported last year in The Wall Street
Journal, is the man who donated more than $50,000 to studies that
would benefit the lobster industry. The donor was the owner of a
restaurant, fishing boats and direct-mail business dealing in
lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service has sniffed over the mutual
fund-related foundations. The result was somewhat tightened
controls over the grants that outfits like Fidelity will approve.
Perhaps you could still get away with some self-interested
activities. But why tempt fate, much less the IRS?
</P>
<P>
   The main limitation is grants must go to IRS-approved charitable
organizations, known as 501(c)3 charities.
</P>
<P>
   That eliminates, among many other things, any chance of using a
grant to pay for your kids' college education. It's unlikely the
IRS would recognize Junior as a 501(c)3 charity.

   SEATTLE _ The Hearst Corp. and the Seattle Times Co. announced
Tuesday that they have agreed to amend their joint operating
agreement to permit the Seattle Times to switch from the afternoon
newspaper field and join Hearst's Post-Intelligencer in the morning
field.
</P>
<P>
   The amended agreement also includes a 50-year extension of the
joint operating agreement (JOA) to Dec. 31, 2083, and provides an
increase in the Post-Intelligencer's economic participation from
the current 32 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other agreements enable the P-I to expand its Internet web site
and provide Hearst with the right-of-first purchase of the Seattle
Times if its owners decide to sell the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real winners in this new arrangement are Seattle-area
newspaper readers,'' said J.D. Alexander, editor and publisher of
the P-I. ``The extension of the agreement combined with the move of
the Times to the morning publication cycle mean that Seattle
readers can count on two strong, independent editorial voices far
into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said he expects the P-I's news staff to thrive on the
direct competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that it was the quality of the
journalism in the P-I, not our publishing cycle, that enabled us to
compete vigorously and successfully in the Seattle market.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the significant additional resources the amendment to the
JOA brings to our newspaper, we anticipate raising our newspaper's
journalistic quality to still higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   The JOA in effect since 1983 had been due to expire in 2033.
Under that agreement, the Seattle Times, which has circulated in
the evening Monday through Friday, was responsible for advertising,
circulation, promotion and production of the newspapers. This
remains unchanged under the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The news and editorial operations of the two newspapers have
been separate and competitive and will remain so under the new
agreement. The P-I produces an editorial and opinion section for
the combined Sunday edition and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The amended JOA provides for a two-year transition to morning
publication by the Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sustain our success and future growth, it isn't feasible
for the Seattle Times to continue publishing an afternoon paper,''
said Mason Sizemore, president and chief operating officer of the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement noted that the growth in highway congestion in
the Seattle area makes afternoon delivery of the Times increasingly
difficult. That problem had led Times officials to consider
building additional printing plants around the region, an option no
longer needed in view of its switch to the morning cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Existing printing facilities can handle both newspapers in the
morning cycle, as it does now on Saturdays and holidays, according
to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The new JOA also clears the way for the P-I to expand in
electronic publishing, backed by Hearst's extensive experience in
Internet technologies. The newspapers's website, P-I Plus at
www.seattle-pi.com, will be expanded immediately to include each
day's news and editorial report.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Intelligencer is one of 12 daily newspapers published
by The Hearst Corporation.

   GENEOLOGY-INTERNET (San Francisco) _ Climbing the family tree
will take a lot less clawing soon, as soon as a non-profit
foundation finishes a more than $15 million project to post Ellis

afford to become dehydrated with her busy schedule of up to three
classes a day, even it means frequent bathroom trips.The bottom
line of any healthy diet should be water. Unlike food that can be

   GOSPEL-GRAMMYS (San Francisco) _ The road to gospel Grammydom
can be curious indeed. Consider Deniece Williams' career over more
than two decades. For all her rock 'n' roll hits _ solo and with
Johnny Mathis _ Williams had been a Grammy bridesmaid 10 times, but
never a bride. A few years ago, she took a gamble and crossed over
to gospel. The result: three Grammy nominations and three wins. Now
she's after her fourth. By CORRIE M. ANDERS.

   BOOKS-REVIEW-MYSTERIES (Undated) _ ``Basilica,'' by William D.
Montalbano, is a tale of Vatican intrigue, murder, sins of the past

   SPORTS-ADVICE (San Francisco) _ DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: Do you think
that a man who is charged with soliciting business from a
prostitute should be allowed to start at safety in the Super Bowl?
_ Kenny in Washington, D.C. DEAR KENNY: Of course not. Hugh Grant
is too slow to play safety in the Super Bowl. He tore an ACL in a

armies already in the field, and more to come. I don't know about
you, but that terrifies me more than terrorism does. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ There's no doubt that the 14
percent of Americans who are poor live much more comfortably than
poor people elsewhere. Don't think, though, that poverty is all
laughs and lolling around. In general, poor people would rather
have jobs and pay their bills without grudging charity from the
rest of us. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   CIVIC-PUNISHMENT (El Cerrito, Calif.) _ Civic leaders in Palo
Alto and Menlo Park began to distribute photos of ``known problem
drinkers'' so liquor stores wouldn't sell to them. They suspended
the program not because of its implications for civil liberties,
but because some of the photos they posted turned out to be of
ordinary citizens with no known drinking problems. What a fabulous
concept: para-punishment. By BOB WIEDER.

FIGHT FOR BRAGGING RIGHTS OVER THE END OF LEWIS AND CLARK'S
JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC COUNTY, Wash. _ The story begins at The End.
</P>
<P>
   It involves a river, two states, dissenting scholars, a
mysterious map, an amateur historian obsessed with the truth and a
daring expedition that has excited the American imagination for
almost 200 years.
</P>
<P>
   It is a story about pride _ ``bragging rights,'' one Northwest
scholar calls it.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a story fueled by a seemingly simple question:
</P>
<P>
   Where did 19th-century explorers Meriwether Lewis and William
Clark complete their westward journey?
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, the easy answer has been Oregon, where
Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery wintered at Fort Clatsop, near
modern-day Astoria, Ore., in 1805-6.
</P>
<P>
   That answer is too easy, say a growing number of Washington
state historians.
</P>
<P>
   The End, they say, is not in Oregon. It is here, in rain-swept
Pacific County, on the northern banks of the Lower Columbia River _
Washington's banks _ buried under a two-lane section of Highway 101
near the Astoria Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the predominant group of scholars in the
Lewis and Clark field was Oregonians, and they convinced everybody
that the end of the trail was Fort Clatsop _ which is not true at
all,'' says Gonzaga University history professor Bob Carriker, a
respected Lewis and Clark scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historians like nothing so much as to copy from one another,''
he adds. ``Once they put something like that down, it shows up time
and time again in other people's books.''
</P>
<P>
   Power players in Washington, D.C., have joined state historians
in pounding the drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that Washington state was the end of the trip.
This is where Lewis and Clark hit the Pacific Ocean and that was
the whole purpose of the expedition,'' says Rep. Norm Dicks,
D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks is the ranking Democratic member of the Interior
Appropriations Subcommittee that will determine funding for the
approaching Lewis and Clark bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   That funding could help to revitalize this economically
depressed county, where major tourist attractions include go-carts,
bumper cars, kite shops, saltwater taffy shops and Jake the
Alligator Man at Marsh's Free Museum of curiosities.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the claims, and what is at stake, it is necessary
to travel back in time, to a glorious, messy, soaked-to-the-bone
chapter in Washington state history that has been swept aside like
so much surf-tossed flotsam and jetsam.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1805, the month was November, the place was the
mouth of the Columbia River, where fresh water meets saltwater in a
ferocious clash of wills.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis and Clark expedition was camped along the north side
of the river, in unorganized territory that would become the state
of Washington. They were, in the unedited words of Clark, finally
within sight of the ``great Pacific Octean which we been So long
anxious to See.''
</P>
<P>
   His joy was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Black clouds rolled out of the southwest, bringing lightning,
thunder, hail, high winds and violent rains. After traveling more
than 4,100 miles on orders of President Thomas Jefferson to find a
direct water route to the Pacific, the 33 members of the Corps of
Discovery huddled in misery.
</P>
<P>
   They were hungry and disagreeable. Bedding was soaked, meager
rations were spoiling.
</P>
<P>
   The river mouth _ which would become known as the Graveyard of
the Pacific for the ships it would chew up and spit out _ rose up
in angry white peaks.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the expedition's heavy dugout canoes tossed like toy
boats among immense driftwood logs. By day, the crew moved from
site to site along the river's northern banks, looking for safe
shelter just east of Point Ellice, or ``Point Distress,'' as Clark
dubbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be distressing to a feeling person to See our
Situation ...,'' Clark wrote in his journal for Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   When at last the expedition rounded Point Ellice, where the
Astoria Bridge now crosses to Oregon, they set up camp on a
``butifull Sand beech'' in full view of the great Pacific. Lewis
and Clark would later refer to the site as ``Station Camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrote Clark: ``... this I could plainly See would be the extent
of our journey by water ...''
</P>
<P>
   From Nov. 15 to 25, the leaders, their men, the young Shoshone
interpreter Sacajawea and her child remained at Station Camp.
</P>
<P>
   In their journals crewmembers noted the significance of the
locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now at the end of our voyage, which has been completely
accomplished according to the intention of the expedition, the
object of which was to discover a passage by way of the Missouri
and Columbia rivers to the Pacific ocean; notwithstanding the
difficulties, privations and dangers, which we had to encounter,
endure and surmount,'' wrote Sgt. Patrick Gass, a carpenter of
Irish stock from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 days the Corps of Discovery used Station Camp as a base
for explorations. These included Clark's difficult overland trek
west to Cape Disappointment, where Fort Canby State Park and the
small, state-funded Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center now stand.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Clark and his small party headed nine miles up the
shoreline, to where the city of Long Beach is now situated, and
Clark carved his name in a pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   Had Clark then returned to camp, packed up and headed back
upriver with the expedition _ as originally planned _ there would
be no question on which side of the Columbia the famous trail
ended.
</P>
<P>
   But what happened next forever muddied the waters of history.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what Lewis and Clark expected when they arrived at the
Pacific? Journals indicate they hoped to find a trader's ship
loaded with supplies and delicacies from the civilization they'd
left behind _ a civilization whose boundaries still extended no
father west than the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no ship. There were no delicacies. And there was
very little game to survive on.
</P>
<P>
   Leather clothing was rotting on the men's lean frames. The crew,
fed up with dried fish, was hungry for red meat. After a group of
Clatsop Indians visited their north-shore campsite, telling of
abundant elk on the south side of the river, Lewis and Clark polled
the expedition about where to camp for the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Among those voting was York, a black slave, and young Sacajawea.
This was more than 50 years before black males would get the vote
in America, more than 100 before either Indians or women had the
right. ``It may have marked the first democratic election in U.S.
history,'' says Washington State Historical Society director David
Nicandri.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was to cross the river. After preliminary scouting,
the expedition set out, landing at a swampy inlet in what is now
Youngs Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied that the site offered game, protection from severe
ocean winds, and access to beaches where the men could process
salt, the expedition built a winter camp christened Fort Clatsop, a
fort that has been handsomely replicated by the National Parks
Service.
</P>
<P>
   This, history books have told us, is the logical end to Lewis
and Clark's westward journey _ this 50-foot-square log stockade
where the expedition holed up for almost four gray months, mending
moccasins, writing in their journals and undergoing fits of
boredom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably didn't think they were through with their
journey until they settled in for the winter here,'' says Chet
Orloff, executive director of the Oregon State Historical Society.
``While on the north side, they were always on the move, always
looking for where to end up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Oregonians place The End even farther south. The beach
communities of Seaside, where the Corps set up its salt works, and
Cannon Beach, where Lewis and Clark scouted a beached whale, have
both claimed honors as Trail's End.
</P>
<P>
   But the director of the Washington State Historical Society has
an altogether different take.
</P>
<P>
   The End, says Nicandri, is here, in southwestern Washington,
where Lewis and Clark spent 18 arduous days fact-finding, taking
notes, recording data and struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington history of Lewis and Clark has been
overshadowed by an ordinary winter encampment on the Oregon side,''
says Nicandri. ``The fact of the matter is, the operative phase of
exploration on the Lower Columbia played out from the Washington
side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the story, and the true ending of the quest to reach
the Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicandri describes the Oregon-Washington debate as a
``friendly'' one. And, like Orloff and Cindy Orlando,
superintendent of Fort Clatsop National Memorial, he stresses the
importance of historical collaboration between the states.
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants to ensure Washington gets its due.
</P>
<P>
   And if that means stealing a bit of Oregon's historical thunder,
so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wants to create a feud or diminish the importance of
Fort Clatsop,'' Nicandri says, ``but the state of Washington needs
to do a much better job telling its story on this side of the
river.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more blunt is the dogged amateur historian who stirred up
the tempest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question,'' says Rex Ziak, ``that the state of
Washington possesses the single most significant site of the entire
Lewis and Clark expedition.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex Ziak is a free-lance cinematographer/photographer by trade.
He lives in his native Pacific County town of Naselle, 11 miles
from the Astoria Bridge. He is the kind of man who relaxes by
reading old encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   Ziak, 45, is admittedly zealous about history, and doubly so
when it comes to Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important to honor great men,'' he says. ``This
was a remarkable achievement, and this is a great terminus _ and it
is still unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Like increasing numbers of American history buffs, Ziak
(pronounced ZEEK) devoured the Lewis and Clark journals, reading
the 1814 Nicholas Biddle edition, the 1893 Elliott Coues edition,
the 1905 Reuben Gold Thwaites edition, and eventually plunging into
Gary Moulton's definitive multivolume set, first published in 1983
by the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Ziak made copies of the journals and, over the course of six wet
winters, took them to the banks of the Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He used surveying equipment and his own detailed knowledge of
the craggy landscape to pinpoint the campsites described by the
explorers _ campsites that, to his amazement, have remained largely
unmarked and unexplored for nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Official publications like the National Parks Service map of the
Lewis and Clark Trail skip right over them, jumping from campsites
in Oregon to the Fort Canby locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 18 days here have been amputated from history,'' says
Ziak. ``How could this have been overlooked?''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his research, Ziak puzzled over a map that
Clark had drawn of the river's edge. The map shows four dotted
lines _ each a carefully calculated compass reading aligned to a
specific landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The four lines meet at a single point on the Columbia's north
banks. The point marks the site Lewis and Clark called Station
Camp, also referred to by historians as the McGowan Site, after its
pioneer settler P.J. McGowan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking myself, `Why did Lewis and Clark think this
particular place was so important?''' says Ziak. ``It was the only
one of Clark's maps with a campsite marked so precisely.''
</P>
<P>
   He deduced that Clark, an exacting surveyor, was permanently
marking the site, marking it as the official end of the Corps of
Discovery journey. The explorer, Ziak says, was providing a guide
that would allow future generations of Americans to someday
relocate this critical historic location.
</P>
<P>
   Ziak's reasoning impressed professional mapmaker Martin
Plumondond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have researched backs up everything Ziak has
said. He has a heck of a good argument,'' says Plumondond, a
cartographer based in Vancouver, Wash., who is mapping the entire
length of the Lewis and Clark Trail.
</P>
<P>
   Ziak published his findings in local newspapers and sent copies
of his arguments to historians around the state.
</P>
<P>
   One was Gonzaga professor Carriker. He had heard
end-of-the-trail arguments before. Until Ziak began circulating his
findings, however, no one paid much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had always deferred to the Oregonians,'' says Carriker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They overpowered us. They had more money, they were more
active in Lewis and Clark history. We did not have a strong sense
of our own history.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he says, has all changed. And Ziak's timing couldn't be
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rex came up with the courage to publish these things, and now
a lot of people are talking about them,'' says Carriker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the evidence in spades.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does a journey end? Who determines it? The arguments can
be difficult and arcane, as murky as a coastal fog slinking through
an ancient rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Lewis and Clark scholar Gary Moulton, for one,
attaches little importance to the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this is not an overwhelming issue,'' says the
University of Nebraska history professor, who will be in residence
at Fort Clatsop this summer condensing the explorers' journals into
a one-volume edition. ``It is one of those things that captures
local imaginations and interest, but it's not necessarily a large
historical point.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Ambrose, author of the best-selling Lewis and Clark book
``Undaunted Courage,'' has no doubt that Washington marks the
westernmost reach of the journey. But is it The End?
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't go out there expecting it was going to be the end
of anything,'' he says. ``They had a hope they could hop on a ship,
but there was no ship. To communicate what they found, they had to
go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Lewis and Clark expedition ended in Washington,
D.C., when Lewis got back and delivered his report to the
commander-in-chief.''
</P>
<P>
   However elusive the debate, both Ambrose and Moulton point out
that the same argument simmers at the opposite end of the Lewis and
Clark Trail. There, cities like Louisville, Monticello, Pittsburgh
and Washington, D.C., all vie for status as The Beginning of the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   Ziak understands this human fascination with beginnings and
ends. ``People,'' he says, ``want to stand on the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes he has identified that historic finish line. What he
finds hard to believe is its obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an inadequacy!'' he declares, as he passionately sweeps
his arm across a turnout next to busy Highway 101, just west of the
Astoria Bridge. The turnout, some 500 yards upriver from the tiny
1904 McGowan Church, commemorates the campsite on Clark's
mysterious map. The actual site is buried under pavement nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This small roadside attraction consists of a simple wooden sign
and a crude, weathered sculpture of Lewis and Clark. There is no
grand gateway declaring this The End and there are no brochures,
displays, maps or drawings to describe the 18 days the Corps of
Discovery spent along this river bank.
</P>
<P>
   Ziak, who sits on the Washington State Lewis and Clark Trail
Committee and gives regular lectures and tours on the explorers,
has a plan to change that.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Lewis and Clark bicentennial nears, his vision is
taking root.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colloquially, we call it `The Rex Ziak Plan,''' says Nicandri.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes a 30-mile interpretive trail that traces the
explorers' forgotten footsteps in westernmost Washington, with 21
markers placed at 15 different sites, each with in-depth
interpretation and descriptions in Lewis and Clark's own words.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key sites along the proposed trail is the Station
Camp locale _ Washington's ``end of the trial.'' Here, plans
include a large kiosk or open-air shelter with extensive
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   The most radical element in the plan is a proposal to reroute
Highway 101 away from the Station Camp site, and establish a large
waterfront park overlooking the Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Nicandri, who serves as president of the National Lewis and
Clark Bicentennial Council, has included Ziak's proposals in the
state's official tourism plan for the bicentennial.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents in Washington, D.C., are also exploring some of the
ideas. ``It's an issue of historical accuracy,'' says Rep. Dicks'
spokesman, George Behan.
</P>
<P>
   Such plans have a sunny effect on movers and shakers in hard-hit
Pacific County, where annual rainfall can exceed 10 feet and where
third-generation loggers and fishermen regularly line up for
unemployment checks, unable to follow the footsteps of their
fathers and fathers' fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have a definite impact on us economically,'' says
Nabiel Shawa, city manager of Long Beach, the westernmost point of
Clark's explorations.
</P>
<P>
   Shawa envisions a new kind of tourism flourishing, an
``intelligent'' tourism drawing on the booming popularity of the
Lewis and Clark saga.
</P>
<P>
   The growing fascination, fed by Ambrose's ``Undaunted Courage''
and by Ken Burns' 1997 TV documentary on the expedition, has
inspired record numbers of Americans to hit the road, following the
historic trail.
</P>
<P>
   Shawa sees a time when that road will lead to this forgotten
corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a time when tourists will no longer bypass one of the
most significant chapters in Lewis and Clark history.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a time when The End will mark a new beginning for
Pacific County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than just a soggy, damp area at the end of the world,''
says the city manager, ``we will become a place where great U.S.
history occurred.''

   IF YOU GO TO CUBA . . .
</P>
<P>
   PROHIBITIONS -- Travel is prohibited for most Americans.
However, journalists, scholars, people with relatives in Cuba and
representatives of humanitarian, research and cultural groups can
apply to the U.S. Treasury Department for a travel license. Those
without a license risk a maximum criminal fine of $250,000 and a
civil fine of up to $50,000. But tens of thousands of Americans
travel to Cuba illegally each year; almost no one is threatened
with fines. Upon request, Cuban officials will not stamp your
passport.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE -- Mexicana Airlines flies to Havana from Cancun
and Mexico City. You must call Mexicana or a travel agent in Mexico
to make a reservation. Cubana Airlines flies to Havana from Nassau
in the Bahamas. You must call a travel agent in Nassau to make a
reservation. If you're traveling legally, you can take a direct
charter flight from Miami to Havana. One charter company is ABC
Charters in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   HOTELS -- Accommodations range from luxury to hotel-like. The
Riviera, the Havana Libre and the Nacional are all nice, with rooms
for US$80 and up.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY -- You must use cash only. Everyone accepts U.S. currency.
Remember to save some cash for the $20 departure tax collected at
the Havana airport.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND -- Taxis are still pretty cheap. You can get
across town for a few dollars. To go round-trip from Havana to
Varadero Golf and Country Club costs $150 to $170.
</P>
<P>
   FURTHER READING -- Lonely Planet has a well-researched guide on
Cuba. The Caribbean Islands Handbook has a good chapter on Cuba.

<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ Delightfully off-limits to most Americans, I
first visited communist Cuba in 1991 simply because I wasn't
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea what to expect. But it was like traveling into a
time warp.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Russian Lada cars rattled alongside 40-year-old
Chevrolets. Old-fashioned pharmacies displayed traditional glass
and ceramic medicine jars. Billboards of the bearded revolutionary
hero, Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, dominated the roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   Decaying pastel-colored mansions, many owned by rich Cubans who
fled to the United States after Fidel Castro took power in 1959,
dripped chips of plaster like drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   As a so-called ``forbidden zone,'' this Pennsylvania-sized
island just 90 miles off the South Florida shore was certainly
lacking -- there were few Americans and few T-shirts to buy, few
tacky souvenirs to browse, and no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, there was little to eat, even in the best
state-run restaurants, and few hotels that could -- even with a
stretch -- be labeled anything close to luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Today I travel to Cuba legally, as a journalist, with the same
awe I felt as a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's still like stepping inside a museum, Cuba today
is a very different country than the one I vacationed in nearly
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The surreal sense of entering the 1950s has given way to an
awkward commercialism, and an all-out wooing of foreign tourists
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   You still see roadside billboards praising the benefits of
Castro's socialist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But you also see billboards for Samsung electronics and
Pepsodent toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Old men still play dominoes at night by candlelight, but their
children love nothing more than catching a Sylvester Stallone movie
on state-run television. Old women still sell peanuts in paper
cones, but their children drink Coca-Cola, imported via Mexico and
other third countries, and wear belts displaying the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cuba remains a charming -- albeit sometimes disturbing
-- place to visit. Founded by Spain in 1519, the capital city of
Havana blossomed into an elegant city of wide avenues, lovely,
shaded plazas, and an enviable cultural scene. It was an
architect's dream that gently blended Spanish-style mansions with
baroque cathedrals. It's no wonder Havana has often been called the
``Paris of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Today paint is peeling from many buildings, but one glimpse at
the Gran Teatro and the Baccardi building and I'm instantly
reminded of Havana's former grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Before the revolution, Havana was the largest, most spectacular
city in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's rather run-down today, you still can savor tastes
of its glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   For $60, you can watch the legendary show at the Tropicana
open-air cabaret, as large a draw today as it was in the 1940s and
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   For much less, you can re-live the Cold War at the Museo de la
Revolucion, where former U.S. President Ronald Reagan is
caricatured as a ``cretin.''
</P>
<P>
   Even my hotel of choice, the Nacional, was a playground for
Hollywood's rich and famous in the days before communism. Built in
the 1930s by the same architects who created the famous Breakers in
Palm Beach, the hotel is a giant, twin-towered structure with a
breezy veranda that overlooks the famed seaside boulevard known as
the Malecon. The rooms go for $100 a night, and include a massive
breakfast buffet that includes Danish pastries, cheese pizza, and
watery scrambled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, I was lucky to find a single hard-boiled egg.
</P>
<P>
   From the hotel, it's an easy 10-minute drive to Old Havana, a
borough of narrow streets that's home to many of Ernest Hemingway's
old haunts.
</P>
<P>
   The pricey but exquisite El Floridita restaurant, where the
daiquiri was invented, is one. Another is the wonderfully divey La
Bodeguita del Medio, a graffiti-splashed watering hole where, by
mid-morning, it's standing-room-only. Hemingway is said to have
written ``A Farewell To Arms'' in the Ambos Mundos Hotel, which has
been renovated lavishly for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Old Havana remains the Plaza de la Catedral,
dominated by the 18-century Catedral de San Cristobal de La Habana,
where Pope John Paul II said Mass during his trip here in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent rise in tourism in Cuba, many of the sidewalks
near the plaza spill over these days with vendors selling
everything from colorful artwork to cheap mobiles fashioned from
shells.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the Havana I first encountered in 1991, when
I searched in vain for any memento of my trip.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, one thing that hasn't changed is the people, who are
as eager to talk politics today as they were in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On my first trip here, I remember swigging rum with an elderly
man named Ivan along the Malecon. He was bursting with questions
about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true that all the students are forced to carry guns in
school because of the violence?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not true, I responded, and he seemed genuinely
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Woefully, the faces of the people I meet today are lined with a
weariness I didn't see before. And they're more jaded by the sight
of foreigners, meaning they're less likely to approach me than they
were eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One woman I recently befriended laments the fact that a Cuban
doctor earns only the equivalent of $20 a month, while a taxi
driver can earn more than that in daily tips from a foreigner.
Another woman just wants Vitamin A and some cotton balls. In Cuba,
where medicines are increasingly scarce, finding an aspirin --
unless you have dollars -- is like embarking on an all-day treasure
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret this country is riddled with contradictions as it
seeks to marry the travel boom with its socialist values.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, this marriage has created a resurgence in
prostitution and also in crime on an island that's still amazingly
safe when compared to its Caribbean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans were shocked last September when two Italian tourists
were shot to death during a robbery. On Thursday(Jan. 28), Cuban
officials ordered two Cubans to go before the firing squad for the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans see tourism as a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the money it brings, but I do not like what it results
in,'' one woman says. ``Every Cuban now wants what they see all the
foreigners as having.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bottomed-out economy that forced a hesitant Castro to
embrace tourism in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Following the fall of the former Soviet Union, Cuba's main
benefactor -- which had subsidized Cuba to the tune of $6 billion a
year -- the economy came unraveled in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's nearly 12 million people entered into what Castro called
``a special period'' during which fuel, clothing, and seemingly
everything else was in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   So Castro had little choice but to allow foreign investment in
Cuba and -- most notably for Cubans themselves -- to permit Cubans
to possess and transact in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   He also allowed Cubans to dabble in capitalism by opening their
own small businesses, such as the home-based restaurants called
paladares that are now so popular with tourists in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   These reluctant but necessary actions created the desired
outcome: they gave a jolt to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But they also created a troubling social schism between those
who have access to dollars and those who don't that's reminiscent
of pre-revolution days.
</P>
<P>
   Before Castro marched triumphant into Havana on New Year's Eve
1958, Fulgencio Batista had ruled Cuba with help from American
mobsters while the likes of Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, and
Josephine Baker tossed around money like yesterday's garbage.
</P>
<P>
   These days most Cubans get around by foot or bicycle, while rich
tourists travel in sleek Mercedes taxis. They make do with monthly
rations that include six eggs a month, while tourists eat their
fill of shrimp and lobster at high-priced restaurants. They live
six families to a house, hanging their clothes out to dry on iron
balconies, while tourists stay in five-star hotels replete with
cigar bars, marble floors, and dry cleaning services.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, I'm often approached by young children begging
for nothing more than a ``pluma,'' or pen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cubans I talk to don't resent foreign visitors,
including Americans -- even though many disdain the U.S. government
-- they just want their share of the tourism pie.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the streets here have been turned into a
hodge-podge of hustlers -- who look to sell everything from women
to contraband cigars.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip I remember sitting on a park bench with a male
American friend when two scantily clad girls approached. Brazenly,
one said to him: I'll do anything for a dollar.'' I was both
floored and saddened.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban government has launched a crackdown on what it
calls ``anti-social activities.'' Over the last year, police have
yanked more than 6,700 prostitutes off the streets here. Many have
been returned to their homes on farms in the rural provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism earned this island more than $1.8 billion in revenue
last year, making it -- and not sugar -- the nation's new economic
linchpin.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the number of tourists visiting Cuba
from Italy, Canada, and other countries has doubled, to 1.4 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   This island now boasts more than 28,000 hotel rooms and is
served by 40 foreign airlines; British Airways will start service
here this spring.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 85,000 Americans visited Cuba last year, many of
them illegally. They sneak in via Mexico, Canada, or the Bahamas,
flying mostly on Mexicana or the Cuban-run Cubana Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   These Americans suffer almost no consequences, despite violating
the Trading With the Enemy Act, a 1917 prohibition that's more
ancient than the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbids Americans from spending money in a country with
which the United States has no formal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions are made for Americans in certain professions, such
as teachers, scientists, and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that the number of visitors to Cuba would
skyrocket by 5 million a year if the U.S. travel restriction
against the island was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Snow, an Austin, Texas-based fishing guide, isn't waiting.
He says no one's going to tell him where to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's visited Cuba at least 150 times since 1977, forever in
search of the world's largest bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep going because I love the warmth of the Cuban
people and because Americans should have the freedom to go where
they want,'' reasoned Snow, who's fished many of Cuba's 1,000 or so
clear-blue lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Cuba has becomethe hot travel destination for
Americans, and for others as well, and the Cuban government --
despite its rallying cry of ``Socialism or Death!'' -- is doing its
part to make sure it stays that way by pumping a virtual fortune
into the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The five-star, 281-room Golden Tulip Parque Central hotel, for
example, just opened with a $31 million investment from Cuba and
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, Castro said in a speech that he saw the
potential for another $20 billion in investment in the island's
booming tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, the Cuban government spent $8
million last year to open the Varadero Golf Club, the first 18-hole
golf course built in Cuba since the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, at least three other golf courses are
planned throughout Cuba, where baseball is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``These golf courses are all part of a big effort to improve the
product for the tourists here,'' said Roberto Garcia, the Varadero
Golf Club's director.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if Cubans are ever resentful that their government has
channeled so much money into tourism when spending on healthcare is
down by more than 70 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans look at tourism as income that can be used for things
like housing and education,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   To play the course, visitors pay $60, or three times the average
monthly salary of most Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The manicured course was enlarged from a nine-hole course on the
expropriated property of the du Pont family. A pro shop and elegant
restaurant -- where the lobster special goes for $45 -- are housed
in the family's former mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, we've had more than 100 people come here in one
day,'' Garcia said, sounding astounded at his own words.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course is located in Varadero, a city of 19,000 just a
two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 15 miles of satin-like beaches, Varadero has long
been a magnet for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   This bustling resort community boasts 38 hotels, including the
upscale Club Med, which recently opened a 500-room, canary-yellow
compound here.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent drive through Varadero, I realized with sadness that
it looked like any other Caribbean beach town, with a slew of
roadside stands selling everything from maracas to beach towels.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways I'm pleased the government's efforts to boost
tourism are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials are hopeful they'll attract 1.7 million tourists
to the island this year.
</P>
<P>
   But, secretly, I've often selfishly wished the plan to increase
tourism will fail.
</P>
<P>
   With even a Benetton store in Old Havana, commercialism seems to
have contaminated the quiet island I first visited like a virus.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll keep coming. At least there's still no McDonald's.

<P>
   HAVANA _ Enjoying Cuba's aegis, former Black Panther activist
Joanne Chesimard remains one of America's most-wanted exiles.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1973, she and two friends got into a shoot-out with state
troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike after being pulled over in
their car for a non-functioning tail-light.
</P>
<P>
   One officer died after being slammed to the ground by a flurry
of bullets, then shot twice in the head -- execution-style -- with
his own pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of first-degree murder in 1977, Chesimard broke out of
prison during a daring, daylight escape in 1979, only to surface in
communist Cuba in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard is just one of nearly 100 serious criminals who fled
the U.S. justice system and were later granted political asylum by
Castro's communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Other outlaws include rogue financier Robert Vesco, who was
indicted for illegally contributing $250,000 in cash to Richard
Nixon's 1972 presidential re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 2,000 Americans currently live in Cuba, according
to the U.S. Interests Section here, but most are children of Cubans
who were living in the United States at the time they were born.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law doesn't stop U.S. citizens from visiting or even living
in Cuba, but the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 does forbid
Americans from spending money on the island of 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a New York City television station early
last year, Chesimard said her life on the lam had been a busy one.
</P>
<P>
   She's become a grandmother, earned a master's degree, visited
with President Fidel Castro, and -- in a poor country -- enjoyed a
fairly comfortable existence only 90 miles from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   She said she receives a stipend from the Cuban government to
cover her living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Cuba to hand over Chesimard and the
other American criminals, but has little leverage so long as the
United States lacks diplomatic relations with the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. State Department officials say they will continue to
push for the criminals' return, citing a 1905 treaty between the
United States and Cuba that allows for extradition. They continue
to emphasize the deportation of more than 1,500 Cuban criminals who
arrived in the United States as part of the Mariel boatlift of
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeking to have the criminals returned to the United
States based on the treaty, but the Cuban government just brushes
it aside,'' said one State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report on international terrorism, the State
Department listed Cuba among those countries harboring terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials simply don't acknowledge the 1905
treaty, and have expressed doubts over the validity of charges
against at least some of the American criminals, including
Chesimard.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard, who's taken the name Assata Shakur -- she's the aunt
of slain rap star Tupac Shakur -- has denied killing State Trooper
Werner Foerster, and has claimed to be the victim of political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard's not the only former Black Panther living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Facing trial for a shoot-out that wounded two police officers,
William Lee Brent carried a handgun aboard TWA Flight 154 in San
Francisco in 1969 and hijacked the jetliner to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He later fled to Cuba where, today, he lives quietly with his
American wife.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview with the Associated Press, he expressed no
regrets over the hijacking, which injured no one, and insisted he'd
been a soldier in the battle to liberate American blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's continued inaction in the cases of American criminals has
outraged many members of Congress, such as U.S. Rep. Robert Franks,
R-N.J., who has stepped up his campaign to win the return of
American criminals on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barbaric, communist dictatorship has become a haven for
terrorists, murderers, rapists, kidnappers, and drug dealers,''
Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Franks sponsored a resolution approved
unanimously in the House that calls on Castro's government to
extradite Chesimard and other U.S. criminals in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Franks sent a letter to Castro that, again, urged
the dictator to return the American criminals.
</P>
<P>
   That letter followed another letter sent to Castro by Rep.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Waters urged Castro not to extradite Chesimard.
</P>
<P>
   Waters compared Chesimard to slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., saying she had been persecuted for her civil
rights work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has doubled
the state's reward for Chesimard's return to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever gets her back to New Jersey to fulfill her sentence
is what we want to see,'' she said.

   IF YOU GO TO CUBA . . .
</P>
<P>
   PROHIBITIONS -- Travel is prohibited for most Americans.
However, journalists, scholars, people with relatives in Cuba and
representatives of humanitarian, research and cultural groups can
apply to the U.S. Treasury Department for a travel license. Those
without a license risk a maximum criminal fine of $250,000 and a
civil fine of up to $50,000. But tens of thousands of Americans
travel to Cuba illegally each year; almost no one is threatened
with fines. Upon request, Cuban officials will not stamp your
passport.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE -- Mexicana Airlines flies to Havana from Cancun
and Mexico City. You must call Mexicana or a travel agent in Mexico
to make a reservation. Cubana Airlines flies to Havana from Nassau
in the Bahamas. You must call a travel agent in Nassau to make a
reservation. If you're traveling legally, you can take a direct
charter flight from Miami to Havana. One charter company is ABC
Charters in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   HOTELS -- Accommodations range from luxury to hotel-like. The
Riviera, the Havana Libre and the Nacional are all nice, with rooms
for US$80 and up.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY -- You must use cash only. Everyone accepts U.S. currency.
Remember to save some cash for the $20 departure tax collected at
the Havana airport.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING AROUND -- Taxis are still pretty cheap. You can get
across town for a few dollars. To go round-trip from Havana to
Varadero Golf and Country Club costs $150 to $170.
</P>
<P>
   FURTHER READING -- Lonely Planet has a well-researched guide on
Cuba. The Caribbean Islands Handbook has a good chapter on Cuba.

<P>
   HAVANA, Cuba _ Delightfully off-limits to most Americans, I
first visited communist Cuba in 1991 simply because I wasn't
supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   I had no idea what to expect. But it was like traveling into a
time warp.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Russian Lada cars rattled alongside 40-year-old
Chevrolets. Old-fashioned pharmacies displayed traditional glass
and ceramic medicine jars. Billboards of the bearded revolutionary
hero, Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara, dominated the roadsides.
</P>
<P>
   Decaying pastel-colored mansions, many owned by rich Cubans who
fled to the United States after Fidel Castro took power in 1959,
dripped chips of plaster like drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   As a so-called ``forbidden zone,'' this Pennsylvania-sized
island just 90 miles off the South Florida shore was certainly
lacking -- there were few Americans and few T-shirts to buy, few
tacky souvenirs to browse, and no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't have been happier.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, there was little to eat, even in the best
state-run restaurants, and few hotels that could -- even with a
stretch -- be labeled anything close to luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Today I travel to Cuba legally, as a journalist, with the same
awe I felt as a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's still like stepping inside a museum, Cuba today
is a very different country than the one I vacationed in nearly
eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The surreal sense of entering the 1950s has given way to an
awkward commercialism, and an all-out wooing of foreign tourists
and investors.
</P>
<P>
   You still see roadside billboards praising the benefits of
Castro's socialist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But you also see billboards for Samsung electronics and
Pepsodent toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
   Old men still play dominoes at night by candlelight, but their
children love nothing more than catching a Sylvester Stallone movie
on state-run television. Old women still sell peanuts in paper
cones, but their children drink Coca-Cola, imported via Mexico and
other third countries, and wear belts displaying the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cuba remains a charming -- albeit sometimes disturbing
-- place to visit. Founded by Spain in 1519, the capital city of
Havana blossomed into an elegant city of wide avenues, lovely,
shaded plazas, and an enviable cultural scene. It was an
architect's dream that gently blended Spanish-style mansions with
baroque cathedrals. It's no wonder Havana has often been called the
``Paris of the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Today paint is peeling from many buildings, but one glimpse at
the Gran Teatro and the Baccardi building and I'm instantly
reminded of Havana's former grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Before the revolution, Havana was the largest, most spectacular
city in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's rather run-down today, you still can savor tastes
of its glorious past.
</P>
<P>
   For $60, you can watch the legendary show at the Tropicana
open-air cabaret, as large a draw today as it was in the 1940s and
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   For much less, you can re-live the Cold War at the Museo de la
Revolucion, where former U.S. President Ronald Reagan is
caricatured as a ``cretin.''
</P>
<P>
   Even my hotel of choice, the Nacional, was a playground for
Hollywood's rich and famous in the days before communism. Built in
the 1930s by the same architects who created the famous Breakers in
Palm Beach, the hotel is a giant, twin-towered structure with a
breezy veranda that overlooks the famed seaside boulevard known as
the Malecon. The rooms go for $100 a night, and include a massive
breakfast buffet that includes Danish pastries, cheese pizza, and
watery scrambled eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, I was lucky to find a single hard-boiled egg.
</P>
<P>
   From the hotel, it's an easy 10-minute drive to Old Havana, a
borough of narrow streets that's home to many of Ernest Hemingway's
old haunts.
</P>
<P>
   The pricey but exquisite El Floridita restaurant, where the
daiquiri was invented, is one. Another is the wonderfully divey La
Bodeguita del Medio, a graffiti-splashed watering hole where, by
mid-morning, it's standing-room-only. Hemingway is said to have
written ``A Farewell To Arms'' in the Ambos Mundos Hotel, which has
been renovated lavishly for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of Old Havana remains the Plaza de la Catedral,
dominated by the 18-century Catedral de San Cristobal de La Habana,
where Pope John Paul II said Mass during his trip here in January
1998.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent rise in tourism in Cuba, many of the sidewalks
near the plaza spill over these days with vendors selling
everything from colorful artwork to cheap mobiles fashioned from
shells.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the Havana I first encountered in 1991, when
I searched in vain for any memento of my trip.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, one thing that hasn't changed is the people, who are
as eager to talk politics today as they were in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On my first trip here, I remember swigging rum with an elderly
man named Ivan along the Malecon. He was bursting with questions
about the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it true that all the students are forced to carry guns in
school because of the violence?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not true, I responded, and he seemed genuinely
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Woefully, the faces of the people I meet today are lined with a
weariness I didn't see before. And they're more jaded by the sight
of foreigners, meaning they're less likely to approach me than they
were eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One woman I recently befriended laments the fact that a Cuban
doctor earns only the equivalent of $20 a month, while a taxi
driver can earn more than that in daily tips from a foreigner.
Another woman just wants Vitamin A and some cotton balls. In Cuba,
where medicines are increasingly scarce, finding an aspirin --
unless you have dollars -- is like embarking on an all-day treasure
hunt.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret this country is riddled with contradictions as it
seeks to marry the travel boom with its socialist values.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, this marriage has created a resurgence in
prostitution and also in crime on an island that's still amazingly
safe when compared to its Caribbean neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans were shocked last September when two Italian tourists
were shot to death during a robbery. On Thursday(Jan. 28), Cuban
officials ordered two Cubans to go before the firing squad for the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Many Cubans see tourism as a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the money it brings, but I do not like what it results
in,'' one woman says. ``Every Cuban now wants what they see all the
foreigners as having.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bottomed-out economy that forced a hesitant Castro to
embrace tourism in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Following the fall of the former Soviet Union, Cuba's main
benefactor -- which had subsidized Cuba to the tune of $6 billion a
year -- the economy came unraveled in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's nearly 12 million people entered into what Castro called
``a special period'' during which fuel, clothing, and seemingly
everything else was in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   So Castro had little choice but to allow foreign investment in
Cuba and -- most notably for Cubans themselves -- to permit Cubans
to possess and transact in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   He also allowed Cubans to dabble in capitalism by opening their
own small businesses, such as the home-based restaurants called
paladares that are now so popular with tourists in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   These reluctant but necessary actions created the desired
outcome: they gave a jolt to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But they also created a troubling social schism between those
who have access to dollars and those who don't that's reminiscent
of pre-revolution days.
</P>
<P>
   Before Castro marched triumphant into Havana on New Year's Eve
1958, Fulgencio Batista had ruled Cuba with help from American
mobsters while the likes of Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra, and
Josephine Baker tossed around money like yesterday's garbage.
</P>
<P>
   These days most Cubans get around by foot or bicycle, while rich
tourists travel in sleek Mercedes taxis. They make do with monthly
rations that include six eggs a month, while tourists eat their
fill of shrimp and lobster at high-priced restaurants. They live
six families to a house, hanging their clothes out to dry on iron
balconies, while tourists stay in five-star hotels replete with
cigar bars, marble floors, and dry cleaning services.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets, I'm often approached by young children begging
for nothing more than a ``pluma,'' or pen.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Cubans I talk to don't resent foreign visitors,
including Americans -- even though many disdain the U.S. government
-- they just want their share of the tourism pie.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the streets here have been turned into a
hodge-podge of hustlers -- who look to sell everything from women
to contraband cigars.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip I remember sitting on a park bench with a male
American friend when two scantily clad girls approached. Brazenly,
one said to him: I'll do anything for a dollar.'' I was both
floored and saddened.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cuban government has launched a crackdown on what it
calls ``anti-social activities.'' Over the last year, police have
yanked more than 6,700 prostitutes off the streets here. Many have
been returned to their homes on farms in the rural provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism earned this island more than $1.8 billion in revenue
last year, making it -- and not sugar -- the nation's new economic
linchpin.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past five years, the number of tourists visiting Cuba
from Italy, Canada, and other countries has doubled, to 1.4 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   This island now boasts more than 28,000 hotel rooms and is
served by 40 foreign airlines; British Airways will start service
here this spring.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 85,000 Americans visited Cuba last year, many of
them illegally. They sneak in via Mexico, Canada, or the Bahamas,
flying mostly on Mexicana or the Cuban-run Cubana Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   These Americans suffer almost no consequences, despite violating
the Trading With the Enemy Act, a 1917 prohibition that's more
ancient than the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The law forbids Americans from spending money in a country with
which the United States has no formal relations.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions are made for Americans in certain professions, such
as teachers, scientists, and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict that the number of visitors to Cuba would
skyrocket by 5 million a year if the U.S. travel restriction
against the island was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Snow, an Austin, Texas-based fishing guide, isn't waiting.
He says no one's going to tell him where to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's visited Cuba at least 150 times since 1977, forever in
search of the world's largest bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep going because I love the warmth of the Cuban
people and because Americans should have the freedom to go where
they want,'' reasoned Snow, who's fished many of Cuba's 1,000 or so
clear-blue lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Cuba has becomethe hot travel destination for
Americans, and for others as well, and the Cuban government --
despite its rallying cry of ``Socialism or Death!'' -- is doing its
part to make sure it stays that way by pumping a virtual fortune
into the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The five-star, 281-room Golden Tulip Parque Central hotel, for
example, just opened with a $31 million investment from Cuba and
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, Castro said in a speech that he saw the
potential for another $20 billion in investment in the island's
booming tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significantly, the Cuban government spent $8
million last year to open the Varadero Golf Club, the first 18-hole
golf course built in Cuba since the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, at least three other golf courses are
planned throughout Cuba, where baseball is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``These golf courses are all part of a big effort to improve the
product for the tourists here,'' said Roberto Garcia, the Varadero
Golf Club's director.
</P>
<P>
   I asked if Cubans are ever resentful that their government has
channeled so much money into tourism when spending on healthcare is
down by more than 70 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cubans look at tourism as income that can be used for things
like housing and education,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   To play the course, visitors pay $60, or three times the average
monthly salary of most Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The manicured course was enlarged from a nine-hole course on the
expropriated property of the du Pont family. A pro shop and elegant
restaurant -- where the lobster special goes for $45 -- are housed
in the family's former mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, we've had more than 100 people come here in one
day,'' Garcia said, sounding astounded at his own words.
</P>
<P>
   The golf course is located in Varadero, a city of 19,000 just a
two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 15 miles of satin-like beaches, Varadero has long
been a magnet for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   This bustling resort community boasts 38 hotels, including the
upscale Club Med, which recently opened a 500-room, canary-yellow
compound here.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent drive through Varadero, I realized with sadness that
it looked like any other Caribbean beach town, with a slew of
roadside stands selling everything from maracas to beach towels.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways I'm pleased the government's efforts to boost
tourism are paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials are hopeful they'll attract 1.7 million tourists
to the island this year.
</P>
<P>
   But, secretly, I've often selfishly wished the plan to increase
tourism will fail.
</P>
<P>
   With even a Benetton store in Old Havana, commercialism seems to
have contaminated the quiet island I first visited like a virus.
</P>
<P>
   But I'll keep coming. At least there's still no McDonald's.

<P>
   HAVANA _ Enjoying Cuba's aegis, former Black Panther activist
Joanne Chesimard remains one of America's most-wanted exiles.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1973, she and two friends got into a shoot-out with state
troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike after being pulled over in
their car for a non-functioning tail-light.
</P>
<P>
   One officer died after being slammed to the ground by a flurry
of bullets, then shot twice in the head -- execution-style -- with
his own pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of first-degree murder in 1977, Chesimard broke out of
prison during a daring, daylight escape in 1979, only to surface in
communist Cuba in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard is just one of nearly 100 serious criminals who fled
the U.S. justice system and were later granted political asylum by
Castro's communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Other outlaws include rogue financier Robert Vesco, who was
indicted for illegally contributing $250,000 in cash to Richard
Nixon's 1972 presidential re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 2,000 Americans currently live in Cuba, according
to the U.S. Interests Section here, but most are children of Cubans
who were living in the United States at the time they were born.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law doesn't stop U.S. citizens from visiting or even living
in Cuba, but the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 does forbid
Americans from spending money on the island of 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a New York City television station early
last year, Chesimard said her life on the lam had been a busy one.
</P>
<P>
   She's become a grandmother, earned a master's degree, visited
with President Fidel Castro, and -- in a poor country -- enjoyed a
fairly comfortable existence only 90 miles from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   She said she receives a stipend from the Cuban government to
cover her living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Cuba to hand over Chesimard and the
other American criminals, but has little leverage so long as the
United States lacks diplomatic relations with the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. State Department officials say they will continue to
push for the criminals' return, citing a 1905 treaty between the
United States and Cuba that allows for extradition. They continue
to emphasize the deportation of more than 1,500 Cuban criminals who
arrived in the United States as part of the Mariel boatlift of
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeking to have the criminals returned to the United
States based on the treaty, but the Cuban government just brushes
it aside,'' said one State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report on international terrorism, the State
Department listed Cuba among those countries harboring terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials simply don't acknowledge the 1905
treaty, and have expressed doubts over the validity of charges
against at least some of the American criminals, including
Chesimard.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard, who's taken the name Assata Shakur -- she's the aunt
of slain rap star Tupac Shakur -- has denied killing State Trooper
Werner Foerster, and has claimed to be the victim of political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard's not the only former Black Panther living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Facing trial for a shoot-out that wounded two police officers,
William Lee Brent carried a handgun aboard TWA Flight 154 in San
Francisco in 1969 and hijacked the jetliner to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He later fled to Cuba where, today, he lives quietly with his
American wife.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview with the Associated Press, he expressed no
regrets over the hijacking, which injured no one, and insisted he'd
been a soldier in the battle to liberate American blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's continued inaction in the cases of American criminals has
outraged many members of Congress, such as U.S. Rep. Robert Franks,
R-N.J., who has stepped up his campaign to win the return of
American criminals on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barbaric, communist dictatorship has become a haven for
terrorists, murderers, rapists, kidnappers, and drug dealers,''
Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Franks sponsored a resolution approved
unanimously in the House that calls on Castro's government to
extradite Chesimard and other U.S. criminals in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Franks sent a letter to Castro that, again, urged
the dictator to return the American criminals.
</P>
<P>
   That letter followed another letter sent to Castro by Rep.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Waters urged Castro not to extradite Chesimard.
</P>
<P>
   Waters compared Chesimard to slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., saying she had been persecuted for her civil
rights work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has doubled
the state's reward for Chesimard's return to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever gets her back to New Jersey to fulfill her sentence
is what we want to see,'' she said.

<P>
   HAVANA _ Enjoying Cuba's aegis, former Black Panther activist
Joanne Chesimard remains one of America's most-wanted exiles.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1973, she and two friends got into a shoot-out with state
troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike after being pulled over in
their car for a non-functioning tail-light.
</P>
<P>
   One officer died after being slammed to the ground by a flurry
of bullets, then shot twice in the head -- execution-style -- with
his own pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted of first-degree murder in 1977, Chesimard broke out of
prison during a daring, daylight escape in 1979, only to surface in
communist Cuba in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard is just one of nearly 100 serious criminals who fled
the U.S. justice system and were later granted political asylum by
Castro's communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Other outlaws include rogue financier Robert Vesco, who was
indicted for illegally contributing $250,000 in cash to Richard
Nixon's 1972 presidential re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In all, some 2,000 Americans currently live in Cuba, according
to the U.S. Interests Section here, but most are children of Cubans
who were living in the United States at the time they were born.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law doesn't stop U.S. citizens from visiting or even living
in Cuba, but the Trading With the Enemy Act of 1917 does forbid
Americans from spending money on the island of 12 million people.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a New York City television station early
last year, Chesimard said her life on the lam had been a busy one.
</P>
<P>
   She's become a grandmother, earned a master's degree, visited
with President Fidel Castro, and -- in a poor country -- enjoyed a
fairly comfortable existence only 90 miles from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   She said she receives a stipend from the Cuban government to
cover her living expenses.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Cuba to hand over Chesimard and the
other American criminals, but has little leverage so long as the
United States lacks diplomatic relations with the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. State Department officials say they will continue to
push for the criminals' return, citing a 1905 treaty between the
United States and Cuba that allows for extradition. They continue
to emphasize the deportation of more than 1,500 Cuban criminals who
arrived in the United States as part of the Mariel boatlift of
1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep seeking to have the criminals returned to the United
States based on the treaty, but the Cuban government just brushes
it aside,'' said one State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report on international terrorism, the State
Department listed Cuba among those countries harboring terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban government officials simply don't acknowledge the 1905
treaty, and have expressed doubts over the validity of charges
against at least some of the American criminals, including
Chesimard.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard, who's taken the name Assata Shakur -- she's the aunt
of slain rap star Tupac Shakur -- has denied killing State Trooper
Werner Foerster, and has claimed to be the victim of political
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Chesimard's not the only former Black Panther living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Facing trial for a shoot-out that wounded two police officers,
William Lee Brent carried a handgun aboard TWA Flight 154 in San
Francisco in 1969 and hijacked the jetliner to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   He later fled to Cuba where, today, he lives quietly with his
American wife.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview with the Associated Press, he expressed no
regrets over the hijacking, which injured no one, and insisted he'd
been a soldier in the battle to liberate American blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's continued inaction in the cases of American criminals has
outraged many members of Congress, such as U.S. Rep. Robert Franks,
R-N.J., who has stepped up his campaign to win the return of
American criminals on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barbaric, communist dictatorship has become a haven for
terrorists, murderers, rapists, kidnappers, and drug dealers,''
Franks said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, Franks sponsored a resolution approved
unanimously in the House that calls on Castro's government to
extradite Chesimard and other U.S. criminals in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, Franks sent a letter to Castro that, again, urged
the dictator to return the American criminals.
</P>
<P>
   That letter followed another letter sent to Castro by Rep.
Maxine Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Waters urged Castro not to extradite Chesimard.
</P>
<P>
   Waters compared Chesimard to slain civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr., saying she had been persecuted for her civil
rights work.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman has doubled
the state's reward for Chesimard's return to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever gets her back to New Jersey to fulfill her sentence
is what we want to see,'' she said.

POVERTY IS NO DAY IN THE PARK 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There's no doubt that poor people in this
country, roughly 14 percent of the population, live much more
comfortably than poor people elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal figures, about two in five poor American
families own their own homes. Seven in 10 own a car. One in four
own two or more cars. The average poor American enjoys a third more
living space than the average Japanese, and 97 percent of poor
American households own color television sets. Three-quarters of
them have VCRs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think, though, that poverty in America is all laughs and
lolling around. In general, poor people would rather have jobs and
pay their bills without grudging charity from the rest of us. In
the case of somebody like Audrey Rarick, however, that's not
possible.
</P>
<P>
   She's 33. She has three kids. She also has a couple of steel
rods that run along her spine, souvenirs of a factory accident that
left her disabled. Until last year, she was living in an apartment
in suburban Albany on Social Security disability. She got food
stamps, and she got help from the government in heating her home
through the Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP).
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she got an insurance settlement from her factory
accident. She used the money to buy a little house in a remote
section of Rensselaer County, N.Y. The place is a converted garage
with a wood stove. And she still needed help from HEAP to stay warm
in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rensselaer County Social Services Department has contractors
signed up to supply HEAP clients who burn wood. HEAP pays the
contractors directly. Rarick was referred to a contractor who
delivered some wood to her. And Rarick noticed that the stuff was
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you familiar with wood at all?'' she asked me when she
recounted this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't heat with it,'' I said, ``so, I'm not intimately
familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, green wood, it'll burn, but it'll also build up in your
chimney and such. And it's basically a fire hazard.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is true. I talked to a few wood stove dealers. Don't burn
green wood, they warned me. It generates too little warmth, and
continued use of it in your wood stove creates creosote deposits.
You can burn your house down.
</P>
<P>
   So Rarick called the dealer who'd delivered her firewood. This
stuff worried her, she told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that I should be grateful for getting a cord of
green wood,'' she told me, ``and that's all he has. And that's all
he'll be giving me. And the way he put it was, `You people don't
seem to realize that my paying customers are what allow me to do
this program.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarick suspected that maybe this guy held HEAP clients in lower
regard than paying customers. Her impression, she told me, was that
the contractor viewed her as ``lowlife scum.''
</P>
<P>
   So, she said, she had a friend call this same dealer to inquire
about seasoned wood for cash customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Rarick told me, ``he said, `Oh, yeah, come on down.
I'll load your truck up.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to call the wood dealer. All I got was a recording. I
did, however, take a look at the contract he signed to become a
HEAP contractor. It reads, ``Home energy suppliers will not
discriminate, either in costs of goods supplied or the services
provided, against the household on whose behalf HEAP payments are
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarick figures she's stuck with this. It's not like she can go
out and pay cash for seasoned wood. And burning the green stuff
sure beats freezing to death.
</P>
<P>
   But she does wish that poverty was the carefree, cushy deal that
so many people seem to think it is.

MUCH ADO ABOUT THE BARD'S TRUE IDENTITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've stayed with me and have come back for more, you know
I'm one of those cranks who believe that William Shakespeare didn't
compose the plays and poems attributed to him. I've cited the movie
``Shakespeare in Love'' as necessarily pure fiction despite its
acknowledged artistic quality and entertainment value; but I've
merely outlined the case against the Bard, and have barely touched
on the ``Oxford theory'' of authorship.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Bacon was the first champion for those who doubted Will
Shakespeare's sophistication and intellectual capacity for writing
what he surely said he wrote. Bacon was a supremely educated man of
the world whose voluminous writings advertise a keen intellect and
such mastery of history and geography as should disqualify him _
for Bacon wouldn't have made some of the historical and
geographical errors that Shakespeare made. Putting that aside,
Bacon's language is not in sync with Shakespearean texts as we know
them.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Marlowe has never ranked with Bacon in the
authorship sweepstakes, but Marlovians persist in their thesis that
Marlowe survived the tavern brawl in which he officially died, and
that thereafter he passed on to Shakespeare the plays he wrote in
hiding. Marlowe's language also isn't Shakespeare's, reminding me
of the late Walter Kerr's observation, upon reviewing a production
of Marlowe's ``Tamburlaine'' in the 1960s, that ``... if
Shakespeare was really Marlowe, Marlowe certainly wasn't
Shakespeare last night.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other claimants. Henry Wriothesley, the third earl of
Southampton, was Shakespeare's patron, and some believe he was the
true playwright, using Shakespeare as his front. The extant
writings of Queen Elizabeth I indicate a vocabulary akin to
Shakespeare's, but the reign of Good Queen Bess is so
well-documented as to render it almost impossible that she would
have had sufficient private time for extended composition.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most who disbelieve Shakespeare as the author of the
complete works (or any of them) have lined up behind Edward de
Vere, the 17th earl of Oxford, as the more likely poet-dramatist.
Charlton Ogburn's definitive ``The Mysterious William
Shakespeare,'' besides stockpiling evidence that the man from
Stratford couldn't have been the author, presents a logical and
fairly convincing case for Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of court, one of Elizabeth's favorites, and his
own preserved writings (a few poems; some correspondence) have the
character of Shakespearean language. More than that, certain words
and poetic images found in Oxford's written legacy are found again,
almost verbatim, in Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's detractors point out that he died in 1604, seven years
before ``The Tempest'' became Shakespeare's last performed play.
Will Shakespeare retired to Stratford in 1611, died there in 1616,
apparently wrote nothing during those years, and in his last will
and testament made no reference to having ever been a dramatist or
any other man of letters.
</P>
<P>
   In the writing of plays that often have subtle political
substance, Oxford would have wanted and needed anonymity. He needed
a go-between, and logically would have settled on an actor _ a good
actor, who could carry off an audacious charade.
</P>
<P>
   If indeed there was a conspiracy between Oxford and Shakespeare,
it was a super one; and it is easily conceivable that when Oxford
died, Shakespeare was in possession of several plays the earl had
passed on to him. When the supply ran out, Will left London and
returned to Stratford as a gentleman, resuming life there with Anne
Hathaway.
</P>
<P>
   Does it really matter who wrote the plays and sonnets? The
important thing is we have them. Everyone loves a mystery, though,
and this delicious mystery will endure forever. Even if the truth
eventually is somehow revealed, the Stratford purists never will be
swayed by mere proof.

CLINTON SEES TERROR UNDER EVERY MATTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ America was settled by people escaping czars,
kings and other despots with armies at their disposal. Nowadays the
czarist threat is strictly domestic.
</P>
<P>
   We already have a drug czar whose troops wage a continually
losing war against drugs, despite broad powers of search and
seizure. Now we have a terrorism czar with secret armies already in
the field, and more to come.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about you, but that terrifies me more than
terrorism does.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Clarke, appointed by President Clinton as the
government's counterterrorism coordinator, has a secretive
mentality, a desire to raise public fears and an $11 billion annual
budget to fight the threats Clinton says are under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   That vast space beneath the national box spring has to be
filled, now that communism has crawled out and slouched away.
</P>
<P>
   Our terrorism czar not only wants to protect America from
chemical and biological attack, he wants to protect us from those
who attack business and governmental computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack on American cyberspace is an attack on the United
States, just as much as a landing on New Jersey,'' Clarke told the
New York Times. ``The notion that we could respond with military
force against a cyber-attack has to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   What's he going to do? Launch cruise missiles at a rec room
where a couple of 14-year-old hackers are holed up?
</P>
<P>
   Clarke and the president see a cyber-threat coming from the
usual terrorist sources. You know who I mean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone want to mount such an attack?'' the terrorism
czar said. ``To extort us. To intimidate us. To get us to abandon
our foreign policy _ `Abandon Israel now!'''
</P>
<P>
   Abandon Israel, or they'll shut down a city's electricity, mass
transit and 911 systems.
</P>
<P>
   To threats like that, Clarke would put the Poseidon missiles in
launch mode off the coast of Libya, or the rogue nation du jour. Or
maybe he'd take the Bruce Willis route and saddle up the Delta
Force for an operation against a radical Islamic computer cabal in
Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Do we want this man in charge of secret military operations
within the United States? Do we want anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Clarke is the genius who overrode the State Department, the CIA
and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and got Clinton to launch cruise
missiles at training camps in Afghanistan and a medicine factory in
Sudan, in hopes of killing the alleged terrorist mastermind Osama
bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   All he got was a night watchman and a few guerrilla trainees
whose comrades are now even madder at us.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Clarke hatched a plan to wage psychological warfare
against Libya's Muammar Qaddafi by having spy planes set off sonic
booms over his head. Just for starters, you have to wonder about a
guy who feels it necessary to drive Qaddafi crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton has put Clarke in charge of military responses to
domestic terrorism. If I were a hacker in a rec room, I'd start
pouring concrete for a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be a libertine, but he's no civil libertarian. In
his 1996 anti-terrorism bill, he restricted rights of habeas
corpus, which allow prisoners to challenge their imprisonment. He
has pushed for increased wiretapping powers for the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the Tripp tapes. I wonder how he feels about
secret taping now.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new budget includes more than $1 billion to improve
computer security, and $250 million over six years to fund 10
military SWAT teams to help civilian authorities respond to
terrorist attacks on our soil.
</P>
<P>
   Just what America needs _ more SWAT teams, and military ones,
even though the military has traditionally been barred from
civilian police work.
</P>
<P>
   We're entering a new age of duck and cover, to use the 1950s
phrase for defense against Soviet nuclear attack _ namely, getting
under our desks.
</P>
<P>
   There's no ducking and covering from chemical and biological
weapons, as Clinton and Secretary of Defense William Cohen are so
eager to tell us.
</P>
<P>
   We live ``in a grave new world,'' said Cohen, in a too-cute play
on words meant to convey the chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons which easily can be carried across borders. Not to mention
cyber-threats that only take the movement of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to reconcile how much we're willing to
give up in the way of our individual liberties in order to be
secure,'' Cohen said in a speech in December.
</P>
<P>
   We may be giving up far too much and not feeling secure at all.

FIGHTING SIN WITH MUG SHOTS

   Commentary

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL CERRITO, Calif. _ Civic leaders in Palo Alto and Menlo Park
probably thought they'd come up with a breakthrough in the field of
the punitive arts. Based on a forgotten ordinance from the 1800s,
they began to distribute photos of ``known problem drinkers'' so
liquor stores wouldn't sell to them.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone greeted this innovation with a joyful clicking of
heels. Nit-pickers, killjoys and legal scholars carped and
complained that the procedure violated the Constitution in several
distinct ways. It smacked of harassment. It presumed guilt without
due process. And it was almost, by definition, discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   None of this evidently carried much sway with city officials in
Palo Alto and Menlo Park. They suspended the program not because of
its implications for civil liberties and personal freedom, but
because, doggone it, some of the photos they posted turned out to
be of ordinary citizens with no known drinking problems.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, once the authorities get their 8-by-10 glossies
properly labeled, the program will gear up again.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutionality, our judicial system and a world of potential
litigation aside, the truly eye-catching aspect to this ploy is
that it doesn't zero in on public drunkenness or
drunk-and-disorderly conduct _ activities which are explicitly
criminal infractions _ but on unpopular personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning seems to be: ``You aren't breaking any law so we
can't lock you up and the ACLU would be on us like lice in a hen
house if we tried public humiliation using the pillory or ducking
stool, drat the luck. But we can, by gosh, make it awkward and
difficult and inconvenient for you to maintain those habits that we
find annoying, improper or unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   What a fabulous concept: para-punishment. Effectively barring
people from engaging in perfectly lawful behavior if they tend to
do so in a manner, or to a degree, that the citizenry considers to
be unseemly and/or excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine how this principle could enhance our quality of
life if, emboldened by the get-tough example of Menlo Park and Palo
Alto, we expanded its application to cover all variety of acts that
offend our sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Photos of known two-pack-a-day smokers will be posted wherever
tobacco products are still sold, and they will be barred from
buying their cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photos of people who are clinically obese will be posted
wherever food is sold. They will be limited to meals of less than
1,200 calories in restaurants and fast-food outlets, and will not
be sold dessert items, snack foods or butter. Any clothing store
that sells them a bathing suit or leotard is in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photos of ``known habitual unhygienics'' _ individuals guilty
of chronically objectionable body odor and/or unkempt appearance _
will be posted in subways and train stations and on buses. The
offenders will be denied access to public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photos of people identified as incorrigible ``sonic
polluters'' for loud boom boxes will be distributed to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Persistent and unapologetic ``package rustlers,'' whose noisy
snacking distracts other patrons in movie theaters, will be
photographed by ushers, banned from snack bars and frisked for
packaged food items.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photos of motorists who habitually tailgate, double park,
drive with turn signals on and/or talk incessantly on cell phones
in traffic will be circulated to gas stations, which will refuse
their patronage, and to car dealerships, which will be prohibited
from selling them anything larger than a golf cart. Volvo dealers
may not even permit them on the property.
</P>
<P>
   Golly, there's almost no end to the number of displeasing
behaviors that we could cut off at the source with the
``photographica persona non grata'' gambit.
</P>
<P>
   Nit-pickers will probably carp that these measures would be
intolerable violations of any notion of justice. Bah. As they say
in Palo Alto and Menlo Park, ``Who needs justice when you've got a
Polaroid?''

RUSSIA'S SECRET POLICE STILL DREADED

   ST. PETERSBURG _ You know exactly where you are when you enter
the Big House, the St. Petersburg headquarters of the Federal
Security Service, or FSB, the successor to the dreaded Soviet
secret police, the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is not marked by any sign, but the atmospherics say
it all: The guard behind the glass protector who takes your
documents and tells you to wait in the entryway, empty except for a
microphone and a camera hanging from the wall. The statue of Felix
Dzerzhinsky, despised for his bloody tactics almost everywhere
else, revered here as the founder of the Soviet secret police. The
portrait of Yury Andropov, the KGB chief whose brief ascent to the
summit of Soviet power in 1982 was cut short by illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   We would like to show you a picture of the building's exterior,
but as one FSB agent told our photographer, ``Don't even think of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where the work of the Soviet secret police is
seen as a matter of pride, and not one of the blackest chapters of
Russia's history.
</P>
<P>
   All this became relevant to American reporter Brian Whitmore on
Thursday, when investigators trying to learn more about the murder
last November of Russian legislator Galina Starovoitova called the
native of North Branford, Conn., in for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Big House, after all, is the home of the notorious Leningrad
KGB headquarters, where Communist-era dissidents were broken down
and forced to sign confessions of ``crimes'' against the Soviet
state.
</P>
<P>
   Although formally the FSB no longer has a political agenda,
traditions die hard.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Petersburg FSB is the agency that charged
environmentalist Alexander Nikitin with treason in 1995 because he
co-wrote a report on the dangers of the Russian navy's negligent
storage of nuclear waste from its Northern Fleet submarines. Human
rights activists have repeatedly protested the FSB's handling of
the case, saying its charges were so vague that Nikitin could not
defend himself. Next week, Nikitin's case will be decided before
Russia's Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Starovoitova's allies have expressed concern that the St.
Petersurg FSB, which harassed and spied on her when she was a
democracy activist in the days before the collapse of Communism,
would be unlikely to solve the case.
</P>
<P>
   Other journalists who have been interrogated tell of agents who
seem more concerned about finding dirt on Starovoitova's friends
than solving the murder. One interrogator gleefully recalled how
many dissidents he had arrested in Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   When Whitmore, a reporter for the local St. Petersburg Times,
received a subpoena last week, he took no chances. He talked to
Nikitin, who warned him about the way FSB interrogators try to get
their quarry to sign statements with subtle distortions of their
testimony. He retained Nikitin's lawyer, who warned him to demand a
translator and not to sign anything. He contacted US Consul Simon
Henshaw, of Harvard, Mass., who accompanied him to the entrance of
Big House, even though Russian law forbids Henshaw from
accompanying Whitmore inside.
</P>
<P>
   As he waited in the minus-11 degree chill, Whitmore had no idea
what awaited him inside. Actually, there is little to report
because Whitmore had to sign a statement saying he would not
disclose the specific line of the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   We can say that the FSB investigator, Major Alexander Andreyev,
was both fascinated and offended by Whitmore's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who frightened you?'' asked Andreyev, a trim, balding man with
a military bearing whose black suit and gray turtleneck seemed more
appropriate for a Hollywood business lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Whitmore said Andreyev failed to understand why he wanted a
lawyer present during questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said imagine for a moment that a Russian reporter gets a
call from the CIA to go to Langley,'' Whitmore said later,
referring to CIA headquarters. ``He said, `We aren't like the CIA,
we are more like the FBI.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him no American in his right mind would go into an FBI
interrogation without a lawyer,'' Whitmore recalled. ``He's like,
`Do you all have lawyers in America?' He seemed really bewildered
that someone might feel a need to have protection. It seemed very
telling about the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another misunderstanding came up when Andreyev asked Whitmore to
sign the agreement not to disclose contents of the questioning.
When Whitmore explained that in America, the First Amendment allows
freedom of speech, Andreyev nodded gravely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid it's going to be like that here some day,''
Whitmore quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   After three hours, Whitmore was out, no worse for wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my apprehension wasn't misplaced because that
organization's reputation certainly precedes it,'' he said. ``Until
they take active measures to change that, people are going to be
afraid of them.''

MAKING THE IMPEACHMENT GAME EVEN WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Susan Collins is not getting the ``credit'' she
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than poor Kenneth Starr, Maine's earnest Republican
senator has come up with a way to join the once-grand mechanism of
impeachment to the reality of modern media and political
scandal-mongering so that they can live in synergistic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Starr lacks historical staying power, but Collins could change
the scandal game for decades in ways every tabloid editor, cable
talkmeister, and political mud-slinger would praise.
</P>
<P>
   If you take the long view, the independent counsel is toast. In
his clumsy and incompetent way, Starr tries to meddle in the
Senate's sputtering trial _ an indictment of a minor figure one
day, a leak of intentions toward the president on another. Starr
has so abused his office that its future after the statute that
authorizes it expires in the spring is likely to be somewhere
between oblivion and emasculation.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Collins _ ah, she has an idea that could be one for
the ages.
</P>
<P>
   For all of American history, impeachment has been more or less
what it was designed to be _ a constitutional process to be
employed very rarely and with the greatest political reluctance in
order to protect the country from the most dangerous abusers of
official power, whether from the bench or the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because two-thirds of the Senate has to agree on a
conviction, it has always been axiomatic that consensus and
conclusive evidence beyond rational doubt were essential precursors
to impeachment proceedings even in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Collins could change all that.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of her ``genius'' is her invention of a means of
helping the House and Senate avoid any serious responsibility for
having brought forward a weak or farcical impeachment case _ either
in the short term politically or the long term historically.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having to answer for giving in to partisanship or
overzealousness, Collins has discovered a way for politicians in
particular and scandal industry generally to reject and accept an
impeachment case at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Enter her ``findings of fact'' _ an inventive perversion of
normal court procedures to facilitate the warping of part of our
Constitution that would no longer mean what it says. This is sheer
brilliance, as witness the fact that Senate Republican leader Trent
Lott has quasi-elbowed her aside to mere membership on a
seven-person GOP committee run by Maine's senior Senator Olympia
Snowe and New Mexico's Pete Domenici.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a spending bill, they will see which facts they can
find that will attract which votes. They will also seek to broaden
their base by stripping their findings of any language asserting or
implying criminal guilt. In scandal vernacular, fuzzy wrongdoing is
preferred over clear crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the real beauty of the Collins idea is in its implications.
If the Snowe-Domenici committee can produce a list of ``facts''
with at least 51 Senate votes behind it, then the impending
rejection of both articles of impeachment can be stripped of its
implied rebuke of those who brought it forward in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   That means impeachment will become much easier to use in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Collins device, a House majority-vote impeachment
followed by a Senate vote not to convict and remove places the
impeachment in a negative historical light. But using the
fact-finding maneuver removes the sting and enables politicians to
say the impeachment target was at least culpable if not worthy of
conviction. Moreover, a new circle of scandal politics is possible.
</P>
<P>
   We already know that the press has dropped its news standards to
put the raising of questions on a par with the provision of
answers; and we already know the House could eke out a
pro-impeachment majority by dropping its own standard to
``censure-plus.'' Thanks to Collins, there would then be a Senate
procedure that would get around the constitutional requirement of a
two-thirds majority for conviction and substitute a majority,
overwhelmingly partisan determination of ``facts.'' Impeachment
could then become a regular part of our politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us were raised on the idea that trials are not held to
find ``truth'' or send messages, but to determine the guilt or lack
of same of the defendant, and that acquittal and innocence are not
synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, however, worries that ``misunderstanding'' might
accompany Senate acquittal of Clinton, or that the president might
even stage a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   If only she had been around when the O.J. Simpson verdict came
down.

VERMONT DEBATES LIFE-OR-DEATH-ROW MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIR HAVEN, Vt. _ The piercing alarm that wailed for help
moments after the bomb went off haunts them still. They knew the
boy killed in the explosion. The delivery man who, unwittingly,
brought the deadly parcel to a downtown doorstep is their friend.
</P>
<P>
   So there is nothing impersonal about the death in this small
town that has confronted Vermont with a question it hasn't faced in
more than 40 years: If the government proves its case, should the
killer be executed?
</P>
<P>
   But, like the state itself, neighbors, friends _ even relatives
_ of the victims of the March 1998 pipe-bombing that killed
17-year-old Christopher Marquis can reach no common ground about
proper consequences for capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say go for the death penalty,'' said Mary Sullivan, who
manages a delicatessen just off Fair Haven's historic town green.
``There were hundreds of people he could have hurt by his actions.
I think he had just a total moral disregard for human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Just yards away, a few doors down from where Marquis suffered
his fatal wounds, there is little appetite for the ultimate
sanction. ``I keep thinking of that passage from the Bible that
says, `An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,' '' said Charles
Pregger. ``If we all followed that, we'd all be blind and
toothless.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four years after Vermont banned capital punishment, the
federal government announced last month that it would seek the
death penalty against Chris William Dean, the 36-year-old Indiana
man who, authorities say, shipped the bomb to Marquis after a
dispute over the sale of citizens band radio parts arranged through
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In a state that hasn't executed anyone since 1954, the federal
government's decision is stirring emotional debate about crime and
punishment. Like Vermont, all of New England turned its back on
capital punishment a generation ago. The region's last execution
was Joseph ``Mad Dog'' Taborsky, who was electrocuted in
Connecticut in 1960 for a murder-robbery spree.
</P>
<P>
   But Dean's is a federal case and the US government reinstituted
capital punishment 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors prepare their case against Dean, a former
truck driver who tinkered with radio equipment from his small
rental home on the edge of a tidy cornfield, Dean's defenders argue
that a man with no criminal record and no history of violence is no
candidate to become the 21st inmate on federal death row.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a penalty phase to a trial, the government has
to convince the jury to impose a sentence of death,'' said Dean's
attorney, Bradley Stetler. ``I think in that respect, the
traditions of Vermonters and the culture of Vermont will be
important. I think we can't divorce what Vermont and Vermonters are
from this equation.''
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific study of nearly 10,000 Vermont residents last
year, conducted by Republican state Senator William Doyle, found
that 45 percent registered support for the death penalty; 44
percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, they hang 'em high,'' Doyle said. ``But in Vermont,
we have a history of not having a death penalty. I think it would
be a very difficult decision for any juror in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both the state's top federal prosecutor, US Attorney
Charles Tetzlaff, and Marquis's mother, Sheila Rockwell, who was
seriously injured in the blast, have expressed philosophical
opposition to state-sanctioned killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I took an oath when I took this job to enforce the laws of
the United States,'' said Tetzlaff. ``The fact that Vermont does
not have a death penalty does not impact on federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with that law, Tetzlaff last month signed a formal
notice to seek a death sentence for Dean, citing a number of
aggravating factors in the case, including Dean's alleged
premeditation and shipping of the homemade bomb via United Parcel
Service, potentially endangering anyone who came near the three
planes and one truck that brought the volatile package to its
target.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say their case, while circumstantial, is
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the bomb exploded in Marquis's bedroom, his mother
_ a 3-inch-wide piece of metal imbedded in her right knee _ told a
police officer about a man in Indiana who had been making
threatening calls to her son about a CB radio swap they had
negotiated over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Marquis's computer desk, officials said they found a piece of
notebook paper containing a handwritten note with Dean's name,
address, and telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Dean told a friend about obtaining
instructions over the Internet for making a pipe bomb, the
components of which included a clothes pin. The bomb sent to
Marquis used a clothes pin in the triggering device.
</P>
<P>
   During a search of Dean's home, federal agents said they found
evidence that Dean had tested a device on his property in Indiana.
``Agents found the test bomb's end cap, which appeared to be made
by the same pipe manufacturer that made the end cap for the bomb
that killed Marquis,'' court papers state.
</P>
<P>
   Dean's attorney said he would not comment about the government's
case against his client, or about the defense he will wage. But he
said he was surprised and disappointed that the government has
decided to seek the death sentence for Dean.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no prior criminal history,'' Stetler said. ``He has no
prior assaultive behavior. He has a stable employment history; a
stable family situation. He is a generous, caring, decent person.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not the type of people the government should be
interested in killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean's mother, Grace Lussmyer, said there is another more
compelling reason to spare her son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris said he didn't do it and I believe him,'' she said.
``Chris was set up. I know it. . . . That's what's so upsetting.
How in the hell do you think you'd feel?''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four people have been executed under the federal death
penalty statute, the last in March 1963, when Victor Feguer was
hanged in Iowa for kidnapping. If the government proves its case
against Dean and the jury invokes the maximum sentence, Dean would
take his place among 20 inmates sentenced to death since the
federal death penalty was revived in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Dean may make his last trip home to Indiana,
where the federal goverment has prepared a lethal-injection death
chamber at the US penitentiary in Terre Haute, about 150 miles from
Dean's hometown of Pierceton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be done in Vermont,'' said Tetzlaff.

   TAKE-BOS  
 VILNIUS, Lithuania: ... of pride.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The oddest manifestation of Catholicism here _ at least from my
lapsed-Unitarian perspective _ is the ``Gates of Dawn,'' originally
part of the town's fortifications. In the 17th century, Carmelites
built a chapel in the wall over the gate, to house an image of the
Virgin that they believed had miraculous healing powers. The icon
of the Virgin is now surrounded by 15,000 offerings in silver, many
depicting body parts people wanted cured: If you had a hurt leg,
you got a silversmith to make a silver leg to give to the icon.
Pious elderly women still climb the steep stone staircase to the
chapel on their knees.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnius was once a center of Jewish culture, too, but Jewish
Vilnius was virtually obliterated by the Nazis. There were once
over 100 synagogues here; now there is one, the Choraul Synagogue,
built in 1904 and restored three years ago. Its ornate
peach-and-blue interior has an almost Moorish feel. But, sadly, it
also feels like a relic. The caretaker says that only 15-20 people
attend services here regularly, and that he, at age 75, is the
youngest of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the many things I loved about Vilnius is that I could
afford it. Much of Europe has become too expensive for Americans
who want to shop; Lithuania hasn't. On the street you can find an
array of well-made crafts, including baskets, amber jewelry,
handmade clothing, and bracelets and buttons made from woods with
intricate graining. For $5, you can buy quite a nice basket from
the woman who made it, who will be enthusiastic about selling her
wares without being so aggressive that you're uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the handsomely rebuilt Island Castle in Trakai,
Lithuania's former capital, a half-hour drive from Vilnius, is a
row of stalls selling dresses and sweaters crocheted from
Lithuanian flax. They're chic, they won't wrinkle, and they cost
next to nothing. I paid $20 for a dress with full-length vest. I've
actually worn the outfit back home, as opposed to the complete
wardrobes I've lugged back from places like Senegal and Indonesia,
clothes that turned out to look ludicrous outside their country of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   I'm always afraid that ``amber'' will turn out to be plastic, so
in Vilnius I bought mine at a legit-looking place in the center of
town, called the Amber Sculpture Museum. (It's the kind of museum
where the ``exhibits'' are all for sale.) There was something
irrationally comforting about the high-overhead premises, and the
shop has a far broader range of styles than the street vendors do.
In an attempt to educate their clientele, the shop's personnel
offer pamphlets with interesting translations from the Lithuanian.
One claimed that the most significant deposits of amber ``occur
only on the shoes of the Baltic Sea,'' which made me check the
owner's footwear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My tour of the Baltic States, organized by the travel company
Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, included all three capitals _ Vilnius; Riga,
the capital of Latvia; and Tallinn, in Estonia. En route from
Vilnius to Riga was a stop at the famous Hill of Crosses, where for
centuries pilgrims have come to put up crosses that now number in
the hundreds of thousands _ crosses tiny and huge, in various
shapes, made of materials from birch twigs to steel, packed so
tightly together that columbine and ferns struggle to find space to
grow among them. The Soviets repeatedly bulldozed the crosses, only
to find the hill blooming with more of them soon after.
</P>
<P>
   In Riga, I admired both the Art Nouveau architecture _ much of
it designed by Mikhail Eisenstein, father of the filmmaker, Sergei
_ and the most beautiful suspension bridge I've ever seen. And I
was lucky enough to stumble on a choir rehearsal in the Dome
Cathedral, which has a famous organ with 6,718 pipes. The choir
would have sounded fine anywhere, but in this setting they were
celestial: I've never experienced finer acoustics than in this
cathedral that dates from the 13th century. Tallinn is intensely
competitive about organs, and my guide, while acknowledging that
the one in Riga is larger, claimed that the organ in Tallinn's
cathedral makes a sound that echoes two seconds longer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Vilnius, though, that made the biggest impression on me,
maybe partly because I stopped there first, but also because Egle
was such a great guide. (My guide in Tallinn had kept her
Soviet-era totalitarian lack of humor intact, along with a tendency
toward the literal. ``Now we are turning left'' was her idea of
fascinating information to pass along to tourists.)
</P>
<P>
   Its historic center may have been restored to movie-set
perfection, but Vilnius still bears scars left by Nazis and Soviets
alike. Egle pointed out the edge of a forest on the outskirts of
the city, where people once went to gather mushrooms and berries:
It's also where thousands of Jews and intellectuals were taken by
the Nazis to be shot and dumped into mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   It's Russia's unpredictability that Lithuanians fear now. ``We
live on a box of powder,'' Egle said, and it wasn't detergent she
was talking about. Pointing out some Stalinist sculpture that
remains in situ still, she said, ``We shouldn't get rid of all of
it. We can't erase 50 years of Soviet presence here.''
</P>
<P>
   But they've turned part of that presence into a tourist
attraction _ the KGB Museum, a converted turn-of-the-century
courthouse where thousands of Lithuanians endured interrogation
before being shipped to Siberia. A former inmate now gives tours of
this chamber of horrors that was used as a prison right up until
Lithuania gained independence in 1991. Upward of 20 prisoners
inhabited the same small cell, he said, where they slept standing
up, leaning against one another. Prisoners were allowed to wear
only underwear in the unheated isolation cells. Showers were
allowed once a month, the temperature of the water controlled by
guards who could make it scalding or freezing. One torture cell
could be flooded with cold water so prisoners couldn't lie down to
sleep. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   For all this, the guide says the KGB prison was nothing compared
to Siberia, where he spent 15 years in a climate where the
temperature bottomed out at 50 degrees below zero. This elderly
gentleman looked remarkably hale and hearty, given what he'd
endured. His secret? ``Siberia was like living in a refrigerator,''
he said. ``It preserved me.''

ZENGA INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING HARKES FROM UNITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga is
eager to acquire John Harkes, and D.C. United appears more than
willing to send Harkes on his way. But the deal is being delayed by
complications and contingencies.
</P>
<P>
   The major impediment is the fact that Harkes is now performing
on loan for Nottingham Forest in the English Premier League. Harkes
would not be available to an MLS team until June, and he might
remain in Nottingham even longer if the team recovers from a
miserable first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having ongoing discussions with D.C. United, and they
are talking to other teams, as well,'' Revolution general manager
Brian O'Donovan said Monday. ``John Harkes is a very valuable
player and there are not a lot of other choices. Walter is
pragmatic, and he knows what the choices within MLS are. He is
interested in any opportunity to improve the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution likely would attempt to trade draft choices
instead of players for Harkes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes the situation unusual is that Nottingham has an
option to buy,'' Harkes's agent, Craig Sharon, said. ``There is no
guarantee John will come back.''

   Harkes, 31, might have rejuvenated his career by returning to
England. He won the League Cup in 1993 with Sheffield Wednesday,
which was guided by his current coach, Ron Atkinson, and also
played for Derby County and West Ham United. Harkes helped D.C.
United to two MLS Cup championships, but then was stripped of his
team captaincy and dropped from the national team before the World
Cup finals in France.
</P>
<P>
   In the MLS, Harkes has been a playmaking midfielder, though in a
secondary role behind Marco Etcheverry. He moved to right back for
Nottingham, and helped the club break a 20-game winless streak with
a 1-0 victory at Everton Saturday. What Harkes's position with the
Revolution would be is unclear, though the team is much weaker in
defense than in midfield, especially with right back Mike Burns
trying out in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our talks with him, Harkes said he would like to come
here,'' Revolution assistant coach Sid Mazzola said. ``Walter told
him what we would expect of him and what we would do for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality player and he can fill many positions on the
field. We are asking players to play for the team and do what needs
to be done. You can't have 11 balls out there. We want to have one
goal and do things together. That is going to require sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   D.C. United has exceeded the salary cap, as it did a year ago,
when it sent Raul Diaz Arce to the Revolution. Diaz Arce scored 18
goals for the Revolution, then was involved in a trade that brought
Giovanni Saverese from the MetroStars.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, though, remains in a contract dispute and has not
reported to preseason training. He was training with Napoli's B
team in Italy two weeks ago, then returned to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gio is desperately hoping to get this resolved so he can
report,'' Savarese's agent, Raul Mateu, said. ``He is excited about
being with a new team and the opportunity there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to let the team or the fans down, and he is
dying to get on the field. He is a 120 percent kind of guy and he
wants to put a good foot forward.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donovan expects Savarese to report this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players who come in late often either get fined or they hurt
their chances of making the team,'' O'Donovan said. ``But, as with
a lot of players who are moving, he has a couple of things to sort
out with the league and then he should be here.''

DAVIES, ON HIS OWN, GETTING THE KINKS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Davies may be a man without his main band, but he is not a
man adrift. The Kinks cofounder, lead guitarist, and sometime
singer-songwriter has learned to make his own plans. That's because
the Kinks' strings are pulled by Davies' older brother, main
singer-songwriter Ray, who has been off doing his own
music-and-chat ``Storyteller'' club gigs and other theatrical
projects for several years.
</P>
<P>
   So at 50, Dave Davies has moved on. He's released a double-disc,
``Unfinished Business: Dave Davies Kronikles 1963/1998'' (VelVel),
consisting of Kinks songs in which he's played a key part plus new
solo material. He has assembled his own band _
guitarist-keyboardist Dave Nolte, bassist David Jenkins, and
drummer Jim Laspesa _ and embarked upon several club tours.
</P>
<P>
   How has he taken to the shift from second fiddle to front man?
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it really easy,'' he says from his home in California.
``I'm really enjoying singing and that takes a while to get used to
when you don't do it all the time. But now I've done a few tours
and I'm into the light and the shade, the emotion of it.. . . I'm
having a ball playing with younger musicians who are really into
it, very supportive and sensitive to the music.''
</P>
<P>
   A cynic might say that after playing to thousands in the huge
arenas, a club tour must be something of a comedown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see that,'' says Davies. ``When we were doing
all those big '80s tours it got to a point where I'd walk in there
and we'd look at ourselves and it was very scary. It was cold
emotionally and became frightening places to go, and these horrible
big dark limousines. . . . The performing was getting a bit flat.
At least now, I can see the eyes of the audience. You get a
different feeling and you can have a bit of fun. I think it's a
revelation. I regard what I'm doing now as a step forward. You can
explore songs in a different way. It's a real eye-opener for me.''
</P>
<P>
   What does any of this mean for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
inductees, the Kinks? Is there a Kinks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd love to make another album as the Kinks,'' says
Davies. ``I don't know if it's a reality at all. We have talked
about it with our management. It's a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he talked it over with his brother?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we haven't discussed it,'' says Davies. This is no
surprise. The brothers Davies do not discuss much. When the Kinks
are a going concern, the two travel separately and rarely
acknowledge each other offstage. There is longstanding animosity, a
contentiousness and combativeness that goes beyond sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Dave Davies is doing a number of his brother's songs in
concert. ``I want to cover a portion of the Kinks history,'' he
says, `` 'cause you can't ignore that, and try and pull some more
obscure things out of the hat. Really, just perform songs that I
personally like of the Kinks and cover stuff from my other
projects, plus a few surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Kinks, says Davies, you never know which song will turn
out to be a classic. ``You're just pleased when they do. All the
best moments, all the magical events, are when you're lost in it
anyway. You don't realize what you're doing when you're doing it.
That's the best times.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's always kept my interest as a musician, on top of
everything else, is the diversity of the music. It's quite
interesting to be in a band like the Kinks 'cause you never quite
know where you're going to go with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, is it possible to love the song, but not the songwriter?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be love; I'm always going to love my
brother. I might not like his personality, but it doesn't prevent
me from loving him. I don't hate his works because he can be
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   You either separate the two, adds Davies, ``or go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Davies knows something about that process. ``I was going
totally insane,'' he says, of a point in the early '70s. ``I wasn't
really able to communicate with people because of all these weird
voices'' in his head. He felt he was headed for a breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to a point where I had to do something about this. I
didn't want to go crazy and I didn't want to die. That's when I
picked up a book on yoga, and then I got interested in astrology.
It was explaining my psyche for me in a way I could understand. It
helped piece my internal life together. . . . I know what it's like
to be in that dark place in our mind and it's really hard to get
out of it. It's like the demons in your mind. Whether they are
real, actual creatures or just weird chemical (stuff), I don't
think it matters. Whatever device you can conjure to get rid of
them, I think it doesn't matter what process you use.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies was once one of rock's many drug-inspired/addled,
bar-smashing, free-loving hedonists _ the kind of rocker who could
wake up in a hotel room on tour and not know what city or country
he was in. He is candid about those details in last year's
autobiography, ``Kink.''
</P>
<P>
   He still drinks, in moderation, but says his salvation has been
meditation. ``I don't know what I would do if I didn't meditate,''
he says. ``Yoga was the thing I studied first and that's always
been an important part of my life. I think it's essential in the
'90s to have some kind of meditative angle. Chanting is really
good; a mantra is a very powerful process. My spirituality is the
most important part in my life. And it's all connected to
everything else, music, having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davies says he wrote the book in order to clarify history and to
entertain readers. Maybe to purge, too. ``Carrying around all that
stuff inside you is not healthy,'' he says. ``Although some of it
was quite painful, some of the emotional stuff about (my family),
it was really important to get out, like shedding a skin.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Kink,'' Davies also wrote about his spiritual life _ a
Hindu/Buddhist/Christain blend _ and about the benevolent aliens
that came calling for him, telepathically. During the telephone
interview, there was a disruption on the line, a clankity-clank
sound as if someone has fallen down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a weird creature on the phone,'' says Davies.
</P>
<P>
   One of those aliens?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I thought it was for a minute,'' says Davies,
laughing slightly. Joking a bit, Davies is poking a little fun at
himself. He knows his theories are rather far-fetched, but he also
says, ``I mean, whatever works. And there is always a chance that I
may be totally right, as well.''

KOSOVO DOCTORS RISK THEIR LIVES BY TREATING SICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIKATOVO, Yugoslavia _ The wails of sick children, their faces
pink with fever, fill the tiny, unheated clinic in this ethnic
Albanian hillside village. Worried mothers and grandmothers press
against the door of Dr. Abedin Halilaj, desperate to make it into
the sparse examining room to see the area's only doctor.
</P>
<P>
   But Halilaj, whose office has just a bed, a wooden table and a
plastic container of tongue depressors, doesn't have much to offer
the 200 people who visit him daily for help. ``I don't have
medicine. I can give them only hope,'' said Halilaj, as he handed a
7-month-old child back to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Halilaj himself is also working at great personal risk: As a
doctor trying to treat patients during Kosovo's civil conflict
between ruling Serbs and ethnic Albanians, he faces harassment,
imprisonment, and even death. With the conflict worsening and the
front lines unclear, being a doctor in rural Kosovo has become a
very, very dangerous job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always tense, and have fear,'' Halilaj said. ``But my
feeling is I have to do this for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the conflict began about a year ago, local physicians
report that four doctors have been murdered, three wounded, 28
arrested, and 19 invited by Serb police for ``informative talks,''
which the physicians call intimidating. Three other medical workers
_ a Serb doctor, a Serb medical assistant, and an Albanian doctor _
have disappeared and are feared dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics, gathered by local doctors, have been generally
backed by the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights. The group
has been assessing the situation here, collecting data going back
to last October. A full report on the situation is expected next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrying medicine is almost as dangerous as carrying guns'' in
Kosovo, said Michael Sullivan, who took a leave from the Tufts
University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy to assist the
physicians' group in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs regard many Albanian physicians as the enemy, an
extension of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Sullivan said. ``People
practicing in places under KLA control are almost seen as being KLA
doctors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Miodrag Kovac, the Yugoslav Minister of Health, Labor and
Social Services, brushed aside questions about the dangers doctors
here face. ``There is no more danger to them than other people
face,'' Kovac said in an interview in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kovac and Dr. Rade Grbic, manager of Pristina's main
hospital, said doctors and patients should not work or go ``outside
the system'' of official health care in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every doctor who works inside the official health care system
is safe, whether they are Albanian or Serb,'' said Grbic.
</P>
<P>
   Two efforts to enter the Pristina hospital to talk to Serb
doctors were refused. A guard said only Grbic was permitted to talk
to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in the interests of the terrorists to be treated in the
official hospital, because once you are a patient, you can get
proper health care,'' Kovac said.
</P>
<P>
   His comments are at odds with reports gathered by local doctors
and Physicians for Human Rights. Local Albanian doctors have
counted 103 cases of mistreatment of Albanian patients, including
beatings, in the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Four patients have been denied access, said a prominent local
physician, who asked that his name not be used because he fears for
his life. Further, ``the situation is worse than the situation I
present,'' because not all cases could be confirmed, this doctor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said Physicians for Human Rights had counted 75 cases
of abuse from October to December, as well as cases of torture,
police harassment, and forced flight of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The local doctor said police cut off the hand of surgeon Lec
Ukaj, head of a health care facility in Glogovac. They later
executed him.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Aleksander Stanojevic, a Serb doctor in the
town of Orahovac, was kidnapped in July, along with his Serb
medical technician. Neither has been heard from since, and locals
fear they were taken by the KLA and killed.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Krajkov, medical workers have a heightened
fear, since a doctor at the clinic, Hafir Shala, disappeared last
April after being detained by police. Shala was taking medicine
from the provincial capital of Pristina to his clinic. He was
accompanied by another doctor and a medical technician. The other
doctor and technician never saw Shala again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are afraid. But there is a very big need, so we
sacrifice,'' said Xhemajl Selimi, a worker at the Krajkov clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The village is in KLA territory, protected by
Kalashnikov-bearing guerrillas. ``This is the population,'' Selimi
said. ``There are people from the population that are KLA. It's
normal that we will take care of them. The only thing that protects
us is the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Murders and disappearances have scared 52 physicians away from
Kosovo, leaving patients in the area with minimal health care,
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are doctors, medicines are few. Even with help from
international aid organizations, there is not remotely enough
medicine to care for the Kosovar population, doctors said. And the
``clinics'' in some cases are no bigger than a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need is so big,'' said Abdirahim Idrizi-Pronari, head of
the Galaxy clinic in Pristina, a private facility. ``When the
medicine comes, it's like pouring a glass of water into the whole
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   People are dying because they cannot get basic care, Halilaj and
other doctors said. Many of Kosovo's 300,000 refugees were forced
to live in the mountains last year, with few clothes and little
food. The refugees have made the health crisis worse, the
physicians said.
</P>
<P>
   Kada Hamdielshani, 27 and ready to give birth any day now, has
been told that her pregnancy has complications, and that the local
clinic cannot handle the upcoming birth. She said she is ill, along
with her husband and two other children, from the week the family
spent living in the mountains, after the Serb offensive against
their Krajkova village in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, I am OK, but the baby is worse,'' Hamdielshani said
as she sat on a mat in the family's bare, two-room home. ``I have
nowhere to give birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The health care system for Albanians in Kosovo has worsened
markedly since 1990, when Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
took away Kosovo's political autonomy. After that, 2,000 Albanian
doctors were fired from the Kosovar health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few Albanian doctors remain in the hospitals, which Serb
police patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians for Human Rights hopes to bring Albanian and Serb
doctors together to fight for medical neutrality, Sullivan said. In
the meantime, the group has called for NATO action, including the
use of ground troops, to calm the situation on the ground and to
protect the citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might seem to some to be out of the realm of a human
rights organization,'' he said. ``But there's been a continuous
series of abuses that haven't ended.''

SEPHARDIC JEWS FIND REASONS TO ABANDON LIKUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OFAKIM, Israel _ One-time construction worker Yigal Hazan leaned
against a crumbling wall across from the cramped house where he
grew up and ticks off the reasons why his life is going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   He has not had a job in over a year and factories in the area
are looking to lay off workers, not hire new ones. His mother can't
sell the stucco family home because nobody in Ofakim has money to
buy and nobody outside wants to move to this bleak place where
heavy rains bring out the stink of raw sewage.
</P>
<P>
   And to make matters worse, 30-year-old Hazan, the son of
Moroccan Jewish immigrants who were settled by the government in
this town on the edge of the Negev Desert in the 1950s, can do
little more than dream of getting married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls these days want someone with money, or at least a job,''
said Hazan, with just a trace of bitterness on his face. ``Who is
going to marry me?''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why when elections come in May, Hazan plans to abandon
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the right-wing Likud party.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Likud has commanded the support of Hazan and his
neighbors. Hazan has decided to vote for Ehud Barak, leader of the
Labor party, which is usually shunned by voters here as a group of
Ashkenazi, or European, elitists more interested in the
Palestinians than in the plight of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it simply, Netanyahu did nothing for us and I don't see
why I should vote for him anymore and, I think, a lot of other
people here feel the same way,'' said Hazan, who did not want his
real last name used.
</P>
<P>
   Hazan's decision could portend trouble for Netanyahu, who rose
to power in 1996 thanks to the votes of ``Oriental'' or Sephardic
Jews _ people from North Africa, like Hazan, and others from Asia
or Arab countries in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In the last elections, nearly 80 percent of the votes for
Netanyahu and Likud came from Sephardic voters nationwide. This
figure was almost the same in Ofakim and is part of the decades-old
trend of Sephardic support for Likud.
</P>
<P>
   But old ties may be weakening in Israel. Netanyahu has been hit
hard with high-level defections by Sephardic colleagues, such as
the departure last year of his former Finance Minister David Levy,
a Moroccan Jew. And last week Netanyahu dismissed Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, who hailed from Iraqi Kurdistan. Mordechai
immediately joined a group of other Likud defectors in a new
centrist party that he now heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have left Likud _ they can't all be wrong,'' said
Pinchas Danino, the owner of Ofakim's main wedding hall, as he
sipped a cup of coffee with his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Moroccan-born Danino is another die-hard Likud voter, or at
least he was until recently. He wouldn't mind voting for Mordechai,
but said he prefers Barak because he thinks the Labor leader has a
better chance.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Danino has any complaints personally _ no matter
how bad things get people always need to get married _ but he's
tired of what he sees around him. Unemployment in Ofakim is around
10 percent, and 25 percent of the mainly Sephardic residents live
at or below the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that Netanyahu got 80 percent of the vote here and
things are still so bad? He had to give something back, like bring
factories,'' said Danino.
</P>
<P>
   Still, political analysts and Sephardic voters who dislike Likud
say it will not be easy to convince this bloc of voters to change
its allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Sephardic Jews in Israel are likely to be poorer and less
educated than the European, or Ashkenazi Jews. They also tend to be
more nationalistic and less trusting of any political compromise
with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   These two factors translated into overwhelming support for the
Likud party, which first took office in 1977 with a platform
championing the underdog and promoting a Greater Israel that would
include the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   But even if voters have not changed their outlook, the parties
themselves are changing.
</P>
<P>
   The ideological divide between Likud and Labor all but collapsed
last year when Netanyahu signed the Wye Agreement to hand over more
of the West Bank to Palestinian self-rule, thereby continuing the
Oslo peace process started by assassinated Labor Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, when the ideological difference is so small,
you have to vote for what's good for yourself personally,'' said
Shlomo Abuksis, another disaffected Likud voter in Ofakim.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has faltered so much since Likud took office _
partly because of the lack of investor confidence due to problems
with the peace process _ that any party that promises new jobs may
look good.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yitzhak Mordechai is now Israel's first Sephardic
candidate for prime minister, which could weaken Likud's hold over
the Sephardic vote.
</P>
<P>
   All this reinforces the view that the Sephardic vote must be
carefully wooed this time. Netanyahu presumably knows this: In 1996
he won the top post with a margin of less than one percent.

FRIEND'S COMPLAINT GIVES BIRTH TO ON-LINE CREDIT SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What began as a side business to support a
couple of would-be graduate students has flourished into a
full-time Internet venture that provides credit reports to
consumers in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Eze and Arash Saffarnia, former physics classmates at San
Francisco State University, never made it to grad school, but their
company, QSpace Inc., has sold 100,000 credit reports since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need credit for a lot of things,'' Eze said. ``Once
they know their credit, they can say, `I can get a better
(interest) rate somewhere else.' It empowers consumers so they can
judge what's a good deal, what's a bad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   QSpace is expanding its service to small banks so they can
process loans on-line.
</P>
<P>
   QSpace retrieves credit information through a software product
developed by the company that cross-references highly sensitive
information, such as birth dates, Social Security numbers,
addresses and bank account numbers, through databases at the three
major credit bureaus. The service has been endorsed by the
International Computer Security Association, the Better Business
Bureau, and TRUSTe, a nonprofit organization that works on security
standards for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   QSpace is monitored by the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   To receive a credit report from QSpace, a customer fills out a
form on the company's subsidiary Web site (www.icreditreport.com).
A credit card is required to purchase reports, which cost $8 each.
It takes about 30 seconds to get a report.
</P>
<P>
   Eze said customers can print the reports and use the information
in them when they go to buy big-ticket items like homes, cars and
electronic products. He said getting reports through credit bureaus
may cost about the same but can take days to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Eze, 27, is a native of Nigeria, and Saffarnia, 28, was born in
Iran. They got the idea for their on-line credit report service
from a friend who had been apartment hunting and became frustrated
by the expensive credit-check process.
</P>
<P>
   Their friend said it cost her between $20 and $25 for each
credit check made by apartment managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the genesis of the company,'' Eze said. ``We thought
this could be done easily over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   They used about $100,000 from friends and Los Angeles venture
capitalist Peter Balas to develop software that cross-references
credit bureau information to ``authenticate'' the identity of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at CyberCash Inc., a Reston, Va.-based company that
processes on-line credit card purchases, later invested $2.5
million in QSpace.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which last month moved from Oakland to San
Francisco, employs 18 people and has plans to add 10 over the next
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Saffarnia said QSpace is working on a service that would allow
customers to correct mistakes on their credit reports. The company
has just started to outfit banks and loan-guarantee companies with
its service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought was that since there are certain risk criteria set
up by banks on whether they can approve a loan or not, they should
be able to do this on-line,'' Eze said.
</P>
<P>
   QSpace's target market is small banks because major financial
institutions have the capital and resources to create their own
on-line loan guarantee businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eze said 1999 sales for QSpace should reach about $10 million _
10 times what the company earned in 1998. QSpace expects to become
profitable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It remains uncertain how QSpace will fare against well-known and
bigger companies that might provide similar services.
</P>
<P>
   James Punishill, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a
technology market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said QSpace
may be one of a few on-line consumer credit companies today, but
the major credit bureaus are working on ways to provide information
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sensitive information. It takes somebody who's very
comfortable with the Internet to give up financial data. This is
not like buying a book through Amazon.com. Getting consumer trust
is not an insignificant task,'' Punishill said.
</P>
<P>
   He said even if QSpace targets only small financial
institutions, the company doesn't have an easy road ahead, adding:
``It's going to take a while for them to build up trust and
penetrate the market.''

SWEAT LODGE OK A 1ST FOR DEATH ROW  
 (ADV: SIDEBAR MATERIAL AT END) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Ariz. - Convicted murderer Darrick Gerlaugh spent two
hours inside a sweat lodge, praying and purifying himself as he
prepared for his impending death.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Feb. 3, at 3 p.m., Gerlaugh faces execution by
lethal injection for a murder committed in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He will be the first Native American to be executed in Arizona
since the death penalty was restored in 1976. On Saturday, he made
history by becoming the first Native American with a death warrant
to be allowed to have the ancient ceremony as part of his last
rites.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh will be the sixth Native American to be executed in the
United States since 1976, according to the Death Penalty
Information Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The five previous Native Americans requested sweat lodge
ceremonies and were denied because of security concerns, said Lenny
Foster, Gerlaugh's spiritual adviser and a coordinator for the
National Native American Prisoners' Rights Advocacy Coalition.
Courts have upheld security as reasons to deny religious access to
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Department of Corrections, though, recognized the
significance of the ceremony and granted the request, Director
Terry L. Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were a Catholic, we could in essence bring the religious
practice to him if he wanted to participate in any of the
sacraments,'' Stewart said. ``We cannot bring the sweat lodge to
him.'' Instead, prison officials were able to grant his request
without endangering anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It establishes a precedent throughout the United States,''
Foster said. ``It allows Darrick Gerlaugh to make some peace with
himself and allows us to demonstrate to Arizona and prison
officials across the country that there were no problems. The
Arizona Department of Corrections needs to be commended for their
understanding and respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrections rules prohibited outside witnesses at the ceremony,
but Foster, who was with Gerlaugh in the sweat lodge, shared
details and spoke on the convict's behalf. Gerlaugh, 38, has
declined all interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of peace and serenity and a little
sadness,'' Foster said Saturday. ``The sweat lodge ceremony
provided him one last opportunity to cleanse his mind and body and
purify, to make things right with his Creator. He has made prayers
for his family and the victims. He's making things right for
himself so he can be at peace as he goes to the next world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh grew up away from the Gila River Indian Community in a
military family with an Anglo father and a Pima mother. He knew
little about traditional Indian practices. He had been involved in
drugs and alcohol and already had a prior conviction that was
punishable by life in prison before he killed 22-year-old Scott
Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh and two friends, all Chandler residents, were
hitchhiking from Chandler to Phoenix on Jan. 24, 1980, and decided
to rob the person who offered them a ride. Schwartz, who wore a leg
brace and walked with crutches, picked them up. At gunpoint, they
ordered Schwartz to drive to the outskirts of Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   The other two men held Schwartz while Gerlaugh, then 19, drove
the car over Schwartz several times. The victim did not appear to
be dead so Gerlaugh and one man stabbed Schwartz 30 to 40 times in
the head, neck and shoulders with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   The men took $36 and the car. Gerlaugh and Joseph Encinas were
convicted of first-degree murder. Encinas received a life sentence.
The other man, Matthew Leisure, pleaded guilty and received a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh received the death penalty in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed many times a deep remorse over what he had
done,'' Foster said. ``He knew he couldn't change what he did so he
chose to pray and ask forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's family declined to comment on the scheduled
execution.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh has been on a spiritual path to discover and practice
his culture, tradition and beliefs for most of his 18 years on
death row, according to Foster, who is the director of the Navajo
Nation Corrections Project based in Window Rock. Gerlaugh has
participated in nine previous sweat lodge ceremonies over 15 years,
Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 7,000 Native Americans are in U.S. prisons, and about 4
percent of Arizona's 25,829 inmates are Native American.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweat lodge is the most profound therapy for Indians who
are incarcerated but it has been denied many, many times,'' Foster
said. ``Spiritually, you are moved to take a deep look at your
inner self, your shortcomings, your actions, behavior. It allows
insight to who you are as a human being. If you're not in harmony
with your surroundings and yourself, the sweat lodge is one way to
become right with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been more progressive than other states, said
Foster, who performed the first sweat lodge ceremony at an Arizona
prison in 1981. In 1992, a sweat lodge area was consecrated in one
of the Florence prison's two highest security units, which is where
Gerlaugh's ceremony was held.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh will have a final pipe ceremony today and be moved to
the death house to await execution. Foster will spend today and
Wednesday with him, and Gerlaugh has requested his family not be
present at the execution.
</P>
<P>
   Gerlaugh has withdrawn his request for a clemency board hearing,
and his lawyer contends there is almost no chance at a stay of
execution.
</P>
<P>
   His appeals have been exhausted except for a recent filing
citing Gerlaugh's dramatic behavior change, said Marty Lieberman,
his court-appointed attorney since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this claim a lot and it never goes anywhere,'' said
Paul McMurdie, the chief counsel in the criminal appeals section at
the Arizona Attorney General's Office. ``We are punishing him not
for the person he is on death row today. We are punishing him for
the crimes and the actions he took 19 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurdie added that the crime was one of the more brutal among
those committed by the inmates who are on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about death usually is taboo for Native Americans, but
in Gerlaugh's case it is unavoidable, Foster said. He needed to
prepare for the return to his ancestors, and now he is ready to
accept his fate.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's sweat lodge played a significant part in that peace,
Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the sweat lodge on Saturday, Foster and Gerlaugh prayed
and sang in Navajo and beat a drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some very good prayers were made. The spirits were with us,''
Foster said. ``I felt a real sense of blessing, knowing that this
was his last sweat lodge ceremony. He stated to me that he was glad
he decided to relearn his spirituality, his prayers and songs, the
traditions of his people. He was happy. He was at peace with his
maker.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Native Americans on death row &QL; 
 &QL; 
- In the United States, 50 of the 3,517 inmates on death row are
Native American. Since 1976, five of the 510 executions were Native
Americans. &QL; 
- Five of the 120 inmates with Arizona death sentences are Native
American. No Native American has been executed in Arizona. &QL;

TRIBE PLAYS IT SAFE, INVESTS CASINO PROFITS IN ITS FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ONAMIA, Minn. _ She is an owner of two enormously profitable
casinos, but Agnes Pendegayosh lives in a small home and, at 68,
works part time in a school cafeteria to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her neighbors, also casino owners, live in tumbledown
houses thirsty for paint. Some sweep floors for a living, some
sling cold cuts in a sandwich shop, and some clean septic tanks.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, most wouldn't have it any other way.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking departure from the high-rolling ways of many other
casino-owning tribes, the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Indians has
committed itself to a get-rich-slow scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dividing casino profits among individuals, the
3,100-member band has built roads, schools, a health clinic, and a
community center, strengthened its tribal government, financed a
legal battle to preserve age-old hunting and fishing rights, and
invested for a future that may or may not include gambling.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the overwhelming bulk of casino proceeds _ tens of
millions of dollars each year _ is being used in a way that Wall
Street might deride as collectivism, and Americans focused on
individual wealth might find odd. But most members of the Mille
Lacs Band of Ojibwe find it as natural as their ancestors pooling a
harvest of wild rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting our money into the community because there are
so many unmet needs here. After 150 years of poverty, it's going to
take a long time to catch up,'' said Chief Executive Marge
Anderson, the architect of the band's financial strategy.
</P>
<P>
   And so, individuals receive only droplets of the torrent of cash
flowing into tribal accounts, the profits from more than $200
million in yearly casino revenue. For years, each band member was
given only an annual $500 ``bonus''; it was raised last year to
$750. By contrast, every member of another casino-owning Minnesota
tribe receives more than $600,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, handing people a check every month and not asking them
to work for it is just another form of welfare. We've worked too
long and too hard getting people off public assistance to go that
way,'' said Anderson, the first woman elected as the band's chief
executive, a job she has held since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even band members who may not live to see the full flowering of
Anderson's plan say they embrace the wisdom of it and consider it
their obligation to build a stable, self-sustaining economy for
their grandchildren's grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the money,'' said Pendegayosh, who like many band
members is a distant relation to Anderson. ``I have a lot of
great-grandchildren _ 16, no, 17 _ and that money is going to help
them and their kids, when they come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling authorities say most of the 183 tribes involved in the
$6-billion-a-year Indian casino industry have spread wealth among
individuals. Most have undertaken community and tribal government
projects as well, as envisioned by the 10-year-old law that cleared
the way for Indian casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing criticism from non-Indians _ particularly government
officials eager to reduce federal aid to tribes _ details of such
payments are jealously guarded. But one notable example is the more
than $600,000 in yearly dividends to every member of the small
Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux tribe, owners of the Mystic Lake Casino
south of Minneapolis. After decades of crushing poverty, tribe
members there have built huge homes and bought fancy cars,
replacing rusted trailers and old heaps.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequots, owners of the
fabulously successful Foxwoods Resort Casino, have showered
individual members with money, while also building schools and a
museum, and making charitable and political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the Mille Lacs Band is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most tribes, the leaders would probably be thrown out of
office for not making these kind of payments when a casino is that
successful,'' said I. Nelson Rose, a professor of law at Whittier
Law School in California and an authority on Indian gambling. ``To
focus first on community, anywhere in American society at the turn
of the millennium, is extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's vision has held sway since 1991, when the band opened
its first Grand Casino here on the banks of Mille Lacs Lake, about
two hours north of Minneapolis. A second Grand Casino opened a year
later in Hinckley, an hour's drive east.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the tribe's financial priorities, it helps to
understand Anderson, a 66-year-old great-grandmother of three.
</P>
<P>
   Born on the band's 6,000-acre reservation, Anderson grew up in
conditions common to Native Americans for much of the past century.
Home was a tar-paper shack with no electricity, no indoor plumbing.
Within her band, unemployment, alcoholism, and infant mortality
were high; life expectancy and hope were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business we ever tried failed,'' she said. ``We were so
poor that we just lived day to day, off the land.'' She recalls
being teased in school about her Indian language, her worn clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mille Lacs children have no fear of that: They attend their
own schools, built with casino money. The band has spent $20
million on public building construction, with another $20 million
in the pipeline. The results include two new ceremonial buildings,
a health clinic with another planned, a center for the elderly, two
community centers and two more planned, and a new government
center.
</P>
<P>
   And in the past seven years, a tribal housing authority has
built about 160 homes, many of which have been sold to members with
low-interest mortgages. Casino profits also have funded
multimillion-dollar infrastructure improvements, including a
200,000-gallon water tower, new roads, and a regional
wastewater-treatment plant under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Millions more are being poured into savings, for the lean times
that used to characterize the band's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Such projects could not continue without gambling money, and
there is widespread concern among tribes that Indian casino profits
will fall or disappear as a result of new federal taxes, added
competition, or changes in state or federal laws. That fear is
particularly acute among tribes in Minnesota, where bar owners
statewide and the Canterbury Downs racetrack near Minneapolis have
been clamoring for slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, anytime a tribe had anything _ trees, land,
mineral rights, fishing rights _ somebody came along and tried to
take it away, with the justification that it was what the masses
want. Now it's the same way with casinos,'' said Don Wedll, the
band's commissioner of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Mille Lacs Band has undertaken a broad economic
diversification program, including the $10 million purchase of a 40
percent share in a fledgling bottled water company that intends to
build bottling plants on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its casino-related hotels, restaurants, and small
businesses, the band also spent $3.4 million to buy a local bank _
making it the country's first Indian-owned, nationally chartered
bank. It also owns a gas station/convenience store, a commercial
bakery, and a Subway franchise. Low-interest business loans have
enabled band members to launch 28 small businesses, including a
beauty salon, a karate studio, a construction company, a septic
tank-cleaning service, and a horse ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of these businesses is not going to make it, but
we've got to take some risks. If the band doesn't try to grow into
other businesses, the impact of these seven years of casinos won't
last,'' said Kenneth Mimmack, the band's commissioner of corporate
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the band has spent more than $1 million in a
court battle with the state of Minnesota and a group of landowners
over an 1837 treaty that the band says guarantees it traditional
hunting and fishing rights. The case is now before the US Supreme
Court, and a decision expected this spring could have widespread
implications for tribal treaties nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Though Anderson enjoys broad support among band members, her
approach has recently faced some pressure from within to increase
the money given to band members.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the band elected a new number two official,
secretary/treasurer Herb Weyaus, who makes no secret of his
differences of opinion with Anderson and who wants to see
individuals receive a bigger cut of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're the owner, there's supposed to be some
profit-sharing. With all the money we have, our kids shouldn't be
going to school in second-hand clothes,'' Weyaus said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson is standing firm. ``When I see the day all our
people's needs are met, that's when I'll talk about per-capita
payments. There's a long way to go before that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, she worries she will not survive _ either politically
or personally _ to fully secure the band's future. ``Sometimes I
think I'll wake up and all this will have been a dream,'' Anderson
said. ``We have so much more to do, and I think sometimes that
somebody could just come and undo everything that's happened here.
That's my greatest fear.''

FRIEND'S COMPLAINT GIVES BIRTH TO ON-LINE CREDIT SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What began as a side business to support a
couple of would-be graduate students has flourished into a
full-time Internet venture that provides credit reports to
consumers in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ike Eze and Arash Saffarnia, former physics classmates at San
Francisco State University, never made it to grad school, but their
company, QSpace Inc., has sold 100,000 credit reports since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers need credit for a lot of things,'' Eze said. ``Once
they know their credit, they can say, `I can get a better
(interest) rate somewhere else.' It empowers consumers so they can
judge what's a good deal, what's a bad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   QSpace is expanding its service to small banks so they can
process loans on-line.
</P>
<P>
   QSpace retrieves credit information through a software product
developed by the company that cross-references highly sensitive
information, such as birth dates, Social Security numbers,
addresses and bank account numbers, through databases at the three
major credit bureaus. The service has been endorsed by the
International Computer Security Association, the Better Business
Bureau, and TRUSTe, a nonprofit organization that works on security
standards for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   QSpace is monitored by the Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   To receive a credit report from QSpace, a customer fills out a
form on the company's subsidiary Web site (www.icreditreport.com).
A credit card is required to purchase reports, which cost $8 each.
It takes about 30 seconds to get a report.
</P>
<P>
   Eze said customers can print the reports and use the information
in them when they go to buy big-ticket items like homes, cars and
electronic products. He said getting reports through credit bureaus
may cost about the same but can take days to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Eze, 27, is a native of Nigeria, and Saffarnia, 28, was born in
Iran. They got the idea for their on-line credit report service
from a friend who had been apartment hunting and became frustrated
by the expensive credit-check process.
</P>
<P>
   Their friend said it cost her between $20 and $25 for each
credit check made by apartment managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the genesis of the company,'' Eze said. ``We thought
this could be done easily over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   They used about $100,000 from friends and Los Angeles venture
capitalist Peter Balas to develop software that cross-references
credit bureau information to ``authenticate'' the identity of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at CyberCash Inc., a Reston, Va.-based company that
processes on-line credit card purchases, later invested $2.5
million in QSpace.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which last month moved from Oakland to San
Francisco, employs 18 people and has plans to add 10 over the next
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Saffarnia said QSpace is working on a service that would allow
customers to correct mistakes on their credit reports. The company
has just started to outfit banks and loan-guarantee companies with
its service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our thought was that since there are certain risk criteria set
up by banks on whether they can approve a loan or not, they should
be able to do this on-line,'' Eze said.
</P>
<P>
   QSpace's target market is small banks because major financial
institutions have the capital and resources to create their own
on-line loan guarantee businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Eze said 1999 sales for QSpace should reach about $10 million _
10 times what the company earned in 1998. QSpace expects to become
profitable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It remains uncertain how QSpace will fare against well-known and
bigger companies that might provide similar services.
</P>
<P>
   James Punishill, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a
technology market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., said QSpace
may be one of a few on-line consumer credit companies today, but
the major credit bureaus are working on ways to provide information
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sensitive information. It takes somebody who's very
comfortable with the Internet to give up financial data. This is
not like buying a book through Amazon.com. Getting consumer trust
is not an insignificant task,'' Punishill said.
</P>
<P>
   He said even if QSpace targets only small financial
institutions, the company doesn't have an easy road ahead, adding:
``It's going to take a while for them to build up trust and
penetrate the market.''

   The 1.2-million-square-foot building will be built on a site now
used as the parking lot for the downtown YMCA, which is working
with Enron to come up with an alternative parking plan.
</P>
<P>
   Enron will begin moving some employees into the building in the
summer of 2001, Lay said.
</P>
<P>
   The new building, which has not been named, will become the main
headquarters of Enron, a Houston-based firm that produces natural
gas, electricity and operates power plants.
</P>
<P>
   After the new building is completed, Enron will continue to
occupy the Enron Building, a 50-story tower in downtown.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston-based developer, Hines, will handle development of the
$200 million Enron building. Hines has developed scores of major
projects in Houston and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The new Enron building will be a silvery, glass-skinned
structure designed by Cesar Pelli &AMP; Associates of New Haven, Conn.
The Pelli architecture firm is led by Cesar Pelli, former dean of
the architecture school at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Pelli designed the tallest office buildings in the world, the
Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At 1,483 feet each,
the Petronas Towers surpass the height of the 1,453-foot Sears
Tower in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-story base of the new Enron Building will contain four
55,000-square-foot trading floors, where traders will buy and sell
electricity and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Enron needs the new building because office space for big
expansions downtown is impossible to find, said Lay, in a telephone
interview from Switzerland, where he was attending an economic
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really need a lot of additional space to accommodate our
growth,'' Lay said. ``Class A office space in Houston is really
very tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Enron, which has 5,500 employees now, expects to add another
1,500 employees to its payroll by the time the building is
complete, Lay said. The company is one of the biggest employers in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Lay said Enron eventually will vacate most of the 500,000 square
feet it occupies in the Three Allen Center building in downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new office building, Enron will build a
1,300-space parking garage on a half-block it owns.
</P>
<P>
   Enron is becoming a major force in downtown Houston. In addition
to the new office tower, Enron is also negotiating with the Houston
Astros about becoming a prominent sponsor for the new downtown
stadium, which is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new Enron tower will inject a significant amount of new
momentum into downtown Houston, said veteran office broker Jeff
Black of Insite Commercial Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, big boost for downtown. It's very positive,''
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The vacancy rate in the major office towers in downtown is less
than 5 percent and finding space is difficult for big companies.
</P>
<P>
   With strong job growth, Houston has made considerable progress
in leasing its office space.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when the Heritage Plaza, the last new downtown tower to
be built, was completed, it remained vacant for many months until a
major portion was leased by Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, when the city was coming out of its economic
doldrums, the Houston office vacancy rate was more than 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With that much space vacant, there was no need for new office
buildings in Houston for years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the citywide vacancy rate is at 12.6 percent, down from
15.2 percent at the end of 1997, according to the Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield realty firm. Companies such as Continental Airlines and
Houston Industries have leased big chunks of downtown office space
recently.
</P>
<P>
   A number of developers also have been crafting plans for
downtown office towers: Means-Knaus, TrizecHahn, Century
Development, Crescent Real Estate Equities and the Wedge Group.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those developers has broken ground yet. A
significant amount of pre-leasing will be required for a developer
to get financing for a new tower downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's suburbs are a different story. With 32 suburban
buildings under construction, Houston currently ranks third in the
nation in new office construction behind Dallas and Washington,
D.C.

MAKEUP BOUTIQUES LOWER SALES PRESSURE, INCREASE CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Makeup shopping at department stores can be so
disenchanting. Either the clerks ignore you or they give you the
hard sell, pushing products you don't need. It's always too dark to
judge colors. And then there are the prices. Is it possible to
leave a store these days without dropping $65 for, say, one bottle
of foundation and a powder puff?
</P>
<P>
   It's because department stores have alienated so many women that
an alternative breed of retailer is gaining momentum _
free-standing makeup stores.
</P>
<P>
   Filled with daylight, funky music, and a sales staff not on
commission, the boutiques are a fun destination for beauty fanatics
such as Nicole Lawrence, who shops for makeup four times a week to
supplement her collection of hundreds of lipsticks as well as
eyeshadows and other goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smaller boutiques are definitely the way to go,'' says
Lawrence, a graphic designer. ``Whenever I go to Bloomingdale's or
Neiman's, I get really stressed. It's fast-paced. They rush you. Or
they're rude.''
</P>
<P>
   E6 apothecary, a cosmetics boutique on Newbury Street, has
almost a slumber-party ambience. Women like Lisa Cohen, a
dietitian, eagerly crowd around the lipsticks, nail polishes,
foundations, and blushes that line the walls. ``It's a quieter
setting. The people in the store don't specialize in one brand, so
you're able to learn about different products,'' says Cohen, who
brought in her 10 bridesmaids to be made up for her September
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Behrakis, E6's owner and a former makeup artist at Saks
Fifth Avenue, opened the store six months ago with two former Saks
co-workers. The makeup enthusiast says she was motivated because a
lot of the hot, cutting-edge lines talked about in Vogue, Allure,
and Marie Claire weren't available in Boston. ``I thought it was
absurd,'' she says. ``People who are really addicted to beauty
products . . . don't just stick to one line anymore. They want the
best of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   E6 offers about 25 cultist makeup lines, including Shu Uemura,
Philosophy, and LORAC. The sales staff _ all makeup artists _ hand
out samples of products for customers to take home and try. The
reaction? ``We've never seen so many repeat customers in our
life,'' says Behrakis. ``They come weekly. It's like a candy shop
for women.'' And women aren't just taking the samples. Behrakis
reports her store has had $250,000 in sales in the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Melchin approaches beauty with a ``try before you buy''
philosophy as well. Her Lily's Apothecary in Plymouth, which opened
in July, features a pedestal sink where customers sometimes spend
45 minutes experimenting with various foundations, blushes, and
other cosmetics. When they're done, they wash it all off. Melchin's
hard-to-find lines, which are often promoted in fashion magazines
(including Diego Dalla Palma, AnneMarie Borlind, and Ahava from
Israel), have drawn customers from as far away as New Hampshire and
Manhattan. ``Women love this stuff,'' says Melchin. ``It's
self-empowerment. It's a huge stress reliever to give yourself half
an hour in the morning for self-care.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the chance to grab a slice of the lucrative
cosmetics business hasn't gone unnoticed by savvy retail chains.
Recently, Bath &AMP; Body Works announced plans to unveil a collection
of cosmetics _ including foundation, lipstick, eyeliner, and blush
_ this month. Prices will range from an affordable $4.50 to $12.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Victoria's Secret introduced a makeup line in
September. The line includes powder for $15, eye pencils for $10,
and lipstick for $12.50. (Both Victoria's Secret and Bath &AMP; Body
Works are owned by The Limited Inc.)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Inc., a Boston bath and body-care company, began selling
its own line of lip color and nail polish in its Newbury Street and
Manhattan stores in September. And since then makeup has averaged
12 to 15 percent of sales, says spokeswoman Kelly Brown. ``It's had
an amazing beginning,'' she says. And now Fresh plans to roll out
eye color and blush. ``I feel confident we could double sales,''
she adds.
</P>
<P>
   With customers like Elizabeth Keer, a Back Bay secretary, that
shouldn't be hard. Keer spends $200 a month on eyeliners, mascara,
lipstick, and foundation. ``If you come to my bathroom, it's like
`Oh my God,' '' she says. While Keer used to be a department store
fan, now she prefers Fresh. ``I'm already a beauty queen. I don't
need someone giving me a hard sell.''

WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington was in a swivet over language again last week _ and
this little storm is likely to cause heavy verbal accumulations
before it's through with us. (On the plus side, at least it's not
about sex.)
</P>
<P>
   It all began when David Howard, an aide to D.C.'s new mayor,
Anthony Williams, offended a staff member by using the word
niggardly in a discussion. Howard knew that niggardly, meaning
miserly, was not related to the n-word it resembles: Niggard is
Middle English, probably from Old Norse, while that other word
comes from the Latinate languages' word for ``black.'' The employee
who stormed out, accusing Howard of racism, was apparently less
well informed, and in the ensuing turmoil, Howard resigned.
</P>
<P>
   A nutty situation? Yes, and everyone except the muddleheaded
mayor _ who says he may rehire Howard for a different job _ seems
to agree that a valued employee should not be forced out because of
someone else's deficient vocabulary. But for many commentators, the
episode will be an excuse for another tirade on ``political
correctness'' and its threat to the integrity of our language. I
can hear John McLaughlin already: ``First they stole gay, then we
couldn't say cripple, and now they're banning niggardly?''
</P>
<P>
   Doomsaying can be a lot of fun. Writing about the Washington
imbroglio in the Wall Street Journal, Richard Dooling imagines that
a nip in the air and a chink in the armor might be banned, and even
that you could get in trouble if you were standing next to a Jewish
redhead when you observed that you didn't like orange juice. And
it's not all invention: In 1991, a University of California
administrator did push for a ban on the aforementioned uses of nip
and chink.
</P>
<P>
   But the language Jeremiahs are highly selective in their
complaints. They lament that they can no longer use gay to mean
merry (though I sometimes doubt that their hearts were ever young
and gay), but I've never heard them regret the disappearance of
gay's earlier use to describe a libertine or a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Austen could use the word intercourse to mean a social
encounter, or show us a lady at her toilet, when that meant
primping at a dressing table. (The word comes from the French
toile, the cloth that covered what the 20th century renamed the
vanity.) In common use till the turn of the century, the term
survives in toilet water (eau de toilette), the low-octane cologne.
But nowadays intercourse means sex _ even to the president _ and
toilet is a bathroom fixture; their older meanings are available,
but we use them carefully, preferring not to draw snickers or blank
stares from our audience. And nobody takes these examples of
linguistic evolution as assaults on our freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, expressions like a chink in the armor and a
nip in the air are likely to resist change; the racial words they
evoke are losing currency, and the idioms are too familiar to
misinterpret unless you're trying very hard. Another such phrase _
calling a spade a spade, which dates back to ancient Greece _ was
also on the endangered list a decade ago. But that was a false
alarm, too: Spade was already fading from the racial slang lexicon
in the '70s _ some of us haven't heard it since Archie Bunker's
last gasp _ and calling a spade a spade still means, as always,
telling it like it is.
</P>
<P>
   (Incidentally, it wasn't really a spade in ancient Greek;
Erasmus misconstrued the word while translating Plutarch into
Latin, and the mistake passed into English. A good thing, probably:
Our version is a lot more emphatic than calling a trough a trough.)
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen to niggardly? You can use it, and defend it,
if you like, but I suspect it's already in decline, especially in
speech; even people who know their etymology can have a hard time
getting their mouths around those syllables. The Oxford University
Press sees the same trend: ``Some speakers and writers have come to
shun it,'' to avoid misunderstandings, says its 1998 usage
dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no shortage of alternatives: Unlike the
much-lamented gay, niggardly has a wealth of excellent synonyms _
miserly, stingy, tightfisted, parsimonious, even mean, for the
Anglophiles among us.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, everyone should know what niggardly really means, and David
Howard should get his job back. But the way to rescue words from a
racist taint is to eliminate racism _ a much less amusing task than
solemnly denouncing political correctness.

IN THE LAP OF LUXURY ABOARD THE SILVER CLOUD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO _ It is positioned on the ninth and uppermost deck,
with a view directly over the prow, and a 180-degree sweep of
windows to make certain you don't miss anything. No wonder the
Observation Lounge is one of the more popular public areas of the
Silver Cloud, a cruise ship of the Silversea line.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one flaw. In future ship construction, a company
spokeswoman says, this room will be accessible from the lower decks
by an elevator _ so that passengers will be able to get here
without having to go outside.
</P>
<P>
   Horrors, imagine having to brave salt spray or withering rays of
sunshine on the ascent from the pool deck.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is no ordinary cruise ship. It feels more like an
oversize yacht. There may be as much brass in the furnishings and
interior accents as there is steel in the superstructure. Moet &AMP;
Chandon is the (ital) &UR; ! &LR; house(end ital) champagne. All of the
cabins look out on the ocean, and 75 percent of them have verandas
_ teak verandas.
</P>
<P>
   The instant you step on board, you're left with little doubt
that this is an ultra-luxury ship. Accordingly, Silversea is
appealing to the particularly well-heeled _ or at least those
inclined to engage in a dramatic splurge _ for a cruise that will
ring in New Year's 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bennett will kick things off with a private concert for
passengers at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Then there will be a
charter flight to Tahiti. New Year's Eve will be spent on a beach
at Suva, Fiji, with the '50s time-warp band Sha Na Na entertaining.
Then the Silver Cloud and its twin sister, the Silver Wind, will
sail east across the international date line, so that the first day
of 2000 can be celebrated a second time. The voyage, which will
also put in at the Cook Islands, Tonga and Samoa, will terminate in
New Zealand on Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Sound great? Undoubtedly, but bring your checkbook. The most
austere accommodations _ 240 square feet, with a window _ start at
$30,195 for the 15-day cruise. If your taste leans more toward the
grand suite, with three giant forward-facing windows, a whirlpool
bathtub, three private verandas and a living room bigger than my
own, plan on doubling that price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all-inclusive,'' said Silversea's Dale DiBello, as if to
be reassuring, when the Silver Cloud tied up at San Pedro recently.
``There are no chits to sign. There is no tipping. If you want a
glass of champagne, you just go get it. It makes it feel like
home.''
</P>
<P>
   But only if home is a floating four-star resort. This is a
cruise line that obviously caters to a discriminating passenger,
someone who has no desire to be herded to buffets and crammed into
tight quarters below decks.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is small _ 514 feet long, 70 feet wide _ and
accommodates a maximum of 296 passengers. All of the cabins are
configured forward, away from the hubbub of the public rooms,
nearly all of which are clustered aft.
</P>
<P>
   It features an entertainment lounge with amphitheater seating, a
discreet casino, a library that contains books in addition to the
requisite movie videos, a restaurant with an elaborate parquet
floor for dinner dances, a fitness room with ocean view, a salon
and a card room.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable that a healthy thirst might be worked up
with all of that activity, and the Silver Cloud has that
well-covered, too. You can get a drink at any time in the Panorama
Lounge in the stern, or in the Observation Lounge, or in the
Venetian Lounge, or in the Terrace Cafe, or in the restaurant. But
none of them is the bar, which commands about a fourth of Deck 5
and is called, in case anyone is stumbling around in confusion, the
Bar.
</P>
<P>
   Want to just hole up in your cabin? It's not likely to be the
spartan, claustrophobic experience common to other cruise ships.
Most accommodations have sitting areas, queen-size beds,
entertainment centers, TVs with satellite reception, VCRs,
direct-dial phones, liquor cabinets, writing desks and
floor-to-ceiling glass doors leading to those verandas.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one other minor flaw that will be corrected in future
construction. Some luxury suites will henceforth be configured
amidships, rather than being concentrated forward, as they are now.
It turns out, according to Silversea's DiBello, that the water can
get a little rough up front, such that those patrons in the grand
suites get to feeling ``like sailors.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Moet &AMP; Chandon starts slopping over the lip of the
flute, life on the open sea can get downright disconcerting.

COLLEGES ATTEMPT TO CLEAN UP CAMPUS `MALLSPEAK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHAMPTON, Mass. _ For a college classroom, this is a
remarkable moment.
</P>
<P>
   With five students speaking to their peers, there is not a
single ``whatever,'' no ``you knows.'' This is a ``like'' free
zone, with only two tiny ``I means'' in total.
</P>
<P>
   But then, they're being graded. Once that's done, the discussion
starts to sound a bit more typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it, like,'' one student asks, ``you know, sort of,
redundant?''
</P>
<P>
   It is this dialect that, across campus, is making Smith College
president Ruth Simmons wrinkle her nose in distaste: ``It's
minimalist, it's reductionist, it's repetitive, it's imprecise,
it's inarticulate, it's vernacular,'' she says, and then, as if she
hasn't made it clear, ``It drives me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mallspeak,'' she calls it. Others say ``teenbonics'' or
``verbal garbage.'' In a ``whatever'' generation, it's littering
college campuses, and schools are on a cleanup mission.
</P>
<P>
   Much as they began to focus more on writing a few years ago,
colleges are now demanding that students learn how to speak well.
For years, they disdained it as too vocational _ speaking
effectively was something students at elite colleges were supposed
to have mastered coming in.
</P>
<P>
   But then alumni began reporting back their horror at the way
graduates spoke in job interviews, or remarking how unprepared they
felt to express themselves in the working world. The point is
simple: Prestigious degrees won't do students much good if they
can't project professionalism and poise in a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   So last year, Smith introduced ``Speaking Across the
Curriculum,'' demanding students do more oral presentations whether
in science or literature courses. At Mount Holyoke, classes are
marked with an ``S'' to indicate an emphasis on speaking, and the
school has a new speaking center where students, and faculty, can
visit with speaking assistants and speaking mentors. They videotape
and critique students who watch themselves replace commas with
``you knows,'' and introduce quotations with ``goes'' or ``like.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the College of the
Holy Cross, and Wesleyan University are incorporating more speaking
requirements and oral examinations into courses, and Stanford and
the University of Pennsylvania have consulted with Mount Holyoke
professors about setting up programs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also less programmatic therapy. ``There are some
students,'' Simmons says, ``I just grab them by the shoulders and
say, `Do not say ``like'' one more time.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some would dispute whether the state of American conversation
has really declined so much, or whether this is simply the age-old
complaint of the older generation about the younger. But others say
they worry more and more that language once limited to teenagers is
now heard from those in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where will we be in another 30 years?'' Simmons asks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps predictably, the blame often lands on television, where
characters speak in slang, declarative statements often end with a
question mark, and even mild profanity has become more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain cult of inarticulateness,'' says Steven
Pinker, a professor of psychology at MIT and author of ``The
Language Instinct.'' ``Nobody wants to be the teacher's pet. What
the `likes' and `you knows' do is make the speaker sound less
emphatic and less dominant. They both bring you down to the same
level as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   More television usually means less reading, and less exposure to
the full range and precision of vocabulary. Meanwhile, education
itself has become less structured.
</P>
<P>
   ``School has become less formal over the years, so people don't
feel as pressured to be as articulate as they were in the olden
days,'' says Carrie Alme, a 19-year-old sophomore and speaking
mentor at Mount Holyoke. ``A more casual atmosphere can be more
conducive to learning in some ways, but the result is, students
don't have much experience in speaking in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   At several colleges, the new emphasis on speaking came out of
discussions on how to redefine the curriculum around ``essential
skills.'' At Mount Holyoke and MIT, formal alumni surveys cited a
demand for students with better speaking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Professors, too, said they worried about how the decline in
communication skills was affecting classroom discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Bartlett, a Smith professor of economics who was one of
the first to suggest an emphasis on speaking when Smith reviewed
its curriculum two years ago, recalls eagerly anticipating a
student who was about to present what, in writing, had been a
persuasive and powerful research project. But what came out in
class was the oral equivalent of scuffing her feet across the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was this intelligent woman with intelligent ideas, and it
all came out in monotone, almost mumbling,'' Bartlett says. ``All
those intelligent ideas lost their importance. Her voice was
saying, you don't have to pay much attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad speaking, professors say, reflects and projects bad
thinking. Learning to speak effectively, then, is learning to think
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we haven't educated them well if they can't write
well,'' Bartlett says. ``Why shouldn't we have the same concerns
about speaking well?''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges worry that if students can't speak effectively, they
can't be effective participants in a democracy. And in that fear,
they have company outside academia.
</P>
<P>
   In July, long before Capitol Hill had ever heard Monica S.
Lewinsky's taped voice say, ``I mean, this is like, you know, he's
like a normal person,'' Senator Robert Byrd complained on the
Senate floor about the ``pernicious'' plague of the vernacular on
American discourse.
</P>
<P>
   The West Virginia Democrat mockingly imagined whether Abraham
Lincoln could have rallied the nation's determination if the
Gettysburg address began, ``Four score, and like, seven years ago,
you know, our forefathers, uh, brought forth, you know. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   But professors warn that it's more than just teaching students
how to give public speeches. And they allow that there is a time
and a place for the vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be stuffy about insisting on a standard of
proper oratory,'' says Lee Bowie, director of the Speaking,
Arguing, and Writing program at Mount Holyoke. ``The point is,
there are rhetorical choices, and so-called proper English and high
oratory should be one of them. The reason people use the vernacular
is that they haven't learned a range of rhetorical choices. Once
people can choose a voice for the occasion, the vernacular doesn't
look like so much a problem, but an option.''
</P>
<P>
   To define goals, they look, again, to the Senate floor. What
colleges don't want, Bowie said, is to encourage the kind of
``Crossfire'' machismo that has been displayed too often in the
impeachment debates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you look at the (former Arkansas senator) Dale Bumpers
model,'' he says, ``he really did bring home the effectiveness of
classical rhetoric, what some of the standard moves are, how
effective it is to craft an address that is responsive to the
precise audience you're talking to.''
</P>
<P>
   As Byrd said, ridding speech of verbal trash alone won't make a
good leader _ ``that requires great thoughts as well as a clear and
stirring delivery.'' But, he added, ``leaving it in can surely
blight the path to greatness _ you know.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sea is a vast expanse of inky blackness at
this hour well before sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   You really don't want to be here, standing on the deck of a
ship, gazing east. As a result of the merry-making last night _
well, a few hours ago _ your skull feels as if anchor chains have
been dragged through your temples. But when you booked this cruise
nearly two years ago, you promised yourself you'd do this.
</P>
<P>
   You vowed you'd be here at this moment to greet the first dawn
of the year 2000. Here in the South Pacific, hugging the
international date line, to be one of the first on the
(ital)planet(end ital) to greet this dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Legions of travelers share this compulsion to do something
extraordinary on New Year's Eve 1999, whether it's a stay at an
exotic resort or a visit to a city known for extreme revelry.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrants probably don't want to hear that this millennium
mania is a lot of wasted energy, since the new century and the new
millennium don't technically begin until New Year's Day 2001.
(There was never a year zero A.D., so the first decade was 10 full
years, the first century 100 full years, the second millennium
2,000 full years.)
</P>
<P>
   But why spoil their fun? If they want to go bonkers over the
novelty of a year beginning with the numeral 2, why not get out of
the way and let them do so?
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to do something monumental,'' said Christie
Wiancko of Travel Professionals International in Lake Oswego, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   And in most cases, apparently, that means passage on an
ocean-going ship. ``It looks like cruises are going to be the most
popular (of all the so-called millennium travel options),'' said
Mary Papenfuss, managing editor of the Consumer Reports Travel
Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines got wise to the fever long ago. Most began
accepting deposits more than a year ago, without specifying what
the final rates would be. Some of those rates came in at double
normal, according to several agents who specialize in booking
cruise travel.
</P>
<P>
   That caused some prospective passengers to back out of their
cruise plans when refund deadlines arrived late in 1998, but not
many. And space for New Year's cruises is not expected to be
available much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bookings were going very, very well for a while, but then
people seemed to balk at the prices. And now the prices are going
down,'' said Elaine Ackerman, a Yonkers, N.Y., travel agent and
former chairwoman of the American Society of Travel Agents' cruise
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Jacaruso of the Royal Caribbean line said: ``We had a
fallout rate, obviously. At one point, we had enough deposits in
place to fill our ships three times over. But they were $200
refundable deposits. There's not much commitment there. (The crush)
could have represented multiple bookings.''
</P>
<P>
   Bev Zukow of First Travel of California in Villa Park, said
cancellations were ``the exception'' for her office's clients.
``Most of the people knew it would be a lot of money,'' she added.
``They realize it's going to be something special, an
extravaganza.''
</P>
<P>
   And interest remains strong. Several travel agents said they
anticipate most cruises will be booked solid by the end of
February, even given the steep freight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks need only to look to the travel industry on the whole to
realize that every travel supplier out there has raised rates for
the millennium celebration,'' said Jennifer de la Cruz, spokeswoman
for Carnival. ``It's a standard supply-and-demand dynamic.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one way to look at it. Here's another:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling the buyer to beware,'' said Papenfuss of the
Consumer Reports Travel Letter. ``We have a huge warning that it is
a great opportunity for gougers.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the extreme demand, cruise lines are in position to
write all the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, travelers have plunked down deposits without
being able to get specific cabin assignments or even firm details
on itinerary and New Year's entertainment. Also, payment schedules
are more exacting. Rather than making an advance deposit and then
paying the balance a couple of months before you sail _ common
conditions for cruises _ payments for most New Year's cruises have
been divided into major installments, with some final balances due
as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still cruises out there, but you're going to have to
pay for them,'' said Zukow, the Villa Park travel agent who
specializes in cruise bookings. ``This is not going to be a
situation where you find a deal. There are no deals out there. ...
There are always all kinds of discounts and upgrades, but this time
everybody is paying full _ what we would call in airline travel
full coach. The consumer isn't used to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the shorter cruises _ seven days' duration or so _
have been snapped up the quickest. Destination doesn't seem to be
of particular concern to many passengers, travel professionals say.
The Caribbean, Mexico, the Panama Canal? No matter. People just
want to be out on the water somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the cruise lines are being swamped with
inquiries about what kind of bash the passengers will get for their
buck, but details are still pretty sketchy in most cases. Cruise
entertainment generally isn't planned and booked this far in
advance. But the lines insist they'll be making as big a splash as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a premium on this event, for all the cruise lines,''
said Dale DiBello of Silversea, a small-ship luxury line. ``It's a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been asking our entertainment people (for details). We
should know more in February,'' said Erik Elvejord of Holland
America. ``It will be interesting to see what they do, because
obviously you have to do something a little bit different than the
typical New Year's Eve party. We might fly a special guest in to
the ship. Or maybe let everybody steer that night.'' After a brief
pause, he added, ``I guess that might be a bad idea on that kind of
a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean boasts that its Vision of the Seas will be the
first cruise ship into and out of the Panama Canal in 2000. In the
Caribbean itself, the line plans to have seven of its ships
converge on its resort in Haiti and five other ships meet at its
private island, Coco Cay. Massive fireworks displays are planned
for both locations.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular destination for those willing to pay for longer
cruises is the South Pacific, where the more accomplished
celebrants will be able to enjoy New Year's Eve twice. It's as
simple as positioning the ship just west of the international date
line (around Fiji or Tonga, for example) and staging a New Year's
party, then promptly sailing east, and crossing the date line,
where it will be Dec. 31 all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the South Pacific, cruise lines undoubtedly will argue
over who saw daylight first.
</P>
<P>
   Antarctica cruises will be able to build a strong case, but that
is a land of six months night, six months daylight, said Stephen
Edberg, an astronomer at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
What do you do, sail to where you can see the first vestiges of
light in the east and declare Jan. 1 to have arrived?
</P>
<P>
   For a true sunrise _ and the first of 2000 _ a ship would have
to sail to the southeast of New Zealand, Edberg said, and take up a
position at about 67{ degrees south latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, for the determined reveler, that will be the place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Just be certain to set the alarm. &QL;

A DIVA WHOSE ADORATION WAS DESERVED

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
HOLLYWOOD DIVA 
A Biography of Jeanette MacDonald 
By Edward Baron Turk 
University of California Press, 467 pp., illustrated, $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeanette MacDonald was adored in her time, and she has been
adored ever since. Fifty years after her final screen appearance
(in a Lassie movie) and 34 years after her death, her fan club
remains active. All her MGM movies are available on video (they
still stir response when they are shown on television), and half a
dozen CDs preserve some of her characteristic recordings.
Nevertheless she is the most parodied, most ridiculed, star of
Hollywood's Golden Age. Popular taste has rotated far away from the
kind of music MacDonald favored and the values some of her movies
promoted. In a paradoxical way, it was a pity that MacDonald could
sing, because she was a captivating comedienne, as elegant and
sassy as Claudette Colbert, whose work has never gone out of style.
</P>
<P>
   Now Edward Baron Turk, a professor of French and film studies at
MIT, has written ``Hollywood Diva,'' the first full-length
biography of MacDonald. Turk marshals all the facts about her life
in a lively fashion; discusses her films in business,
entertainment, and art contexts; analyzes her popular image; asks
leading questions and provides provocative answers. He knows
everything there is to know about MacDonald, and he puts that
knowledge into a cultural context.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald's story was of hard work and professional discipline _
in Hollywood they called her the ``Iron Butterfly,'' and she
rejoiced in the title. The Philadelphia-born MacDonald arrived as a
chorus girl on Broadway by the time she was 15; she spent a decade
mastering her craft, appearing in a dozen shows, revues, and
touring companies before heading for the movies. She chose to
advance through her talent and not through her captivating looks.
In 1921, when she was 19, she took a job modeling furs. Running
into an agent on the street, she told him she'd just sweated
through a photo shoot. The agent made a coarse jest, so Jeanette
socked him in the jaw and knocked him out cold.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have tended to prefer the more sophisticated MacDonald
boudoir farces of the early '30s _ most of them directed by Ernst
Lubitsch and co-starring Maurice Chevalier _ to the famous series
of eight romantic operettas with Nelson Eddy that began in 1935
with ``Naughty Marietta'' and ended with ``I Married An Angel'' in
1942. Turk has some fun at Eddy's expense (Ray Bolger dubbed him
the ``Singing Capon''), but avoids making this easy distinction.
His purpose is to examine MacDonald's whole achievement, and he
admires the later films both for the romantic ardor, even sexual
abandon, of MacDonald's singing and for the more natural, earthy
characterizations she was permitted. The biographer picks up on the
sexual complexity of MacDonald's roles, a fact her wholesome image
fails to incorporate _ she often plays a strong woman, often on the
rebound from a previous marriage, who defies convention in order to
get what she wants. Turk responds to persistent rumors of an
offscreen liaison between the Singing Sweethearts with a dismissive
sentence; according to him, Eddy and MacDonald had little use for
each other.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald often played a singer in the movies, and the real-life
role of opera singer was one that she coveted. She did sing in a
few performances of ``Faust'' and ``Romeo et Juliette'' with
considerable success after coachings with the redoubtable German
diva Lotte Lehmann, but the doors of the Metropolitan remained
closed to her. Her worst professional mistake was to give up the
role in ``Kiss Me, Kate'' that Cole Porter had written with her in
mind; that might have created a whole new image and career. But she
felt going to New York for the show might jeopardize her marriage
to Gene Raymond, and she may also have known that she no longer had
the physical and vocal stamina to survive a long run.
</P>
<P>
   After the movies, there was a some radio, a little television,
some summer stock, a couple of Vegas engagements. Turk accurately
describes the frisson of the flashback in her touring version of
``Bittersweet'' when the heroine becomes young; this writer was
taken to see MacDonald at the Kenley Players in Ohio in 1959. When
the lights came up, MacDonald's illusion of radiant youth was
breathtaking, but she could no longer maintain that illusion when
she sang _ she sounded wobbly, cloudy, and off-pitch.
</P>
<P>
   There are two flaws in Turk's book. One is an inadequate
discography that doesn't include MacDonald's surviving broadcast
material. (Callas critic John Ardoin considers MacDonald's
Hollywood Bowl broadcast of ``Il est doux'' from Massenet's
``Herodiade'' the best recording of this erotic aria ever made, and
he may be right.) The other is a rather scattershot approach to the
purely vocal aspect of MacDonald's art. Turk praises her for
silvery tone, lively phrasing, prolonged high notes, but doesn't
really analyze her singing _ the quick flicker in her voice, for
example, that helps give it a period flavor. Turk does remind us of
the paradox noted by critic Will Crutchfield, that the only kind of
singing now judged ``natural'' requires electronic amplification in
order to be heard. Engineers were constantly accused of boosting
MacDonald's voice, but they probably did the opposite; one reason
MacDonald is charming rather than assaultive is that her soprano
rarely gets louder as it ascends the staff and heads out beyond the
blue horizon.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Turk writes generously about the inclusivity of
MacDonald's art and elegiacally about the idealism and commitment
to values her life and work represented. ``Hollywood Diva'' is the
most thorough, intelligent, and sensitive book ever written about a
movie star, because it's about a whole lot more than Jeanette
MacDonald.

LOVELY WEEKENDS FOR VALENTINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Valentine's Day is near - just two weeks away - and what are
your plans?
</P>
<P>
   A romantic getaway is the perfect choice for this weekend. Since
the day falls on a Sunday, for most a Friday or Saturday getaway
(yes, I know Saturday is the 13th, but that doesn't mean bad luck,
it's Friday you have to worry about. I know _ I once was married on
a Friday the 13th).
</P>
<P>
   Where you go doesn't matter either. This is a day for the two of
you. But should you need some help, most hotels and inns have
special packages, some not only for Valentine's Day but also for
other days in February and throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   A lavish idea for those about to pop the question is offered by
the Waldorf Towers, the 26th through 42nd floors of the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York. Their Engagement-of-a-Lifetime
includes accommodations in the Royal Suite, for more than 25 years
the New York residence of the duke and duchess of Windsor, a
private jet to the city and private limousine to the hotel, a
candlelight dinner in the suite's dining room with sweeping views
of the city, private in-suite consultations on diamonds from a
jeweler from Harry Winston (who supplied the former occupants with
jewelry) and from the couturier to the stars, Stephen Yearick, on
wedding attire. And, yes, breakfast in bed.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of this fantasy? It begins at $3,500. The final cost is
determined by where you're flying from, and should you decide on a
diamond or dress. To book the package, available beginning Feb. 12,
call Christine Hentschel at 212-872-7222. For other reservations,
call 888-WATOWER.
</P>
<P>
   The Renaissance Vinoy Resort in St. Petersburg, Fla. Offers
couples ``An Enchanted Evening,'' which includes a game of the same
name (ABC News calls the game ``love, laughter, and romance in a
box''); dinner, champagne, and more. The Vinoy is a classically
restored Florida landmark. The evening begins at $235, depending on
season. Call 727-894-1000.
</P>
<P>
   If playing an Enchanted Evening sounds good, some 90 Hiltons
will offer the game free to guests who pay for their stay with a
Discover Card. The package, good for Feb. 12-15, includes
chocolate-dipped strawberries and champagne. Call 800-HILTONS for
information or reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston offers a lavish Engaging
Weekend at just $9,995 a couple. Ah, but that includes a suite,
dinner, limo tour of Boston, spa treatments, tickets to the Mary
Cassatt exhibit at the Museum of Fine Arts, a $7,500 credit for a
diamond naturally from Shreve, Crump &AMP; Low, along with a $1,000
Neiman Marcus shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Copley Plaza also offers Sweetheart Packages beginning at
$299 that include chocolates, flowers, and champagne. For
information, call 800-527-4727.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's newest hotel, the Seaport, offers a choice for the
weekend: A Valentine's Day only package at $279 which includes
accommodations, parking, and dinner for two; or a Bed &AMP; Breakfast
package throughout the weekend at $169 that includes
accommodations, parking, continental breakfast. For details, call
877-SEAPORT.
</P>
<P>
   For more Boston ideas, call 888-SEE BOSTON and ask for the
Boston Overnight brochure filled with events, food and wine
festivals, and accommodation ideas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Good deals
</P>
<P>
   Another idea is to take a trip. Especially if the day leads to a
honeymoon. Few destinations are as romantic as France, and Air
France provides all the goodies with its Paris Honeymoon Package
starting at $899 a person out of New York or Boston. Air fare,
accommodations, breakfasts, a Seine river cruise and a lot more are
included. The trip can be extended to other parts of France as
well. Call 800-2FRANCE.
</P>
<P>
   Or take the train. From Feb. 12-14 sleeping-car passengers
booking Amtrak's Twilight Shoreliner in the Northeast or the Coast
Starlight on the West Coast will find fine staionary, stamped
envelopes, and fountain pens, and for inspiration, a copy of Andrew
Carroll's ``Letters of a Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Valentine's Day promotion promises to win many hearts by
offering customers a chance to contemplate life's most cherished
moments,'' said Barbara Richardson, Amtrak's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Cypress Inn in Conway, S.C., will hold its second annual
Valentine Weekend where couples have a chance to renew their
marriage vows in a special setting. Couples can renew their
original vows or write new updated vows on how their life has grown
and changed. The two-night package ranges from $280-$330 . For
details, call 800-575-5307.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
All year long
</P>
<P>
   And finally, if you're looking for more romantic ideas
throughout the year, book a subscription to Romantic Traveling
(3181 Mission St. 124, San Francisco, CA 94110). A sample issue is
$5, a year's subscription is $20 for the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Or, head for a local bookstore and pick up a copy of one of the
Globe Pequot Press Romantic Days and Nights series for ideas in
Savannah, Boston, San Francisco, Vancouver, Atlanta, Santa Fe,
Washington, New York City, Chicago, San Diego, and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, the longest holder of the
Mobil Five-Star and AAA Five-Diamond awards, is offering rooms in
March starting at $125 a night, a 30-percent discount. In addition,
guests receive complimentary vouchers for each night book that are
good for spa treatments, dining, golf or tennis. For information,
call 800-634-7711.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for spring, head for the Emerald Coast of
Florida _ Destin, Fort Walton Beach, Okaloosa Island _ which claims
the title of the ``Official Beach of Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   From March through June, the 24-mile sandy coastline is
celebrating Spring Splash '99 with more than 50 seaside festivals,
events and competitions, with discounts of up to 40 percent off
seasonal room rates. The area also claims enticing temperatures of
70 degrees. For more information, call the Emerald Coast Convention
and Visitors Bureau at 800-322-3319.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Prince of a show
</P>
<P>
   What better way to learn about some of the landmarks of England
and especially of London than from a member of the royal family?
Edward Windsor, third son and youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II
and the Duke of Edinburgh, will present ``Crown and Country,'' a
three-part series on PBS Sundays beginning Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   For this series, Windsor focuses his sights on London landmarks
such as Buckingham Palace, Parliament, Big Ben, the Tower of
London, and more. Windsor not only acts as host of the series, but
is also the writer and producer of ``Crown and Country II.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Buffalo Bill bash
</P>
<P>
   He was the world's first superstar, and you can raise a toast to
him on his 153rd birthday party in Denver. Col. William F. Cody,
better known as Buffalo Bill, was a living legend in his time, when
many considered him the living embodiment of all the glory and
romance the West had to offer. From 1883 to 1913, he and his show,
``Buffalo Bill's Wild West'' toured the globe. In Denver, two
birthday parties are planned. The first, Feb. 27 at the Buckhorn
Exchange Restaurant, Denver's oldest saloon where Cody was a
regular, always ordering apple juice and bourbon at the same white
oak bar in use today (the drink is also available: it's the Buffalo
Bill Cocktail).
</P>
<P>
   The birthday bash features a look-alike contest, buffalo
burgers, music and shootouts. On Feb. 28 the Buffalo Bill Museum,
which overlooks Denver on Lookout Mountain, will hold a more
traditional party, as well as free admission so you can learn more
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Buffalo Bill'' will be in attendance, you might also
want to pay your respects, as his grave is just steps away from the
museum. For a free guide to Denver, call 800-393-8559; for
information on the Buckhorn, call 303-534-9505; and for information
on the museum, call 303-526-0744.

THEY'VE GOT THE WRONG IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Once people go, they're hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is Kelly Rabren. And her topic is something she
knows a lot about: cruisegoing. After all, she's a spokeswoman for
the Cruise Lines International Association, a nonprofit group
representing 24 cruise lines. A harbor pilot's daughter, she is
also guest manager for Holland America Line and thus a frequent
cruisegoer.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing, says Rabren, is to persuade people to take
their first cruise, often because of misconceptions that will be
swept away once they've sailed. Some of those wrong ideas:
</P>
<P>
   --There won't be anything to do. ``Actually, there's something
for everyone,'' says Rabren _ shows, games, demonstrations,
shopping, movies, excursions, and so much more. Among people who've
cruised in the last five years, 96 percent of those surveyed were
either ``extremely'' or ``very'' satisfied. And 84 percent
expressed interest in cruising again.
</P>
<P>
   --Cruisegoing is for the elite or super-rich. Maybe it was in
days of yore, but today, says Rabren, ``it's the most economical
way to travel,'' with some weeklong cruises available for under
$1,000 _ and that includes the meals and entertainment. Three out
of five cruisegoers surveyed had household incomes under $60,000
and 15 percent took their children along. Rabren notes that
everyone on today's ships gets the same service, has the same
meals, and sees the same shows, whether they've booked the lowest-
or highest-priced cabins.
</P>
<P>
   --Everyone aboard will be elderly and infirm. In reality, Rabren
says, 34 percent of cruisegoers are under age 40, and the average
cruiser age is 49. What's more, the fastest-growing segment of
cruisegoers is the 25-39 age group. And whatever their age,
cruisegoers are ``more fit than they've ever been,'' she says,
adding that healthy meal choices are readily available, as are
active shore excursions _ swimming, diving, climbing. Meanwhile,
she says, upcoming innovations for the active include a
rock-climbing wall and an ice-skating rink aboard. Sounds like fun.

ONE FUN DAY ON GREAT BARRIER ISLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRIER ISLAND, New Zealand _ Slop the cop!
</P>
<P>
   That seems the most amusing amusement for the hardy band of
islanders at their New Year's fair: a good-natured dousing of the
three policemen who don't have a whole lot to do in the nature of
catching crooks.
</P>
<P>
   So on this day annually, they take turns at catching, head-on, a
bucket of water that has been rigged precariously above, on a
wooden frame over the wet seat. Through a system of ropes, pulleys,
and hinges _ a Rube Goldbergian contraption _ the bucket is tipped
and emptied whenever a splash-minded contestant triggers it by
hurling a baseball-hard cricket ball against a target 20 feet
distant. Throw a bull's-eye, and keep a bull un-dry. Three balls
for $2. Proceeds to a local charity.
</P>
<P>
   Since a strong summer sun cloaks the scene, a soaking appears no
hardship or indictable abuse of an officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law can put up with disorder once a year,'' says the fair
Tanya Sykes, who is operating a fresh-fruit juice bar amid the
makeshift concession stalls shaded by huge pines.
</P>
<P>
   She and Marama Ulstrup also set up shop at the grass-carpeted
Claris air terminal, three unremarkable sheds. There they peddle
the good stuff, called a fruit smoothie (apple, orange, pineapple
mix), to those infrequently arriving or departing passengers. They
come and go in small prop planes of friendly Great Barrier
Airlines, based in Auckland, 55 miles to the southwest, the
principal city of New Zealand's North Island.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Tanya puts in some time with the municipal ``highway''
crew. She drives a steamroller on the mostly unpaved roads where
superfluous DUST NUISANCE signs may be seen. ``It's such a nice,
laid-back place to be that you do whatever you can to be able to
stay. There aren't many jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The local labor outlook was well expressed by a contractor, who
was supposed to finish paving an uphill driveway after New Year's
Day for our friend, Rick Thomson. ``Well, Rick, I've got a bit of a
hangover  &UR; today &LR; , you know.  &UR; Tomorrow &LR;  it's gonna be too nice to
work. So, mate,'' he said, smiling, ``it's not gonna happen for a
few days. You understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick, a Bostonian of New Zealand upbringing who spends a month
here every year with his wife, Judy Wineland, and daughters,
Nicole, 11, and Erica, 9, understands. Someday a driveway?
</P>
<P>
   Great Barrier Island, 110 square, rugged, beautiful, and mostly
unpopulated miles without electricity or running water, is publicly
out in force  &UR; today &LR; . Probably a majority of the thousand-or-so
residents have shown up in this pasture on a bluff above Kaitoke
Beach for the simple and satisfying fun of a country fair.
Predominantly costumed in shorts and halter-tops and T-shirts (US
varieties such as Chicago Bulls, Buffalo Bills, Oakland Raiders,
and Duke Blue Devils lead the display), they greet distant
neighbors for drinks and gossip, a look-around, and a picnic. Maori
faces are sprinkled among the white.
</P>
<P>
   There is a used-book stand to be browsed, a kids' violin recital
led by instructor Mary Watson, a yoga demonstration. Motorcycle and
horseback rides are available, along with the timeless
egg-and-spoon and three-legged races. Fifteen-year-old Brad Collins
has won the nail-driving championship. Plastic tubing stretching
down a slight slope and greased with soap suds is a thrilling slide
for kiddies. Home-made bread and pastries, jams and jellies are on
sale. So are the works of island pride potter, Sarah Harrison, and
other craftsfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Removed from the general scene are horse races conducted down on
the broad beach, beside the green, fluffing sea. My racetrack
degenerate Bostonian pals, Mike Vickers, ``Clocker'' Taylor, and
``Saddlesore'' Booth, would call it a primitive Delmar, alluding to
their preferred California oval beside the Pacific, and wonder
where the mutuel windows were located. Maybe in crannies in the
rocks, manned by local skinks.
</P>
<P>
   Start and finish lines are scratched in the sand. The
straightaway dashes seem ominous cavalry charges accompanied by
tall, spectral shadows, and hoofbeats that startle snoozing
sunbathers. But gay shrieks from the watering crowd at the edge of
the surf preserve the festive atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have bet on that one,'' says Nicole, pointing at the
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if they had betting,'' says her sister, Erica, laughing.
``If they did, you would have picked that one,'' she says, pointing
at the tail-ender.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are our favorite beaches, of so many,'' says Nicole of
Kaitoke and adjoining Medlands, a three-mile horseshoe bisected by
a rocky outcropping, Sugar Loaf. High dunes form the backdrop, then
a series of hills on which angora goats traipse, and a wooded
mountain also called Kaitoke. It's not far from the top of the
island, Mount Hobson, whose demanding 3,300 feet were covered by
nimble Erica, undoubtedly the first Bostonian to conquer that peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This beach is teeming  &UR; today &LR; ,'' says Judy. ``Sorry it's so
crowded.'' Right. We've counted almost 40 people. Not a structure
in sight. Only rock formations that look like ancient gray Legos.
The water is warm, but the surfers, who stay all day, are in wet
suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish for supper,'' says Rick as we depart homeward. ``If you
catch it.'' He is looking at me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I suppose it's Berry Berry Nice Meusli,'' I
respond, citing a tasty New Zealand breakfast brand. And hoping we
might return to the Barrier Oasis Lodge where the resident barefoot
contessa, vivacious proprietor Penny Gardiner, invites you into her
kitchen while she prepares a sumptuous meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I should confess that my previous fishing expeditions
have come up emptier than a Russian bank,'' I offer. ``My
performances have been as adept as a wayward Walton's _ John Boy,
not Izaak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, but you can't miss in Hauraki Gulf, just off our house,''
counsels Rick. ``You will be a provider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A profaner of the art,'' I grumble, even less enthusiastic
about fishing than the fished. ``A guardian angel couldn't save me
from a gulfing bagel. Hemingway would call me the fold man on the
sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless . . ..
</P>
<P>
   Within the hour, we are rockin' and reelin' on his yacht, the
14-foot Sea Nymph, two miles out in Hauraki waters where America's
Cup 1999-2000 will be contested, starting in September. And my
unbrilliant career as angler lurches along, with far-off green
cliffs framing the sooty Gulf that matches my mood. Fish are
biting, but only long enough to steal _ damned brazen bait-nappers.
``Thieves!'' I scream. ``Freeloaders!''
</P>
<P>
   Judy's hook is more inviting, apparently, and she captures a
six-pound snapper. Hurrah, I'm off the hook for dinner. Rick spins
the wheel and heads for home and the mooring at Gooseberry Flat.
</P>
<P>
   It adjoins Pah Beach, where later at night an invasion of
plankton in the shallows will stage a spectacular light show. The
magical phosphorescence of plankton grips anything touching the
water, making fish appear silvery streaks and raindrops lightning
explosions. Water cupped in hands sparkles like a trove of
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   But I have not sparkled with rod. Wait . . . about to reel in a
last empty line, I feel a slight tug. A charitable twinge? Yet
another come-on from one more purloiner of a tempting squid hors
d'ouvres? No, amazingly enough. This time this poor thing has
gulped the hook, and is rising to the surface, fighting but
disgraced _ losing the battle to me. A mismatch, I admit. At 2 1/2
pounds, my snapper is outweighed considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a catch is a catch is a catch, as Stein used to say. That
would be Maury Stein, the old Brandeis fullback.
</P>

FUGEES' FUTURE TO INCLUDE   ALBUM, TOUR, CLEF   SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Since the Fugees' Grammy Award-winning 1996
sophomore release, ``The Score,'' became the largest-selling rap
album of all time, fans have wondered if the trio will ever record
again.
</P>
<P>
   Wyclef ``Clef'' Jean promises a new Fugees album and tour next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clef says he's thrilled at fellow Fugees member
Lauryn Hill's 10 Grammy nominations for ``The Miseducation of
Lauryn Hill,'' her acclaimed solo debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said Clef, who was himself recently
nominated in the best rap solo performance category. ``She deserves
it. She put a lot of hard work into that album.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a lawsuit over the creation of the music brought by
a New Jersey session group that played on Hill's record, Clef is
unusually mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Al Capone said it first _ no comment,'' he said with a
smile.

THEFT SCHEMES INCREASINGLY LINKED TO BETTING ADDICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly two years, Raymond Ricci dipped into the locked cash
box at the auto parts business where he had worked for 17 years. As
the general manager of Astro Automotive, he had the key to the box,
which held the receipts from over-the-counter sales of auto parts.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was caught last February, Ricci had stolen more
than $205,000 from the business in Franklin, Mass. And by the time
he admitted the crimes last month in federal court in Boston, Ricci
was already in treatment for the problem that turned him into a
criminal: gambling.
</P>
<P>
   All the money he had stolen, including loose change, had
financed trips to Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. Warned by US
District Judge Patti B. Saris to stay out of trouble until his
sentencing in April, Ricci assured her his gambling days are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing anything at all,'' Ricci insisted. ``I'm
committed to myself, my family, and the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci is part of a growing group of defendants _ at least nine
within the past few years in federal court in Boston _ who say they
were driven into crime by an insatiable need to bet big and often,
hoping against hope for one big score that would make everything
right. In the process, they gambled away other people's money,
ranging from a couple of hundred thousand dollars to several
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person will do what they need to do to stay gambling, to
stay in action,'' said Kathleen Scanlan, executive director of the
Massachusetts Council on Compulsive Gambling, which estimates there
are as many as 143,000 problem gamblers in the state. ``And what
they need to stay in action is money.''
</P>
<P>
   The council also estimates that $6 billion is bet legally and
illegally in Massachusetts each year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of gambling-related cases in federal court, where
strict guidelines control sentencing, has also sparked debate over
the nature of addiction. Defense lawyers paint compulsive gambling
as a mental impairment that warrants lighter sentences, but
prosecutors argue that out-of-control gambling is not madness, but
motive.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in the number of gambling-related crimes, which comes
at a time of renewed debate over legalizing casino gambling in
Massachusetts, is no surprise to Scanlan.
</P>
<P>
   While many first-time callers to the council's hot line seek
help because their gambling has gotten them in trouble at home or
at work, ``It's more common for people to call us because they've
become involved in some kind of illegal activity to finance their
gambling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Mark L. Marino simply steal the money they need.
Marino embezzled more than $4 million from his family's paving
company to cover his bets on professional sports. It was not
unusual for Marino, who was in charge of the company finances, to
write a check for $50,000 to his bookie after a losing weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball, football, hockey, he would bet everything,'' said
his lawyer, Robert A. George. ``He had a serious gambling
addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Michael M. O'Connell, 31, a bookkeeper for a fabric
wholesaler, was charged with stealing roughly $700,000 from his
employer. According to the US attorney's office, O'Connell
regularly wrote checks to himself, forging the company president's
name; the checks, ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, were used to
cover O'Connell's bets on professional football and basketball
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually fool themselves that they're going to make the
big score, the big hit, and somehow it will all come clean in the
end,'' said Robert E. Schlabach, special agent in charge of the
economic crime squad in the Boston office of the FBI. ``Of course,
it never does.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the schemes are elaborate. Thomas Aldred, 39, and Neal
J. Coiley, 37, stole more than $1.9 million to gamble away by using
a phony chemical supply company.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scheme, the fictitious company billed the chemical
manufacturer where Aldred worked for $25,000 to $45,000 a month,
from late 1993 to 1997. The company paid the invoices after Aldred
forged delivery documents and other paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a cash cow for them,'' said Assistant US Attorney
Joshua S. Levy, who prosecuted Aldred and Coiley. ``They used it to
go down to Foxwoods. . . . They were living the high life.''
</P>
<P>
   Both pleaded guilty. Coiley was sentenced to 18 months of home
detention, Aldred to three years and 10 months in prison. Both were
ordered to make restitution.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the sentencing judge refused to consider their
alleged gambling addiction as a justification for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Amy Baron-Evans lost a similar argument in May
1997, when she asked for a reduced sentence for 29-year-old Andrew
Leppo, who claimed he had been addicted to gambling since he was
10. Leppo had pleaded guilty to a variety of schemes, including
bank fraud and selling more than $2 million in counterfeit IBM
memory. Saris sentenced him to 37 months in prison, not the 30
months Baron-Evans sought.
</P>
<P>
   Federal sentencing guidelines do not mention gambling addiction
as a mitigating factor, ``and the guidelines generally denigrate
the idea that mental and emotional conditions, including drug and
alcohol addiction, should have any relevance,'' said Baron-Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But obviously they do have relevance to why the person
committed the crime. . . . On a human level it's sad, because it's
what's driving people in so many of these cases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To make her case, Baron-Evans enlisted Dr. Lance M. Dodes, a
psychiatrist and director of the Center for Problem Gambling at
Mount Auburn Hospital in Boston, who had diagnosed Leppo with
``compulsive gambling disorder,'' recognized as a mental disorder
by the American Psychiatric Association since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Committing crimes to fund a gambling obsession is so common,
Dodes said in a recent interview, that it's one of the diagnostic
criteria. ``It's kind of unfortunate that they (commit crimes),
because it gives them a bad name and makes it harder to get
funding,'' Dodes said. ``There is no Betty Ford Center for
compulsive gamblers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Leppo's case, Assistant US Attorney Jeanne M. Kempthorne
argued successfully that gambling was the motive for his crimes,
not the cause. Simply put, Leppo did not suffer from ``reduced
mental capacity'' as a result of his compulsive gambling, a
requirement for a lower sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, Kempthorne got Dodes to acknowledge
that Leppo's mental functioning was intact and he understood what
he was doing was fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   US Attorney Donald K. Stern is uncompromising on the subject.
Gambling, he says, ``is not going to be an excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you embezzle money, if you forge checks,'' he said,
``you're not going to be able to walk into court and expect that
excuse will fly.''

HIP-HOP STAR WYCLEF JEAN WRITES, OVERSEES SOUNDTRACK FOR `LIFE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A pitch-black screening room on a busy studio lot
can be a sterile, charmless place, the sort of environment that
makes you think of a lonely bus station in the dead of night.
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp afternoon the other day, though, the subdued Norman
Rockwell still-life titled ``Portrait of a Dubbing Room'' got kind
of, well, gritty _ and loud.
</P>
<P>
   Ducking into a glass-enclosed office at the back of the hushed
theater at Universal were director Ted Demme and Fugees member
Wyclef ``Clef'' Jean, collaborators eager to spin ambitious new
music composed for the forthcoming Eddie Murphy-Martin Lawrence
comedy ``Life.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a long day in an especially harried week of
painstakingly tweaking the $60 million film's sound. On this
afternoon, Demme and company were going over a fight sequence in
which Murphy, dressed in prison stripes, was about to get stomped
in the yard of a Mississippi penitentiary _ a beating sparked by a
disagreement over cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   At issue, however, weren't the camera angles, the actor's
expressions, the lighting on set or even the consistency of the
cornbread. The bone of contention was the meaty sound of the slugs
Murphy was enduring on screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring it up,'' Demme ordered, as an assistant engineer
twiddled a knob on the room-length mixing desk and the scene
immediately sprang backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hear that again. Clef?''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clef's official job on ``Life'' entailed writing and
producing music that reflected 60 years in the life of the movie's
two main characters, Demme asked the Haitian-born hip-hop star to
come to Los Angeles and scrutinize all of the film's sound
elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an uncredited sound doctor,'' Demme said. ``His official
job ended more than a month ago, but I wanted him here for the
dubbing process. He's my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 10 run-throughs, the thud of those punches rained
on Murphy are deemed ideal for moviegoers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life,'' which opens April 16, tells the story of Ray (Murphy)
and Claude (Lawrence), wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to
life imprisonment at a Mississippi prison. Over the course of 60
years, they witness hardship and kindness, cruelty and forgiveness
and life and death as they never lose hope that eventually they'll
be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Clef, who released his solo debut, ``Wyclef Jean Presents the
Carnival,'' two years ago, was chosen for the Murphy project by
``Life'' music supervisor Amanda Scheer, Demme's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true musician,'' she said. ``He's got the personality,
the charm, and he's brilliant at working with so many different
people. Only a few rap artists are classically trained and are true
musicians the way he is. I was certainly taking a chance, but I
have a pretty good sense of someone's musical abilities and I
believed in him. He's all about making it right. Ted and Clef
worked beautifully together.''
</P>
<P>
   Demme, who began his career on MTV shooting Denis Leary spots
and launching ``Yo! MTV Raps'' in 1988, has directed ``Monument
Ave.,'' ``The Ref'' and ``Beautiful Girls.'' His uncle is Academy
Award-winning director Jonathan Demme (``Silence of the Lambs''),
who made the Talking Heads documentary ``Stop Making Sense,''
considered one of the best music films ever.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Life,'' shot throughout California mostly outdoors on
sweltering days, was the biggest-scale production Demme has been
involved in. Along with Murphy and Lawrence, the cast includes Ned
Beatty, Clarence Williams III, Cicely Tyson, Obba Babatunde and
funk-rock musician Rick James as the tough guy Spanky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big work scenes, big fight scenes,'' the director
explained. ``It was a long shoot and a lot of work. See, big studio
movies are either big and broad or very action-oriented. I've
always thought you can make a big studio movie with the integrity
of an indie and get it seen by lots of people. This movie is
showing kids it's not cool to get locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the pleasure of watching longtime friends Murphy and
Lawrence joke around on set, Demme said he considers working with
Clef one of the highlights of the production.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, during the recent dubbing session, the two
practically end each other's sentences as Clef plays a digital work
tape of one of his just-completed tracks for the ``Life''
soundtrack for a vistor.
</P>
<P>
   The piece has a warm '70s soul feel with socially conscious
lyrics and a jazzy groove clearly inspired by Marvin Gaye's
``What's Going On'' masterpiece. At one point, a sensuous saxophone
snakes through the melody.
</P>
<P>
   Clef, 26, explains with a twinkle in his eye that we're
listening to mellow pop-instrumentalist Kenny G, of all people. The
addition was a stroke of genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought Kenny to Brooklyn, bought him some Pumas and a gold
chain, and we got the right vibe,'' Clef jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Clef's other pieces for ``Life'' are equally effective in
drawing upon the music of the '30s, '40s, '50s and '90s as well as
the '70s. It's his first film score.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's the hardest one I'll ever do,'' the dreadlocked
rapper said. ``Everything else will be a piece of cake. This wasn't
just one genre where the music stays the same. With this movie, you
had to start in 1932 and end up in the '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides traces of soul and hip-hop, Clef's score, in which he
sang, arranged and played most of the instruments, features
elements of jazz, blues and ragtime. Pop-soul superstar R. Kelly
also composed songs for the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the highlights of the project has been going into a
small studio and working on the beats, then turning around and
watching Clef conduct a 35-piece orchestra,'' Demme said. ``I don't
know anyone that can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Life'' score may be unveiled in early April at New York's
Lincoln Center with Clef performing with the 62-piece New York
Philharmonic, Demme said, adding that the soundtrack album will
feature both Clef's score and Kelly's songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ghetto meets Beethoven,'' Clef quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Son of a preacher, Clef emigrated from Haiti at the age of 9 to
live in the Marlboro housing project in Brooklyn, N.Y., weaned on
the music of Bob Marley, Thelonious Monk and Jimi Hendrix. Working
with his cousin, Pras Michel, Clef enlisted singer-actress Lauryn
Hill to complete a new rap trio.
</P>
<P>
   Settling on the Fugees moniker (short for refugees), the group
began recording in an East Orange, N.J., basement studio. The
Fugees' second album, ``The Score,'' is the biggest-selling rap
album in history.
</P>
<P>
   To create such a wide-ranging score for ``Life,'' Clef _ who
recently produced the title track of the new Whitney Houston album
_ took a nontraditional approach, working at home from pivotal
scenes sent to him on video by Demme. Clef said he first went back
and studied soundtracks by Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes and Quincy
Jones before starting work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you call me for a flick, don't call me if you want some
string sections,'' he said during a break. ``If you want me, think
Paul Simon meets Marvin Gaye meets `Superfly.' &UR;  &LR; '' &UR;

IT'S A GREAT TIME TO SAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To cruise or not to cruise, that is the question.
</P>
<P>
   Most people answer negatively. While cruising seems a very much
``in'' vacation, only about 10 percent of Americans have cruised.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cruise lines would like to change a lot of minds.
This is why they sponsor a ``Choose to Cruise'' month at the
beginning of each year. At the same time, they'd better not change
too many minds too quickly: Even though it seems there is a vast
armada of cruise ships, if just 1 percent more of the population
booked a cruise, the lines couldn't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   Art Sbarsky, vice president of sales at Norwegian Cruise Lines,
said there is great opportunity for the cruise industry, when one
realizes that a small jump in bookings would put the lines at
overcapacity. Most lines are building new vessels to meet the
anticipated demand.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there are reports of more cabins than people to
always fill them. That means taking a cruise this year gets you
extra value for the travel dollar. With few exceptions _ some
holiday periods, some special cruises _ most lines are discounting
the advertised price. Sbarsky, seeing what he calls a soft year for
cruises, has put all NCL cruises on sale, with discounts up to 50
percent for some sailings. The sale, which covers cruises during
the entire year, continues through Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Why, someone might ask, take a cruise? Especially given all the
other travel opportunities out there. First, passengers on cruises
consistently rate their satisfaction at 90 percent or higher. This
takes a lot of worry out of planning a vacation. Everyone, no
matter the age or marital status, will find something at sea to
please.
</P>
<P>
   What's the secret to enjoying a cruise? The ship. It's as simple
as that.
</P>
<P>
   Ships, like people, have individual personalities. The design,
the size, the features, the staff, all contribute to the cruise
experience.
</P>
<P>
   So, before making a deposit, do some research, talk with friends
who have taken a cruise, talk to a cruise specialist at a travel
agency, check out a guidebook _ there's even one by Bostonian Fran
Golden called ``The Idiot's Guide to Cruises'' that answers a lot
of questions. One good reason to check out a cruise guide is that
many travel agencies now deal with ``preferred suppliers,'' and
since that limits the number of cruise choices at that agency, the
agent may not be aware of the many other choices available.
</P>
<P>
   And don't book on price alone. A good deal may not be good for
you if the ship isn't what you are looking for. Choices include
megavessels holding up to 3,000 passengers; sailing vessels; small
luxury ships; and boats. The Delta Queen Steamboat Co. vessels are
all boats; canal boats travel the Erie Canal and French and English
waterways; riverboats cruise Europe's waterways and the Nile in
Egypt. Small vessels have the advantage of being able to hug the
coastline. There, too, are adventure cruises and even cruises on a
luxury barge that travels the Mississippi and the coastline to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   First-time cruisers might look at one of the new megaliners _
vessels in the 70,000-ton to 145,000-ton category _ as they have
everything one might want, from smooth sailing to lavish
entertainment. Or simply take a three- or four-day cruise to test
the waters. Cruises lasting from one day to more than 100 days are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Families will especially love a cruise, particularly on the new
liners with grand children's play areas and family-sized rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Cruise Line has almost one deck devoted to children's
activities, even a separate area for teens. Carnival, Royal
Caribbean, Princess, and Holland America all have huge children's
areas on their new ships.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Caribbean offers staterooms with two bedrooms and two
baths as well as a sitting area for families. Princess has some
similar arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   More and more families are also finding cruise ships ideal for
reunions. Not only is there something for everyone on board, but
the lines make getting to the ships a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Solo travelers also find their needs catered to. Unfortunately,
most lines charge a hefty premium to book a room for one, but there
are ships with single cabins, and most lines will also work to
match up singles with other singles to cut the cost. Some guarantee
to do so or the solo traveler gets the room at the reduced price.
On board, special activities are planned for solo travelers, and
some lines offer ``gentlemen hosts'' to dance with or join in
activities.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing interest by families and young adults, the age
level on most cruises has dropped considerably. In general, the
longer the cruise, the older the crowd aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The major reasons most people object to cruises are because they
think cruises are regimented, offer too much food, are too dressy,
are too confined, are only for the lethargic, and may not be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Especially with the newer megaliners, each one of these
objections has been answered. First, regimentation is out. Yes,
most lines have some set hours for dining, generally for dinner.
But there are cruises where you can enter the dining room from 7
p.m. on and choose your own seating. Many lines offer 24-hour room
service and pizza parlors. Princess even has a dining room open 24
hours a day. With the exception of the ship safety drill, no
activity on board is mandated for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Food service has come a long way. Every line now offers a
``healthy'' choice at all meals. Most, if requested, will prepare
meals for special dietary needs; and many now offer alternative
dining, often at no extra cost.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, one of the first to do so, offers a choice of an
Italian or an Oriental dining room in addition to its other food
services. Many lines have even dropped the midnight buffet.
</P>
<P>
   The thought of getting into a tux scares many a man away from a
ship. While most lines still feature one or two formal nights, the
only request is that men wear at least a business suit or dressy
jacket. And there are lines where dressing up is not required _
check out Windjammer, for instance. On a cruise on the new Paul
Gauguin in Tahiti, a classy ship if I may say so, jackets for men
were never required.
</P>
<P>
   As to fears of confinement or even being sedentary, try any of
the new megaliners. There's not only room galore, but chances are
you won't be able to take in half the offerings on board in seven
days. Health clubs with all the latest equipment and grand views of
the ocean are a part of all the newer ships. Spas, too, have become
very popular. Celebrity Cruises has some spectacular spas.
</P>
<P>
   And as for safety, the ship lines have one of the best records
in the transportation world. Yes, there was that fire on the
Carnival Ecstasy last year. It was a made-for-television spot with
all that black smoke pouring out of the ship's aft. The fire,
caused by a welder's torch, was limited to the rear of the ship and
caused only minor injuries, mostly smoke-related. With modern
navigation and other technical equipment, along with strict
fire-safety requirements, the danger of something happening at sea
is very small.
</P>
<P>
   Another fear is that of getting seasick. If that is a concern,
again book one of the new megaliners. Most are so smooth you'll
hardly know the vessel is moving. Most ships have stabilizers to
help smooth out the journey.
</P>
<P>
   With cruises today, travelers can go just about anywhere in the
world where there is water, to find adventure or simply relax. An
added advantage to cruising, especially in Europe, is that you can
travel from port to port without ever unpacking and repacking. Now
that's a real travel luxury!

NEW SHIPS AND NEW OPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are exciting times for the cruise world. Not only have
some grand ships arrived in ports around the world, but even more
cruise options are on the horizon, some arriving this year.
</P>
<P>
   The grandest vessel afloat, at least for the near future, will
be Royal Caribbean's 142,000-ton, $500 million Voyager of the Seas.
The vessel, which will have its maiden voyage in November, is not
only huge but also filled with innovative touches.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines have been playing a game of one-upmanship the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   For almost 50 years since its launching in 1946, Cunard's Queen
Elizabeth II, at 83,673 tons, held the title of the world's largest
cruise ship _ it's still the only ship offering trans-Atlantic
service. Then, in 1996, Carnival Cruise Lines introduced the
Carnival Destiny, the new champion at 101,353 tons. It held the
title until last year, when Princess Cruises' 108,821-ton Grand
Princess took the title. The Voyager, the first of three ``Eagle
Project'' ships from Royal Caribbean, should hold the title for a
few years at least. Except for two additional Eagle ships, no other
line is proposing anything this size. Both Carnival and Princess
are building additional ships of the size of the Destiny and Grand
Princess.
</P>
<P>
   The question might be, ``Why build such large ships?'' For the
cruise lines, it's a matter of economics. The larger ships with
their increased passenger capacity _ up to 3,000 passengers or more
on one sailing _ have a lower cost ratio. For passengers, the
increased size means more amenities, more options, and grander
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Carnival has found, its Destiny is proving exceptionally
popular with passengers. For travelers who enjoy the resort-class
atmosphere of a ship, the Voyager of the Seas should be a dream
come true. It will have a horizontal atrium as long as two football
fields. This Royal Promenade will boast two 11-story Centrums
(another feature Royal Caribbean introduced years ago) and will
have ships, restaurants, and entertainment areas along its winding
path. Special lighting and theatrical effects will change the Royal
Promenade's appearance by day and night. And overlooking this will
be staterooms with ``courtyard views.'' The innovations don't stop
there. Also on board will be a 40- by 60-foot skating rink for
passenger ice skating and ice shows, a rock-climbing wall, and an
in-line skating track. It will also feature an Aquarium Bar with a
huge display of sea life in four aquariums, many options for
dining, and, of course, the world's largest casino.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival, in the meantime, has grown even larger. The line
recently acquired Cunard and Costa Cruises. It already owns Holland
America, Windstar, and Seabourn.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Magic is another innovative ship that now sails on
three- and four-day cruises between Cape Canaveral in Florida and
the Bahamas. Later this year, a second Disney ship, the Wonder,
will join the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic is designed like a classic liner. It is a beauty.
While the ship is designed to be a family cruise experience, those
without children will still find a grand ship to sail on. Among
innovations is a dining experience in which passengers rotate
dining rooms each evening of the cruise _ even the waitstaff comes
along. For children, there is almost a complete deck set aside for
them, with areas separated by age. The kids get care from morning
to late in the night. There are also adult-only areas with a
variety of entertainment lounges. There is no gaming casino on the
ship, but with all the entertainment options, including some
spectacular Disney shows, you'll never miss the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Another Disney feature is its own private isle, a part of every
cruise (four-day cruise passengers also call on Nassau). Not only
is the island grandly set up, but it is the only island where the
cruise ship docks _ no boarding tenders on this cruise. Disney is
also innovative in its packaging of the vacation. The cruises are
sold as a package with a stay at Disney World and are designed for
a seamless vacation. The same key card that is used at a Disney
World hotel is also used aboard ship for everything, including
unlocking doors, providing credit services at the theme park and
aboard ship, and security. Special buses make the one-hour journey
between Disney World and the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Grand Princess holds the ``world's largest''
title for now, its designers have created many intimate spaces, so
with few exceptions you'll never feel crowded. This ship, too,
offers many innovations ranging from a wedding chapel _ for both
renewal of vows as well as marriage _ to a spectacular disco
suspended 155 feet in the air.
</P>
<P>
   On this as well as some other Princess ships, you can dine
around the clock. The Horizon Court never closes.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia for the seagoing past is found on Holland America's
lavish new Rotterdam. The sixth vessel to hold that name in the
line's 120-year-plus history, the new Rotterdam boasts twin
smokestacks, a holdover from the previous ship.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation on both the sea and rivers is RiverBarge
Excursions. The company's first vessel, the River Explorer, began
service last fall. The River Explorer carries 198 guests on two
interlocked river barges. It features luxurious accommodations and
cruises along the inland waterways as well as the Gulf Intracoastal
Waterway. Excursions range from four to 10 days. A nice
entertainment touch is that the line features regional performances
from its various ports of call _ from storytellers and Cajun bands
to full gospel choirs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the healthiest decisions of the past year was Carnival's
introduction of the Elation, the first nonsmoking cruise ship. From
the day its keel was laid, Carnival issued a no-smoking ban during
its construction in Finland, and carries this prohibition on its
weekly sailings. If you smoke, you face not only a fine but the
possibility of being removed from the ship at the next port of
call.
</P>
<P>
   This year will see not only more ships but also new ship lines.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line will not only introduce a new vessel, the
Norwegian Sky, but is also stretching the Norwegian Majesty by
adding a new midsection. The stretch will be completed by April,
when the Majesty reenters Boston-to-Bermuda service. The Sky will
debut in August and will carry 2,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the smaller lines, Radisson Seven Seas, will introduce
the Seven Seas Navigator in August. This 490-passenger vessel will
boast an ice-strengthened hull, which means it could sail just
about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance Cruises is also adding to its fleet this year with
two additional 684-passenger vessels. One will be based in Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   Among other vessels arriving this year will be the Carnival
Triumph, another 102,000-ton vessel; and Holland America's newest
Volendam, at 63,000 tons. Holland America keeps seagoing history
alive by naming its newest vessels for previous vessels from the
line.
</P>
<P>
   In December, a new cruise line specializing in world cruises at
reasonable prices will begin service. While many lines now offer
around-the-world cruises each January, the World Cruise Co. will
offer these cruises year round, and at prices lower than the
starting price on other lines. The Toronto-based company is part of
Marine Expeditions, and has said its rates will range from around
$10,000 to $15,000 a person for 100-plus days of cruising. The
cruises may be a bit spartan for some travelers, but, unlike other
such cruises, these voyages will touch on every continent,
including Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after the turn of the century, American Classic
Cruises, parent company of the Delta Queen Steamboat Co., will
introduce not only a new line but also new ships for its American
Hawaii Line. The new line is planning on five coastal cruises over
the next seven years. The 226-passenger vessels will recapture the
days of the old Fall River Line, which offered grand sailings
between Boston and New York. The new vessels will offer a variety
of sailings along the Eastern seaboard and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   For its American Hawaii Line, the company has signed a letter of
agreement to build two vessels that the company says will be the
largest US cruise ships ever built and the first large cruise
vessels constructed in America in more than 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another line offering a bit of nostalgia is American West
Steamboat Co. Next year, it will introduce the Empress of the
North, a 224-passenger sternwheeler recalling the river showboats
of the 1800s but with all the modern amenities and technology. The
340-foot vessel will join its sister ship, the Queen of the West, a
slightly shorter version of the Empress, on cruises on the rivers
and coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest and Southeast Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Star Clippers, which currently offer the only true sailing
vessels in the world _ built on the design of the famed clipper
ships once built in Boston _ will offer the Royal Clipper, the
first five-masted full-rigger vessel since 1910. With some 40 sails
(most of them square), the 439-foot vessel will carry 228
passengers. The line's other ships are the Star Clipper and the
Star Flyer, each carrying 170 passengers.

WHETHER ALBUM OR LIVE, THIS   WEISS GUY `EXTREMELY COOL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
BY DAVID BLOOM 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He played drums for blues legend Lightning
Hopkins. He lived down the hall from musical fellow travelers Tom
Waits and Rickie Lee Jones when none of them could afford more than
a $9-a-day Hollywood fleabag hotel. One of Jones' first hits,
``Chuck E.'s in Love,'' was about him.
</P>
<P>
   And today, Chuck E. Weiss has a new album out on Slow
River/Rykodisc. Just like its name suggests, the album is
``Extremely Cool.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a delightfully sly stew of styles, made with production,
writing and musical help from Waits, former X guitarist Tony
Gilkyson and others, mixing cajun, blues, Lieber and Stoller pop
jokes, boogie-woogie, jump, Dixieland and much more.
</P>
<P>
   All that is filtered through the same beatnik sensibilities that
color Jones' and Waits' work, and the voodoo guitar blues of
Hopkins and John Lee Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   And as fun as the album is, the stumpy Weiss _ whose outsized,
weathered face and shaggy black hair remind one a little too much
of Keith Richards _ is even more fun in concert. He's been
performing before crowds since he was a teen-ager backing Hopkins,
and his entertainment savvy shows.
</P>
<P>
   Long a Friday night staple in North Hollywood at the Hot House,
12123 Riverside Drive, Weiss also will be playing other dates
around the region in the next few weeks. Whether live or on the
album, check out Chuck E. He's ``Extremely Cool'' indeed.

VILNIUS: CITY OF SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILNIUS, Lithuania _ The huge statue of Lenin has been removed
from the former Lenin Square in Lithuania's capital. Lenin has been
banished to a sculpture storage gulag while the city that lived so
long in his shadow, in every sense, decides what to do with him.
There's talk he might end up in Europos Parkas, which is a bit
short on Socialist Realist art: A sophisticated sculpture park
north of the city, it's filled with works by an array of
internationally known artists.
</P>
<P>
   Europos Parkas became possible only with the 1991 ouster of the
Soviets, of course. But there's also a downside, culturally
speaking, to ditching communism, and it's not just the multiple
McDonald's eateries here: In 1995, Vilnius earned the dubious
distinction of becoming home to the world's first memorial to Frank
Zappa.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything about Vilnius surprised me, starting with the
presence of a first-rate sculpture park. My hotel was fine, the
food was fine, the architecture and art were fine, the shopping was
fine, even the visit to the former KGB detention cells was, in a
creepy way, fine.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there was not fine. I was traveling with a small group
from Warsaw to Vilnius. LOT, the Polish airline, bumped us from our
flight, which meant the organizers of the Baltic States tour I was
on had to charter an 18-seat prop plane with stringent space
limitations. Our luggage was weighed; the steward who looked well
in excess of 200 pounds wasn't. The great communist tradition of
overmanning because labor is cheap is still in force, I found:
Hence, the half-dozen guys with walkie-talkies at the Warsaw
airport who spent an hour thrashing out the problem of getting us
from the terminal to the plane, which would have been a two-minute
walk. Eventually, they found a bus. In Vilnius, we were the subject
of a similarly overmanned dispute: No, we couldn't walk the 100
yards or so from the plane to the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Things brightened the moment we entered the building. People
waiting to meet friends and family held armloads of flowers to
welcome them. Traveling freely is still a novelty here, and
traveling by plane still has a whiff of glamour and excitement.
Arrivals are special occasions. And while the outskirts of Vilnius
are filled with leftover Soviet buildings _ bleak, huge apartment
blocks with laundry hanging over the rusting metal balconies _ the
city center has a fairy-tale charm.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnius is a perfect size for walking. Many of the city's pale
stucco neoclassical structures _ painted gold, yellow, vanilla,
peach, and rose _ have been lovingly restored, often with foreign
money. ``IBM,'' says the sign on one lovely turquoise building. On
the facades of some, you'll see a spot where centuries' worth of
exterior layers have been peeled away, intentionally exposing the
buildings' bones, a reminder that the past is ever present, even
when it's covered over.
</P>
<P>
   Vilnius is reclaiming its architectural past. The Soviets had
closed the city's beautiful cathedral, and yanked three huge
Baroque sculptures off its roof, allowing them to smash on the
ground below. Reproductions were put up after the fall of the
Soviet regime _ but not without debate. The cathedral architecture
is a restrained 18th-century neoclassical, and the exuberance of
the Baroque figures was always incongruous. In this case, though,
the final decision was to make the cathedral look just as it did
before the Soviets took control. Back went the statues.
</P>
<P>
   This is a music-conscious city. One evening I attended a concert
given by a local chamber music ensemble called Arsenalas, in the
Vilnius Picture Gallery, a 17th-century palace that formerly
belonged to the Chodkeviciai family. In a white-and-gold rococo
room adorned with a ceramic stove in the corner, the musicians
performed a program that included standard Western repertory, Lully
to Faure, and also the work of M.K. Ciurlionis, a
turn-of-the-century Lithuanian composer and pianist, whose Vilnius
home is now a museum where concerts are also regularly held.
</P>
<P>
   You needn't buy a concert ticket to hear music performed well in
Vilnius, though. The young student musician I heard playing a
Beethoven violin romance on a corner near the Presidential Palace
was far above the usual street musician standard. One of his
predecessors at the Academy of Music here was Jascha Heifetz.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a religious city, with 40 churches for a population
of 600,000. Some were used by the Soviets for purposes other than
worship: One became the Museum of Atheism. Many are architectural
gems, their vocabularies ranging from medieval to neoclassical. In
the so-called ``Gothic Corner'' in the old part of town, for
instance, are three churches in that style. The most beautiful is
St. Anne's, which boasts a brick facade that looks like lace, with
huge, elegant arches threading their way through slender pillars.
When Napoleon dropped by en route to Russia, he expressed a desire
to bring St. Anne's back to Paris with him.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baroque Church of Saints Peter and Paul was
built on the site that was allegedly headquarters for the cult of
the Lithuanian pagan goddess of love, Milda. I learned this from a
publication called ``Vilnius in Your Pocket: The Official City
Guide.'' Most of the world's big cities have similar periodicals,
but I've never found one as complete _ and completely irreverent _
as the Vilnius version, which takes pains to point out, for
instance, that Lithuania was the last pagan state in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A lingering pagan influence might account for the raucous
interior of Saints Peter and Paul, a white-on-white stucco
extravaganza adorned with 2,000 figures _ laundresses, tritons,
characters from local legends and the Bible, an unfortunate chap
being boiled in oil, allegorical skeletons reminding you to behave
yourself while you've still got the chance, and some folks not
behaving well at all. Silent witnesses to all this are the elephant
sculptures holding up the church's arches: Their plaster trunks are
bound with plaster cloth so they can't blab.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Vilnius is a religious city _ but Egle Jakubenaite, my
guide, also observes that ``basketball is our second religion.''
Lithuania's victories over the Soviet Army team, she says, used to
be a particular point of pride.

HYPE ON FOX KEPT ADDING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, Fox ran 228 commercials during its Super Bowl
coverage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine ran during the game. The rest of the 30-second spots
were scattered throughout the seven-hour pregame show. In addition,
Fox's in-house ads, promoting prime-time programming such as ``The
Simpsons'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' numbered around 80. Fox affiliates
also ran a handful of promotions and local advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials don't apologize for the commercialization of the
most-watched sporting event on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an 8 percent drop in viewership from last year's game,
the Super Bowl still managed to earn a 40.2 rating and 61 share in
the overnight measure of 44 major media markets. Nielsen estimates
that about 127.5 million people watched all or part of the game.
That makes it the sixth most-watched television program in history.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spokesman Vince Wladika said critics of Fox's generous use
of advertisements are being naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that all networks want to have the NFL on their
network is to promote itself and earn revenue,'' Wladika said. ``We
didn't have an outrageous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ads went for an average of $1.6 million apiece;
Fox paid $550 million for the rights to broadcast NFC games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston viewers didn't tune in as much as those in other cities.
The game generated a 39.6 rating and 58 share here.
</P>
<P>
   The much-criticized pregame show earned solid numbers throughout
the day. In Boston, the numbers peaked during the 30 minutes before
kickoff, when Channel 25 earned a 32.6 rating and 53 share. That
was significantly up from ratings earlier in the day. John Madden's
All-Millennium Team, for instance, earned a 6 rating and 14 share.
</P>
<P>
   Madden was his usual self during his game analysis, openly
questioning why the Falcons declined to attempt field goals, for
instance, when their offense was unable to move deep in Broncos
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Play-by-play man Pat Summerall was uneven. He made a great
transition when a technical glitch caused a commercial to run three
seconds too long. When game coverage resumed, John Elway already
had taken the snap and was rolling right to throw an 80-yard
touchdown to Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But Summerall also misidentified Broncos cornerback Darrien
Gordon and mistook a holding penalty for roughing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes happen, and Summerall has been one of the best
play-by-play announcers of all time. He is almost 70, and the
details are getting past him.
</P>
<P>
   Former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw once proved that he
could indeed spell ``cat'' _ after Hollywood Henderson bet he
couldn't, even if you spotted him the c and the t _ and showed
Sunday that he is a dogged journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw's pursuit of whether Elway would retire was golden. He
asked three different times in three different circumstances. Elway
was mum at first, but then relented by telling Bradshaw it would be
challenging to try for three championships in a row. Elway didn't
say either way, but he left the door open. Thanks to Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The best postgame interview was conducted by ESPN's Chris
Mortensen, who talked with Eugene Robinson right after the game on
the field. The Falcons safety, who had been arrested the night
before the game on charges of soliciting sex from an undercover
police officer, told Mortensen that there was a difference between
being innocent and being righteous, and he ``wasn't righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.

THE RULE OF FAIR PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; My businessman friend was earnest _ and urgent. ``Will someone
explain this thing to me?'' he asked. ``Not the retention of
office. I agree that there was no impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I need explained is the dynamics. How does someone who
violates a young lady and lies under oath about it become the hero
of the hour and those who want to bring him to justice become the
villains. How has President Clinton arranged to become the
victim?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him I would take a stab.
</P>
<P>
   There are two perpetrators in the dock in the current situation.
Bill Clinton is one. The Republican Party is the other. And the
American people have made it clear they are much more alarmed by
the GOP's Orwellian attempt to overturn the results of a popular
election than they are about Clinton's embarrassment after having
been caught cheating on his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind ``the rule of law.'' The current fracas is about the
deep, mysterious, and far more binding rule of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   This shared sense of what constitutes playing by the rules is
nowhere written down; it is handed down from one generation to the
next, in a constant state of flux. More important than the perjury
statutes, it is the anvil upon which they are hammered out. Indeed,
decisions of this court of popular opinion, reached by the American
people after all competing institutions have their say, are more
fundamental than the Constitution itself. They gave the
Constitution birth.
</P>
<P>
   There can be no doubt that Clinton is guilty of much
unattractive behavior. Anybody who doesn't understand that he and
Betty Currie and Vernon Jordan conspired to clean up an
embarrassing situation by getting Monica Lewinsky out of town
doesn't know a thing about their high-powered world. The same might
be said about Webster Hubbell's embarrassing exit from the Justice
Department. But these are relatively small-time violations of rules
for which norms are far from being widely shared. A great majority
of Americans therefore apparently consider the appropriate remedy
to be disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   So what constistutes a really gross violation of the rules?
Perhaps the most basic tenet of American democracy is the agreement
to abide by the results of elections. It has been so since 41
Pilgrims set their hands to the Mayflower Compact in 1620.
</P>
<P>
   This basic rule has been tested many times over the centuries.
It was affirmed most recently by none other than Richard Nixon.
Nixon decided in 1960 not to contest an election that friends of
John F. Kennedy may or may not have stolen by stuffing ballot boxes
in a few criucial districts.
</P>
<P>
   The rule was tested again starting in the fall of 1996. A trio
of influential voices in New York _ the editorial page of The Wall
Street Journal, William Safire of The New York Times, and Stuart
Taylor Jr., writing on the Paula Jones case in the American Lawyer
_ raised the possibility of impeachment in the wake of Clinton's
victory at the polls. That crucial permission from the elite media
enabled all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was a ``jail break,'' as they say in
football: all manner of players rushing through a previously
defended line. It is hard now to remember all the fliers that the
Republicans took once permission was given. My favorite is the one
described on a clipping that I keep above my desk. ``Republicans
believe they have a real winner in `Spacegate' _ charges that Bill
Clinton approved the launch of a US-built satellite on a Chinese
rocket in exchange for campaign contributions,'' wrote Nancy Dunne
of the Financial Times. ``Industry baffled by space scandal,'' says
the headline.
</P>
<P>
   What turned the Republicans into losers so sore they were
prepared to use any means, fair or foul, to unseat the president?
About this I talk a good deal with my Republican friends.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the Democrats refused to come to terms with the
mandate Ronald Reagan won in 1980 for many years. Not until the
Republican congressional landslide in 1994 did Clinton emerge in
his present form. There were the various special prosecutors who
targeted Presidents Reagan and Bush; and the extreme partisanship
on the eve of the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   My own candidate would be the Democrats repudiation of the 1986
tax act in 1993. Whatever it was, something drove the GOP around
the bend. They abandoned the fundamental tenets of fair play. That
is why the Republicans, not Clinton, are on trial.

AT&AMP;T DEAL WITH TIME WARNER LATEST STEP BY CEO ARMSTRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, AT&AMP;T Corp. was the telecommunications
industry's sickly giant. The company was saddled with high costs
and declining market share in its core long-distance telephone
business. And while the Baby Bell local phone companies were making
plans to offer long-distance services of their own, AT&AMP;T still
hadn't come up with a way to compete with the Bells in local phone
service.
</P>
<P>
   Today, AT&AMP;T still faces many of the same problems, but now the
company has a plan, and it's executing that plan with an intensity
that has surprised many industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The company has slashed its payroll and cut costs, leading to a
45 percent increase in 1998 profits. And its deal, announced
Monday, to provide local phone service through Time Warner's cable
television system is the most recent in a series of bold deals
intended to transform AT&AMP;T into a one-stop shop for all kinds of
telecommunications offerings _ from local phone service to wireless
communications to high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, the outsider who was appointed as AT&AMP;T's
chief executive officer in October 1997, is getting much of the
credit for the company's new aggressiveness. ``The reason AT&AMP;T
didn't make the big moves until Armstrong came is that Armstrong
didn't know they couldn't be done,'' said telecommunications
industry analyst Jeffrey Kagan. ``So he went ahead and did them.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors have largely applauded Armstrong's moves. AT&AMP;T
stockhas increased from about $50 a share when he took over to
$93.56 Monday, when it rose 2 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Adamik, senior vice president at the Yankee Group in
Boston, says that Armstrong arrived at AT&AMP;T with a huge advantage
over his predecessors. He wasn't a ``Bellhead,'' a long-time
telephone industry veteran with roots stretching back to the days
of the old Bell system monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Armstrong took a very different route to the top. He
played football at Miami University of Ohio, winding up with a
business degree and an injury that left one of his arms shorter
than the other. Right out of college he joined IBM Corp. and stayed
for 31 years, but left in 1992 because he wasn't given the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong became chief executive officer at Hughes Electronics
Corp., then mainly known as a defense contractor. He refocused the
business on the booming market for communications satellites. In
the process, he developed relationships with the leaders of the
cable television industry, who depend on satellites to deliver TV
programs to cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's knowledge of the TV business led him to a decision
that seemed extremely risky back in 1994. He concluded consumers
would be willing to replace traditional cable TV service with a
system that would let them receive programs direct from space with
small satellite dishes at their homes. Hughes called the service
DirecTV and it has prospered, with 4.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was first contacted about the job at AT&AMP;T in 1996,
when Alex Mandl, the man expected to succeed then-CEO Robert Allen,
quit to join Teligent, a new communications firm. But AT&AMP;T
surprised industry watchers by picking John Walter, chief executive
officer of the printing firm, R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Within months, AT&AMP;T's board had a change of heart. It dumped
Walter and came back to Armstrong, who took the post in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most important moves in AT&AMP;T's turnaround were
launched by Allen. He oversaw the decision to spin off AT&AMP;T's
telephone switching division. The resulting company, Lucent
Technologies, has gone on to highly-profitable success. And Allen
reversed perhaps the biggest blunder of his tenure when he spun off
computer-maker NCR Corp. Allen had pushed to acquire NCR in 1991
for $7.4 billion, and the company lost another $4 billion by the
time it threw in the towel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong has won plaudits from investors who wanted to
see more dramatic moves to reverse AT&AMP;T's fortunes. Two months
after his arrival, Armstrong sold off AT&AMP;T's credit card business.
In January 1998, Armstrong said he planned to cut up to 18,000 jobs
over the next two years. One year later, 13,500 of those jobs had
already vanished.
</P>
<P>
   In the same month, AT&AMP;T made its first major move back into the
local telephone business, agreeing to pay $11.3 billion for
Teleport Communications Inc., a company that operates local
telephone networks for businesses in major US cities.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the company has acquired Tele-Communications Inc. ,
a cable company that serves a third of the nation. And now the Time
Warner deal will give AT&AMP;T access to even more of the nation's
cable TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to upgrade the TCI and Time Warner systems so that
they can be used to carry telephone calls. AT&AMP;T operates the
nation's largest long-distance network, but has no way to carry
calls ``the last mile,'' from an AT&AMP;T phone office to the caller's
home. For that, AT&AMP;T has had to depend on leasing local lines from
the Baby Bell phone companies. Armstrong's predecessor launched
just such an effort, but Armstrong abandoned it, after deciding
that it was too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Now AT&AMP;T hopes to convert the TCI and Time Warner cable systems
to carry phone calls as well as TV shows. Nobody has yet done this
on a large scale, said Gigi Wang, telecommunications analyst at
International Data Corp. ``Is it a sure bet? Absolutely not,'' Wang
said. ``They're still a ways away from offering the service.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffrey Kagan said that AT&AMP;T has no choice but to go after
the local phone market, or sit helplessly while rivals _ MCI
Worldcom, Sprint and eventually the Baby Bells _ continue to devour
its long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of hard calls that Mike Armstrong has to
make to prepare for AT&AMP;T's future,'' said Kagan, ``that nobody was
willing to take before.''

</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Corrects tag line at end of take. No other changes.) 
 By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who understands bureaucracies should know that the way to
get a cushy job isn't to make yourself desirable but to make
yourself undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, while we're suffering through a national crisis over
alleged favors to Lewinsky, the one person who clearly has enjoyed
a big payoff--at taxpayer expense--is Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was a secretary at the White House, a holdover from the
Bush administration. When she began to look like trouble, she was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the Pentagon is no surprise. Although
conservatives who inveigh against overpaid, do-nothing federal
bureaucrats probably have in mind the Department of Health and
Human Services, if your urgent need is a government job in general,
rather than anything in particular that job might accomplish,
apparently the Pentagon is your best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a military force of one and a half million people, the
Defense Department employs about 800,000 civilians. Linda Tripp is
one of them, holding the position of public affairs specialist with
a civil service ranking of GS-15, Step 6. That puts the 49-year-old
high-school grad at the top of the Pentagon's middle management
ranks. Like all GS employees, she just received an
across-the-board-pay increase. Tripp's raise, including a
``locality'' adjustment for working in the Washington, D.C., area,
was 3.68 percent, bringing her salary to $94,098 a year.
</P>
<P>
   For which she does ...? Since March 1998, nothing. Although she
has supposedly been working at home, she was stripped of her
duties--but not her pay or her title--shortly after the scandal
broke. Tripp has characterized this as a politically motivated
``demotion.'' It will strike many as a demotion devoutly to be
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky's title at the Pentagon was confidential
assistant to the assistant secretary for public affairs. Her job
was writing press releases, for which she was paid $33,000. Note
that Lewinsky got this job as a payoff for being undesirable to a
presidential aide, not for being desirable to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Tripp is the public affairs specialist for a program
called the Joint Civilian Orientation Conference, an arguably
worthwhile annual propaganda effort that takes 60 civilian ``public
opinion leaders'' on a weeklong tour of military operations. Tripp
had primary responsibility for the paperwork involved in the
selection process, for making travel and hotel arrangements, as
well as for other logistic odds and ends such as the week's
kick-off banquet. According to the New York Times, before Tripp
took the job, this position was part-time.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for more detail, the person now doing Tripp's job
used the word ``coordinating'' a lot, but that was about it. There
is, it turns out, no official description of the job. Writing one
is among the tasks Tripp is being paid to perform now.
</P>
<P>
   But there are official descriptions of other GS-15 public
affairs specialist positions. For instance, the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights is currently looking for someone to ``assist in the
reviews and analysis of numerous requests for speeches; to develop,
clear, release, and distribute a wide range of information and data
concerning the nature and objective of the Commission's programs;
(and to) prepare press releases, fact sheets, etc. and arrange
press conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: PR grunt. Salary: $80,658 to $104,851.
</P>
<P>
   To try to get some sort of independent measure of what these
jobs are worth, I called Kelly Services, the nationwide temp
agency. Without mentioning Tripp or the Pentagon, I described her
job there to the woman at Kelly. Oh, she said, that's high-end
secretarial. How much would you have to pay somebody to do a job
like that, I asked. Oh, $18 to $25 an hour, she said. That's
$36,000 to $50,000 a year--roughly half of what Tripp is being paid
not to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the folks on duty in the skies over Iraq make about half
of what Linda Tripp makes. Indeed, Tripp pulls down more than all
but a handful of the U.S. military's most senior officers. She
earns more than a ballistic missile submarine commander and is on a
par with aircraft carrier skippers in the Persian Gulf and Army
generals ready to lead thousands of troops into combat.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Bob Barr and Henry Hyde would say if Monica had got
a deal like that.

FLAWED HEROES PROVIDE SUPERB FODDER IN `BASILICA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Basilica.'' By William D. Montalbano. G.P. Putnam's Sons. 304
pages. $23.95.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano's stunning last work is a tale of Vatican intrigue,
murder, sins of the past and above all, friendship.
</P>
<P>
   A priest with close ties to Roman Catholicism's first Latino
pope, Pius XIII, falls from the walkway in the dome of St. Peter's
Basilica. The pope, known as Tredi, asks his old friend, Brother
Paul, to help the Swiss Guard investigate and determine whether the
priest fell or was pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Years before, when Pius XIII was a cardinal ferreting out drugs
throughout Latin America, Paul was a Miami cop who was on Tredi's
protection detail whenever Tredi was in Miami. One night, Paul
saved the cardinal's life when they were ambushed by the Caballero
drug cartel. Paul also stole a suitcase containing $1 million in
drug money. That single crime would haunt both the cop and the
cardinal for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basilica'' works on every level. It is a first-rate, riveting
thriller, peopled with flawed heroes and heinous villains, as
Montalbano subtly and skillfully weaves between past and present to
tell the life stories of the pope and Brother Paul. His story alone
would make a great novel. Delving deep into the intrigue of church
politics, Montalbano writes with clarity and wit.
</P>
<P>
   The author artfully uses his years as a foreign correspondent to
show an insider's knowledge of Miami, Colombia and Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   Montalbano died in March. The publishing world has lost a truly
fine writer and storyteller.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Dark Justice.'' By William Bernhardt. Ballantine Books.
$22.50. 388 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt's eighth legal thriller featuring Tulsa, Okla.-based
defense attorney Ben Kincaid is a compelling look at the dark side
of the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   On tour for his true-crime book, ``Katching the Kindergarten
Killer,'' Kincaid is at the Magic Valley Mystery Bookstore in the
Pacific Northwest. No one is buying the book, so Kincaid strikes up
a conversation with the owner and learns that the owner is going to
have his cat put to sleep. Late that night, Kincaid breaks into the
bookstore, but he gets caught before he can rescue the cat.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with breaking and entering, the judge sets Kincaid's
bail at $50,000 after the gorgeous and treacherous District
Attorney Granny Adams tells the judge that Kincaid has worked for
``some kind of animal rights terrorist group,'' adding that he
probably was involved in their illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   While in jail, he meets some members of the environmental group
Green Rage and agrees to defend one of its leaders, George Zakin,
who is accused of killing a lumberjack. Years ago, Kincaid had
successfully defended Zakin in another murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid slowly begins to realize what an uphill battle he faces
in a town where the loggers and conservationists hate each other.
The judge refuses a change of venue, Granny conceals information,
Zakin won't tell the truth, one of Kincaid's investigators is
attacked, a tabloid reporter posing as a Green Rage member is
killed, Granny blackmails witnesses and the violence continues to
escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Bernhardt masterfully weaves his tale of legal corruption,
out-of control environmentalists and angry loggers fighting for
their livelihood. His characters are well developed, the dialogue
is fresh and the ending totally unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Bad City.'' By Ed McBain. Simon and Schuster. $25. 271
pages.
</P>
<P>
   No one writes a police procedural better than Ed McBain. The
49th in the series featuring the 87th precinct is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The body of a young woman is found in a park just seven blocks
from the station house. Detective Steve Carella and Artie Shaw
``don't need a medical examiner to tell them she's been
strangled.'' But they can't find a handbag, so they don't know who
she is.
</P>
<P>
   Then Carella pulls off her ring and discovers the letters IHS,
engraved on the inside of the band. Hence the victim had to have
been a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Other officers are trying to catch a burglar known as the Cookie
Boy because he always leaves a cookie on the pillow after he
finishes cleaning the place out. Unfortunately, one day he breaks
into an apartment and finds the occupant with her lover, she pulls
a gun and before you know it she and the lover are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the man who killed Carella's father but was acquitted
because of an inept district attorney is stalking Carella. And
Carella's divorced sister is dating the D.A.
</P>
<P>
   McBain gives you realistic, gritty and often witty dialogue. His
stories are well paced and so realistic that they could come off a
police blotter in any big city. It's a pleasure to read the end
product of a master of his genre.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Clancy's Net Force.'' By Tom Clancy and Steve Pieczenik.
Berkeley. $7.99 (paperback). 372 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Confession time _ I am a Tom Clancy junkie. I'll read anything
with his name on it, even when it's a paperback collaboration. But
``Net Force'' is neither Clancy nor Steve Pieczenik at his best.
</P>
<P>
   It's 2010 and almost every aspect of life worldwide is linked by
computer. The United States creates a security agency called Net
Force to ensure that the laws of the Net are enforced.
</P>
<P>
   As the thriller opens, Net Force's chief is assassinated and all
signs point to a mob hit. Alex Michaels, the deputy director, is
promoted and soon becomes a target. Meanwhile, computer-generated
disasters occur around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   This quickie geopolitical thriller is the basis of a two-part
ABC miniseries. TV Guide called it an ``intriguing drama.''
Usually, Clancy's books are strong on technological details, but
the virtual reality of Web-walking sequences in ``Net Force''
really confused me.
</P>
<P>
   If you watched the miniseries, forget the book. Even if you
didn't watch, scratch this book from your reading list.

right along with the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. It's a happy thought.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I was trying to hedge my bet a bit, trying to buy
credit life insurance to back up the loan.
</P>
<P>
   But would you believe it? The bank balked.
</P>
<P>
   When the nice lady punched in the particulars, a red band popped
up across her computer like she'd never seen before, declaring in
no uncertain terms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit Life Refused!''
</P>
<P>
   Heck of a note. They'd probably still take a bet on the Falcons.
But they won't bet I'll still be around next year.
</P>
<P>
   The nice lady, trying to make me feel better, said it was
nothing personal. She said it was probably because of my age.
Imagine how much better I felt.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, I do think it is personal. I think the computer still
remembers me. That makes two of us.
</P>
<P>
   This was some 25 years ago. My daddy was stricken with cancer.
The print shop where he worked had no medical insurance for its
employees. He ended up having to make a note at the bank for money
for radiation treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it was in those days. Lest we forget, it's still
the way it is for millions of Americans. How long, oh Congress, how
long?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, on his way out of the bank a nice young lady clerk had
asked my dad if he wanted credit life for the loan. He said you
bet.
</P>
<P>
   For the bank it was a bad bet, selling loan insurance to a man
who was borrowing money for cancer treatment, as stated on his loan
application.
</P>
<P>
   Not too many months later my dad was dead, and I was trying to
arrange to pay off whatever debts he had left.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the bank, I was told not to worry, that the
insurance took care of the balance on the loan _ good news at a bad
time.
</P>
<P>
   But a week or so later the bank called me. The insurance
company, I was told, had balked at paying, claiming that the bank
should have never sold him credit life on that kind of loan.
</P>
<P>
   I agreed, the bank shouldn't have. But it did, and they had
taken his money for the insurance, month after month while he
lived.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company, to be fair, said it would refund the
premiums. I can't repeat here what I said. Suffice it to say I put
a curse on all banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   But a day or so later, the president of the bank called me to
say that he'd looked into the matter and if the insurance company
wouldn't make good on its promise, the bank would.
</P>
<P>
   I'll always remember the reason he gave: ``Because I think it's
the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   I banked with that bank for as long as that banker was there,
though I never bought credit life for a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Not until now, now that it's too late and I'm too old.
</P>
<P>
   I'm 58. My dad was 59 when he died. The computer remembers.
</P>
<P>
   But just wait until next year.

WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE, BUT DO YOU DRINK ENOUGH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Valerie Morrow carries her water bottle
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually have one in the truck and one in the dance bag,''
she said. Morrow, a YMCA aerobics instructor, can't afford to
become dehydrated with her busy schedule of up to three classes a
day, even it means frequent bathroom trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the beginning of the third class, I'm excusing myself,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so water conscious, especially in a country
where advertisers spend billions of dollars trying to persuade us
to drink soft drinks, alcohol and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeinated and alcoholic beverages are actually dehydrating
because they increase the amount of urine produced by the body and
do nothing to replace the fluids. (Decaffeinated sodas don't
dehydrate, but some contain other substances that aren't good for
you, like sugars.) And keeping an adequate balance of fluid in the
body is one of the most important steps to achieving good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for water,'' said William Vacca, chief
of medicine and director of cardiac rehabilitation program at St.
Clare's Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But that shouldn't discourage you from drinking other beverages
like juice, milk, and seltzer, composed largely of water. The
bottom line of any healthy diet, however, should be water.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike food that can be stored as fat for later use, the body
has limited reserves of water that require frequent replenishment.
In other words, you'll die of thirst before you die of hunger.
``It's really hard to store fluid in the body,'' Vacca said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why an adequate water supply is so important: It
regulates the body's temperature through perspiration, removes
wastes and toxins through the urine and transports nutrients
throughout the body.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Mayo Clinic Health Oasis, an on-line
newsletter, human blood is about 80 percent water. On a daily
basis, humans lose about 10 cups of fluid through sweat, urine,
exhaled air and bowel movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``For basic fluid maintenance, there is nothing better than
plain old water,'' Vacca said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arthur S. Cohn, an Albany physician, recommends that
patients with sinus problems drink at least eight glasses of water
a day to keep some symptoms in check, including post nasal drip.
</P>
<P>
   When people are dehydrated, the body's normal mucous supply
tends to become thicker and cause discomfort. ``People don't tend
to drink enough water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although eight glasses of water daily is a good start, don't
overlook the obvious: thirst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the body is pretty good at telling us we need water,''
Vacca said.
</P>
<P>
   Dehydration, however, is of particular concern to the very young
and very old, who may not be able to respond to the thirst
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other considerations:
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that vigorous exercise may deplete important
reserves of fluid before thirst kicks in. That's why it's important
to drink before, during and after exercise, usually every 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good athlete on a hot day, it's not unusual to lose three to
five pounds of water weight,'' Vacca said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, drinking water is the best way to replenish the body.
According to the Mayo Clinic, sport drinks are usually not
necessary unless you're exerting yourself for 90 minutes or more.
</P>
<P>
   Thirst and frequent urination, however, can sometimes signal a
medical problem, including two types of diabetes. If you notice
unexplained increases in either of those symptoms, check with your
physician.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, adding more water to your diet is a wise
choice. For some, it's a matter of taste. ``To tell you the truth,
my favorite beverage is water,'' Vacca said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrow, 47, is also a fan and encourages her husband, Bruce, and
her 12-year-old son, Logan, to drink their share.
</P>
<P>
   Besides replenishing the body's fluid reserves, Morrow has found
that water can be helpful to those people who are trying to watch
their weight. ``When you're trying not to eat as much, it really
fills you up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the extra trips to the bathroom, Morrow isn't deterred
from reaching for a glass of water. ``I have it on my night table.
I drink it all night long.''

MAKING THE IMPEACHMENT GAME EVEN WORSE 
</HEADLINE>

 By THOMAS OLIPHANT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Susan Collins is not getting the ``credit'' she
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than poor Kenneth Starr, Maine's earnest Republican
senator has come up with a way to join the once-grand mechanism of
impeachment to the reality of modern media and political
scandal-mongering so that they can live in synergistic bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Starr lacks historical staying power, but Collins could change
the scandal game for decades in ways every tabloid editor, cable
talkmeister, and political mud-slinger would praise.
</P>
<P>
   If you take the long view, the independent counsel is toast. In
his clumsy and incompetent way, Starr tries to meddle in the
Senate's sputtering trial _ an indictment of a minor figure one
day, a leak of intentions toward the president on another. Starr
has so abused his office that its future after the statute that
authorizes it expires in the spring is likely to be somewhere
between oblivion and emasculation.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Collins _ ah, she has an idea that could be one for
the ages.
</P>
<P>
   For all of American history, impeachment has been more or less
what it was designed to be _ a constitutional process to be
employed very rarely and with the greatest political reluctance in
order to protect the country from the most dangerous abusers of
official power, whether from the bench or the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely because two-thirds of the Senate has to agree on a
conviction, it has always been axiomatic that consensus and
conclusive evidence beyond rational doubt were essential precursors
to impeachment proceedings even in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Collins could change all that.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of her ``genius'' is her invention of a means of
helping the House and Senate avoid any serious responsibility for
having brought forward a weak or farcical impeachment case _ either
in the short term politically or the long term historically.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having to answer for giving in to partisanship or
overzealousness, Collins has discovered a way for politicians in
particular and scandal industry generally to reject and accept an
impeachment case at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Enter her ``findings of fact'' _ an inventive perversion of
normal court procedures to facilitate the warping of part of our
Constitution that would no longer mean what it says. This is sheer
brilliance, as witness the fact that Senate Republican leader Trent
Lott has quasi-elbowed her aside to mere membership on a
seven-person GOP committee run by Maine's senior Senator Olympia
Snowe and New Mexico's Pete Domenici.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a spending bill, they will see which facts they can
find that will attract which votes. They will also seek to broaden
their base by stripping their findings of any language asserting or
implying criminal guilt. In scandal vernacular, fuzzy wrongdoing is
preferred over clear crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the real beauty of the Collins idea is in its implications.
If the Snowe-Domenici committee can produce a list of ``facts''
with at least 51 Senate votes behind it, then the impending
rejection of both articles of impeachment can be stripped of its
implied rebuke of those who brought it forward in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   That means impeachment will become much easier to use in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Without the Collins device, a House majority-vote impeachment
followed by a Senate vote not to convict and remove places the
impeachment in a negative historical light. But using the
fact-finding maneuver removes the sting and enables politicians to
say the impeachment target was at least culpable if not worthy of
conviction. Moreover, a new circle of scandal politics is possible.
</P>
<P>
   We already know that the press has dropped its news standards to
put the raising of questions on a par with the provision of
answers; and we already know the House could eke out a
pro-impeachment majority by dropping its own standard to
``censure-plus.'' Thanks to Collins, there would then be a Senate
procedure that would get around the constitutional requirement of a
two-thirds majority for conviction and substitute a majority,
overwhelmingly partisan determination of ``facts.'' Impeachment
could then become a regular part of our politics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us were raised on the idea that trials are not held to
find ``truth'' or send messages, but to determine the guilt or lack
of same of the defendant, and that acquittal and innocence are not
synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, however, worries that ``misunderstanding'' might
accompany Senate acquittal of Clinton, or that the president might
even stage a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   If only she had been around when the O.J. Simpson verdict came
down.
</P>

   President Bill Clinton leaves Feb. 10 for a six-day visit to
hurricane-ravaged Central American countries. The United States has
poured million of dollars into efforts to aid the countries and
also sent help from the U.S. military. But the effort has come
under fire for having much-needed goods bogged down in paperwork
and crates stuck in warehouses. This, on top of early criticism
that the U.S. was slow in offering aid to the region.

   El Nino helped make 1998 the hottest year ever recorded. Its
dramatic weather changes have been linked to an upsurge of diseases
such as cholera, malaria and dengue fever around the globe, as well
as a brutal drought in Texas, wildfires in Indonesia and Brazil,
marine mammal deaths in the western Pacific and a host of other
woes. Scientists are hard at work trying to improve their ability
to predict El Ninos so we can prepare for the extremes of weather.
Meanwhile, there is speculation that global warming may be
compounding El Nino's effect. In other words, YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET. Reported by Carl Zimmer, senior editor of Discover.

   Like many other researchers, Michael Zasloff made his discovery
as a fortuitous accident while doing unrelated studies. He was
doing genetic research on frogs when he noticed that after he
operated on them in a nonsterile environment, the wounds never
became infected. Hypothesizing that something in their skin was
protecting them from bacterial attack, he discovered a peptide,
which he named magainin. He proceeded to find peptide antibiotics
in a host of other animals. Zasloff is turning these peptides into
antibiotic drugs for humans in the hope of providing an alternative
or an adjunct to existing drugs. Clinical trials are now taking
place. Josie Glausiusz is an associate editor at Discover magazine.

   El Nino helped make 1998 the hottest year ever recorded. Its
dramatic weather changes have been linked to an upsurge of diseases
such as cholera, malaria and dengue fever around the globe, as well
as a brutal drought in Texas, wildfires in Indonesia and Brazil,
marine mammal deaths in the western Pacific and a host of other
woes. Scientists are hard at work trying to improve their ability
to predict El Ninos so we can prepare for the extremes of weather.
Meanwhile, there is speculation that global warming may be
compounding El Nino's effect. In other words, YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET. Reported by Carl Zimmer, senior editor of Discover.

   Food and dining stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Wednesday, Feb 3:
</P>
<P>
   RESTAURANT-SERVICE (New York) _ Diners divide into two great
human types, the ones who like to talk to their waiter and the ones
who don't. Frank de Falco, a veteran New York diner, belongs to the
second group. He likes advice on food, although he knows a lot
about it. He like advice on wine, although he knows a lot about
that too. These days he's getting a lot of both. Over the last
decade, a distinctly American style of service has been evolving, a
relaxed yet professional approach that suits the national character
better than the old-style formal French service. This
reinterpretation of restaurant protocol is radical enough to merit
a name _ the new American service _ and at fine restaurants, owners
and managers spend as much time thinking about it as they do about
the food. By William Grimes.

<P>
   RESTAURANT-TIPS (New York) _ Many uncertainties surround the
dining experience, but one thing is sure. At the end of the meal,
the waiter will present a bill, and the diner, barring a near
nuclear catastrophe, will leave a tip. Last year, American diners
left an estimated $12 billion on the table, at an average of 16.7
percent of the total bill. In Manhattan, the standard tip is closer
to 20 percent at a good restaurant. Regardless of the amount, the
gesture may well be mass delusion. The tip is a puzzle. No one
quite knows why diners tip in the first place, or whether tipping
serves any rational economic purpose. It's not at all clear how the
custom got started, for that matter. By William Grimes.

</P>
<P>
   SOMMELIER (New York) _ Ralph Hersom, the sommelier at Le Cirque
2000, was holding forth on wine on a recent afternoon. ``Some of
these wines are like a hot stock,'' he said. 'What blew me away was
Flowers Chardonnay. It's creamy-slash-buttery but not overly,'' he
continued about the 1996 vintage. ``You know, everything is in its
place.'' Hersom, you may have guessed, is not middle aged. At 28,
Hersom is in charge of one of the most prestigious and largest _
700 selections _ wine lists in New York City, and he talks about
wine with as much zip and enthusiasm as he uses moving around the
dining room. Hersom is part of an emerging generation in wine
service who are helping shed the image of the snooty, aloof
sommelier and infusing life into a traditionally stodgy profession.

   At Magainin Pharmaceuticals, in leafy Plymouth Meeting, Pa.,
amphibians abound. A plastic toad guards the entrance, startling
strangers with a mournful mechanical croak. A beanbag frog sits
atop the desk of Magainin's founder, Michael Zasloff. And in a tank
that Zasloff keeps in his lab swim a clutch of African clawed
frogs, Xenopus laevis.
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins when he lifts one out. Grasping the squirming
frog firmly in his hand, Zasloff sprinkles a dried form of the
hormone adrenaline on its back and rubs it in.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, hundreds of tiny white spots dot the frog's
skin, then slowly merge into a creamy sheen. Zasloff calls the
white film ``a beautiful bandage'' because it's filled with
bacteria-killing antibiotic peptides _ small strings of amino
acids, which are the building blocks of all proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of one of these peptides, which Zasloff named
magainin after the Hebrew word magain, or ``shield,'' inspired him
to found the company of the same name 11 years ago. He wasn't
looking for unconventional antibiotics at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As a physician and molecular biologist researching gene
expression at the National Institutes of Health, he was harvesting
immature eggs from Xenopus ovaries. Although he operated on the
frogs in nonsterile conditions and then returned them to
microbe-infested water tanks, their wounds never became infected or
even showed signs of inflammation. Zasloff concluded that something
in the frogs' skin was protecting them from bacterial attack.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a piece of skin, ground it up and extracted its
protective component, which turned out to be a peptide. Magainin,
he found, is discharged onto the frog's skin in response to
adrenaline, which is released when pain receptors in the skin send
the brain a message that an injury has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since that early find, Zasloff has discovered peptide
antibiotics in all manner of places: the airway and tongue of a
cow, the gut of a pig, the stomach of the spiny dogfish shark.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are in on the hunt, too, and they have found
peptide antibiotics in a witches' brew of beasts: in silk moths,
fruit flies, honeybees and budworms; in salamanders, snakes and
horseshoe crabs; in the white blood cells of pigs and cows and
humans; in our skin; and in fish, birds and even plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now recognized in every species of life, from the
smallest to the biggest, from things that fly or swim or just sit
around on rocks to human beings _ all defend themselves with
antimicrobial peptides,'' says microbiologist Bob Hancock of the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ``And they're a very
large proportion of what protects us daily from infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and Zasloff are among a handful of pioneers who are
turning these peptides into antibiotic drugs in hopes of someday
providing an alternative or an adjunct to currently available
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new antibiotics is becoming increasingly urgent as
misuse and overuse of conventional antibiotics has bred resistance
in many common disease-causing bacteria. And so the possibility of
new antibiotics with novel modes of action that may be immune to
resistance is exciting news.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are even active against some disease-causing
protozoans, fungi and viruses such as Herpes simplex and HIV.
Still, it must be stressed that although some of these new peptides
are undergoing clinical trials, none have yet emerged into general
use, and many problems in their manufacture remain.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these new peptide antibiotics different from
penicillin and its kin is that they stem from animals' own immune
defenses rather than from other microbes. That means they have
spent millions of years in an evolutionary battle with invasive
bacteria and have emerged victorious time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not many peptide antibiotics are on their way to
the clinic, and even those currently undergoing testing would have
only limited use. One reason for the slow pace is the cost of
bringing a drug to market, which has been estimated to cost about
$300 million, including clinical trials. Another major expense is
producing peptide antimicrobials in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, some peptides are beginning the
arduous trek to market. One of the most promising is a compound
called BPI (for ``bactericidal/permeability-increasing'' protein),
originally derived from human neutrophils and developed for
clinical use by a small Berkeley, Calif., company called Xoma.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Xoma published the results of a clinical trial
of BPI for the treatment of meningococcemia, a virulent infection
that affects nearly 3,000 children a year in the United States.
This condition can progress from flulike symptoms to death within
one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

   The rains were heavy and long. Camels, cows, sheep and goats all
started dying of violent fevers. Soon people, too, began to get
sick. The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure
mosquito-borne virus. It pops up every few years in Africa when
standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and
animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to
jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange
weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold
snaps and heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this
year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty
expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents
and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered
weather patterns around the world. The change in the weather was,
of course, the work of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of
sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs
offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full
flower. It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded. In
addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an
upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue
fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this
year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in
the next few months and in future decades. The good news is that
they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El
Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in
advance. The bad news is that according to some research this
latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El
Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and
Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory. In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature
Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut
off this wind or that current to see which factors were most
important to El Nino's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They built a simple computer model, and almost as an
afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. It
accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then,
in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the
onset of a string of El Ninos.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer
models. By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able
to give much better forecasts. To that end, Lamont-Doherty and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create
the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along
New York's Hudson River. Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to
making climate predictions up to a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer
models. Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's
behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from
the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about
El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other
parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea
surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. That might make it
possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in
years without a big El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency
of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the
Pacific Ocean. It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of
El Nino does change.
</P>
<P>
   From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from
1915 to 1950 they were minuscule. After 1960 they picked up again,
and since the late 1970s they've been very big.
</P>
<P>
   The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this
year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the
occasional bad fish catch. El Nino represents the fickleness of a
powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather
with stunning swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of
the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years. One of
the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean
to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then
stay that way for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so
far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos
to the past may be ``outrageous.'' Extrapolating into the future is
even more hazardous. Yet it's possible, and certainly worth
contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional
visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.

   At Magainin Pharmaceuticals, in leafy Plymouth Meeting, Pa.,
amphibians abound. A plastic toad guards the entrance, startling
strangers with a mournful mechanical croak. A beanbag frog sits
atop the desk of Magainin's founder, Michael Zasloff. And in a tank
that Zasloff keeps in his lab swim a clutch of African clawed
frogs, Xenopus laevis.
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins when he lifts one out. Grasping the squirming
frog firmly in his hand, Zasloff sprinkles a dried form of the
hormone adrenaline on its back and rubs it in.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, hundreds of tiny white spots dot the frog's
skin, then slowly merge into a creamy sheen. Zasloff calls the
white film ``a beautiful bandage'' because it's filled with
bacteria-killing antibiotic peptides _ small strings of amino
acids, which are the building blocks of all proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of one of these peptides, which Zasloff named
magainin after the Hebrew word magain, or ``shield,'' inspired him
to found the company of the same name 11 years ago. He wasn't
looking for unconventional antibiotics at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As a physician and molecular biologist researching gene
expression at the National Institutes of Health, he was harvesting
immature eggs from Xenopus ovaries. Although he operated on the
frogs in nonsterile conditions and then returned them to
microbe-infested water tanks, their wounds never became infected or
even showed signs of inflammation. Zasloff concluded that something
in the frogs' skin was protecting them from bacterial attack.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a piece of skin, ground it up and extracted its
protective component, which turned out to be a peptide. Magainin,
he found, is discharged onto the frog's skin in response to
adrenaline, which is released when pain receptors in the skin send
the brain a message that an injury has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since that early find, Zasloff has discovered peptide
antibiotics in all manner of places: the airway and tongue of a
cow, the gut of a pig, the stomach of the spiny dogfish shark.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are in on the hunt, too, and they have found
peptide antibiotics in a witches' brew of beasts: in silk moths,
fruit flies, honeybees and budworms; in salamanders, snakes and
horseshoe crabs; in the white blood cells of pigs and cows and
humans; in our skin; and in fish, birds and even plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now recognized in every species of life, from the
smallest to the biggest, from things that fly or swim or just sit
around on rocks to human beings _ all defend themselves with
antimicrobial peptides,'' says microbiologist Bob Hancock of the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ``And they're a very
large proportion of what protects us daily from infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and Zasloff are among a handful of pioneers who are
turning these peptides into antibiotic drugs in hopes of someday
providing an alternative or an adjunct to currently available
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new antibiotics is becoming increasingly urgent as
misuse and overuse of conventional antibiotics has bred resistance
in many common disease-causing bacteria. And so the possibility of
new antibiotics with novel modes of action that may be immune to
resistance is exciting news.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are even active against some disease-causing
protozoans, fungi and viruses such as Herpes simplex and HIV.
Still, it must be stressed that although some of these new peptides
are undergoing clinical trials, none have yet emerged into general
use, and many problems in their manufacture remain.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these new peptide antibiotics different from
penicillin and its kin is that they stem from animals' own immune
defenses rather than from other microbes. That means they have
spent millions of years in an evolutionary battle with invasive
bacteria and have emerged victorious time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not many peptide antibiotics are on their way to
the clinic, and even those currently undergoing testing would have
only limited use. One reason for the slow pace is the cost of
bringing a drug to market, which has been estimated to cost about
$300 million, including clinical trials. Another major expense is
producing peptide antimicrobials in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, some peptides are beginning the
arduous trek to market. One of the most promising is a compound
called BPI (for ``bactericidal/permeability-increasing'' protein),
originally derived from human neutrophils and developed for
clinical use by a small Berkeley, Calif., company called Xoma.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Xoma published the results of a clinical trial
of BPI for the treatment of meningococcemia, a virulent infection
that affects nearly 3,000 children a year in the United States.
This condition can progress from flulike symptoms to death within
one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

of BPI for the treatment of meningococcemia, a virulent infection
that affects nearly 3,000 children a year in the United States.
This condition can progress from flulike symptoms to death within
one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.

   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

<P>
   When 1998 began, East Africa should have been at its most
beautiful. Normally the short rainy season ends in December, but
this year was different.
</P>
<P>
   The rains were heavy and long. Camels, cows, sheep and goats all
started dying of violent fevers. Soon people, too, began to get
sick. The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure
mosquito-borne virus. It pops up every few years in Africa when
standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and
animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to
jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange
weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold
snaps and heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this
year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty
expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents
and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered
weather patterns around the world. The change in the weather was,
of course, the work of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of
sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs
offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full
flower. It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded. In
addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an
upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue
fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this
year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in
the next few months and in future decades. The good news is that
they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El
Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in
advance. The bad news is that according to some research this
latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El
Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and
Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory. In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature
Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut
off this wind or that current to see which factors were most
important to El Nino's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They built a simple computer model, and almost as an
afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. It
accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then,
in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the
onset of a string of El Ninos.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer
models. By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able
to give much better forecasts. To that end, Lamont-Doherty and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create
the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along
New York's Hudson River. Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to
making climate predictions up to a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer
models. Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's
behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from
the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about
El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other
parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea
surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. That might make it
possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in
years without a big El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency
of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the
Pacific Ocean. It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of
El Nino does change.
</P>
<P>
   From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from
1915 to 1950 they were minuscule. After 1960 they picked up again,
and since the late 1970s they've been very big.
</P>
<P>
   The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this
year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the
occasional bad fish catch. El Nino represents the fickleness of a
powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather
with stunning swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of
the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years. One of
the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean
to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then
stay that way for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so
far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos
to the past may be ``outrageous.'' Extrapolating into the future is
even more hazardous. Yet it's possible, and certainly worth
contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional
visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.

   RESTAURANT-SERVICE (New York) _ Diners divide into two great
human types, the ones who like to talk to their waiter and the ones
who don't. Frank de Falco, a veteran New York diner, belongs to the
second group. He likes advice on food, although he knows a lot
about it. He like advice on wine, although he knows a lot about
that too. These days he's getting a lot of both. Over the last
decade, a distinctly American style of service has been evolving, a
relaxed yet professional approach that suits the national character
better than the old-style formal French service. This
reinterpretation of restaurant protocol is radical enough to merit
a name _ the new American service _ and at fine restaurants, owners
and managers spend as much time thinking about it as they do about
the food. By William Grimes.

   RESTAURANT-TIPS (New York) _ Many uncertainties surround the
dining experience, but one thing is sure. At the end of the meal,
the waiter will present a bill, and the diner, barring a near
nuclear catastrophe, will leave a tip. Last year, American diners
left an estimated $12 billion on the table, at an average of 16.7
percent of the total bill. In Manhattan, the standard tip is closer
to 20 percent at a good restaurant. Regardless of the amount, the
gesture may well be mass delusion. The tip is a puzzle. No one
quite knows why diners tip in the first place, or whether tipping
serves any rational economic purpose. It's not at all clear how the
custom got started, for that matter. By William Grimes.

   SOMMELIER (New York) _ Ralph Hersom, the sommelier at Le Cirque
2000, was holding forth on wine on a recent afternoon. ``Some of
these wines are like a hot stock,'' he said. 'What blew me away was
Flowers Chardonnay. It's creamy-slash-buttery but not overly,'' he
continued about the 1996 vintage. ``You know, everything is in its
place.'' Hersom, you may have guessed, is not middle aged. At 28,
Hersom is in charge of one of the most prestigious and largest _
700 selections _ wine lists in New York City, and he talks about
wine with as much zip and enthusiasm as he uses moving around the
dining room. Hersom is part of an emerging generation in wine
service who are helping shed the image of the snooty, aloof
sommelier and infusing life into a traditionally stodgy profession.

LIFE BEFORE DEAR ABBY 
 BY KAREN DECROW

  800 words  
 c.1999 Karen DeCrow 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is 1906; a man writes for advice. He has lied to his wife and
wonders if he should tell her the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now I never told anyone about it, but it bothers me. I
have no secrets from my wife, and I want to know whether I should
now tell her all, or not mention it. I beg you to answer me.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``This secret may be withheld from his beloved wife,
since it is clear he keeps it from her out of love.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is the secret? It's not about fooling around. The man
and wife are immigrants living from paycheck to paycheck. The wife
has fallen gravely ill, and the husband must tend her. His boss
tells him that if he doesn't appear at work he will be fired. He
fears they will slowly starve to death. He opens the gas jet, gets
into bed with his wife, and waits for death for the two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly his wife cries out for water. As he goes to get it, he
closes the gas jet. Two weeks later she has recovered, but he does
not know whether to tell her the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The advice comes from the arbiter of ethics and behavior for
millions of people, for dozens of years: The Jewish Daily Forward.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1881 and 1925, about 2.5 million Jewish immigrants came
to America from Eastern Europe. Few spoke English and most were
very poor. They were all eager to integrate, to become, as my
grandmother used to say ``real Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed guidance, not only in the ways of the new land but
in ways that would carry on the traditions they had left behind.
Not all of them chose to continue the Orthodox way of life, but
they did not want to throw aside the ethics of their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus arose the readership for the daily column, A Bintel Brief
(A Bundle of Letters). It was the Dear Abby and the Ann Landers of
its day, giving advice in solving weighty problems. It eased the
transition from the old world to the new. And it dispensed wisdom.
</P>

   A man who describes himself as a ``greenhorn'' from Russia
inquires: ``Shall I send my father a few dollars for Passover, or
should I keep the little money for myself? I will do what you tell
me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bintel Brief replies: ``He should send his father the few
dollars for Passover because, as he is young, he will find it
easier to earn a living than would hi. blind father in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Concise and to the point: It is all right to lie to your loved
ones to spare them pain. Help your parents, even if it requires
personal sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   A letter on eating habits will resonate with the parents of
today who shape tofu into the form of a turkey at Thanksgiving:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two sons, 9 and 7 years old. They are healthy, well
built and are doing well in public school and Hebrew school. So you
would think everything is fine, but I have trouble with the older
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``About nine months ago he took it into his head to become a
vegetarian and stopped eating meat...As soon as he smelled meat
cooking he wouldn't come into the kitchen. ...Not only does he
refuse meat, but he doesn't even eat fish or sardines. With thanks
for your answer, The Worried Mother.
</P>
<P>
   A Bintel Brief: ``The mother is advised to find out where her
son got the idea to become a vegetarian, and then, with the help of
a specialist, she might be able to bring him back to eating
meat...A good doctor would know how to treat her 9-year-old
vegetarian.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 92 years since the following letter was written, nothing
has changed:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a girl from Galicia and in the shop where I work I sit
near a Russian Jew with whom I was always on good terms...But once,
in a short debate, he stated that all Galicians were no good, ...
and that he wished all Galician Jews dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Editor, does he really have a right to aay this7 And,
does he, the Russian, remain fine and intelligent in spite of such
expressions?''
</P>
<P>
   A Bintel Brief: ``The Galician Jews are just as good and bad as
people from other lands. If the Galicians must be ashamed of the
foolish and evil ones among them, then the Russians, too, must hide
their heads in shame because among them there is such an idiot as
the acquaintance of our letter writer.''
</P>
<P>
   For the new year I wish every reader peace, and I heartily
recommend ``A Bintel Brief: Sixty Years of Letters From the Lower
East Side to the Jewish Daily Forward,'' compiled and edited by
Isaac Metzker (Schocken Books, $12).

5 STEPS TO A DEBT-FREE NEW YEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Di Gesu is cq.)
 By ABBY SCHULTZ 
 900 words

<TEXT>
<P>
   As winter rolls on, you can think back fondly to the holidays,
remembering the squeals of your children as they tore open their
gifts and the good times spent with family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But those pleasant memories can vanish quickly when the credit
card bills arrive. There in stark black and white are the Brio
train table for the kids and the Palm Pilot for your spouse, as
well as the restaurant charges for all the times your family ate
out because you were too rushed to make dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic. To let spending get out of hand is only human,
especially around the holidays, when there's a good excuse to
splurge on your family. What's important is to pay off the debt now
so it doesn't add up as the year goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a step-by-step guide to getting rid of holiday debt, plus
advice on how to keep your family finances on track year-round.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Examine Your Expenses &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lay your credit card bills on the kitchen table and tallying the
cost of your spending spree.
</P>
<P>
   Then write down must-pay monthly expenses, such as the mortgage
or rent, car payments, student loans and utility bills. Next,
estimate how much your family spends on food, clothing and
entertainment every month.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't come up with a number for these ``flexible''
expenses, write down in a small notebook every dollar you spend _
whether it's on groceries, dinner out with your spouse, or art
supplies for your daughter's playgroup _ for one week. Add it up at
the end of the week multiply by four and you'll have a rough
estimate of your monthly flexible spending.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've come up with an amount make it part of your fixed
monthly expenses and start applying it to your card balances.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Dip Into Savings &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The interest rates on your credit cards probably average around
16 percent. Compare that with the interest you're earning on your
savings account (currently about 2.1 percent) or taxable
money-market fund (4.66 percent). Clearly, you'll save money if you
tap your savings to help pay off your credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle the cards with the highest interest rates first (such as
department store cards, which may charge up to 22 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But don't dig too deep into your savings if you can avoid it,
particularly if you think you can get rid of your holiday debt in
three or four big monthly payments, says James Di Gesu, a certified
public accountant and senior manager in KPMG's personal
financial-planning practice in New York City. You may pay $20 to
$30 in extra finance charges, but it's worth it to keep an
emergency fund of at least three months' living expenses set aside
for bigger, unexpected obligations, he notes, such as medical
bills.
</P>
<P>
   And try not to touch long-term savings, such as retirement funds
or college accounts, because you might incur hefty withdrawal
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Use Credit Cards to Advantage &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once you've earmarked the money to pay off your debts, the next
step is to take a hard look at your credit cards. It's easier to
shed debt if you have to make only one or two payments a month
instead of six.
</P>
<P>
   Roll the balances from all those cards that got a holiday
workout over to the lowest-rate card (then cancel and cut up the
higher-rate offenders), and you've immediately reduced your monthly
costs.
</P>
<P>
   If the interest rate is still uncomfortably high, call the card
company and try to get a better rate. Point out that you're
considering a lower-rate offer from another provider. Chances are
good that your current company will cut you a deal. Don't try this
with a department store, however. They won't play ball.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Go Back to Cash &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The best way to make sure that you don't overspend in the future
is to pay for purchases with cash, says Ginger Applegarth, a
Winchester, Mass.-based certified financial planner. Decide what
you can spend each week and take that amount out of the bank on
Monday. If the weekend rolls around and you've run out of cash,
forget about taking the kids to the movies; instead, stay home and
play games with them.
</P>
<P>
   To find out where the money goes, keep track of what you're
spending by putting receipts in a designated envelope or by writing
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Consider using a debit card if you don't like to carry lots of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Start Saving for the Future &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Once your debts are under control, you can channel into savings
the money you were using to pay off your credit cards. You can do
this easily by having money automatically withdrawn from your
checking account into a savings account at your bank or into an
uninsured money market fund, which earns investors a higher
interest rate for taking on slightly more risk.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage good planning throughout the year, set up separate
savings accounts to cover specific expenses, like gifts for family
and friends. Then, when the holidays come around again, you'll have
a set sum to spend. And you'll be able to enjoy the season without
dreading the bills.

<P>
   You've probably seen the ads for Sony Minidisc, pushing the
promise of digital music mixes without the hassles of cassette
tapes. It's a good selling point. In the early '80s, I spent
endless evenings extracting my favorite songs from hours of radio
play, grouping them onto tapes called ``The Best Dance,'' ``Rock
for Amy'' and ``Decent New Wave.''
</P>
<P>
   But cassettes, like new wave, went out with the '80s. And just
because you haven't laid down the cash for the audio toy-du-jour
doesn't mean you can't have a digital mix of your own. In fact,
there are at least six services on the Internet that are banking on
the hunch that consumers will want to create personalized CD mixes
_ complete with liner notes, your own title and cover art.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of marketing custom album mixes is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   You might vaguely remember seeing a company called Personics
from your Reagan-era trips to the mall. They would make custom-made
cassette compilations for you at kiosks in record stores. Of
course, major labels weren't thrilled with the arrangement, since
customers could pick and choose hits and bypass the full-length
albums. As a result, Personics in 1990 went the way of Elvis and
Frank Sinatra.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of picking, clicking and rocking seems pretty
cool, actually doing it (like many things on the Internet) is not
as easy or fun as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   On a quest to create my own CD, I put at the top of my list of
sites a company called SuperSonic BOOM (www.supersonicboom.com).
After finding my way around, I saw that my musical choices were
somewhat limited.
</P>
<P>
   It's all too obvious that the major label pressures that plagued
Personics haven't gone away. So, while you can find tracks by
Dhaima Matthews, you won't find any Dave Matthews. Or any Madonna,
or Spice Girls, or Smashing Pumpkins, or ... you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   After spending about 45 minutes putting together a mix of music,
I went to purchase the CD, only to find out that they didn't have a
secure site for retrieving my credit card information. Most
Internet experts caution consumers against giving out any credit
card information on unsecured sites. (Looking at the little lock or
key icon at the bottom of your browser will tell you if the site is
secure.)
</P>
<P>
   Leaving that site mixless, I went to Custom Disc
(www.customdisc.com). After waiting an impossibly long time for the
pages to load in (over my 56K modem) I found out that they, too,
had an unsecured transaction page.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I found My-Disc, a site co-founded by former VH-1
president and Prodigy CEO Ed Bennett. In addition to having a
secure site, it also seemed to have the best selection.
</P>
<P>
   What I found there were lots of rock classics, like Little
Richard and Tina Turner, and good jazz and blues. Since jazz is big
in my household, I followed that path.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a meter at the bottom that displays how much time
you have left on your disc and how much you've spent. The base
price is $5.99, and the tally adds a dollar for each song you pick.
</P>
<P>
   My disc started with some smooth ``Do You Know What It Means To
Miss New Orleans'' by Louis Armstrong. Next, it glided through some
Billie Holliday, Wynton and Ellis Marsalis and Dizzy Gillespie. I
wound it down with Count Basie and Glenn Miller and their
orchestras and finished it off with ``Georgia On my Mind'' by Art
Blakey and his Jazz Messengers. I had 69 minutes of cool jazz for
$16.99.
</P>
<P>
   I titled my disc ``Digital Swingtime'' and chose cover art of a
beer mug. I entered my mailing address and credit card number and,
days later, had my made-to-order disc.
</P>
<P>
   How did it sound? Great. The songs all flowed together and there
weren't any of the awkward stops and starts that prevailed on my
homemade tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, this isn't something I would make a habit of. I
really had to look for enough songs to make a whole disc. But if
the music-on-the-Internet industry grows (and it seems likely to)
there's bound to be better selections available all the time. In
the meantime, I'll probably still be cruising to the sounds of one
of those classic mixes, like ``Rock for Amy.''

HYPE ON FOX KEPT ADDING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects in third graf that soccer is most-watched sporting
event.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the record, Fox ran 228 commercials during its Super Bowl
coverage Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine ran during the game. The rest of the 30-second spots
were scattered throughout the seven-hour pregame show. In addition,
Fox's in-house ads, promoting prime-time programming such as ``The
Simpsons'' and ``Ally McBeal,'' numbered around 80. Fox affiliates
also ran a handful of promotions and local advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Fox officials don't apologize for the commercialization of what
must be the second most-watched sporting event on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Even with an 8 percent drop in viewership from last year's game,
the Super Bowl still managed to earn a 40.2 rating and 61 share in
the overnight measure of 44 major media markets. Nielsen estimates
that about 127.5 million people watched all or part of the game.
That makes it the sixth most-watched television program in history.
</P>
<P>
   Fox spokesman Vince Wladika said critics of Fox's generous use
of advertisements are being naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that all networks want to have the NFL on their
network is to promote itself and earn revenue,'' Wladika said. ``We
didn't have an outrageous amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second ads went for an average of $1.6 million apiece;
Fox paid $550 million for the rights to broadcast NFC games last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Boston viewers didn't tune in as much as those in other cities.
The game generated a 39.6 rating and 58 share here.
</P>
<P>
   The much-criticized pregame show earned solid numbers throughout
the day. In Boston, the numbers peaked during the 30 minutes before
kickoff, when Channel 25 earned a 32.6 rating and 53 share. That
was significantly up from ratings earlier in the day. John Madden's
All-Millennium Team, for instance, earned a 6 rating and 14 share.
</P>
<P>
   Madden was his usual self during his game analysis, openly
questioning why the Falcons declined to attempt field goals, for
instance, when their offense was unable to move deep in Broncos
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Play-by-play man Pat Summerall was uneven. He made a great
transition when a technical glitch caused a commercial to run three
seconds too long. When game coverage resumed, John Elway already
had taken the snap and was rolling right to throw an 80-yard
touchdown to Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But Summerall also misidentified Broncos cornerback Darrien
Gordon and mistook a holding penalty for roughing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes happen, and Summerall has been one of the best
play-by-play announcers of all time. He is almost 70, and the
details are getting past him.
</P>
<P>
   Former Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw once proved that he
could indeed spell ``cat'' _ after Hollywood Henderson bet he
couldn't, even if you spotted him the c and the t _ and showed
Sunday that he is a dogged journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw's pursuit of whether Elway would retire was golden. He
asked three different times in three different circumstances. Elway
was mum at first, but then relented by telling Bradshaw it would be
challenging to try for three championships in a row. Elway didn't
say either way, but he left the door open. Thanks to Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The best postgame interview was conducted by ESPN's Chris
Mortensen, who talked with Eugene Robinson right after the game on
the field. The Falcons safety, who had been arrested the night
before the game on charges of soliciting sex from an undercover
police officer, told Mortensen that there was a difference between
being innocent and being righteous, and he ``wasn't righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.

ASTRONOMERS ASK DIRECTIONS ON THE 'NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Charles Stough is an editor at the Dayton (Ohio) Daily News)  
 By CHARLES STOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   They see things few others see.
</P>
<P>
   They are explorers and mathematicians. They know the jibes and
growls of their mates for spending so much money on the new lens
and so much of the night in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   They're also outgoing people. You can't tell someone who has
been stalking Andromeda that he should get out more.
</P>
<P>
   They're amateur astronomers. They feel the thrill of looking at
a smudge of light that started its journey to Earth 250 million
years ago, came through their glass and down that tube and shined
into their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In the discussion circles of the Internet, astronomy hobbyists
reveal themselves as clever and sophisticated, probably the
archetypes of people using the 'Net to its fullest.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't know where they are.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in the Usenet newsgroup sci.astro.amateur, someone in
Sweden asked for directions to the center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   If you hang with the astronomers you can imagine the smiles that
this question caused. These guys can compute the spin of the
planet, the orbit around the sun, even the sun's path around the
galaxy. Some say they know which direction the galaxy is going. But
none presumes to measure the path of this cluster of galaxies, much
less our supercluster.
</P>
<P>
   What it all means is that no one is finally sure what direction
anything is, including the mailbox. So, the center of the universe?
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I saw it, it was over there somewhere,'' one
fellow offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is over my cat!'' another stargazer argued. ``And she is
the Queen of the Universe!''
</P>
<P>
   Another Swede, Dr. Dominic-Luc Webb in Stockholm, went deeper in
the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is a center in time as well as space. Think of the
universe as a basketball where you are standing on the surface,
along with the entire rest of the universe. In this special case,
there is no center. True the basketball has a center, but for you
as an observer, standing on the surface, you could walk around
forever, never finding it, because you have no access to such a
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but...
</P>
<P>
   ``From where we stand, all points in the sky appear similar when
viewed at great distances. We could maybe say that we can see
roughly the same density of matter out to the same distance, that
of the limiting resolution of a telescope. We would then come to a
conclusion that we are at the exact center of the universe. But
perhaps someone at the edge of our observable universe is looking
at us and thinking that they are at the center. In this case, we
are all at the center. So you could also say that the center is
everywhere, but not here....''
</P>
<P>
   That's when the brawl started. Some other punches:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wouldn't the center of the universe be where there is
absolutely no motion?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``No, since this is true of every location in the universe. No
matter where you are in the universe, everything is moving away
from you.''
</P>
<P>
   That drew argument, of course. The selfsame Andromeda galaxy is
hurtling right at us, everyone knows. But in the greater scheme of
things (astronomers are always in that), we and Andromeda are mere
marbles rattling around in a small bag of marbles in a rear car of
a trainload of marbles going who knows where.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Everywhere is the center. The idea behind the Big Bang
theory is that space itself is expanding, not that stars and
galaxies are expanding into empty space. At the instant of the Big
Bang event, the theory goes, all space, energy and matter were
contained in the infinitesimally small object that would after
10-15 billion years expand to be the universe we now observe. At
that time, every `place' you can be now was in the same `place'
then. You're standing on the center of the universe right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the cat is.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion continues, and everyone is invited. It's in
cyberspace, the center of which is somewhere near the ``H'' key of
your keyboard.

ELLIS ISLAND GROUP TO OFFER GENEALOGY RECORDS ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Climbing the family tree will take a lot less
clawing as soon as a nonprofit foundation finishes a project to
post Ellis Island immigration records on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By helping people to access information instantly that
previously was buried in a bureaucratic quagmire, the $15 million
project will revolutionize genealogical research for many of the
more than 113 million Americans who pursue their family histories.

New York, the same organization that gave Lady Liberty a face lift
in 1986 without any public funding, estimate that more than 40
percent of Americans can trace their European ancestry back to
Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a reference point,'' said Vern Deubler,
president of the California Genealogical Society in Oakland. ``It's
going to provide people with very important leads.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of next year, the foundation hopes, people will be
able to enter any information they know about an ancestor and the
program will search more than 20 million records for a match. The
software will be able to adjust for misspellings.
</P>
<P>
   If a match is found, the researcher can choose to print out a
photo of the ship and a copy of the original manifesto that marked
the immigrant's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Island was the primary immigration gateway into the United
States from 1892 to 1924.
</P>
<P>
   The database _ which organizers say could be ready by the end of
2000 _ will catalog records of almost 20 million immigrants who
flooded the tiny island in Upper New York Bay. Until now, those
documents have been stored by the National Archives and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service in microfilm format.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the project was to collect and digitize
records for computers.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation spokeswoman Peg Zitko said the project got off the
ground when a nationwide network of Mormon volunteers agreed to
digitize the microfilm information for free. Thousands of
volunteers have logged more than 2 million hours; they have entered
three-fifths of the data so far.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
in Salt Lake City said the project was important to the church's
mission. ``We've always been involved in genealogy,'' said Dan
Rascon, ``because linking to our family helps us understand who we
are and what we may become.''

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ An Australian Olympics official's offer
of $70,000 in financial aid to two International Olympic Committee
members on the eve of the award of the 2000 Games to Sydney was
within the bidding rules and will not be investigated further,
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, the IOC seems to be making a distinction
between money, gifts and other favors provided to individual IOC
members and their families and offers of financial support to
programs in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   In Salt Lake City's successful campaign for the 2002 Winter
Olympics, IOC members were provided as much as $1 million in direct
payments, travel expenses, medical care, college scholarships and
other perks found excessive by Olympics officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney's case, the money was not intended to go directly to
IOC members but rather to the national Olympic committees in their
home countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing written down that says you can't provide
inducements right up to the last minute,'' said Kevan Gosper, an
Australian IOC member and a member of the IOC's powerful executive
board. ``Whatever the perceptions are, that's what happened. Any
organization in a marketplace that competes for something is
entitled to put up its best effort, and that's what Sydney did.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, John Coates, the president of the Australian Olympic
committee and an IOC member, acknowledged that he had offered
$35,000 each to the National Olympic Committees of Kenya and Uganda
through their respective IOC members, Charles Mukora and Francis
Nyangweso.
</P>
<P>
   Mukora is one of four IOC members who has resigned as a result
of the Salt Lake City bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, one of the leaders of the Sydney bid, said he offered
the money in the hope that it would help persuade the IOC members
to vote for Sydney, which won the Games in 1993 by defeating
closest rival Beijing by just two votes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the inducements were made contingent on Sydney's
being awarded the Games, IOC officials denied this constituted an
improper attempt to influence members.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Sydney revelation first came to light during a late
January special meeting of the IOC executive board on the Salt Lake
City scandal, IOC officials have satisfied themselves that Coates
did nothing wrong, said Jacques Rogge, an IOC member from Belgium
and the committee's liaison for the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received explanations from Mr. Coates,'' Rogge said at
a news conference Tuesday. ``We checked the details, and found that
everything was in order according to IOC rules. So, for us we find
no need for continued inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogge said that the other cities bidding for the 2000 Games had
similar programs intended to send money to national Olympic
committees in poor countries. ``What Sydney did was perfectly
correct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its continued effort to bolster its standing in the wake of
the Salt Lake City scandal, the IOC also launched the first ethics
commission in the committee's 105-year history. Director general
Francois Carrard said the ethics panel will police the general
conduct of IOC members and their business practices. The
five-member panel will include three officials from outside the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's special commission investigating the Salt Lake City
allegations will continue meeting this week, panel members said. So
far, nine members have either resigned or been recommended for
expulsion by the IOC executive board in the scandal. Three remain
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, chaired by IOC member Dick Pound, is now looking into
other IOC members who could be implicated in the Salt Lake City
affair.

PRACTICAL TRAVELER: TRAVEL AGENTS TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a Saturday afternoon in October, I sat in a dimmed seminar
room at the Los Angeles Convention Center with 22 travel agents
facing 12 computer terminals. Using a big screen, Ray M. Greenly,
then vice president for member services for the American Society of
Travel Agents, was unraveling the Web for one session of Internet
101, six oversubscribed training sessions at the agents' annual
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Other training sessions at the convention included designing Web
sites, desktop publishing, managing databases and one called
``Start Your Engines,'' focusing on five major services that search
for information on the Web: Alta Vista, Yahoo, Excite, Hotbot and
Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Travel agents in the United States are straining to catch up as
the electronic medium gnaws at their business.They are also being
squeezed by a reduction in airline commissions, initially in
September 1997 for domestic tickets, and since then for overseas
tickets and Amtrak. For years they sold tickets at the same price
as the airlines, getting a 10 percent commission out of the
airlines' gross. Now the airlines are taking back part of that
cost, and as a way of staying afloat, more than half the agencies
in the country are charging their clients for some services,
perhaps $10 for an airline ticket and $50 for trip planning.
</P>
<P>
   A further blow to agents came last month when Delta Airlines
said it would charge $1 extra for each component _ a round trip is
two components _ that was sold any way but through its Web site.
This included all travel agent sales and its own sales by phone or
over the counter. Two weeks after this step, sharply criticized by
the agents' society, Delta canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   Agents' electronic competition came on fast. Three years ago
airlines latched onto the Internet as a way to sell directly to the
consumer: Alaska Airlines was the first, beginning Dec. 27, 1995.
Cruise lines, tour operators, limo agencies _ all the agents'
normal suppliers _ opened electronic shops; Web addresses joined
phone and fax numbers on business cards. Computer experts started
creating cyber travel agencies, allowing consumers to comparison
shop and buy tickets with credit cards at home 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   In these boom times, travel agencies are selling more but making
less. In 1998, 2,116 full-service agencies shut up shop, according
to the Airlines Reporting Corporation, the clearinghouse for agency
sales. Although new agencies were being started, they did not
offset the losses. The total number of active agencies reported by
the clearinghouse at year end was 28,807, a net loss of 5.23
percent from December 1997, and the smallest total since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   There were 5,000 delegates at the agents' convention, and all
but online agency people clearly felt acutely vulnerable. What is
the future for the places that are becoming known in the trade as
bricks-and-mortar agencies? How often do experts think clients will
shift to the electronic sales window, where the line is never busy,
and the ``agent'' is always in?
</P>
<P>
   Estimates inevitably disagree on how many people buy travel on
the Internet, either from airlines or from online agencies like
Travelocity, which links to Sabre, a travel-agent reservations
system; Expedia, an offshoot of Microsoft; the Internet Travel
Network, or 1travel.com, a two-year-old discount agency. But two
recent consumer surveys give a snapshot of what is happening: The
people who spend more money on travel also spend more time on the
Web, and are more likely to buy on line than just to window-shop.
</P>
<P>
   One study was issued by the Travel Industry Association, which
makes monthly phone surveys. In September it carried out 1,200
interviews as a sample of the 199.8 million adults over 18 in the
48 contiguous states. It checked interest in the new technology
among all adults, then among travelers _ defined as people who
traveled away from home 100 miles or more, one way, in the last
year _ and then among frequent travelers, those who made five or
more 100-mile trips in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The total of ``current users'' of the Internet or any other
online service, including e-mail, was extrapolated to be 76.6
million. As for purchase of travel on the Internet, 6.7 million
American adults, or 9 percent of ``current Internet users,'' had
booked and paid for an airline ticket, hotel room, rental car,
package tour or other travel need. This was up from 5.4 million in
1997. Although use of the Internet is growing faster than the rate
at which people are making bookings on line, the booking rate is
also leaping ahead: the percent of all adults _ not just Internet
users _ in the 48 states who made reservations on line rose from 3
percent in 1997 to 4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The other survey was made by International Communications
Research of Media, Pa., for Phocus-wright, a research company
specializing in Internet travel. The survey was also sponsored by
online agencies: Expedia, the Internet Travel Network, Preview
Travel and the Sabre Group. Philip C. Wolf, the president of
Phocuswright, said that 10,000 calls were made randomly to adults
in the contiguous 48 states to identify 2,500 people who had flown
a commercial airliner in the last year and had ``visited a Web site
in the last month.'' These were defined as ``wired travelers,'' and
500 of the 2,500 were selected for the survey, Wolf said. Since
Americans make the huge majority of their trips by car, this was a
narrower universe than that interviewed by the Travel Industry
Association. Further, as Wolf pointed out, the heaviest use of the
Web is for e-mail, and his survey limited its respondents to those
who had visited a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ``wired travelers,'' about a fifth, 18 percent, used
the Internet to buy travel, the survey found. Of the ``wired
travelers'' who take vacations, only 10 percent usually buy air
tickets on line, but 68 percent research travel on line.
Phocuswright said ``frequency of Web usage'' was a good predictor
of online buying. Among those who used the Web less than weekly,
only 23 percent have bought on line; of those who used it just
about daily, 56 percent have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most nonbuyers express a reluctance to jump into E-commerce
anytime soon,'' the company said. ``A hefty 75 percent say they are
not likely to buy anything on line in the near future. They worry
about credit card security (82 percent), personal privacy (79
percent) or would rather speak to a knowledgeable
salesperson.Travel agents are a big reason why travelers resist
online services. Among the vast majority (82 percent) of `wired
travelers' who have not bought travel on line, nearly half (48
percent) say it's because they have a travel agent they know and
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, from its electronic viewpoint, said that having a
travel agent was a ``significant barrier'' to buying travel on
line, but not an ``insurmountable one.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Most of the agents in the Los Angeles class were learning to use
the Web as a way to research resorts, spas, ski areas, tours and
other suppliers' wares. In many cases, they were acutely aware that
their clients had already shopped these Web sites and now wanted
corroboration of their choice, or reservations. Most of the class
was apparently working where the computers they use for access to
the airline reservation systems _ Amadeus, Galileo, Sabre and
Worldspan _ do not necessarily have connections to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But some agencies have embraced technology, either setting up
their own Web sites or becoming all-electronic agencies that sell
on line. Stratton Travel in Oakland, N.J., characterizes itself as
a travel management company. It serves 350 clients that are
virtually all corporations. It has a Web site where an employee of
a client company may look and even reserve a flight at any hour,
but the flight can be sold and ticketed only by Stratton.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Harmes, director of information technologies for Stratton,
said that this moves information directly into the hands of clients
_ no telephone tag, no waiting for the agent to check flights, no
need to wait for resort brochures. However, it leaves the agency,
as the client's travel manager, in control of policy: business
class vs. first class, American vs. British Airways, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Harmes said, however, that he had some clients who still were
not at ease even with fax machines. He thinks sometimes older
clients are slower to shift, and he says Stratton wants to avoid
giving the idea it is forcing clients to change their ways. They
get the personal phone calls they want, but the company works on
shifting them over to e-mail or electronic booking, pointing out
the time to be saved and the reduction in service fees that is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   More than embracing the Web, 1travel.com in Zionsville, Pa., is
a child of the Web. It began as a Web site three years ago and in a
year became an online agency, developing software to let the public
see the information travel agents have when using reservation
systems. The company, with 40 employees, has headquarters in a barn
on a sheep farm. Sally Lewis, the marketing director, said that the
company itself sold the ``down and dirty,'' air tickets and car and
hotel reservations. For spas, tours and other travel requiring
consultation, online customers are put in touch with specialists,
450 companies that have pages accessible through the Web site.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Greenly dispatched his novice Web students in Los Angeles,
he urged them not to put their notes away, but to noodle around on
the Web when they got back to their agencies, or use home personal
computers to become at ease with the new research tool. One
student, Raschinna Findlay of the Travel Stores branch in Beverly
Hills, Calif., said she had not been on line since the course. Much
of her time since then has been spent traveling to look at the
things she sells. Only some of the computers in her office have
phone connections for the Internet. In the next few months, she
said, the Travel Store plans to put in new equipment and hookups to
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of her business is leisure, which she said was
``very upscale,'' representing Beverly Hills and other wealthy
areas around Los Angeles. For these clients, she specializes in
cruises and spas. Her clients shop around the Internet a lot, she
said, and frequently ask her for things they notice. ``Often I have
to tell them that the hotel is not in a good area,'' she said, ``or
that it is just not up to par. I know what kind of cruise they will
enjoy, and they rely on me to know these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Findlay is almost quintessentially Phocuswright's
``significant barrier'' to buying travel on line. Her clients want
advice and personal attention. And she will certainly stay in
business as long as she is more savvy than the Internet about
places they both know.

Others come to flee the reach of U.S. justice. But whatever the
reason, Cuba has attracted a lot of Americans. While U.S. law does
not prohibit Americans from living in Cuba or traveling to Cuba,
the Trading with the Enemy Act bans U.S. citizens from spending
money in Cuba. Still, the number of Americans mingling with Cubans
grows every year. Austin, Texas-resident Dan Snow, for example,
comes to Cuba at least once a month. He comes for the fishing and
always brings lots of Texans with him. Others come to scout out
business opportunities. So why don't any of the Americans visiting
the so-called forbidden island _ or even living there _ get in
trouble for violating U.S. law? Is the law ever enforced? (Emling,

directors and a retired veterinarian, but no physicians. This year,
eight senators listed lawyering as their trade, including four

   DISCIPLINE _ The Ohio legislature is considering a bill to give
teachers authority to discipline students, including ``harmless
props,'' verbally discipline, physically isolate, require community

   TEX-LEGIS-LOTTERY _ AUSTIN _ The Texas Lottery Commission makes
its case before Senate budget writers Tuesday on how to revive
flagging lottery ticket sales. Commission staffers are in a tricky
position. They want to increase prize payouts without saying ``I
told you so'' to lawmakers who reduced the payouts in 1997. Some
believe that action triggered the sales slump. (Herman, Austin

DON'T FORGET TO PACK THE MICROCHIPS AND OTHER GADGETS

<P>
   These are heady days for travel enthusiasts who love gadgets.
From computer cases with built-in alarms to cellular telephones
with built-in navigation systems, the travel industry has been
showered, or inundated, depending on your sentiments, with objects
to ease life on the road. While some of the new toys seem designed
primarily for techies, many will appeal to those who hate to turn
on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The latest generation of high-tech toys _ a sampling is listed
here _ is distinguished by relatively modest cost and size. The
gadgets are smaller and lighter than ever, a good thing given the
Draconian enforcement of size restrictions for hand-held luggage on
planes. They are as sophisticated as a palm-size audio recorder
that shoots digital video and photos, or as simple as a computer
case that doubles as a backpack. And most can be ordered by
telephone or on line.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still important to choose the accessories you take on a
trip with care. ``Ask yourself what each item will do for you, and
if it's worth dragging the added weight through the airport, even
if it's only a few pounds,'' says Stephanie Winston, author of
``Getting Organized'' (Warner Books).
</P>
<P>
   All of today's gadgets are a reminder of how much life on the
road has improved since the era of William Boot, the hapless
voyager in Evelyn Waugh's 1937 novel ``Scoop,'' whose baggage
included a collapsible canoe, a hand pump and sterilizing plant, a
camp operating table and surgical instruments and a portable
humidor ``guaranteed to preserve cigars in condition in the Red
Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   LAPTOP CASES
</P>
<P>
   The latest fully equipped cases for notebook computers, cell
phones and electronic hand-held planners don't look like computer
bags and can double effortlessly as backpacks, athletic bags or
overnight cases.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Easyroller &LR;  ($149) is a new briefcase-style model from Port
mounted on wheels resembling those on inline skates. It has a
telescoping handle and meets size standards for carry-on baggage.

passengers on Japan Airlines to watch in-flight movies, even while
reclining in their seats. The device uses a liquid crystal display
to produce images inside futuristic-looking eyeglasses with
headphones attached. Currently available in Japan for about $600,
Eye-Trek is tentatively scheduled to go on sale in the United
States in early summer. No other airlines are Eye-Trek compatible,
but buyers can use it like a pair of headphones for their eyes, for
private viewing from a DVD or videotape player. Olympus America, 2

   FAMILY TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Motorola Pagewriter 2000  &LR; is among the latest generation of
smart pagers ideal for the road. The black flip-top Pagewriter
looks like a miniature laptop and has a keyboard and
two-and-a-half-inch-wide screen that displays up to nine lines. It
can send messages to pagers, fax machines and e-mail addresses and
receive e-mail and pager messages, along with sports scores,
weather reports, news and stock quotes. It is sold through a
service provider; Motorola recommends Pagenet, (212) 912-1188, or
Skytel, (800) 395-3518. Each sells the device for $360, plus $24.95
a month for basic service and other fees.
</P>
<P>
   But even the simplest pagers, purchased along with a month of
service, can be useful for finding family members at places like
Disney World.  &UR; Motorola Talkabouts &LR;  are among the various brands of
two-way radios available to help families stay in touch at a theme
park or while hiking, camping or skiing. They are small, light and
water resistant with a range of two miles. Motorola's new Talkabout
SLK270 is three and a half inches tall, weighs just under five
ounces and starts at $169.99. Motorola, 1303 East Algonquin Rd.,

<P>
   The  &UR; Navtalk &LR;  ($625) is a new cell phone from Garmin with a
built-in Global Positioning System receiver that almost guarantees
the user won't get lost. Besides the features of a regular cell
phone, Navtalk has a an electronic road atlas of the United States,
Canada and South America. You can also transmit your location to
anyone using a similar phone. For an additional fee, owners can
subscribe to a service that will send help in case of an emergency.

</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Bosch World Phone 718  &LR; is one cell phone you can use at
home or overseas, as long as your cellular service provider uses
the right operating system. The system used throughout most of
Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and parts of the Middle East
is G.S.M. The phone, distributed by Audiovox, has dual-band
capabilities for the frequencies used overseas or those used here.
It costs $199 to $369, depending on accessories. Audiovox, (800)
229-1235; www.audiovox.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a ``bilingual'' phone like the Bosch for your
trip, you'll need to rent a phone geared to the frequencies used
overseas and insert the smart card contained in your phone. But
this will work only if your service provider uses the G.S.M.
operating system. Omnipoint, (888) 289-6664, rents cell phones
without smart cards to its customers, and provides
G.S.M.-compatible service for customers based in New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Florida. Other
regional G.S.M. carriers include Pacific Bell Wireless, Western
Wireless, Aerial Communications, Bell South and Power Tell. For
American visitors to London, Omnipoint charges 29 to 69 cents a
minute, depending on time of day, for calls within the United
Kingdom, and 92 cents to $1.63 a minute for calls from London to
the United States.

hold several ounces of water. A tiny fan inside the collar blows
air across the water, cooling the collar by up to 20 degrees, a
spokesman said. The battery-operated collar weighs 16 ounces when
full and looks like a cross between a high-tech neck brace and a

 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many years ago, I ordered a bottle of a grand cru Chablis at a
restaurant in Stockholm. The wine steward presented the bottle with
the usual flourish. Then he unscrewed the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that I visited one of the vast cellars under the
streets of Rheims, France, where millions of bottles of Champagne
are housed while they mature. This cellar was filled with bottles
of reserve wines, which were to be used later in nonvintage blends.
Each bottle was capped with the same kind of metal closure found on
bottles of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   The point I'm making is that corks are not as sacrosanct as we
have been led to believe. In fact, most wines do not need them at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Every few years, a team of artisans from Chateau
Lafite-Rothschild in Bordeaux goes on a road trip to recork older
bottles of the chateau's wine.
</P>
<P>
   Take your precious bottles to them and they will insert new
corks, make sure your wine is still good and even freshen it up a
bit with a touch from a more recent vintage.
</P>
<P>
   What these cellar men do for wine lovers around the world
replicates what they do at the chateau _ recork all the old bottles
every 10 or 20 years. No one likes to admit it, but had Lafite, or
any other chateau, closed its bottles with good screw-on caps in
the first place, there probably would be no need for recorking.
</P>
<P>
   A screw cap does the job _ keeping the wine in and air out _
just as well as a cork does, and since it does not dry out, it just
may do it better. The winemaker I visited in Rheims knew this: he
put corks in his bottles only when he was ready to ship them, for
appearance's sake.
</P>
<P>
   And the Swedes, for a while, embraced screw caps in a major way:
a Swedish government monopoly bought French wines in bulk and then
bottled them in Sweden as it saw fit.
</P>
<P>
   The wine cork, which the general public still expects to see in
just about any wine that is not in a jug, is actually a charming
relic of a bygone age. But the wine business is so rooted in
tradition, romance and nostalgia that any deviation from the
accepted, familiar ways is unthinkable. Or almost.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s and the early 90s, the wine industry was plagued
with bad corks, which gave many wines a moldy, damp-basement smell
and taste. (Recent research has shown that some of the supposed
corkiness was not the fault of the corks at all; it came from
insecticides in new wood used when many French wineries renovated
their cellars in the prosperous 1980s. Fumes from
insecticide-permeated wood found their way into the barrels and
tanks of maturing wine. Most of those problems have been remedied.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem with bad corks occurred just as demand for corks was
growing exponentially. Big wine producers like E&AMP;J Gallo in this
country and big cooperatives in southern France were moving away
from making inexpensive wine in screw-top jugs to higher quality
wine in bottles with corks. To meet the demand, some cork producers
were said to be cutting corners on cleaning and sterilizing their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure from the winemakers and the threat that they might
switch to plastic corks brought about considerable improvement in
quality. ``It's simply not the problem it was a few years ago,''
the Beaujolais producer Georges Duboeuf said recently.
</P>
<P>
   A wine cork costs about 10 cents if it is made from pressed cork
scraps, and about 45 cents if it is one of the extra-long corks
used to close the bottles at famous estates in Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Italy and California. The best Champagne corks can cost $1.50 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Most Champagne has little shelf life after it is released, and
it is usually drunk soon after it is purchased, so there really is
no need for an expensive cork.
</P>
<P>
   But would anyone drink Champagne if there was no cork to pop?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, under certain circumstances. Passengers on some European
and trans-Atlantic flights are sometimes offered small Champagne
bottles, usually 18.75 milliliters, each with the telltale
Champagne cork bulge and the requisite gold foil capsule. But the
``cork'' is in fact a screw-on plastic cap that is much easier to
manipulate _ and is no doubt safer to use on a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, five prominent California wineries _
Beringer, Clos du Bois, Kendall-Jackson, Robert Mondavi and
Sebastiani _ formed a consortium to develop an alternative to
natural cork. With several investors, they created Neocork
Technologies, which came up with some prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   To date none of the partners have used them, but according to a
report last year in Wine Spectator, a consumer magazine, Sebastiani
plans in the near future to release some 500,000 cases sealed with
a Neocork product. One winery that uses synthetic corks exclusively
is St. Francis Vineyards in Sonoma County.
</P>
<P>
   Whether made from cork or plastic, corks will always remain
something of a problem because they are hard to remove. They
contribute to the stubborn conviction many Americans still hold
that wine is an elitist affectation that calls for special
equipment as well as special knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with the trappings of wine like corkscrews and foil
cutters, many Americans _ in fact, most _ just shrug and ask for
another beer.

ARISTA OF PORK  
 WATER BATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a recipe for arista of pork, but I cannot find a
definition of arista as a food anywhere. Is it boneless or bone-in?
Is it a special cut? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Arista of pork refers both to the cut of the meat and to its
method of preparation. It's a Tuscan dish made from a boneless loin
of pork that is seasoned with rosemary or wild fennel, garlic and
olive oil. Traditionally, it was roasted on a spit, but now recipes
call for oven-roasting.
</P>
<P>
   There's a legend about the way this savory dish was named. John
Mariani tells us in his Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink
(Broadway Books, 1998) that according to one story, the name was
derived from a compliment given by Greek bishops visiting Florence
for the Ecumenical Council of 1450. Delighted with the meal, they
deemed the pork ``aristos,'' which means ``best'' in Greek. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your discussion about using a water bath for baking
cheesecake, custard or flan, you advised placing a roasting pan on
a rack in a hot oven, placing the baking dish containing the
dessert in the pan and then pouring boiling water into the roasting
pan to a point halfway up the baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   When I tried this while making a flan I could not add the water
without burning my hand on the oven. Is there a special utensil
with a long spout that allows you to safely add the boiling water
to the pan? I also tried it with the oven rack pulled halfway out
while I poured in the water, but when I carefully pushed the rack
back in, a small amount of the boiling water nevertheless sloshed
into my flan.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have any suggestions about removing the flan, whose
recipe calls for using a glass pie pan, from its bath without
scalding one's fingers? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Maneuvering a dish like flan in and out of a water bath is an
extremely tricky proposition. The water is boiling, the flan
jiggling and the oven rack unwieldy and awkward. But here are a few
more suggestions to make it go a little more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   First, many bakers believe that very hot water from the tap,
rather than boiling water, is perfectly fine for adding tothe
roasting pan. This eliminates the step of bringing a kettle of
water to boil and may reduce the chance you could be burned.
</P>
<P>
   A shallow dish like a pie plate is particularly susceptible to
even small waves of water sloshing in from the roasting pan; a deep
pan, like a souffle dish, is easier to work with. If you have to
use a pie plate, err on the side of putting too little water in the
roasting pan; you can get away with filling the roasting pan a
third of the way up the sides of the pie plate.
</P>
<P>
   Most oven racks are difficult to push back into the oven, but if
yours is especially tenacious, it may be coated with the sticky
remains of years and years of baking. Give it a thorough cleaning.
And as for a long-spouted utensil for pouring hot water, a watering
can for plants works beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Wear heavy-duty oven mitts when removing the flan from the water
bath; mine are the kind designed for grilling. The mitts might get
wet at the tips, but your hands stay dry and cool. Don't use
unlined, flimsy oven mitts or you'll end up with burned fingers.

SEATTLE NEWSPAPERS CHANGE JOA, SET STAGE TO COMPETE HEAD-TO-HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Setting the stage for an old-fashioned newspaper war,
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The Seattle Times disclosed
Tuesday that they will compete head-to-head in the morning after
dramatic changes in their joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Hearst Corp., owner of the P-I, and The Times
said the move was designed to assure the long-term survival of two,
independent editorial voices. But the landscape clearly has been
altered in ways that make that uncertain to some observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Times will switch from afternoon to morning publication over
the next two years as part of a deal that extends the joint
operating agreement for another 50 years through the year 2083 and
gives the Post-Intelligencer a larger share of profits.
</P>
<P>
   Under separate agreements, the P-I will immediately begin
upgrading its Internet web site with the newspaper's daily content,
which has been a contentious issue between the two papers. The
Hearst Corporation also obtains first rights to buy The Times
should the Blethen family ever put it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I's share of the profits generated by the two companies
will increase from 32 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   P-I publisher J.D. Alexander said the deal represents a boost
for both newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is not to put anybody out of business,''
Alexander said, pledging to improve what he called his already
well-positioned newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think we are a pretty damn good news operation,''
Alexander said. ``I think we will be energized and thrive on the
competition. It's going to be different and it's going to be
sharper. I think we're well prepared to meet that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new equation left open the question of whether both
newspapers will remain in business when most major media markets
have shrunk to one newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Times Publisher Frank Blethen appeared in a photograph on the
newspaper's web page, wearing a T-shirt with its symbol, an eagle,
holding the P-I's symbol, a globe, in its clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander struck back at meeting with P-I staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when they discover news, they will be confused,'' he
said, although he conceded The Times is a well run operation that
will learn how to change its direction.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, The Times has struggled with its identity,
placing a major emphasis on lengthy features and investigative
reporting, while the P-I has sought to be an edgier paper
emphasizing hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing terms of the joint operating agreement, if one
paper becomes unprofitable for three consecutive years or economic
conditions turn downward, the papers could go the U.S. Justice
Department, which oversees joint operating agreements, for
permission to have one newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Although that provision has not been invoked in the 15 years of
the JOA, it has never been tested in morning competition.
</P>
<P>
   If Hearst closed the P-I, the amended joint operating agreement
allows it to continue to collect a share of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   In the P-I newsroom, reaction was subdued, with many staff
members expressing skepticism about their future despite repeated
pledges from Alexander and George Irish, president of Hearst's
Newspapers, to stay in the market and improve the quality of the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander hailed the agreement as a victory for readers, saying
the 50-year extension assures two independent editorial voices will
continue far into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that it was the quality of the
journalism in the P-I, not our publishing cycle, that enabled us to
compete vigorously and successfully in the Seattle market,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the additional resources the P-I will receive will allow
it move to higher journalistic levels. He said the paper will
invest at least an additional $1 million, spending more money on
news pages and staff, although he gave no breakdown. Irish said
that number could grow.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is one of only a handful of major U.S. cities with at
least two daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I and Times directly competed in the morning during a
brief period in the early 1980s, when the Times published a morning
edition that was delivered to homes outside the Seattle area and
sold on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Times gave up that slot when the joint operating agreement
became effective in 1983, combining the advertising, circulation,
promotion and production facilities of the newspapers but keeping
their editorial deparments separate.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Sizemore, president and chief operating officer of The
Times, said his newspaper isn't prepared to immediately switch to
morning publication because it couldn't begin making moves until
changes in the JOA were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions about the changes began several years ago,
executives of both papers said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the driving reasons for the changes was to make
the partnership with the Times healthier and to increase the
revenues and quality of the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore said the Times sought the morning slot because that is
what readers prefer, particularly those who have moved to the area
from places with morning papers, and because of the increasing
difficulty of delivering papers in the afternoon through heavy
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Times, which enjoys about 32,000 more readers
than the P-I, is the last dominant afternoon paper in a major
market, it has struggled to attract new readers as circulation at
both papers has remained flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been swimming against the tide for a long, long time,''
Sizemore said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last audit in September, Times' circulation was 227,715,
up 0.2 percent from the previous September. The P-I's total dropped
0.8 percent, to 196,271, during the period.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I heavily depends on the single-copy sales from newstands,
which represents 28 percent of its circulation compared to 10
percent for the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the P-I's right of first purchase, The Times's majority
owners, the Blethen family, have no plans to sell, Sizemore said.
</P>
<P>
   He said their resolve has been shown in their repeated
resistance to sell the paper to the Knight-Ridder Corp., which owns
49.5 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Ridder will continue to keep its share, although its
profits will drop. It could sell its shares to any buyer it
chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore called the deal a ``win-win for the two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two news departments are going to do everything
possible to kick each other's butts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised agreement was being filed with the Justice
Department Tuesday.

<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE ESSENTIAL GORE VIDAL &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Fred Kaplan (Random House, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be laziness,'' Kingsley Amis said, ``but on the rare
occasions when I do pick up Vidal . . . he seems to me to suffer
from American cleverness: the fear of being thought stupid, or
dull, or behind the times.'' Some would say Amis was stating the
obvious _ how else to explain Vidal's withering wit, his
outrageousness, his instinct for satire and contrariness? How else
to explain Alfred Kazin's contention that Vidal got ``more literary
mileage out of his sex life than anyone since Oscar Wilde and Jean
Cocteau.'' Here are 1,000 pages of fiction and essays. Kaplan has
included ``Myra Breckinridge'' and the play ``The Best Man'' in
their entireties, and selections from early novels such as ``The
City and the Pillar'' and from ``Duluth,'' ``Julian'' and ``Live
from Golgotha'' as well as ``Burr,'' ``Lincoln'' and ``1876.'' Then
there are the essays, in which Vidal sounds, one critic said,
``like some great conversationalist lying relaxed in a hammock,
talking about whatever comes into his head.'' He slips in snipes at
journalists (of Tennessee Williams: ``I have never known any writer
with the exception of the artistically gifted and humanly appalling
Carson McCullers who cared so much about the opinion of those
condemned to write for newspapers''), and that easiest of marks,
Nancy Reagan. In 1964, when someone interrupted a speech by Dwight
Eisenhower, Vidal wrote that Nancy ``turned, lips curled with
Bacchantish rage, huge unblinking eyes afire with a passion to kill
the enemy so palpably at hand _ or so it looked to me.'' He even
jabs at himself. The representative who accepted Vidal's 1993
National Book Award for his collected essays read a speech by Vidal
that included this line: ``As you have already, I am sure, picked
the wrong novelist and the wrong poet, I am not so vain as to think
that you've got it right this time either.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; AMERICAN SERMONS &QL; 
 &UR; (Library of America, $40)
</P>
<P>
   This anthology covers 347 years, three religions and many
denominations, moving from Robert Cushman's ``Sermon Preached at
Plimmoth'' on Dec. 9, 1621, to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s
rousing ``I've Been to the Mountaintop,'' delivered on April 3,
1968, at the Masonic Temple in Memphis, Tenn. In between you will
find sermons by Increase Mather and his son, Cotton; Thomas
Shepard; Samuel Danforth; Jonathan Edwards; Samuel Johnson; Ralph
Waldo Emerson; Lucretia Mott; Henry Ward Beecher; Aimee Semple
McPherson; Reinhold Niebuhr; Fulton J. Sheen; and Abraham Joshua
Heschel. Fifty-eight sermons are presented in chronological order
and deal with fundamental spiritual and civic concerns (including
``A Sermon in Praise of Swearing,'' written anonymously in the 18th
century). These writings are a rich reflection of American history
and literature, illustrating the important progression of religious
and social thought, as well as the power of language to convey it.
As Herman Melville wrote in ``Moby-Dick,'' ``the pulpit leads the
world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BASILICA &QL; 
 &UR; William D. Montalbano (Putnam, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's farfetched, but irresistible: Let's transplant Miami and
murder and mayhem to the Vatican and see what kind of strange
intrigue we can devise. The new pope is in the middle of it _ Pope
Pius XIII, known to his old friends as Rico and to his flock as
Tredi. He's young and known to stir things up. As the ``Cocaine
Cardinal'' he had called on decent citizens of Latin America to
turn in drug dealers, a successful mission that had brought him
visibility, the devotion of common people and the deep hatred of
criminals. Tredi's friend in Rome is Brother Paul, a former Miami
cop who has sought solace in religious life after the murders of
his wife and daughters by a drug family that Tredi had crossed.
When a priest is pushed to his death from the top of St. Peter's
Basilica, Tredi asks Paul to look into it. It's not long before
Paul begins to suspect that Miami has come to the Vatican, that
this new violence is connected to his own part in the fate of his
family. Montalbano, who wrote three previous books with Carl
Hiaasen, was Rome bureau chief for the ``Los Angeles Times'' for
eight years and covered Latin America for the ``Times'' and the
``Miami Herald.'' He died of a heart attack last year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MY SISTER LIFE &QL; 
 &UR; Maria Flook (Broadway, $13)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is novelist Flook's disturbing story of her
sister's disappearance, and the lives they experienced apart. Karen
was 14 and Maria was 12 in 1964 when Karen announced that she was
going to the store, then walked out of the house and never came
back. In her new life she worked as a child prostitute and was
raped more than once, while Maria was left with their cold,
tormented mother, their weak father and obsessive thoughts about
the sister who had abandoned her to face adolescence alone. Two
years later, Karen resurfaced, and the sisters proceeded into
horrible parallel lives, ``lives in tandem motion,'' as Flook
writes. Theirs is the story of ultimate, if scarred, redemption
from mental instability, physical abuse and familial despair. Flook
tells it with an edgy and unwavering commitment to the truth, no
matter how ugly it might be. Her novels are ``Open Water'' and
``Family Night.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The weekend began with a breakfast in his honor. It
ended with his reputation on the way the ruin.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Eugene Robinson _ husband, father of two, Bible
thumper, philanthropist, spiritual leader of the Atlanta Falcons _
did on Saturday morning: He accepted the Bart Starr Award. From the
Christian group, Athletes in Action. In recognition of his ``high
moral character.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what Eugene Robinson did on Saturday afternoon: He
lounged around the hotel pool with his wife and their 9-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Eugene Robinson did on Saturday night, barely 20
hours before the Falcons took the field for the biggest game in the
history of the franchise: He got busted.
</P>
<P>
   He got busted on a strip of Biscayne Boulevard where prostitutes
and drug dealers do Miami nice. He was driving a rental car, alone,
when he encountered a woman who turned out to be an undercover cop.
According to the police, Robinson offered $40 in exchange for the
deed that made Monica Lewinsky famous.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was just a silly misunderstanding, the sort of thing
Mrs. Robinson will look back at one day and laugh. Maybe her
husband was out patrolling the streets the night before Super Bowl
XXXIII _ on a divinely inspired mission of mercy _ when he spotted
a woman who appeared to be down on her luck. Maybe Eugene Robinson
said, ``You look like you could use work. I'm going to hire you.
Would you like a $40 advance?''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe people's noses really grow every time they tell a lie.
Until that blessed day when Don King's nose turns into an elephant
trunk, the safest thing that anybody in Miami can do _ besides
leave _ is assume that Robinson was the wrong guy in the wrong
place at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Caught trying to get his pants down.
</P>
<P>
   Setting aside for a moment the issues he will have to address
with his family, Robinson indecently exposed the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is a 14-year National Football League veteran who has
played in the past three Super Bowls. Teammates call him, ``The
Prophet,'' and look for him to lead them. And when somebody with
his experience began acting so much out of the character he
portrayed, there wasn't much hope of the Falcons acting like they
belonged anywhere near the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Try as the Falcons might to distance what happened with Robinson
from a 34-19 thrashing Sunday night by the Denver Broncos, it
doesn't wash. A team playing in is first Super Bowl has enough on
its mind without wondering what has gotten into the its starting
free safety. Remember, the Broncos arrived at Pro Player Stadium
with defending-champion credentials.
</P>
<P>
   They had John Elway on their side. They had Terrell Davis on
their side. They had coach Mike Shanahan scripting their offense.
They didn't have anybody, let alone a player signed as a free agent
to provide a veteran's stability and leadership, getting arrested
in a sleazy act.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really want to do now is apologize first to the Lord
Jesus Christ, to my wife and kids, thirdly to my teammates and the
entire NFL for the distraction that I caused,'' said Robinson, who,
citing his lawyer's advice, declined to discuss the specifics of
the Stupor Saturday before Super Sunday. ``I regret I was not able
to satisfy the standards that I have set for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe I will be found innocent in this deal.
However, not righteous.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about buzzard's Super Bowl luck for Falcons coach Dan
Reeves. If it's not one thing, it's another. Reeves lost three
Super Bowls as the head coach of the Denver Broncos. He lost this
time against a former assistant.
</P>
<P>
   To think, Reeves tried to provide stable, home-spun environment
by allowing family members to stay with the players all week. Yes,
yes, yes, Reeves was right when he said, ``We're all sinners.''
What he didn't say is that there are 51 other weeks of the year
where Robinson's sin would have been forgivable.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about doing the Dirty Bird.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At best, Robinson was stupid and short-sighted for putting
himself in a situation open to an undercover cop's interpretation.
And that's a stretch. He's 35. He played 11 seasons with the
Seattle Seahawks and won the city's Man of the Year Award four
times.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, he is hypocrite who has cloaked himself in religion.
The Falcons media guide offers this quote from Robinson: ``I tell
people I'm a Christian who just happens to play football.'' By
Robinson's account, he spent a sleepless night pondering what he
had done and how he was doing to explain himself to the world.
Still, he insisted, ``I was extremely focused on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't affect my play, because it was pretty much
therapeutic,'' Robinson said. ``This was very, very therapeutic for
me, because I got to do what I do best: be a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the football, Robinson got beat by tight end Shannon
Sharpe on a 14-yard completion one play before the Broncos' first
touchdown. He got beat deep by Rod Smith on a post pattern in the
second quarter for an 80-yard touchdown that put the Broncos ahead,
17-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it really affected us that much,'' Falcons
safety William White said. ``We prayed for him (Saturday) night. We
prayed for him (Sunday) morning.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed, to say, focusing on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Deep down, Eugene Robinson had to know better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that's devastating like that ... the ramifications
are far-reaching,'' Robinson said. ``You have no idea the gravity
of the situation, and the effect it's going to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good friend said to me, `Confession is good for the soul but
bad for the reputation,''' Robinson said. ``The reputation? I can
deal with that? But the hurt of my wife, that means much, much more
to me because I truly love my wife. I love her and I love my kids.
I'm sorry that I had to drag her through that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes far beyond football. I'm a husband, a father.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, a candidate for president.

HELPING A FRUIT TO FIND THE VEGETABLE WITHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you come across an underripe mango or papaya in a
fruit bin, don't shove it aside. Do what cooks in the tropics often
do: put that fruit into a vegetable suit.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, don't pigeonhole that mango or papaya as a sweet
fruit. Instead, think of it as chameleon food, whose definition
changes as the food ripens. Use it in savory ways, as if it were a
subtly aromatic vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Shred green mango perhaps, as you would cabbage for a slaw, or
use mango or papaya in cooked chutneys or stews, in which fruit
that is riper would tend to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   All that is needed is a willingness to blur the already fuzzy
line between fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The botanical definition of a fruit, which has to do with a
plant's reproductive organs, is for all practical purposes
irrelevant to the cook. It defies common sense to consign manifest
vegetables like eggplant and green beans to the fruit family, even
though that is where they technically belong.
</P>
<P>
   Even the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the futility of this
formalistic approach, famously ruling in a trade case in the 19th
century that the tomato was a vegetable despite its botanical
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   But culinary usage is not an infallible guide, either, since
fruits like apples and apricots routinely appear in savory guises,
not sweet ones. So, what it actually comes down to is a matter of
custom: we simply choose to call a peach a fruit and a squash a
vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   The informality of this nomenclature allows ample room for the
tropical practice of treating certain plants as vegetables when
they are green and as fruits when ripe. This custom most likely
came about from the wild profusion of fruits in the tropics; when
you can go out to your backyard and pick mangoes or papayas any
time, there is a tendency to become very inventive in using them.
</P>
<P>
   The use of fruits as vegetables is probably most familiar to
American diners in the guise of the slawlike green papaya side dish
that is a staple in the cuisines of northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   But the practice reaches its apogee in India, where green
mangoes are not only used in stews, relishes and chutneys but also
dried and ground into a powder that adds a sour touch to many
dishes. Indian cooks also routinely use papayas that are underripe
in pickled dishes and highly spiced sauces.
</P>
<P>
   To select a properly underripe mango or papaya in the market,
judge by feel rather than appearance, since the only visual
difference is a slight reddening or yellowing as the fruit ripens.
When unripe, both fruits should feel as firm as a crisp Granny
Smith apple.
</P>
<P>
   When an underripe mango is cut open, it reveals flesh that is a
pale, yellowish cream rather than the deep, saturated yellow of the
fully ripe fruit. Green papayas are similarly pale in color, and
when very green will have considerably fewer seeds than the ripe
versions.
</P>
<P>
   Logically enough, these green fruits should be prepared just as
vegetables are. Since the skins cling more tightly to the flesh, it
is easier to peel them with a vegetable peeler than to slice the
fruit from the skin as you would if they were ripe.
</P>
<P>
   After they are peeled, papayas can be halved and the seeds
scooped out in the usual way before the flesh is diced or grated.
Because the unripe flesh of the mango is so firmly attached to the
pit, however, it is easier simply to grate or slice the flesh away
from the pit, rather than to remove it as you ordinarily would.
</P>
<P>
   Although green mangoes and papayas each have distinctive
flavors, they can be used more or less interchangeably in recipes
of this type. There are really few such opportunities to turn what
might have been a shopping disappointment into a culinary
revelation. &QL;

<P>
   Paul Mellon, the patrician art collector who tenaciously turned
philanthropy into his personal art form, above all through his
stewardship of the National Gallery of Art, died on Monday at his
home in Upperville, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A son of enormous wealth, Mellon turned from his family's world
of banking and business to become an endlessly inventive benefactor
of the nation's cultural life. The Mellons' total contributions to
museums and other causes from parks to poetry has been estimated at
nearly a billion dollars. The money has gone to save seashores and
encourage scholars. It established the Yale Center for British Art
and America's top poetry award, the Bollingen Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, the greatest monument to the family's fortune, and
to Paul Mellon's personal dedication, is the National Gallery of
Art in Washington, originally conceived as a gift to the people by
his father, Andrew W. Mellon (1855-1937), the financier and
longtime secretary of the Treasury. The elder Mellon did not live
to see his wish fulfilled. But Paul Mellon, who could never share
his father's love for commerce, more than inherited a dedication to
giving something back to society. For the son it became a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving away large sums of money nowadays is a soul-searching
problem,'' he once said. ``You can cause as much damage with it as
you may do good.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many patrons of the arts insist that their names
be chiseled on a museum's facade, Paul Mellon was remembered for
avoiding self-promotion and refraining from narcissistic exercises
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it, I suppose, is just a natural shyness on my part,''
Mellon once said. But there were other reasons. In ``Reflections in
a Silver Spoon,'' his 1992 autobiography, written with John
Baskett, he said, ``If my father had created `the Mellon Gallery of
Art' in Washington, would other donors have been willing to support
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically he insisted that the Yale Center not bear his
name either, ``in the hope that other future donors of works of art
and of funds would be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon was born in Pittsburgh on June 11, 1907, the only
son of Andrew W. Mellon and his first wife, the English-born Nora
McMullen. The couple had a daughter, Ailsa, six years earlier.
Andrew Mellon, a partner in the private bank founded by his father,
Judge Thomas Mellon, in Pittsburgh in 1870, became one of the most
successful American financiers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul once put it, Andrew ``had an astonishing flair for
recognizing nascent industrial potentialities.'' Among the Mellon
Bank's earliest loans was one to Andrew's friend Henry Clay Frick
to develop coke ovens. The bankers approved the loan, noting
privately that Frick may have been ``a little too enthusiastic
about pictures, but not enough to hurt.'' Those pictures became the
Frick Collection in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his 60s, after having established and consolidated an
international commercial empire, Andrew Mellon entered public life,
serving as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1932, under three
presidents, and as the United States ambassador to Britain in 1932
and '33.
</P>
<P>
   He might have had a predestined crown prince in his only son,
but from the very first Paul found neither happiness at home nor
any hope of fulfillment in his father's offices. By the time he was
2, his parents' marriage was effectively at an end. As he put it
with characteristic concision, ``Within 18 months of my parents'
marriage in 1900, my mother fell in love with an Englishman who
would have described himself as a gentleman but who was, in fact,
nothing more than a devious adventurer.'' The couple divorced in
1912.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon recalled that ``it was not much fun to be a divorced
person or to be the offspring of divorced parents in Pittsburgh in
1912.'' He spent portions of his childhood in England, where he
began to develop a lifelong love of British culture.
</P>
<P>
   When he did see his father, relations between them were not
easy. ``I do not know,'' Paul wrote, ``and I doubt if anyone will
ever know, why Father was so seemingly devoid of feeling and so
tightly contained in his lifeless, hard shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his school days at Choate, in Connecticut, and later
during his years at Yale and at Clare College, Cambridge, Paul
Mellon developed in ways that defined and strengthened his
character, even if they did not always delight his father.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the United States or in England, he loved the
countryside. It was there that he could indulge his passion for
horses, a passion that was requited.
</P>
<P>
   When his horse Mill Reef won the English Derby in 1971, Mellon
was naturally euphoric. But what crowned the whole experience, he
said, was that three generations of Mill Reef's ancestors had come
from Mellon's Rokeby Stables in Virginia, long his adopted home
state.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to see his horses win, he said, but ``the sights and
sounds of the countryside, as well as the color and action and
excitement of the racecourse, are what turn me on: the mare
suckling her foal, the renegade foal bothering all the others, the
yearling who is boss of the field.'' To watch them, to ride them
and to breed them gave him satisfaction. He was a champion trail
rider until well into his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   At Cambridge he also came to love English literature as it was
imparted at that time by gifted teachers. He had heard many other
lectures on the subject at Yale, including one by Gene Tunney, the
former heavyweight champion, who had spoken without notes on
Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida.'' ``It wasn't a bad lecture
at all,'' Mellon remembered.
</P>
<P>
   His feelings for England went deep. He had been baptized in St.
George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He enjoyed rowing, and he kept
his oars from Cambridge above the bookshelves in his personal
library on his Virginia estate.
</P>
<P>
   As a landowner and an independent scholar in England before
World War II he might have been very happy. But when he left
Cambridge in 1931 and went back to Pittsburgh, he agreed, almost as
a courtesy to his father, to enter the Mellon Bank as a trainee
clerk, moving from one department to another.
</P>
<P>
   His father's employees never dared to evaluate the boss' son,
and in due time he was invited to join one corporate board after
another. Besides the Mellon Bank, the family had large holdings in
Gulf Oil and Alcoa, among other corporations.

</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon began amassing his own collection of British art in
1934 when he bought a painting of a horse by the 18th-century
artist George Stubbs, who would remain a Mellon favorite. The
following year Mellon was married in New York to Mary Elizabeth
Conover Brown; the couple had a son, Timothy, and a daughter,
Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their marriage, the Mellons, seeking to learn the
source of Mary's asthma, went to Switzerland to seek out C.G. Jung,
the founder of analytical psychology. He became a friend and guided
them in some of their early philanthropy. But before that Mellon
had to tell his father that he could never settle down in the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial meeting took place on Nov. 29, 1936, when Andrew
Mellon was already in failing health. (He was to die nine months
later.) Paul had taken great trouble to prepare his case. He
recalled telling his father that he could not be ``an inadequate
replica of yourself, or a counterfeit.'' Nor, he said, could he
retreat into silence and mental compromise. He was not a man of
business, and never would be.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, his father told him that it was really not
necessary for Paul to take any active part in the business. He
should consider himself as an owner who ``kept vaguely in touch
through the head people.'' In the end, Andrew said, good management
was the only thing that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   But if they could never share a love for business, father and
son were ultimately joined in another sphere. Just two months
before Andrew died in 1937, construction began on the National
Gallery of Art, which had been approved by Congress earlier that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mellon had provided funds for the initial gallery, now
known as the West Building, which was designed by John Russell
Pope. He also gave a collection of 115 paintings, 31 of which had
been sold by the cash-poor Soviet government from the Hermitage in
Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, 1941, Paul Mellon officially presented the National
Gallery to President Franklin D. Roosevelt along with the Andrew
Mellon Collection, which included Raphael's ``Alba Madonna,'' van
Eyck's ``Annunciation,'' Botticelli's ``Adoration of the Magi'' and
a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Mellon said that he hoped that the gallery ``would
become a joint enterprise on the part of the government, on the one
hand, and of magnanimous citizens, on the other.'' Magnanimous
citizens did come forward and have continued to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon was the National Gallery's president and a trustee from
1938 to 1939, rejoining the board in 1945. He served again as
president from 1963 to 1979 and as board chairman from 1979 to
1985, when he became an honorary trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years he made clear that he did not wish anyone on
the staff to bow and scrape at his arrival. To his final days, he
would call the gallery's director, Earl A. Powell 3d, and ask,
``Would it be all right if I came to lunch tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he retired from the board in 1985, he told the
trustees that he would haunt the museum for the rest of his life.
``And who knows?'' he said. ``Perhaps from beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The same year that the nation accepted the gallery from Mellon,
it accepted another offer from him. He enlisted in the Army and
asked to join the cavalry. After nine months he was made a second
lieutenant and spent two years at Fort Riley, Kan., as an
instructor in horsemanship. The Army later sent him to England, and
by the end of World War II he had become a major in the Office of
Strategic Services.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Conover Mellon died in 1946. Two years later Mellon married
Rachel Lambert Lloyd, universally known as Bunny, an heir to the
Listerine fortune. A spectrum of new interests _ domestic,
decorative and horticultural _ came into Mellon's life. So did his
wife's particular fondness for French painting of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. In addition to his wife, Mellon is survived
by his son, Timothy, of Lyme, Conn.; his daughter, Catherine M.
Conover of Washington, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Gallery the great business of the postwar years
was the completion in 1978 of the East Building. With its huge
aerial inner space and its dexterous use of a difficult
trapezoid-shaped ground plan, the East Building was from the outset
a crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   It also proved itself well able to display 20th-century art of
many kinds and to attract substantial gifts in that field. But the
Mellons consistently donated French and American masterworks. Their
gifts of 20th-century art included works by Matisse, Magritte and
Giacometti as well as earlier ones by David and Gericault.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to build an East Building that would
complement the West and yet not be at all like it, many problems
had to be solved. Andrew Mellon had stipulated in his original gift
that Congress should reserve an additional area on the Mall for the
gallery's eventual expansion. After 30 years this had become the
most desirable unused site in Washington, and there were fears that
Congress might refuse to hand it over.
</P>
<P>
   But John Walker, then the gallery's director, was able to tell
the Committee on Public Buildings that the money for construction
would be provided privately: Paul Mellon and his sister, Ailsa
Mellon Bruce (who died in 1969), had agreed to underwrite the
costs, which were estimated at around $20 million. In his memoirs,
Mellon said that by the time the East Building opened, ``the final
figure had risen to slightly over $94 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The building committee for the project had held more than 60
meetings, and Paul Mellon was there for every one of them. It was
Mellon who commissioned I.M. Pei to be architect of the East
Building after being charmed by his designs for the Everson Museum
of Art in Syracuse and the Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon gave 913 works to the National Gallery over the years,
including Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red Waistcoat,'' two paintings by
Mark Rothko, Alexander Calder animal sculptures, Winslow Homer's
``Dad's Coming,'' Picassos, Gauguins, Bonnards, Vuillards, a Manet,
the original wax version of Degas' ``Little 14-Year-Old Dancer''
and postcards that had been written by van Gogh and Matisse. The
gallery is organizing a memorial exhibition to highlight some of
his gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures he donated were not bought expressly for museums,
but were works he valued intimately. Most had been hung in his
homes, often on nails he drove himself. Like his love of literature
and horses, Paul Mellon's love of art was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gifts that he and his wife made to the National
Gallery on its 50th anniversary in 1991 were two paintings in his
father's collection that he would never forget. One was the
portrait of a very young Miss Willoughby by George Romney that he
had found quite irresistible when he was 5 and had cherished ever
since. ``In Pittsburgh, that painting was like an oasis in a desert
of smog,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the portrait of the Marchesa Balbi by van Dyck,
which had been the first thing he saw when he walked in through the
front door of his father's apartment in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But if he lavished attention on the National Gallery, many other
museums were dear to him, too, including the Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond, where in 1963 he first revealed the extent of his own
growing holdings in British art.

</P>
<P>
   Through his friendship with an English scholar, Basil Taylor,
Mellon became fascinated by aspects of English art that ``seemed to
me long neglected or even abandoned, not only in this country but
in its homeland,'' he said. This was the not English art of the
formal portrait and the ``fancy picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's take it seriously,'' he said when he opened the Richmond
exhibition of his collection. ``Let's re-evaluate it, let's look at
it. Let's enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   He once maintained that ``collecting is the sort of thing that
creeps up on you.'' That was certainly true of his panoramic
enthusiasm for English art in all its forms. Before long those
holdings seemed to call out for a home of their own. From this came
his decision to create the Yale Center for British Art, a museum
and research institution that is the largest collection of British
works outside Britain. It opened in April 1977 in a memorably
beautiful building by Louis Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon remembered his encounter with Kahn in California. ``He
was eccentric,'' Mellon once said. ``I had gone to see him in La
Jolla, where he was working on the Salk Institute, to talk about
his designing the Yale Center. He came to breakfast at the hotel
and made pencil drawings all over the tablecloth. I always regret
not having asked to keep it: one work of art I was never able to
collect.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his love for art, Mellon was a single-handed and
single-minded environmentalist. In 1956, foundations that had been
started with his sister published a report, ``Our Vanishing
Shoreline.'' As a result of this alarm, and with considerable
amounts of Mellon funds, parts of the Cape Hatteras National
Seashore, the Great Beach of Cape Cod and Cumberland Island off the
coast of Georgia have been preserved. He bought Virginia the
2,600-acre Sky Meadows State Park and Washington the outdoor chess
tables in Lafayette Square. He used his resources to help insure
that riding and hiking trails would remain available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Through his family foundations Mellon was also instrumental in
supporting libraries as well as organizations in the arts,
education and public health. He bought the papers of Samuel
Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, when they turned up in a
castle in Ireland, and gave them to Yale. When he was offered 835
volumes from the private library of the philosopher John Locke _
cataloged, annotated and shelf-numbered in Locke's own hand _ he
bought them forthwith and before long gave them to the Bodleian
Library at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   He gave $500,000 for restoring Monticello and $1 million for
saving monuments in Britain. The Bollingen Foundation, which he
established, not only created the nation's top poetry prize but
also published an idiosyncratic array of elegantly designed books
in a series that has no parallel in this country. The series
included the complete works of Jung and Coleridge; a four-volume
edition of Pushkin's ``Eugene Onegin,'' translated into English and
annotated by Vladimir Nabokov; the ``I Ching''; Joseph Campbell's
``Hero With a Thousand Faces,'' and scores of other studies in
esthetics, cultural and art history, philosophy, psychology,
mythology and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon did not give money to every cause that came by. In
``Reflections in a Silver Spoon,'' he recalled his encounter with
Vanessa Redgrave, a distant relative, in the 1980s. ``She arrived
dressed in jeans and some kind of Daniel Boone leather jacket.''
Over tea, Ms. Redgrave explained ``that she was raising funds for
the revolution and that she wanted some money from me to help in
her fight for the proletariat.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to enlist in her battle. ``I tried to explain to
her,'' he wrote, ``that for my part, I was really not in favor of a
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Mellon's generosity deprive him of a supremely
comfortable life. Besides buying art and raising horses, the
Mellons maintained homes simultaneously in Washington, Manhattan,
Paris, Antigua, Cape Cod and other places, as well as their
4,000-acre estate in Virginia. The Mellon jet was decorated with
work by George Braque, Paul Klee and Ben Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon always entered a room as if he believed himself to be
inconspicuous, and he maintained an air of never having had to
raise his voice and not intending to begin now. His clothes never
called attention to themselves, nor did they ever look quite new.
His taste in neckties was in the area of the ``winter regimental.''
When he had to carry speeches and papers around, they came not in
zippered containers of Italian leather but in a brown paper
accordion folder with an elastic tie.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mellon's countless awards were the National Medal of Arts,
presented by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the National
Humanities Medal, awarded by President Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1967 Mellon was the commencement speaker at the Carnegie
Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, which was about to merge
with the Mellon Institute as Carnegie-Mellon University. He advised
the graduates to experience great works of literature and art for
themselves, saying, ``There is no intellectual or emotional
substitute for the authentic, the original, the unique
masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went further: ``Just as there is no substitute for
original works of art, there is no substitute for the world of
direct sensual experience.'' Among them he listed the sound of
birds, the smell of flowers, the taste of ``the evening's first
cold and dry martini'' and ``perhaps the most important, the thrill
and mystery of touching, of love between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Such poetic thoughts were not rare for Mellon, who once said
that ``what this country needs is a good 5-cent reverie.''
</P>
<P>
   He even wrote light verse, usually for family consumption. But
when one of his racehorses won a prize, Mellon read the awards
dinner guests a poem expressing the horse's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; As I browse through my field in Virginia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And muse, at the close of the day &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Once again they will give me a medal &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Made of silver, although it ain't hay ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another man with Mellon's wealth might have aimed for high
office. But ``for many reasons the idea of power has never appealed
to me,'' he once said. ``What has appealed to me is privacy. To me,
privacy is the most valuable asset that money can buy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Mellon, the patrician art collector who tenaciously turned
philanthropy into his personal art form, above all through his
stewardship of the National Gallery of Art, died on Monday at his
home in Upperville, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A son of enormous wealth, Mellon turned from his family's world
of banking and business to become an endlessly inventive benefactor
of the nation's cultural life. The Mellons' total contributions to
museums and other causes from parks to poetry has been estimated at
nearly a billion dollars. The money has gone to save seashores and
encourage scholars. It established the Yale Center for British Art
and America's top poetry award, the Bollingen Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, the greatest monument to the family's fortune, and
to Paul Mellon's personal dedication, is the National Gallery of
Art in Washington, originally conceived as a gift to the people by
his father, Andrew W. Mellon (1855-1937), the financier and
longtime secretary of the treasury. The elder Mellon did not live
to see his wish fulfilled. But Paul Mellon, who could never share
his father's love for commerce, more than inherited a dedication to
giving something back to society. For the son it became a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon was born in Pittsburgh on June 11, 1907, the only
son of Andrew W. Mellon and his first wife, the English-born Nora
McMullen. The couple had a daughter, Ailsa, six years earlier.
Andrew Mellon, a partner in the private bank founded by his father,
Judge Thomas Mellon, in Pittsburgh in 1870, became one of the most
successful American financiers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In his 60s, after having established and consolidated an
international commercial empire, Andrew Mellon entered public life,
serving as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1932, under three
presidents, and as the United States ambassador to Britain in 1932
and '33.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his school days at Choate, in Connecticut, and later
during his years at Yale and at Clare College, Cambridge, Paul
Mellon developed in ways that defined and strengthened his
character, even if they did not always delight his father.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the United States or in England, he loved the
countryside. It was there that he could indulge his passion for
horses, a passion that was requited.
</P>
<P>
   His feelings for England went deep. He had been baptized in St.
George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He enjoyed rowing, and he kept
his oars from Cambridge above the bookshelves in his personal
library on his Virginia estate.
</P>
<P>
   As a landowner and an independent scholar in England before
World War II he might have been very happy. But when he left
Cambridge in 1931 and went back to Pittsburgh, he agreed, almost as
a courtesy to his father, to enter the Mellon Bank as a trainee
clerk, moving from one department to another.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon began amassing his own collection of British art in
1934 when he bought a painting of a horse by the 18th-century
artist George Stubbs, who would remain a Mellon favorite. The
following year Mellon was married in New York to Mary Elizabeth
Conover Brown; the couple had a son, Timothy, and a daughter,
Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their marriage, the Mellons, seeking to learn the
source of Mary's asthma, went to Switzerland to seek out C.G. Jung,
the founder of analytical psychology. He became a friend and guided
them in some of their early philanthropy. But before that Mellon
had to tell his father that he could never settle down in the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   But if they could never share a love for business, father and
son were ultimately joined in another sphere. Just two months
before Andrew died in 1937, construction began on the National
Gallery of Art, which had been approved by Congress earlier that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mellon had provided funds for the initial gallery, now
known as the West Building, which was designed by John Russell
Pope. He also gave a collection of 115 paintings, 31 of which had
been sold by the cash-poor Soviet government from the Hermitage in
Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, 1941, Paul Mellon officially presented the National
Gallery to President Franklin D. Roosevelt along with the Andrew
Mellon Collection, which included Raphael's ``Alba Madonna,'' van
Eyck's ``Annunciation,'' Botticelli's ``Adoration of the Magi'' and
a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon was the National Gallery's president and a trustee from
1938 to 1939, rejoining the board in 1945. He served again as
president from 1963 to 1979 and as board chairman from 1979 to
1985, when he became an honorary trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Conover Mellon died in 1946. Two years later Mellon married
Rachel Lambert Lloyd, universally known as Bunny, an heir to the
Listerine fortune. A spectrum of new interests _ domestic,
decorative and horticultural _ came into Mellon's life. So did his
wife's particular fondness for French painting of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. In addition to his wife, Mellon is survived
by his son, Timothy, of Lyme, Conn.; his daughter, Catherine M.
Conover of Washington, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon gave 913 works to the National Gallery over the years,
including Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red Waistcoat,'' two paintings by
Mark Rothko, Alexander Calder animal sculptures, Winslow Homer's
``Dad's Coming,'' Picassos, Gauguins, Bonnards, Vuillards, a Manet,
the original wax version of Degas' ``Little 14-Year-Old Dancer''
and postcards that had been written by van Gogh and Matisse. The
gallery is organizing a memorial exhibition to highlight some of
his gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But if he lavished attention on the National Gallery, many other
museums were dear to him, too, including the Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond, where in 1963 he first revealed the extent of his own
growing holdings in British art.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his love for art, Mellon was a single-handed and
single-minded environmentalist. In 1956, foundations that had been
started with his sister published a report, ``Our Vanishing
Shoreline.'' As a result of this alarm, and with considerable
amounts of Mellon funds, parts of the Cape Hatteras National
Seashore, the Great Beach of Cape Cod and Cumberland Island off the
coast of Georgia have been preserved. He bought Virginia the
2,600-acre Sky Meadows State Park and Washington the outdoor chess
tables in Lafayette Square. He used his resources to help insure
that riding and hiking trails would remain available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Through his family foundations Mellon was also instrumental in

EX-ROCK SINGER FINDS GOLD (AND GRAMMYS) IN GOSPEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CORRIE M. ANDERS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The road to gospel Grammydom can be curious
indeed. Consider Deniece Williams' career over more than two
decades. For all her rock 'n' roll hits _ solo and with Johnny
Mathis _ Williams had been a Grammy bridesmaid 10 times, but never
a bride.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, she took a gamble and crossed over to gospel.
The result: three Grammy nominations and three wins. Now she's
after her fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gospel sensation Kirk Franklin, a relative newcomer, picked up
his first Grammy last year. This year alone, the not-yet-30
superstar could pick up four _ including two in the secular world
of R&AMP;B _ when the gospel Grammys are presented Feb. 24 in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Bishop Walter Hawkins, who has been on the musical
scene in the San Francisco area for three decades. Hawkins _ a
singer, composer and conductor _ has received several nominations
in the past and has collaborated on numerous Grammy-winning
projects, including one with his brother Edwin and another with his
former wife Tramaine. He's hoping a CD that blends traditional and
contemporary gospel will reward him with the first Grammy in his
own right.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' entry, ``This Is My Story'' (Harmony), is a soft,
moving collection of songs nominated in the pop-contemporary
category. The CD title, taken from a line in the song ``Blessed
Assurance,'' is up against dc talk's ``Supernatural,'' Michael W.
Smith's ``Live the Life,'' Point of Grace's ``Steady On'' and
Carman's ``Mission 3:16.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching from pop to gospel was a considered risk for Williams,
whose high-soaring voice nailed hits such as ``Free,'' ``Let's Hear
It for the Boy'' and the ``Too Much Too Little Too Late'' duet with
Johnny Mathis. Only a few rockers had tried it previously _ disco
diva Donna Summers and B.J. Thomas are two notables _ and ``they
literally got pulverized for it'' by their old fans and by gospel
skeptics, Williams said in a telephone interview from her Los
Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who grew up in the Church of God in Christ in Gary,
Ind., had always included one or two gospel numbers on her pop
albums. Fans ``were used to hearing me do gospel music'' and a
full-blown gospel album didn't represent a jarring, sudden
departure from secular music, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most closely watched gospel categories _ and perhaps
the most competitive _ are Contemporary Soul Gospel Album and
Gospel Choir or Chorus Album.
</P>
<P>
   Vying for contemporary soul honors are CeCe Winans for
``Everlasting Love'' (Pioneer Music Group), a sultry album of love
for life and Christ; Yolanda Adams for ``Songs From the Heart''
(Verity); Karen Clark-Sheard for ``Finally Karen'' (Island); Fred
Hammond for ``Pages of Life'' (Verity), a double CD that mixes funk
and tent-revival evangelicalism; and Franklin for ``The Nu Nation
Project'' (Gospo Centric).
</P>
<P>
   The odds may favor Franklin, the diminutive Dallas preacher
who's had a giant impact on gospel music's popularity and its
new-found commercial success. His tough-edged, urban contemporary
``Nu Nation'' CD is atop Billboard's gospel chart, a position his
previous ``God's Property'' album held for months on end. His four
albums have sold in the millions and his autobiography, ``Choir
Boy,'' is on the bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin's music is a marriage of hip-hop and gospel and is
aimed directly at the MTV crowd. In ``God's Property,'' Franklin
candidly admonished gospel traditionalists who feared that his
music had gone too far into the secular world that they ``ain't
seen nothing yet.'' The angels couldn't have been more prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nu Nation'' kicks off with a page right from the theatrical
hip-hop world. With ominous and dramatic background music, the
opening portrays Franklin being led into the Court Room of God,
charged with associating ``with known secular artists in the R&AMP;B
and hip-hop world'' and with being ``a secular artist posing'' as a
gospel artist.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not guilty on grounds that Franklin unequivocally
is ``down with God.'' And true to his in-your-face form, the CD
immediately segues into ``Revolution,'' a pumped-up call for a new
order free of greed, social ills, lying politicians and religious
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nu Nation'' also has an arresting array of secular
co-conspirators. R. Kelly, Mary J. Blige, U-2's Bono and Crystal
Lewis team up with Franklin, playing piano, to record ``Lean on
Me,'' a feel-good, ``We Are the World'' anthem. The single is up
for best song of the year in the R&AMP;B category and best R&AMP;B
performance by a duo or group with vocals.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hammond, a guest singer on Franklin's album, is another
strong contender. Last month, Hammond walked off with every major
prize at the Stellar Awards, gospel music's version of the Grammy.
``Pages of Life'' won album of the year; the album's ``Let the
Praise Begin'' was song of the year; and Hammond was named artist
of the year as well as top male vocalist, contemporary male
vocalist and producer. Let the praise begin, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gospel choir is another especially strong category _ so much so
that excellent CDs by two premier assembles, ``I'd Rather Have
Jesus'' (CGI Records), by the Dallas-Fort Worth Mass Choir (CGI
Records), ``Keep Your Mind on Jesus'' (CGI) by the Chicago Mass
Choir _ failed to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders include ``Just Churchin,''' by Bobby Jones and
New Life with the Nashville Super Choir (Gospo Centric); ``Pastor
Hezekiah Walker Presents the LFT Church Choir _ Live at Love
Fellowship Tabernacle'' (Verity); ``Reflections'' by the Associates
(label); ``Strength,'' by the Rev. John P. Kee and the New Life
Community Choir (Verity); and ``Love Alive V _ 25th Anniversary
Reunion'' with Hawkins' Love Center Choir (Gospo Centric).
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Alive,'' commemorating Hawkins' ordination into the
ministry 25 years ago, was recorded over two memorable days at the
Paramount in Oakland, Calif. It was music at its spiritual finest,
with Hawkins joined on the reunion CD by his extended family. It
included his older brother, Edwin, one of gospel's first major
crossover artists with ``Oh Happy Day'' in the early 1970s. The
double ``Love Alive'' album features a contemporary sound as well
as old-time gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong candidate is the high-profile Bobby Jones, who
has a weekly gospel music television show. Jones has a good voice _
not a great one. But his supporting cast on ``Just Churchin'''
included Ann McCrary, Vanessa Bell-Armstrong, Donald Lawrence and
Vickie Winans, who are gospel powerhouses with numerous solo albums
of their own. It all makes for a high-energy album where each song
is a flicker away from spontaneous combustion.

CULINARY ALCHEMY: THE SECRETS BEHIND A SIGNATURE DISH WITH SIMPLE
COMPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the first of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've got a sentimental as well as a culinary attachment to this,
the first of eight fish recipes I'll be sharing with you in the
coming weeks, because it dates from my first days at Oceana. Now my
signature dish, seared striped bass is essentially three simple
components _ the fish, whipped potatoes and vinaigrette _ but each,
good alone, is outstanding with the others.
</P>
<P>
   When I created this four years ago, striped bass was impossible
to buy, although it is easier to find today. So, back then, I began
with blackfish, and because the dish works with almost any
firm-flesh fillet, over the years I've made the dish with
mahi-mahi, red snapper and even dorade.
</P>
<P>
   The technique for cooking the fish is one I often use for thick
fillets. I preheat a dry ovenproof skillet to smoke-detector hot,
butter the fillet's skin generously and slip the fish _ skin side
down _ into the pan. (There's no need to butter the pan, since the
butter on the skin makes the fish self-basting.)
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the fish sizzles and pops, I weight it down. Because
the fillets have a tendency to scrunch up when they hit the heat _
it's as though the fish is hunching its back _ they need to be
pressed against the pan so they can cook evenly. At the restaurant,
I keep a foil-wrapped brick in a small skillet at the ready for
this job, but you can press them with a pancake turner and a little
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of minutes on the stove, the fish goes into a
very hot oven to finish cooking. Prepared this way, the fish stays
moist and the skin crisps enough to provide another texture for the
dish.
</P>
<P>
   The fillets are nestled into a mound of smooth, buttery whipped
potatoes _ which contain a full cup of chopped chives. The chives
contribute an edge to the potatoes, making them no less soothing
and slightly more complex. Then I circle the potatoes with truffle
vinaigrette, a sauce created for the fish but completely
complimentary to the potatoes. (Then again, I can't think of an
instance in which truffles aren't right with potatoes.)
</P>
<P>
   The vinaigrette, like all properly made sauces, resembles music.
Here, the earthy truffles and the deep sherry part of the sherry
vinegar are the bass; the shallots riff between the bass and the
midrange; the midrange resonates with the white pepper and the
grape-seed oil (which doesn't offer flavor but does contribute
everything to the texture), and the high notes are played by the
salt and the acid of the vinegar. Together, they create the
well-balanced harmony I want in a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce provides all the accompanying flavors the fish and
potatoes need, but at the restaurant I like to add another texture
by topping the fish with crispy fried straw potatoes. If you've got
the time, slice Idaho potatoes into slender strands on a mandoline,
soak them in cold water, dry them well, then fry them in grape-seed
oil heated to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As they're fried, transfer them to a plate lined with paper
towels to drain, then toss them with some salt. Just be sure to
make more than you think you need _ they beg to be snacked on.

high heat, bring the chicken stock to a boil. Boil until reduced to
{ cup. Place the shallots in the container of a blender, add the
hot stock and allow to rest for 3 minutes. Add the vinegar and salt
and pepper to taste. With the blender at medium-low speed, drizzle
in the truffle and grape-seed oils, blending until the vinaigrette
is emulsified. Add the truffles, and pulse just to mix. Set the
vinaigrette aside until needed; it may be prepared up to 8 hours
ahead and kept at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare the chive whipped potatoes. Put the potatoes into a
medium saucepan, add enough cold water to cover and 2 teaspoons of
salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium and
simmer until the potatoes can be pierced easily, about 15 minutes.
When the potatoes are almost cooked, in a small saucepan combine
the cream and 4 tablespoons of the butter, and bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the potatoes are done, drain them, and put them back in
the pan. Return the pan to the warm, turned-off burner, and add the
hot cream mixture. Using a sturdy whisk, break up the potatoes and
then whip them until smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste, stir in
the chives and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prepare the seared striped bass. Preheat the oven to 450
degrees. Place a 10-inch ovenproof skillet over high heat. While it
is heating, season both sides of the fish fillets with salt and
pepper to taste, and brush the skin sides generously with the
remaining 2 tablespoons of softened butter. Place the fillets, skin
side down, in the hot skillet, and immediately weight them down
with another smaller skillet, or flatten them with a spatula.
Remove the second skillet after 1 minute. Cook 1 minute more, put
the pan in the oven and roast until the fillets are cooked through
but still moist inside, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip the fillets, flesh
side down, then remove them to a warm platter. To serve, place a
mound of potatoes in the center of each warm dinner plate, top with
a fillet, skin side up, and surround with truffle vinaigrette.
Serve immediately.

<P>
   Penfolds Kalimna Bin 28 Shiraz 1995, Australia. About $19. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whenever August Sebastiani blended different vintages, he would
give the blends a bin number to differentiate them. When his
marketing people told him vintages were important, he stopped
blending.
</P>
<P>
   Some Australians assign bin numbers to distinguish different
bottlings within a single vintage, as in this case.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the wine is excellent. A part of this particular
blend comes from the Kalimna vineyard, a source for some of the
wine that goes into Penfolds Grange, probably Australia's finest
wine.
</P>
<P>
   Shiraz, Australia's favorite wine grape, is, of course, syrah in
the Northern Hemisphere. This wine is 100 percent shiraz and was
aged more than 12 months in older American oak. The wine is good to
drink now and should easily improve in the bottle for five years.

MAYBE ROBINSON SHOULD RUN FOR OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Before the apocalypse, before the NBA begins a
season without Michael Jordan, the advice columnist must put in an
appearance. After that, she expects to be overextended for quite
some time, helping people to cope, to make sense of it all.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: Do you think that a man who is charged with
soliciting business from a prostitute should be allowed to start at
safety in the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenny in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KENNY: Of course not. Hugh Grant is too slow to play safety
in the Super Bowl. He tore an ACL in a parlor scene from ``Sense
and Sensibility,'' and he hasn't been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: What did you make of all the fuss over
Lindsay Davenport's comments at the Australian Open about Amelie
Mauresmo, the woman who beat her in the semifinals? Davenport said
her opponent had huge shoulders, that she hit ``like a guy,'' and
then the media made it sound as if this was a huge insult.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martha in Sydney
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MARTHA: This is a difficult etiquette question, still under
review by the experts. Not so long ago, the biggest insult you
could level at a female athlete was that she ``played like a
girl.''
</P>
<P>
   In this particular case, Davenport seemed quite clearly to be
complimenting her opponent's strength. The media then
hyperventilated over the comments because Mauresmo brought her
girlfriend to the tournament and talked openly about being a
lesbian. My recommendation? More weight training for all the top
females in tennis, so that eventually Mauresmo's game will seem
like girl's play. And instant replay for the reporters, who blew
this interview as if they were NFL referees.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: How did a $400,000 gift to the ex-governor of
Louisiana end up costing Eddie DeBartolo control of the San
Francisco 49ers and the city of San Francisco a firm commitment on
a new stadium and the 2003 Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   _ William in San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WILLIAM: Until recently, I couldn't figure this all out,
either. But in the last few weeks, it's become clear. Mr. D, that
rascal, obviously stopped taking things one game at a time. He
started looking ahead, a cardinal sin in football. And what did he
see? San Francisco hosting not just the Super Bowl, but the
Olympics as well.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of how athletes go into high altitude to train for
the Olympics? Well, Mr. D went in the other direction. New Orleans
is below sea level, and its public officials are world-class in the
little-known palm-extension event. Apparently, Edwin Edwards was
happy to play an IOC official on the scout team.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: When I asked you about solicitation and the
Super Bowl, I meant Eugene Robinson from the Falcons, and how he
was arrested the night before the game and then got to play anyway.
Have you ever seen anything so ridiculous?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenny in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KENNY: Actually, I was at the Democratic National
Convention in '96, when Dick Morris' fondness for paid escorts was
revealed the night before his boss was nominated for re-election.
Morris was promptly fired, but that's only because he wasn't
necessary any more.
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me that if Dan Reeves thought Dick Morris could
have caught Rod Smith on that 80-yard touchdown pass, the Falcons
would have put him in the game.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: Now that the ABL is out of business, what
hope is there for women's basketball? I'm in despair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jennifer in Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR JENNIFER: The Michael crisis is taking up enough of my
time. I can't be bothered with more mourning fans right now. Just
chill out and console yourself with this thought: One woman quit
her job to run the ABL farewell game. Eight others paid $1,500 for
courtside seats, just as if they were Spike Lee or Woody Allen at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Margaret Thatcher's attack on the Falkland Islands,
this proves that women can be just as crazy as men. That's all the
WNBA needs to soar, the promise of a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   Remember just 25 years ago, the men of the NBA couldn't get
their Finals on live television. Now, one of them goes off to play
golf at age 35, and the world acts as if it's time to update the
Bible. Things can change that quickly. In another 25 years, we may
even have a male tennis player say that an opponent ``played like a
girl' and everyone will immediately assume it's a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MS. DEMEANOR: You don't seem to be getting my point about
Eugene Robinson. He pretended to be a religious man, and then he
committed this horrible sin, and he still got to be in the Super
Bowl. Isn't anyone as upset as I am?
</P>
<P>
   _ Kenny in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KENNY: Anyone ever tell you that you're a pest? OK, I'll
grant you this. Football players shouldn't pretend to be something
they're not. They should live up to the images they create for
themselves. Since Robinson couldn't do that, he was unfit to be in
the Super Bowl, unfit to play in the NFL. He should be running for
Congress instead.

SO LISTEN TO MOTHER ALREADY: FOR FLU, TAKE CHICKEN SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Neb.)   (editors: recipes at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With more people sneezing and coughing their way through winter
in New York than anywhere else in the country, it's helpful to
remember that the therapeutic value of ``Jewish penicillin'' is not
a myth.
</P>
<P>
   Chicken soup has been served to billions of cold and flu victims
around the globe for centuries, almost always with the same result:
the patients feel better. And according to at least one pulmonary
specialist, they probably get better sooner, too _ even those who
would rather lie in bed and moan.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Irwin Ziment, chief of medicine at Olive View-UCLA Medical
Center in Silmar, Calif., and an expert in respiratory
pharmacology, is one physician who goes beyond the scientific
evidence to site the historical tradition of chicken soup as a
legitimate natural remedy. He points out that as early as the 12th
century, the rabbi and physician Maimonides wrote that ``soup made
from an old chicken is of benefit against chronic fevers'' and that
it ``also aids the cough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1978 that researchers at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in Miami Beach, Fla., conducted a randomized flu trial using
hot water, cold water and hot chicken soup. The soup proved the
most effective liquid in clearing up the nasal passages. The
subjects who drank hot water were also helped, but not as much as
those who got the soup.
</P>
<P>
   Ziment said scientists know that cystine, an amino acid
plentiful in chicken, is chemically similar to a drug prescribed
for bronchitis and other respiratory infections. The drug,
acetylcysteine, was originally made from chicken feathers and skin.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients that make eyes water and noses run also turn out to
be very useful in relieving cold and flu symptoms _ so chicken soup
made with hot, pungent additions works better than blander recipes.
Garlic, hot peppers, wasabi, horseradish, mustard, ginger and even
curry powder are spices that will break up congestion and flush out
sinuses. If you can't find someone to dote on you by making soup
from scratch, buy the best you can _ made with real chickens _ and
simmer it with one or two of these.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Dr. Stephen Rennard, who specializes in lung
diseases at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha,
Neb., did another chicken soup study _ ``without matzoh balls,'' he
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Renard found that, in a test tube at least, chicken soup made by
his wife from her grandmother's recipe inhibited the ability of
certain white blood cells to promote inflammation involved in some
cold symptoms, like irritated airways and phlegm production. ``The
soup may make you feel better, temporarily, but won't affect the
virus itself, which has to run its course,'' concluded the January
1994 Berkeley Wellness Letter, which published his findings.
</P>
<P>
   Ziment, isn't so sure. ``This is where religion or poetry comes
into it,'' he said. ``If people think it makes them feel better, it
will help. Placebos work if people believe in them.''
</P>
<P>
   LAZARUS SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6 cups rich turkey or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 heads garlic, cloves separated and peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 small fresh jalapenos, seeded and coarsely chopped, or
less if desired
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh oregano or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh thyme or 1 teaspoon dried
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or pepper Jack cheese.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine the stock, garlic, jalapenos and herbs in a saucepan,
and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, and simmer until the garlic
is very soft, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Transfer to a blender, and puree until smooth. Season with
salt, and serve in mugs, garnished with the Parmigiano-Reggiano or
pepper Jack cheese if you're up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 or 4 servings.

   GERMAINE SWANSON'S CHICKEN SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Germaine Swanson of the former Germaine's
restaurant in Washington
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 hours, plus chilling overnight  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 medium yellow onion, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   1 4-inch piece of fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 pounds chicken backbones
</P>
<P>
   2 whole star anise pods
</P>
<P>
   2 cinnamon sticks (each 2 inches long)
</P>
<P>
   5 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup turbinado (raw) sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons salt.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place onion directly on a gas burner or under an electric
broiler, and roast it, turning with tongs, until it is lightly
browned on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut the ginger in half lengthwise. Using a side of a heavy
cleaver or chef's knife, smash ginger all over. This will release
its full flavor.
</P>
<P>
   3. Skin chicken bones, and rinse well. Place bones, onion,
ginger and spices in a large soup pot. Add 3 gallons of water, and
bring to a boil over high heat. Lower heat to medium-low, and
simmer for 3 hours, skimming foam and fat off the surface with a
slotted spoon until the stock becomes clear and is reduced by half.
</P>
<P>
   4. Strain stock through a fine sieve, and discard the solids.
Refrigerate overnight. Next day, remove all fat from the surface.
</P>
<P>
   5. Bring stock to a boil, and cook 5 minutes; then, add sugar
and salt, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 5 quarts.

FROM LIGURIA, PESTO'S COUSIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pesto and tapenade are now well known as all-purpose condiments
that can be made in a few minutes and that will transform simply
cooked meat, fish or poultry _ in fact, nearly any bland dish, from
pasta to mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   But another simple and versatile sauce can be made from the
sun-dried tomato, that 1980s ingredient that faded from the scene
largely because few Americans learned just what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Plotkin, who divides his time between New York and Italy,
includes a sketchy but informative recipe for sun-dried tomato
sauce in his ``Recipes From Paradise'' (Little, Brown; 1997), a
cookbook on Liguria (also known as the Italian Riviera).
</P>
<P>
   Plotkin is intentionally vague about the sauce's ingredients and
their proportions, because he believes that anything beyond the
distinct flavor of the dried tomato and the olive oil in which it
soaks is nearly superfluous. With his guidance, and some
experimentation, I've given the recipe more structure.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy sun-dried tomatoes already reconstituted and soaked
in olive oil, but you may find, as I do, that the price is
prohibitive. It's certainly easy enough to begin with plain dried
tomatoes and reconstitute them.
</P>
<P>
   Since they will just about double in bulk, start with about one
ounce (half a cup) of dried tomatoes to produce enough for this
recipe. Soak them in very hot water to cover until they are very
soft, about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Drain them well, and let them sit for at least an hour in good
light fruity olive oil to cover _ ``preferably Ligurian,'' Plotkin
noted. You'll need half a cup, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the tomatoes are pounded, usually with garlic,
with a mortar and pestle. I use a small food processor (a blender
is not as good). Plotkin adds a little lemon juice, as well as pine
nuts, and I like basil. Against his advice, I tried adding
anchovies or Parmesan, but he was right: other flavors merely
confuse matters.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce is thick, like pesto, and more easily spread than
poured. Plotkin likes it on tubular pasta, but warns that it should
be used sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   It will keep, covered with a thin layer of oil and refrigerated
in a tightly covered container, for at least a week. But its flavor
is best when it is just made. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SUN-DRIED TOMATO SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sun-dried tomatoes, with their oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small clove garlic or { large clove, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 chopped basil leaves, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon lemon juice, optional
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   Additional extra virgin olive oil if necessary. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the tomatoes and a tablespoon or so of their oil in a
small food processor along with the garlic and a good pinch of
salt. Process until fairly smooth, stopping the machine and
stirring down the mixture with a rubber spatula as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the basil and lemon juice if you like; pulse the machine
a few times to blend. Remove the paste from the machine, and stir
in the nuts and just enough additional oil to make the mixture
silky rather than oily. Taste and adjust seasoning. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ In what may be the world's most serious restaurant
city, Daniel Swee qualifies as a heroic diner. He can be found
perusing a menu up to five nights a week, sometimes for business,
more often for pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat out far too often,'' he says. Over the past decade,
Swee, the casting director for Lincoln Center Theater, has felt a
change in restaurant service that's a little like the change in the
weather. It's nothing specific, it's hard to put your finger on,
but it's there, and it has made him happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trend toward restaurants where the food is really
fantastic but the atmosphere is casual, and you are made to feel
welcome,'' he said. ``In the past, you felt that dining in a top
restaurant was a rare privilege and you'd better behave. Now
there's a warmth and an interaction that wasn't there before.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where intimidation is nine-tenths of the law and
one-upmanship is the coin of the realm, pleasing the customer
counts as a revolutionary idea. Swee is not alone in sensing a
different tone in restaurant service these days, one that reflects
a shift in the way restaurant service is thought of, invested in
and delivered in New York and other large cities today.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, a distinctly American style of service has
been evolving, a relaxed yet professional approach that suits the
national character better than the old-style formal French service.
This reinterpretation of restaurant protocol is radical enough to
merit a name _ the new American service _ and at fine restaurants,
owners and managers spend as much time thinking about it as they do
about the food.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of diners would say it's about time. More than half
those who responded in the 1999 Zagat Survey, which covers 45
cities, listed service as their top complaint about a restaurant,
and for all restaurants, service ratings lagged 1.5 points behind
the food ratings on the survey's 30-point scale.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a city with the highest restaurant prices in the
United States, 43 percent of respondents nevertheless listed
service as their top complaint, and the average service rating was
nearly 2 points lower than the average food rating.
</P>
<P>
   The gap reflects a historical lag between food and service that
makes perfect sense, given the evolution of American cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, American restaurants, energized by a
fresh American approach to cooking, threw all their energies into
the kitchen. In the last decade, however, as food quality rose, and
as competition between restaurants heated up, owners and managers
began looking at service as a way to set themselves apart. Their
efforts have begun to show results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service in fine dining is at an all-time high right now,''
said Elizabeth Ward, a vice president for marketing at Visa who
helps restaurants develop service-improvement programs.
``Fine-dining restaurants can get highly educated, skilled
employees, who know they can make a lot of money serving. Also, the
restaurants realize that to charge the prices they do, they have to
nail it every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen MacNeil, a restaurant consultant who lectures on service
at the Culinary Institute of America's campus in Napa Valley,
Calif., went even further. ``American service is much better than
European service right now,'' she said. ``When I go to Europe, I am
shocked, except at three-star restaurants, where it's like an
elegant ballet, at how much more professional the American waiters
are.''
</P>
<P>
   So why all the complaining? Although statistics on the
restaurant industry tend to be scanty, the numbers that are out
there paint a picture of an America that is rapidly developing two
starkly divergent restaurant economies.
</P>
<P>
   The mass-taste establishments, which include chains, casual
dining restaurants and fast-food franchises, are indeed in the
throes of a service crisis. Like their counterparts in the hotel
and retail industries, they have been squeezed by a tight labor
market that has sent them scrambling for employees, who leave
almost as soon as they are hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationwide, many casual-dining restaurants have more jobs than
people to fill them, which depresses standards a bit,'' said Art
Siemering, the editor of Trend/Wire, an industry newsletter.
``Restaurants want to give good service, but the whole labor market
works against it.''
</P>
<P>
   In an annual survey by the American Society for Quality and the
University of Michigan, consumer satisfaction with fast-food
restaurants, low to begin with in comparison with other service
industries, has declined markedly since 1994, the first year the
survey was conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are higher,'' said Ron Zemke, the president of
Performance Research Associates, a Minneapolis company that does
service-quality audits and service training for restaurants. ``In
part this is because of the better economy, but it's also because
of an increased awareness of higher levels of service, much more
than five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At fine-dining restaurants, however, especially in cities like
New York, San Francisco and Chicago, where competition among
top-dollar spots is ferocious, the picture looks very different. In
the last five years, the gap between food and service ratings in
the Zagat Survey has shrunk from two points to a point and a half.
``That's a significant change when you're talking about the whole
range of restaurants covered by the survey,'' said Tim Zagat, who
publishes the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Over that same period, tips, ordinarily regarded as a reward for
service, have risen across the country. According to survey data
from NPD Group, a market research company in Rosemont, Ill., the
average dinner tip nationwide rose from 14.9 percent in 1993 to
16.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody is doing something right.
</P>
<P>
   The new style of service is still taking shape; the rules are in
flux, but restaurant owners and their customers know it, or feel
it, when they meet it.
</P>
<P>
   What it is not is the old-fashioned European-style service, with
tuxedoed captains, imposing maitres d'hotel, rigid rules of
service, and an air of hauteur and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   For generations of American diners, this was the definition of
fine dining _ the kind of snooty French joint where Lucy and Ethel
made fools of themselves. It became an anachronism as a new
generation of chefs and restaurant owners developed a fresh
American approach to cuisine over the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, new American service is professional, casual and
democratic. It is democratic in two senses. First, diners get equal
_ or at least more nearly equal _ consideration, rather than being
divided into nobodies and friends of the house. Second, service
duties are shared more equitably among staff members, which
translates into better, more informed service for diners and, not
incidentally, good salaries for waiters at top restaurants.

<P>
   It is not uncommon to earn $50,000 waiting tables at a
second-level restaurant in New York, while waiters at the city's
top restaurants can bring home $80,000. The profession may not have
the glamour that attaches to chefs, but the days of ``My name is
Jason, and I'll be your waiter,'' and snide remarks about
out-of-work actors, seem anachronistic these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little more conversational, rather than
presentational,'' Swee said. ``You can have a conversation with the
servers and actually learn. At Babbo, one of my current favorites,
if the wine steward comes over, it's not an intimidating
experience. He's incredibly knowledgeable, but enthusiastic and
willing to talk to you, to help.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, it has become standard practice at fine
restaurants for waiters to know the menu from top to bottom, and to
be able to answer questions about the ingredients in each dish.
Waiters are expected to have a solid understanding of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The new way takes a lot of time and a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   When Picholine changed its format from casual bistro to fine
dining, Terrance Brennan, the owner and chef, hired a sommelier and
a fromageur, bumped the number of waiters from five to eight, and
added a second runner to carry food from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   He hired a silver polisher after upgrading from stainless steel.
His linen costs doubled, partly because he started using finer
cloth, and partly because diners who get up from their seat to use
the telephone or go to the restroom, return to find a new folded
napkin at their places.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan hired an extra manager simply to oversee service.
``Actually, I think service is a little more important than the
food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes cost money. The number of employees rose from 25
when the restaurant opened to 75 now. Over the last five years,
Brennan raised prices about 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening its doors last month, Bayard's, a new restaurant
on Hanover Square in Manhattan, put its staff through a weeklong
series of lectures and workshops organized by Eric Weiss, the
president of company called Service Arts, which has worked with
about 80 New York restaurants in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hearing notables like Gray Kunz, the former chef
at Lespinasse, and Karen Waltuck, an owner of Chanterelle, talk
about the subject, staff members at Bayard's went through
role-playing exercises. They learned that waiters who are asked
where the bathrooms are must walk the customer at least halfway
there, instead of pointing.
</P>
<P>
   Because many diners are unfamiliar with the Wall Street area,
staff members carry a map with instructions on how to get to the
restaurant by car, train or subway. The first-floor and
second-floor hostesses must know the menu inside out so that they
can field questions about ingredients from callers or potential
diners who stop in off the street.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant Associates, when training staff for Cafe Centro,
Tropica and its other restaurants, imprints a 10-part regimen
called ``Steps of Service.'' It begins with ``First Approach''
(``Greet guests with a smile, within two minutes of table being
seated'') and takes the servers through the entire meal in great
detail _ ``check presentation'' is divided into three parts.
</P>
<P>
   Technique is only half the battle, and one of the main
differences between the old style of service and the new is a
characteristically American inclination to put practice ahead of
theory. ``To break up a conversation simply to be technically
correct in serving from the left makes no sense,'' Brennan said.
``We will bend that rule in the interest of unobtrusive service.
We'll serve incorrectly rather than put an elbow in someone's face
or intrude on someone's personal space.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, technique is only half the battle. The art of
waiting tables rests on intangibles. ``The real difference between
good service and great service is the ability to read the table,''
Weiss said. ``You don't treat every table the same. You have to be
sensitive to body language, to the things that people say, and
serve them accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   A good waiter can sense when diners want to be left alone, and
when they want constant attention. He or she can usually tell who
is in a hurry and who wants to linger. An even better waiter can
draw subtler inferences. The diner who asks for ``a dry white
wine'' needs a different response from the diner who asks for a
medium-bodied white wine, or the one who wants to know whether a
sauvignon blanc has an assertively grassy character.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter at the top of his game, in Weiss' view, achieves
near-psychoanalytic powers of analysis and receptivity. At any
rate, Weiss spends a great deal of time telling his workshop
students that many of the diners they encounter will not be in the
restaurant to eat at all, when you look deeply enough. ``May people
are at a restaurant because they want recognition, attention, or
simply to belong to something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The demanding customer is often sending out a cry for help, in
other words. It's not about the underdone filet, which clearly
isn't underdone at all. The perceptive server knows this, and takes
the appropriate therapeutic measures. The steak goes straight back
to the kitchen, no questions asked, and the diner is smoothed down
with apologies and cosseted.
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Last November, when Richard Fischbein led a posse of
fellow lawyers and paralegals from the firm of Fischbein Badillo &AMP;
Harding into Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, a Manhattan steakhouse, he simmered
in silence at service that he later called ``a disaster,'' and then
erupted, refusing to pay the mandatory 18 percent service charge
levied on large parties.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo &AMP; Maxie's, in a move straight out of the old school,
detained Fischbein and summoned the police. The mess was sorted out
before both sides got to court, but not before Fischbein became an
instant culture hero.
</P>
<P>
   In the city that invented service with a snarl, there may be a
little work still left undone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   What is good service? Many diners say they know it when they see
it, or feel it, but the rules are in flux. Although the new
American service continues to evolve, it has its hallmarks _ things
a restaurant will do to make customers feel comfortable and
welcome. Here is a checklist of some of them, provided by
restaurateurs and consultants who specialize in service.
</P>
<P>
   Many diners think of service as a product delivered by the
waiter. They're wrong.``It's everything that happens to you other
than the calories that go into your body,'' said Karen MacNeil, a
consultant. ``It begins when you phone to make a reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   Does the reservationist ask if you would mind holding, instead
of cutting you off with a quick ``Please hold''? Is there an
apology when the reservationist gets back on the line? Is there
some expression of regret if the restaurant does not have the
desired opening?
</P>
<P>
   When you enter the restaurant, does the person at the
reservation book look up and greet you? ``The first thing I notice
is whether the host seems perplexed by my name,'' Ms. MacNeil said.
``There is no reason for anyone to stare for five minutes at the
book. I mean, how many reservations can there be at 8 o'clock? Half
a dozen? Part of the job is to memorize the book.''
</P>
<P>
   How does the hostess escort you to the table? If you have to
race to keep up, something's wrong. She should walk slightly ahead,
and slightly turned toward you. A waiter should establish contact
almost immediately, diners should be presented with the menus hand
to hand, and menus should be open.
</P>
<P>
   When taking drink orders, the waiter should read the table to
determine what kind of interaction diners want, and how quickly
they want the meal to progress.
</P>
<P>
   In taking food orders, the waiter should describe, rather than
recite, the specials and encourage questions about specials and
menu items. In taking the wine order, the waiter should gauge the
level of wine sophistication at the table, describe the wines
accordingly, and suggest pairings of wine and food.
</P>
<P>
   When serving and clearing, the servers should violate the
traditional protocol of serving from the left and clearing from the
right if it is more unobtrusive to do so. When a problem arises,
the waiter should apologize and correct it, without making excuses,
challenging the diner or taking a defensive tone.

FAIRWAY GAINS ON BROADWAY  
 DUELING LIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the turf battle between the two high-profile markets on
Broadway between 74th and 75th Streets, Fairway has definitely
trumped Citarella, in size, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The two stores have been squaring off on cheese, fish, meat and
produce for some time. But now, Fairway has taken over the adjacent
D'Agostino's supermarket space along with the Jack LaLanne studio
on the second floor, adding to the additional area it gobbled up in
1997 when it expanded south to 74th Street. When the new space
opens this spring, Fairway will have nearly 25,000 square feet,
dwarfing Citarella's 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Jenkins, a partner at Fairway, said the latest expansion
would allow the store to carry most of the merchandise sold at the
huge Fairway in Harlem, which has staples like paper towels and pet
food. The new second floor will be devoted to organic produce, a
cafe will be added and the fish and meat departments will quadruple
in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will look just as no-frills tacky as ever,'' Jenkins
promised. ``That's how we'll keep our prices down.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought about Fairway's latest plans, Citarella's
owner, Joseph R. Gurrera, said, ``We have separate customers, and
there's enough for everyone.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

<P>
   The turmoil in the foie gras business brings to mind the breakup
of Ma Bell. New federal regulations permitting the importing of raw
foie gras from France have resulted in lower prices, more choices,
competition and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   D'Artagnan, the country's largest distributor of foie gras, is
continuing to sell raw American duck livers to chefs ($37 a pound
for top quality) but is promoting the French variety at $29 a pound
because Hudson Valley Foie Gras, the leading domestic producer, has
started marketing its livers directly for $31. Hudson Valley Foie
Gras in Ferndale, N.Y., used to sell only through D'Artagnan.
</P>
<P>
   D'Artagnan has also started selling one-and-a-half-ounce slabs
of raw French duck foie gras, two to a package, for home cooks who
previously had to buy an entire liver weighing 10 times as much
just to saute a little for dinner. Shops, including Balducci's,
Grace's Marketplace and Citarella, have the slices for about $20 a
package.
</P>
<P>
   Terrines of French and American duck foie gras are now both $75
a pound from D'Artagnan. In a blind sampling, the French had a
rounder, more complex taste.
</P>
<P>
   So far, chefs are divided. The French duck livers are winning
praise from some top chefs, including Remi Lauvand of Montrachet,
Scott Campbell of Avenue, and Charles Palmer of Aureole. Others,
like Matthew Lake of 27 Standard, are sticking with the domestic,
especially for sauteeing.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the situation is the fact that many chefs
do not want to disrupt their relationships with D'Artagnan, which
sells game and duck confit in addition to foie gras and which
readily ministers to chefs' needs in emergencies and at odd hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have some deciding to do,'' said Rocco DiSpirito, the
chef at Union Pacific. ``D'Artagnan is about more than foie gras.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ginor, owner of Hudson Valley Foie Gras, says he plans
to sell directly not only foie gras, but also confit, smoked salmon
and perhaps even French livers. ``And I'm not the only one,'' he
said, adding that others, like Rougie, a big French producer, were
starting to sell raw foie gras here.
</P>
<P>
   But Ariane Daguin, an owner of D'Artagnan, contends that she has
a contract with the best and most traditional of the five French
plants that produce foie gras for export. D'Artagnan has just
expanded its production with a big new plant in Huntington, N.Y.,
and has also started selling mushrooms and truffles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new era,'' Ginor said. ``Soon, there will be plenty of
D'Artagnans and everyone will have foie gras.''

NICE AND CLEAN: ROACH'S HUMOR IS GREEN, NOT BLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Irish comedian Hal Roach has a prescription for good
health:
</P>
<P>
   Laugh 20 times a day and call him in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the dosage Dr. Roach recommends,'' says the man touted
as the King of Blarney. ``Humor is the key to all our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Few cultures have faced as much adversity as the Irish, and
humor has been their salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't laugh in the Emerald Isle, we'd have gone mad,''
Roach says.
</P>
<P>
   During a show business career that has lasted more than 50
years, Roach, 67, has been delighting listeners with his brand of
humor as authentic and pungent as Irish whiskey and as clean as a
cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   Smut is for the feeble of wit, Roach says. Besides, his
audiences often are peppered with nuns and priests who don't mind a
good Catholic joke but won't brook filth.
</P>
<P>
   Roach is calling from outside Fort Lauderdale, where he owns a
home and spends his winters making Floridians chuckle. His other
home is in Dublin, Ireland, where he has performed for 28 years at
Jury's Irish Cabaret and in May will move to the Regency Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists who flock to Roach's shows don't want to hear
anything they can get at home, he says, so he keeps his act
authentic Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go to Africa to hear Zulus sing ``My Way,'' '' he
laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Some subjects Roach won't touch, no matter how humorous _ such
as the U.S. president. But the Irish themselves are fair game. And,
of course, the British.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Two fellows are sitting in a pub in Belfast. One
says to the other, ``What's new?''
</P>
<P>
   The other fellow says, ``Well, there's good news and bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the bad news?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The British have landed on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the good news?''
</P>
<P>
   ``ALL of them.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   When Roach comes to America, he brings his family with him _
wife, Mary; son, John; and three daughters. One daughter is named
for her mother. The other two are named after ancient Celtic
queens, Aine (AHN-yay) and Grainne (GRAHN-yay).
</P>
<P>
   His own given name is John. But when he was just a wee lad, his
hair stuck up like Alfalfa in the ``Our Gang'' comedies, created by
legendary American producer Hal Roach. Some of John Roach's pals
began teasing him that he looked like Alfalfa and began calling him
Hal. The nickname stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Roach has had his share of sadness as well as laughter. In 1967,
his wife gave birth to their son, who was diagnosed with Down
syndrome. In those days, parents were often advised to
institutionalize disabled children. The Irish believed them to be a
curse.
</P>
<P>
   When John was born, Mary told Hal, ``If you can take this, I
can.'' He said he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe these children are sent to teach,'' he says. ``There
are ways to react to other people, to show what love is.''
</P>
<P>
   On St. Patrick's Day, Roach will perform in Lakeland, Fla. It's
his favorite day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was grand marshall at a St. Patrick's Day parade
in Washington, D.C. _ one of the grandest days of his life, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Roach is happy to spend his favorite day in the States, his
second home. You won't hear him taking potshots at his good
friends.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) America is a wonderful country. They can send a man
to the moon, but they can't make a cup of tea. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   That's as mean as he gets. &QL;

<P>
   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

 &HT;    THREE YEARS AFTER HUGE TELECOM BILL, CONFUSION REIGNS
 &HT;    1330&AMP;add. With TELECOM-DATA, TELECOM-SBC and TELECOM-BELLSOUTH.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three years ago Monday, President Clinton signed
into law a huge bill to overhaul the nation's telecommunications
industry and usher in an era of competition and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The act was aimed at reforming industries ranging from
long-distance phone service to cable television, but it mentioned
the Internet only twice.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a few years make.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the visions of local phone competition and shrinking
cable TV and local phone bills are still a dream. Instead, telecom
giants are in a mad dash to grab the Holy Grail of the 21st
century: high-speed Internet delivery of data services to millions
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and regulators, caught completely off guard, are
frantically trying to level the playing field in a marketplace that
resembles shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's broad consensus that the act isn't working,'' said
Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Research Technology Team of the
Legg Mason investment bank. ``But there's no consensus about what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous. The exploding U.S. market for voice and
data services is expected to increase 8 percent in 1999 to $270
billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and that
doesn't include high-speed Internet access or cable television.
Globally, the market will soar to $825 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking its share of the bonanza, corporate America is engaged
in a dizzying round of musical chairs. Giants such as AT&AMP;T Corp.
are joining forces with cable companies such as Time Warner Inc.
Regional Bell phone companies are buying each other to fend off
long-distance competitors. And Internet newcomers are in a panic
that cable companies will gain a monopoly on high-speed pipelines
to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of change is overwhelming,'' says Legg Mason's Bill
Whyman(cq), an Internet specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But the telecom world is expected to change even more
dramatically in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict mega-companies will provide integrated services
_ voice, data and video as well as Web hosting and private networks
_ to business and high-end individual customers. Smaller companies
will fill niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean changes will benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An average American family now spends at least $1,000 a year on
phone and cable services. Since the 1996 act, local phone rates
have risen about 10 percent. And cable rates have soared 21
percent. And while government rules have saved long-distance
carriers as much as $1 billion in local connection costs, not a
penny has been passed on to consumers, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of broken promises,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, technology leapfrogged the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The battle today is between technologies, not industry segments:
On one side, cable operators are betting on high-speed cable
modems. On the other, phone companies are investing in Digital
Subscriber Lines (DSL). Both provide super-fast connections to the
Internet with the capacity to transmit voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's causing the hoopla: Telephone lines remain
regulated, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not
indicated yet how it will regulate DSL services. That means that
phone companies may be required by the government to let their
competitors lease lines and equipment. But cable lines are
virtually unregulated, with a retail pricing structure set to
expire in March. There are no rules requiring cable companies to
share their lines with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides are rushing to lock up the emerging
Internet market. ``Today, data is everything,'' insisted Bob
Bishop, GTE Corp.'s chief Washington spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned analysts have difficulty projecting the market for
these high-volume ``broadband'' services. But this much is known:
Every three months, Internet traffic doubles. And by 2001, U.S.
data traffic is expected to surpass voice transmission in volume.
In 1997 alone, the nation's top Internet service providers,
including America Online Inc., reported $6.9 billion in revenue, up
from nearly nothing before the telecom act passed.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this seismic shift in the industry has sent
telecom players scrambling. That's why AT&AMP;T's $48 billion bid for
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is raising eyebrows among
competitors. If approved by regulators, AT&AMP;T would gain direct
access to millions of U.S. customers through TCI's extensive cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   TCI owns a large share of the high-speed At Home data network,
which recently purchased Web portal Excite, putting AT&AMP;T in a good
position to compete with any Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, users of broadband access such as DSL or cable
modems don't need Internet service providers. This has led online
firms such as AOL to put together a lobbying group to persuade
regulators that cable has an unfair advantage because it is
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, five consumer groups took the same message to the
FCC. With access to 96 percent of American homes, they argued, the
cable industry could quickly gain a monopoly on Internet access and
require users to view their content as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable companies want to use their bottleneck over
high-speed to get you to use their content,'' charges Jamie Love,
director of the Consumer Project on Technology. ``Any time, we've
had a monopoly in the past, it hasn't turned out good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies see it differently. Steve Effros, president of
the Cable Telecommunications Association in Fairfax, Va., says
cable companies today have two-way Internet capabilities in 56
percent of American homes. But only 500,000 of their customers have
signed up for high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a monopoly here,'' scoffed Effros. ``We're in
the middle of vigorous competition. We happen to think we have a
pretty good mousetrap, but that doesn't mean we should have to give
it to our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, William E. Kennard, is stuck in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has the dual job of protecting consumers as well as
regulating the industry. As telephone, wireless, Internet and cable
technologies meld, though, regulators admit it's tricky to balance
conflicting missions.
</P>
<P>
   At a January discussion with reporters, Kennard stressed:
``We're not here to pick winners or losers. The agency is keeping
its eye on the prize, which is alternative networks that provide
consumers with choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But in coming months, the agency will be faced with key
decisions, including whether phone giants must lease part of their
systems to data delivery companies.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bell companies grumble that they should be unencumbered
in order to compete fairly with cable companies. ``We would just as
soon regulators keep their hands off all of it,'' says BellSouth
Corp.'s chief lobbyist, David J. Markey. ``But if they are going to
regulate us, they should regulate them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also was expected to make recommendations about
whether cable companies need to open their lines to competitors, as
requested by AOL and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers aren't likely to support measures
that meddle with the fast-growing Internet industry. In fact, some
are fed up with the FCC's progress deregulating other segments of
the industry, and there likely will be efforts to restructure the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio, chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, both plan legislation that will
downsize the FCC and reduce its regulatory muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, nobody would like better than I to take another
shot at spelling out in clearer terms the intent of the '96 Telecom
Act,'' Oxley said in a statement. ``But we need to stay focused on
the structure and mission of the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration _ most notably Vice President Al Gore
_ has been mum about the act's failings. The administration would
prefer to stress its priority that all Americans have access to the
``information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on upcoming regulatory decisions, the government could
either encourage or discourage investments in poorer, more remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, for example, knows he must revamp the subsidy system
that keeps rural phone rates affordable. And some consumer
advocates fear the nation is on the verge of ``telecom
red-lining,'' where unregulated corporate giants will build private
networks to service only wealthy business or residential customers
in high-density, affluent areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tricky and it's never going to be perfect,'' admitted Tom
Power, a top aide to FCC Chairman Kennard. ``But that's one of our
main concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand today's chaos, you have to revisit the lobbying
frenzy surrounding the passage of the 1996 act. The bloodiest
battles were fought between long-distance giants and regional Bells
over access to each others' voice markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing the act, the world was defined by voice,''
said BellSouth lobbyist Markey. ``And the question was: Who has the
biggest share?''
</P>
<P>
   While local telephone service accounted for the largest domestic
market, at $109.3 billion in 1996, the $86.9 billion long-distance
market was poised to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, regional Bells are allowed into long distance
only after they open local markets to competition. A Merrill Lynch
analysis, written days after the act's passage, predicted that
regional Bells would offer long-distance service in 18 months. But
three years later, not a single Bell company has met a 14-point
checklist to prove they have legitimate competition locally.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, regional Bells still received 97 percent of the local
phone service revenue in 1997, according to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problems we see every time are hardware and
software problems,'' said Power. Regional Bells ``haven't shown
that competitors are really able to win over and switch
customers,'' Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is coming, though.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, leads the nation with 35 local competitors
assigned numbers to deliver local service. The state is followed by
California, with 28 competitors, including Cox Communications Inc.,
a corporate relative of Cox Newspapers; New York, 27 competitors;
Florida, 25 competitors; and Georgia, 22 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bells have challenged the rules for local competition
in court, but without much success. In mid-January, the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to consider a case challenging the FCC's
constitutional authority to regulate the Bells. And on Jan. 26, the
high court restored rules that forced the Bells to lease their
networks to rivals at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, Kennard said, he expects to allow at least one Bell
_ probably Bell Atlantic _ into long-distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Bells acknowledge that the telecom game has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the world is defined by data bits, `` said Markey. ``It
could be voice, data or video. But we know that we have a much
smaller share of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world today includes a lot of things beyond what they were
looking at in the act,'' he said.

 &HT;    AN INTERVIEW WITH BELLSOUTH'S TOP LOBBYIST
 &HT;    With TELECOM. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ BellSouth's top lobbyist David J. Markey gave his
views of the telecommunications wars in an interview with Cox
Newspapers Washington Bureau correspondent Mary Beth Regan.
</P>
<P>
   Markey joined BellSouth in 1985 after serving as president of
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
under President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will 1999 be a pivotal year for telecom reform?
</P>
<P>
   A: Obviously, the act has taken longer to move along than some
people expected. We're coming up on the third-year anniversary, and
some things happen as a result of three years passing. I think
those deadlines indicate Congress expected some things to have
happened by now.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there's going to be a lot of activity in all sectors.
There's going to be activity on the Hill. There's certainly going
to be continuing activity in the regulatory arena. Obviously, the
marketplace too.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to us that people will say, ``Your markets
aren't open.'' Well, they sure are in there providing a lot of
services. And we sure are competing with them _ particularly in the
business market, and more and more in the residential market.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's at stake for BellSouth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every year seems to be a pivotal year. But if what you mean
is: Will we get out from under some of the current restrictions?
Then, we sure hope so. We're planning on it being a pivotal year in
that we think we're going to be able to convince the (Federal
Communications Commission) that we've met the checklist and we
should be able to compete with long-distance carriers. That's what
we thought the deal was when the act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has the marketplace changed since 1996?
</P>
<P>
   A: Back when the act was going through, this was pretty much a
battle between the long-distance and the local carrier. Now you're
starting to see Internet companies and computer companies and AOL,
and others, starting to understand that what happens to us has a
real impact on them, because we're the connection to the customers
in most places. These companies are beginning to understand that
putting restrictions on us is holding us back from doing the things
that they want to see _ building broader-band networks to the homes
and offices, so they can sell more of what they want to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will lawmakers or regulators further regulate Internet
access?
</P>
<P>
   A: My point is that they already regulate this. When you talk
about the Internet, you're talking about BellSouth. How do people
get hooked up to AOL? For most people, it's through the phone line.
When you talk about the Internet, you're talking telephone and
telecommunications companies because the Internet won't work
without us. Maybe someday there will be new technology through
satellite operations, but we're not there yet. Today, you've got
two ways to get onto the Internet, through a cable hook-up or
through your phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are companies consistent in their positions on how government
should regulate phone and cable lines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, we think we're consistent. But I don't think that AT&AMP;T
is. AT&AMP;T is saying to regulators, you've got to make the (incumbent
local exchange carriers) do all these things. You've got to
restrict them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you've got (C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman) saying, ``Oh, don't do that to us. Because if you do that
to us, we won't invest.'' Well, that's what we've been telling the
regulators for years.
</P>
<P>
   With the cable networks that they are buying, AT&AMP;T is saying,
``We don't have any obligation to do what those guys are going.''
</P>
<P>
   We're saying, ``Don't regulate them and don't regulate us.'' We
would just assume the regulators keep their hands off of all of it.
But if they are going to regulate us, we think they ought to
regulate them too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But FCC Chairman Kennard has signaled he is not going to
require cable companies to open their lines, especially in the
AT&AMP;T-TCI merger decision. What's your opinion about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: From his standpoint, I think it's a reasonable stance.
Congress expected the cable companies to be in there competing
against the local telephone companies. Here's an opportunity for
AT&AMP;T to do that, and it makes sense for him to support that merger.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I would think that it would make sense for
him to do things to encourage us to expand and invest in this area.
And we just don't think that what they are coming up with is
anything that's going to encourage us to do the things he wants us
to do (such as installing high-speed phone or fiber-optic lines to
homes). The fact of the matter is, only the local telephone
companies today serve everybody. There are some places you can't
get cable.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Bill Kennard, and you're worried about the have-nots,
the inner city, the rural areas. Who are the only people in
position to serve those folks? We think it's us. So it doesn't make
sense for us to make it harder for us to do that.

   TELECOM REGULATORS FACE KEY DECISIONS THIS YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications regulators face a handful of key decisions
this year that will shape the landscape of the industry:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET ISSUES: The Federal Communications Commission will
decide what elements of a regional Bell's network must be available
for lease to competitors for data transmission. Bell companies
grumble that this ruling could handicap them in competition with
cable companies. The agency also will decide whether calls to the
Internet are local or long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   LONG DISTANCE: Three Bell companies are vying to be the first to
offer long-distance service. Right now, Bell Atlantic is the
favorite, expected to get state and federal approval to offer
service in New York. That ruling likely will pave the way for
BellSouth's Georgia bid.
</P>
<P>
   SUBSIDY REFORM: Regulators will begin to revamp the pricing
structure for local service. Today, analysts estimate that $20
billion in price-distorting subsidies exist in the $100 billion
local market. For example, some residential users pay only half the
real cost of basic service.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR MERGERS: By mid-1999, the agency will rule on three
mega-mergers expected to reshape the industry. They are
SBC-Ameritech, Bell Atlantic-GTE and AT&AMP;T-TCI. Collectively, these
mergers involve two-thirds of the local phone industry, half the
long-distance industry and one-third of the cable industry.

 &HT;    AN INTERVIEW WITH SBC'S LOBBYIST
 &HT;    With TELECOM. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ SBC Telecommunications Inc.'s lobbyist to the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Dale ``Zeke'' Robertson,
gave his views of the telecommunications wars in an interview with
Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau correspondent Mary Beth Regan.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson joined SBC's Washington office in 1997 after serving
as president of SBC's Telmex operations. He began his career in
1967 with Southwestern Bell in Lubbock, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the 1996 Telecom Act been effective?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there's an incredible amount of activity in the
marketplace today. And technology is just exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In general, I think the act is pro-competition, pro-universal
service. And it's got a pro-consumer tone. It was set up so that
the long-distance companies should be able to do local and cable;
the local companies should do long-distance and cable, and the
cable companies should be able to do local and long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that it was to remove barriers that had
historically been classifications of different companies.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it was moving from a rigid regulatory environment to
one where the marketplace would dictate who the winners are, with
the provision that you need to protect universal services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has it worked?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since then, it seems the regulatory agencies, primarily FCC
and the state regulatory bodies, have been mired in the arbitration
of competitive interests between companies.
</P>
<P>
   But we believe that the third anniversary marks not an end but a
change in the paradigm from that time when it was litigious,
dividing companies.
</P>
<P>
   And we are looking forward to when the commission is going to
start looking at the services as opposed to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   At some point at time, we hope the regulators will come to the
conclusion that they should regulate the service, not the company.
Then you may have someone that gripes about it. But the regulator
can say the rules are the same for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The FCC has indicated it may allow telephone companies to
deliver data services through separate subsidiaries. Do you support
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on how it is done. If what they come out with is
restrictive, highly separative, it will force costs into the
operation. And that's going to minimize broadband deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The more freedoms you have to use your existing resources, to
share various things, while keeping it a pure accounting of it, the
greater the deployment is going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your view of the current battle between telephone and
cable companies for high-speed Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, portions of your company, Cox Cable, are offering
bundled services in Orange County, Calif. and other places. And
they are going at it with a cable modem. We have to respond. We
have to find some way to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of issues underlying this, such as universal
service. But the bottom line is: Technology and the capability of
having an innovative provider say to the consumer: ``I know you
want faster Internet service, I know you want programming,
television, local phone service _ I've got a deal for you'' means
we have to respond. We simply want the ability to stay in the
market as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: FCC Chairman Kennard has indicated that the FCC will look
favorably on the ATT-TCI merger. What's your position on that?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is an attitude that seems indicative of my first point
about arbitrating competitive interests. As a competitor of this
huge new enterprise, I would say I should have the same privileges,
and no more obligations, than my biggest competitor. Its doesn't
seem logical that we would have two huge, well-capitalized,
consumer-oriented companies _ one having an obligation to do
something that impacts it so negatively, and the other one not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will SBC position itself against an AT&AMP;T-TCI?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, that's our concern. But how do you fight that?
</P>
<P>
   We've been very critical of the implementation of the act up to
this point. And we have said that there has been some unfair
treatment. But it's our vision that there will be handful of five
or six companies that will have international reach and good
domestic coverage. We fully expect to be one of them. And our
Ameritech merger is the first step.

 &HT;    THREE YEARS AFTER HUGE TELECOM BILL, CONFUSION REIGNS
 &HT;    1330&AMP;add. With TELECOM-DATA, TELECOM-SBC and TELECOM-BELLSOUTH.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three years ago Monday, President Clinton signed
into law a huge bill to overhaul the nation's telecommunications
industry and usher in an era of competition and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   The act was aimed at reforming industries ranging from
long-distance phone service to cable television, but it mentioned
the Internet only twice.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a few years make.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the visions of local phone competition and shrinking
cable TV and local phone bills are still a dream. Instead, telecom
giants are in a mad dash to grab the Holy Grail of the 21st
century: high-speed Internet delivery of data services to millions
of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators and regulators, caught completely off guard, are
frantically trying to level the playing field in a marketplace that
resembles shifting sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's broad consensus that the act isn't working,'' said
Scott Cleland, an analyst with the Research Technology Team of the
Legg Mason investment bank. ``But there's no consensus about what
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous. The exploding U.S. market for voice and
data services is expected to increase 8 percent in 1999 to $270
billion, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and that
doesn't include high-speed Internet access or cable television.
Globally, the market will soar to $825 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking its share of the bonanza, corporate America is engaged
in a dizzying round of musical chairs. Giants such as AT&AMP;T Corp.
are joining forces with cable companies such as Time Warner Inc.
Regional Bell phone companies are buying each other to fend off
long-distance competitors. And Internet newcomers are in a panic
that cable companies will gain a monopoly on high-speed pipelines
to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of change is overwhelming,'' says Legg Mason's Bill
Whyman(cq), an Internet specialist.
</P>
<P>
   But the telecom world is expected to change even more
dramatically in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict mega-companies will provide integrated services
_ voice, data and video as well as Web hosting and private networks
_ to business and high-end individual customers. Smaller companies
will fill niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean changes will benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   An average American family now spends at least $1,000 a year on
phone and cable services. Since the 1996 act, local phone rates
have risen about 10 percent. And cable rates have soared 21
percent. And while government rules have saved long-distance
carriers as much as $1 billion in local connection costs, not a
penny has been passed on to consumers, consumer advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of broken promises,'' said Gene
Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers Union in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, technology leapfrogged the 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
   The battle today is between technologies, not industry segments:
On one side, cable operators are betting on high-speed cable
modems. On the other, phone companies are investing in Digital
Subscriber Lines (DSL). Both provide super-fast connections to the
Internet with the capacity to transmit voice, data and video.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what's causing the hoopla: Telephone lines remain
regulated, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has not
indicated yet how it will regulate DSL services. That means that
phone companies may be required by the government to let their
competitors lease lines and equipment. But cable lines are
virtually unregulated, with a retail pricing structure set to
expire in March. There are no rules requiring cable companies to
share their lines with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides are rushing to lock up the emerging
Internet market. ``Today, data is everything,'' insisted Bob
Bishop, GTE Corp.'s chief Washington spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned analysts have difficulty projecting the market for
these high-volume ``broadband'' services. But this much is known:
Every three months, Internet traffic doubles. And by 2001, U.S.
data traffic is expected to surpass voice transmission in volume.
In 1997 alone, the nation's top Internet service providers,
including America Online Inc., reported $6.9 billion in revenue, up
from nearly nothing before the telecom act passed.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, this seismic shift in the industry has sent
telecom players scrambling. That's why AT&AMP;T's $48 billion bid for
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. is raising eyebrows among
competitors. If approved by regulators, AT&AMP;T would gain direct
access to millions of U.S. customers through TCI's extensive cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   TCI owns a large share of the high-speed At Home data network,
which recently purchased Web portal Excite, putting AT&AMP;T in a good
position to compete with any Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, users of broadband access such as DSL or cable
modems don't need Internet service providers. This has led online
firms such as AOL to put together a lobbying group to persuade
regulators that cable has an unfair advantage because it is
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, five consumer groups took the same message to the
FCC. With access to 96 percent of American homes, they argued, the
cable industry could quickly gain a monopoly on Internet access and
require users to view their content as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cable companies want to use their bottleneck over
high-speed to get you to use their content,'' charges Jamie Love,
director of the Consumer Project on Technology. ``Any time, we've
had a monopoly in the past, it hasn't turned out good.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies see it differently. Steve Effros, president of
the Cable Telecommunications Association in Fairfax, Va., says
cable companies today have two-way Internet capabilities in 56
percent of American homes. But only 500,000 of their customers have
signed up for high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a monopoly here,'' scoffed Effros. ``We're in
the middle of vigorous competition. We happen to think we have a
pretty good mousetrap, but that doesn't mean we should have to give
it to our competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC's chairman, William E. Kennard, is stuck in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has the dual job of protecting consumers as well as
regulating the industry. As telephone, wireless, Internet and cable
technologies meld, though, regulators admit it's tricky to balance
conflicting missions.
</P>
<P>
   At a January discussion with reporters, Kennard stressed:
``We're not here to pick winners or losers. The agency is keeping
its eye on the prize, which is alternative networks that provide
consumers with choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But in coming months, the agency will be faced with key
decisions, including whether phone giants must lease part of their
systems to data delivery companies.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bell companies grumble that they should be unencumbered
in order to compete fairly with cable companies. ``We would just as
soon regulators keep their hands off all of it,'' says BellSouth
Corp.'s chief lobbyist, David J. Markey. ``But if they are going to
regulate us, they should regulate them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also was expected to make recommendations about
whether cable companies need to open their lines to competitors, as
requested by AOL and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers aren't likely to support measures
that meddle with the fast-growing Internet industry. In fact, some
are fed up with the FCC's progress deregulating other segments of
the industry, and there likely will be efforts to restructure the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Rep. Michael G. Oxley, R-Ohio, chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee, both plan legislation that will
downsize the FCC and reduce its regulatory muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, nobody would like better than I to take another
shot at spelling out in clearer terms the intent of the '96 Telecom
Act,'' Oxley said in a statement. ``But we need to stay focused on
the structure and mission of the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration _ most notably Vice President Al Gore
_ has been mum about the act's failings. The administration would
prefer to stress its priority that all Americans have access to the
``information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not as easy as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on upcoming regulatory decisions, the government could
either encourage or discourage investments in poorer, more remote
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard, for example, knows he must revamp the subsidy system
that keeps rural phone rates affordable. And some consumer
advocates fear the nation is on the verge of ``telecom
red-lining,'' where unregulated corporate giants will build private
networks to service only wealthy business or residential customers
in high-density, affluent areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tricky and it's never going to be perfect,'' admitted Tom
Power, a top aide to FCC Chairman Kennard. ``But that's one of our
main concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand today's chaos, you have to revisit the lobbying
frenzy surrounding the passage of the 1996 act. The bloodiest
battles were fought between long-distance giants and regional Bells
over access to each others' voice markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing the act, the world was defined by voice,''
said BellSouth lobbyist Markey. ``And the question was: Who has the
biggest share?''
</P>
<P>
   While local telephone service accounted for the largest domestic
market, at $109.3 billion in 1996, the $86.9 billion long-distance
market was poised to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, regional Bells are allowed into long distance
only after they open local markets to competition. A Merrill Lynch
analysis, written days after the act's passage, predicted that
regional Bells would offer long-distance service in 18 months. But
three years later, not a single Bell company has met a 14-point
checklist to prove they have legitimate competition locally.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, regional Bells still received 97 percent of the local
phone service revenue in 1997, according to the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problems we see every time are hardware and
software problems,'' said Power. Regional Bells ``haven't shown
that competitors are really able to win over and switch
customers,'' Power said.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is coming, though.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, for example, leads the nation with 35 local competitors
assigned numbers to deliver local service. The state is followed by
California, with 28 competitors, including Cox Communications Inc.,
a corporate relative of Cox Newspapers; New York, 27 competitors;
Florida, 25 competitors; and Georgia, 22 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Regional Bells have challenged the rules for local competition
in court, but without much success. In mid-January, the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to consider a case challenging the FCC's
constitutional authority to regulate the Bells. And on Jan. 26, the
high court restored rules that forced the Bells to lease their
networks to rivals at discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   During 1999, Kennard said, he expects to allow at least one Bell
_ probably Bell Atlantic _ into long-distance service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Bells acknowledge that the telecom game has shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the world is defined by data bits, `` said Markey. ``It
could be voice, data or video. But we know that we have a much
smaller share of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The world today includes a lot of things beyond what they were
looking at in the act,'' he said.

 &HT;    AN INTERVIEW WITH BELLSOUTH'S TOP LOBBYIST
 &HT;    With TELECOM. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ BellSouth's top lobbyist David J. Markey gave his
views of the telecommunications wars in an interview with Cox
Newspapers Washington Bureau correspondent Mary Beth Regan.
</P>
<P>
   Markey joined BellSouth in 1985 after serving as president of
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration
under President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will 1999 be a pivotal year for telecom reform?
</P>
<P>
   A: Obviously, the act has taken longer to move along than some
people expected. We're coming up on the third-year anniversary, and
some things happen as a result of three years passing. I think
those deadlines indicate Congress expected some things to have
happened by now.
</P>
<P>
   This year, there's going to be a lot of activity in all sectors.
There's going to be activity on the Hill. There's certainly going
to be continuing activity in the regulatory arena. Obviously, the
marketplace too.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to us that people will say, ``Your markets
aren't open.'' Well, they sure are in there providing a lot of
services. And we sure are competing with them _ particularly in the
business market, and more and more in the residential market.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's at stake for BellSouth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every year seems to be a pivotal year. But if what you mean
is: Will we get out from under some of the current restrictions?
Then, we sure hope so. We're planning on it being a pivotal year in
that we think we're going to be able to convince the (Federal
Communications Commission) that we've met the checklist and we
should be able to compete with long-distance carriers. That's what
we thought the deal was when the act was passed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How has the marketplace changed since 1996?
</P>
<P>
   A: Back when the act was going through, this was pretty much a
battle between the long-distance and the local carrier. Now you're
starting to see Internet companies and computer companies and AOL,
and others, starting to understand that what happens to us has a
real impact on them, because we're the connection to the customers
in most places. These companies are beginning to understand that
putting restrictions on us is holding us back from doing the things
that they want to see _ building broader-band networks to the homes
and offices, so they can sell more of what they want to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will lawmakers or regulators further regulate Internet
access?
</P>
<P>
   A: My point is that they already regulate this. When you talk
about the Internet, you're talking about BellSouth. How do people
get hooked up to AOL? For most people, it's through the phone line.
When you talk about the Internet, you're talking telephone and
telecommunications companies because the Internet won't work
without us. Maybe someday there will be new technology through
satellite operations, but we're not there yet. Today, you've got
two ways to get onto the Internet, through a cable hook-up or
through your phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are companies consistent in their positions on how government
should regulate phone and cable lines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, we think we're consistent. But I don't think that AT&AMP;T
is. AT&AMP;T is saying to regulators, you've got to make the (incumbent
local exchange carriers) do all these things. You've got to
restrict them.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you've got (C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman) saying, ``Oh, don't do that to us. Because if you do that
to us, we won't invest.'' Well, that's what we've been telling the
regulators for years.
</P>
<P>
   With the cable networks that they are buying, AT&AMP;T is saying,
``We don't have any obligation to do what those guys are going.''
</P>
<P>
   We're saying, ``Don't regulate them and don't regulate us.'' We
would just assume the regulators keep their hands off of all of it.
But if they are going to regulate us, we think they ought to
regulate them too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But FCC Chairman Kennard has signaled he is not going to
require cable companies to open their lines, especially in the
AT&AMP;T-TCI merger decision. What's your opinion about that?
</P>
<P>
   A: From his standpoint, I think it's a reasonable stance.
Congress expected the cable companies to be in there competing
against the local telephone companies. Here's an opportunity for
AT&AMP;T to do that, and it makes sense for him to support that merger.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I would think that it would make sense for
him to do things to encourage us to expand and invest in this area.
And we just don't think that what they are coming up with is
anything that's going to encourage us to do the things he wants us
to do (such as installing high-speed phone or fiber-optic lines to
homes). The fact of the matter is, only the local telephone
companies today serve everybody. There are some places you can't
get cable.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Bill Kennard, and you're worried about the have-nots,
the inner city, the rural areas. Who are the only people in
position to serve those folks? We think it's us. So it doesn't make
sense for us to make it harder for us to do that.

   TELECOM REGULATORS FACE KEY DECISIONS THIS YEAR
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications regulators face a handful of key decisions
this year that will shape the landscape of the industry:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET ISSUES: The Federal Communications Commission will
decide what elements of a regional Bell's network must be available
for lease to competitors for data transmission. Bell companies
grumble that this ruling could handicap them in competition with
cable companies. The agency also will decide whether calls to the
Internet are local or long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   LONG DISTANCE: Three Bell companies are vying to be the first to
offer long-distance service. Right now, Bell Atlantic is the
favorite, expected to get state and federal approval to offer
service in New York. That ruling likely will pave the way for
BellSouth's Georgia bid.
</P>
<P>
   SUBSIDY REFORM: Regulators will begin to revamp the pricing
structure for local service. Today, analysts estimate that $20
billion in price-distorting subsidies exist in the $100 billion
local market. For example, some residential users pay only half the
real cost of basic service.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR MERGERS: By mid-1999, the agency will rule on three
mega-mergers expected to reshape the industry. They are
SBC-Ameritech, Bell Atlantic-GTE and AT&AMP;T-TCI. Collectively, these
mergers involve two-thirds of the local phone industry, half the
long-distance industry and one-third of the cable industry.

 &HT;    AN INTERVIEW WITH SBC'S LOBBYIST
 &HT;    With TELECOM. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ SBC Telecommunications Inc.'s lobbyist to the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Dale ``Zeke'' Robertson,
gave his views of the telecommunications wars in an interview with
Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau correspondent Mary Beth Regan.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson joined SBC's Washington office in 1997 after serving
as president of SBC's Telmex operations. He began his career in
1967 with Southwestern Bell in Lubbock, Tex.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has the 1996 Telecom Act been effective?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, there's an incredible amount of activity in the
marketplace today. And technology is just exploding.
</P>
<P>
   In general, I think the act is pro-competition, pro-universal
service. And it's got a pro-consumer tone. It was set up so that
the long-distance companies should be able to do local and cable;
the local companies should do long-distance and cable, and the
cable companies should be able to do local and long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that it was to remove barriers that had
historically been classifications of different companies.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it was moving from a rigid regulatory environment to
one where the marketplace would dictate who the winners are, with
the provision that you need to protect universal services.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has it worked?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since then, it seems the regulatory agencies, primarily FCC
and the state regulatory bodies, have been mired in the arbitration
of competitive interests between companies.
</P>
<P>
   But we believe that the third anniversary marks not an end but a
change in the paradigm from that time when it was litigious,
dividing companies.
</P>
<P>
   And we are looking forward to when the commission is going to
start looking at the services as opposed to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   At some point at time, we hope the regulators will come to the
conclusion that they should regulate the service, not the company.
Then you may have someone that gripes about it. But the regulator
can say the rules are the same for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The FCC has indicated it may allow telephone companies to
deliver data services through separate subsidiaries. Do you support
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on how it is done. If what they come out with is
restrictive, highly separative, it will force costs into the
operation. And that's going to minimize broadband deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The more freedoms you have to use your existing resources, to
share various things, while keeping it a pure accounting of it, the
greater the deployment is going to be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your view of the current battle between telephone and
cable companies for high-speed Internet access?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, portions of your company, Cox Cable, are offering
bundled services in Orange County, Calif. and other places. And
they are going at it with a cable modem. We have to respond. We
have to find some way to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of issues underlying this, such as universal
service. But the bottom line is: Technology and the capability of
having an innovative provider say to the consumer: ``I know you
want faster Internet service, I know you want programming,
television, local phone service _ I've got a deal for you'' means
we have to respond. We simply want the ability to stay in the
market as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: FCC Chairman Kennard has indicated that the FCC will look
favorably on the ATT-TCI merger. What's your position on that?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is an attitude that seems indicative of my first point
about arbitrating competitive interests. As a competitor of this
huge new enterprise, I would say I should have the same privileges,
and no more obligations, than my biggest competitor. Its doesn't
seem logical that we would have two huge, well-capitalized,
consumer-oriented companies _ one having an obligation to do
something that impacts it so negatively, and the other one not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How will SBC position itself against an AT&AMP;T-TCI?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, that's our concern. But how do you fight that?
</P>
<P>
   We've been very critical of the implementation of the act up to
this point. And we have said that there has been some unfair
treatment. But it's our vision that there will be handful of five
or six companies that will have international reach and good
domestic coverage. We fully expect to be one of them. And our
Ameritech merger is the first step.

CLINTON SENDS A VALENTINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Playing traditional politics, President Clinton is
thanking his core constituency of women and middle-class families
for their political support, with tax goodies in his budget for
them and a new initiative to strengthen equal pay laws for women.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't say it's gratitude that drives him to emphasize
economic issues that especially impact those groups, but he doesn't
have to do so.
</P>
<P>
   We all get it _ except those Republicans who still can't figure
out why voters haven't deserted him in large numbers over the
Monica Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP clings to the theory that the public will yet turn
against him, despite polls that have shown consistently high
favorable ratings for his job performance and low ratings for
congressional handling of the Monica show.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the Republicans don't understand why women have
not demanded his removal out of anger for the disdain and lack of
respect for their gender they feel is evident in his affair with a
young White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The gender gap persists despite the scandal: Women vote
Democratic in a larger proportion than men vote Republican. The
1998 election produced a gender gap of 13 points. Other surveys
indicate that similar majorities of men and women opposed the House
impeachment of the president, do not want him dumped from office
and think that he is doing a good job, despite his personal faults.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is shameless in pandering to his constituencies, and
it works. This is, after all, how politics is supposed to function.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is that the Republicans have been slow to accept the
reality that a large segment of the country actually likes Clinton
and likes his policies even more. Predictably, they found
unacceptable his budget proposals and his legislative Valentine to
women aimed at closing the pay gap between men's and women's wages.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Paul, chairman of the Georgia Republican party, offered
some frank advice on that subject to his party in the New York
Times recently.
</P>
<P>
   Paul counseled the GOP to ``forget macroeconomics.'' The GOP's
insistence upon broad across-the-board tax cuts that benefit the
rich more than the middle class cannot compete for sex appeal with
the president's narrowly targeted cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to setting aside much of the budget surplus for
Social Security, Clinton's tax breaks would go for items like
education expenses, child care and long-term care for the elderly
and disabled _ specific, easily understood assistance with the
financial problems of many families. By contrast, the GOP cuts
would set aside less for Social Security and put small amounts of
cash in the pockets of everyone but the rich, who would make out
comparatively handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   (A study by the Citizens for Tax Justice _ a liberal group _
found that 62 percent of the benefits of a 10 percent
across-the-board income tax reduction would go to the wealthiest 10
percent of the population. The bottom 60 percent would get less
than 10 percent of the benefits.)
</P>
<P>
   Complaining that the GOP has become ``the party of uptight white
guys,'' Paul also warned his side to ``loosen up'' and become more
likable, conceding that Clinton's empathetic personality had a lot
to do with the public preference for letting him stay in office.
For women, ending wage discrimination can look pretty friendly. On
the average, women make 75 cents to every dollar earned by men.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is having trouble competing with Clinton's agenda in
part because the party can't figure it out. Some criticize
Clinton's proposals as piddling mini-benefits; others complain the
president is attempting another federal power grab, as he was
accused of with his sweeping health care reforms that failed in his
first term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is the budget contains something for everyone and
that's what's troubling,`` huffed Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't offering something for everyone, each to his or her
needs, the way to build a consensus and enrich a country? Good
governing is not about helping the few at the expense of the many.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's multi-faceted budget plan also has goodies for
business, the military, decaying schools and the disabled, just so
that no constituency can claim it was missed. But he would sock it
to the tobacco industry, raising taxes on cigarettes to help pay
for tax cuts elsewhere. Not a lot of pro-smoking votes out there.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the most controversial tax breaks was added
primarily to undermine past Republican criticism of proposed
Democratic-sponsored child care credits. The GOP complained that
such credits encouraged mothers to work rather than stay home as
full-time moms in the traditional family structure.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Clinton wants a tax credit for middle-class women
who stay home.
</P>
<P>
   But this gambit raises a fundamental question of fairness. While
the government is telling welfare mothers they can't stay home with
their children but must go out to work, the proposed tax credit
would reward middle class mothers who stay at home with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Clinton has laid out a public policy agenda that
assumes life will go on as usual in Washington when his impeachment
trial is over. And that while he may be politically crippled, he
can still run circles around the Republicans.

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many uncertainties surround the dining experience,
but one thing is sure. At the end of the meal, the diner, barring a
near nuclear catastrophe, will leave a tip. Last year, American
diners left an estimated $12 billion on the table, at an average of
16.7 percent of the total bill. In Manhattan, the standard tip is
closer to 20 percent at a good restaurant. Regardless of the
amount, the gesture may well be mass delusion.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a tip is a reward for good service. But many
restaurants pool tips _ putting them all into one pot and evenly
dividing them at the end of the night _ which means that the reward
intended for a particular server is shared among many. Under these
circumstances, a tip is a little like a declaration of love
delivered over a public address system.
</P>
<P>
   And in any case, the message may say more about the sender than
the receiver. A tip, social scientists seem to be discovering, has
less to do with the diner's opinion of the service than it has with
his opinion of himself, his need for approval or his desire to
please the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   The tip, in other words, is a puzzle. No one quite knows why
diners tip in the first place, or whether tipping serves any
rational economic purpose. It's not at all clear how the custom
started, for that matter. Even the word itself is of obscure
origin.
</P>
<P>
   The economic argument for tipping is that it gives restaurants
extra managers at no cost. Because a restaurant cannot possibly
monitor its staff as efficiently and accurately as the people being
served, this function has been delegated to diners. Acting as
employers, they assess the performance of the service staff and set
their salary accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a good tip motivates the staff to provide good
service in the present, and the diner who leaves a generous tip
helps ensure good service in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But tipping is not only, or even primarily, an economic
transaction. It is also a social event, and as researchers have
discovered, a very complex one, at times bordering on the perverse.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lynn, an associate professor of consumer behavior at the
Cornell University School of Hotel Administration, has been
studying tipping since 1980, and although he readily admits that
many mysteries remain, one thing is fairly clear: The quality of
service has very little to do with the size of the tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill size allows me to explain 70 percent of the variability
in tip amount,'' he said. ``Less than 2 percent of the variability
can be explained by how the diner rates the service.'' Lynn and
others have found that the social norm of tipping dictates that a
more or less predictable tip will be left, depending on the size of
the bill. ``The primary motivation for tipping is social
approval,'' Lynn said. ``It's expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The peculiarities of the diner-server relationship also confound
the economic model. Researchers have found that in most cases,
diners do not feel that they are judging the waiter, but that the
waiter is judging them. They tip to please.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the tip is a weapon, but as a social scientist
named Leo Crespi found when he studied tipping in the 1940s, ``most
people do not have the requisite nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be an American problem. Some researchers have theorized
that the tip is a way to defuse the anxiety associated with the
unequal server-diner relationship, and a way of fending off envy
and ill will.
</P>
<P>
   In a country dedicated to the principle of social equality, this
anxiety takes an acute form. Indeed, over the years, many social
critics have attacked tipping as an insult to the nation's core
values, a repellent holdover from the days when aristocrats would
fling coins at their servants.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Itching Palm,'' a 1916 screed against the practice,
William R. Scott argued that ``tipping equals flunkyism.''
Flunkyism, the author said, is ``the willingness to be servile for
a consideration,'' and he called it ``democracy's deadliest foe.''
</P>
<P>
   Social unease may be the waiter's friend, however. In one
well-known 1984 experiment, researchers found that a waitress who
touched her customers, whether male or female, on the hand or
shoulder when asking if the meal was all right, raised her tips to
14 percent, from 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sophisticated diners may cringe, but waiter introductions also
put green on the table. So does crouching at the table when taking
an order instead of standing upright; or, if the server is a woman,
putting a smiley face on the bill. For male waiters, the smiley
face actually cuts tips.
</P>
<P>
   Some responses are simply weird. It is well known that
credit-card customers tip more lavishly than cash customers, but
experiments have shown that cash customers who are presented with a
bill on a tray embossed with credit-card logos will leave a larger
tip than cash customers who receive a plain tray.
</P>
<P>
   The waiter does not always win. It is well documented that tip
size decreases with the size of the party, which is why many
restaurants impose a mandatory service charge for groups of six or
more. According to the NPD Group, which does research on consumer
marketing, single diners leave an average tip of 19.7 percent. That
number drops to 16.9 percent for two people, 15.2 percent for
three, 14.9 percent for four and 13.2 percent for five.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have theorized that a phenomenon known as diffusion
of responsibility may account for the downward slide. Just as a
lone witness is more likely to help an accident victim than a
witness who is part of a group, the diner in a group may hold back
a bit on the tip, expecting others to pick up the slack. Or it may
be that diners feel that the amount of attention given to each
member of the party diminishes with the size of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Even if tips were a purely economic message sent from diner to
waiter, the widespread practice of pooling tips jams the signal. In
what is known as a ``pooled house,'' which includes almost all
fine-dining restaurants in New York, a tip does not usually go
directly into the pocket of the waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, all cash and credit-card tips are added up at the end
of the evening and distributed to waiters, runners and busboys
according to a point system. A point is the total tip pool divided
by the total hours worked by the pool participants. Each worker
receives an amount equal to the hours he or she has worked
multiplied by the point amount, or the fraction of a point assigned
to a particular job category.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the simplest sort of pool, if the night's tips add up to
$1,000, and the staff is made up of six waiters and four busboys,
who together worked 50 hours, a point would equal $20. A waiter
working five hours would earn $100. A busboy, paid at a half-point
rate, would pocket $50. Some pools include the bartender,
sommelier, maitre d'hotel and others. If they don't, waiters
normally tip these people, which can take as much as 45 percent of
the waiter's share of the tips.
</P>
<P>
   The mildly socialistic pool system penalizes the outstanding
waiter who is surrounded by average ones, but it also evens out the
injustices of a stingy table, or uneven seating patterns, which can
make one waiter's station more valuable than another's.
</P>
<P>
   In a nonpooled house, seating can become a serious source of
friction, and service can become balkanized, with waiters at one
station refusing to help customers outside their area. In theory,
workers in a pooled house will be eager to help each other, knowing
that better overall service will translate into more money for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Managers do track how much their waiters are being tipped. An
eager-beaver server can expect to get better hours, better tables,
and perhaps a promotion to assistant sommelier or, more rarely,
captain or maitre d'hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the pool system better,'' said Belinda Behne, who has
been a waitress at Gotham Bar and Grill for five years. ``I realize
that the old maverick style of waiter doesn't like it, but the pool
means that no one waiter gets hurt, and you can rely on a steady
income. At a restaurant like Gotham, I want willing help
surrounding me. It takes the pressure off.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, diners could always adopt the visionary scheme
outlined by Crespi half a century ago. Crespi despised tipping,
which he saw as a way for management to avoid paying a fair wage.
He proposed the formation of a National Anti-Tipping League, whose
members would leave, instead of a tip, a printed card explaining
that it was up to the waiter to confront his boss and demand a
living wage. The American people, the card explained, would be
right behind him in this demand for social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the idea never took off. Add a smiley face,
however, and it just might work.

THE ART OF THE POLITICIAN: BOSTON STILLS BUYS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When it comes to rendering fecklessness endearing, no
other scribbler is in the same league as P.G. Wodehouse of
Jeeves-and-Bertie-Wooster fame.
</P>
<P>
   I give you a minor classic, ``The Mating Season,'' where this
pithy portrayal awaits, as fine a definition of woebegone-ness as
there is extant, describing Bertie in the dumps:
</P>
<P>
   ``Few, seeing him, would have recognized in this limp and
shivering chunk of human flotsam the suave, dapper boulevardier of
happier years.''
</P>
<P>
   I cite this as partial explanation for why the Republicans so
hate Bill Clinton. They think he is Bertie Wooster, a charming fool
whose luck has somehow carried him this far, and if only they rough
him up a little more, he'll cave.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The Bill Clinton on display Tuesday in Boston, the
grinning, cheerful, yes, even cocky Bill Clinton, is probably the
most artful politician in the trade today. And it drives his
enemies batty.
</P>
<P>
   The political event that brought Clinton to the Hub was a
love-bombing for Steve Grossman, the Massachusetts Envelope Co.
executive who's wrapping up a much-lauded stint as Democratic
national chairman. The Park Plaza ballroom was stuffed with
long-lunching contributors. And the reception for Clinton was
noticably warmer than the polite but notably restrained greeting he
got last fall when he was in the same room, before largely the same
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One day after Monica's grilling by Republican inquisitors (the
23rd official, sworn, watch-your-step-girl interrogation about what
she and Clinton got up to), with official First Buddy Vernon Jordan
undergoing his own ordeal-by-inquisition in DC, the president
ambled on stage in the company of the wall-to-wall Democratic Party
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   They may want to fry him in Utah, in the Bible Belt, in
precincts far from Friendly Fenway. But Boston still buys Bill,
that was plain. Hand in trouser pockets, text ignored in front of
him, Clinton unrolled an artful political speech, never once
alluding to what the nightly news would undoubtedly lead with.
Monica monopolizes the media.
</P>
<P>
   So Bill trolled his ``save Social Security first'' theme,
keystone of his seventh federal budget, and cornerstone of his plan
to beat the congressional Republicans back into minority. The White
House press corps, on hairtrigger alert for any Monica morsel, had
to be content with a meager crumb, when a pre-recorded Clinton, in
the lavish video tribute to Grossman, noted archly that not since
1822 had the party of a sitting president actually picked up House
seats in the sixth year of his reign.
</P>
<P>
   After that 1822 election, said Bill, ``the other party
disappeared.'' Sly pause. ``We should be so lucky.'' Laughs all
around. Clinton knows he does better in Boston and the Land of the
Bean and the Cod than he does anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have listened to this go on forever,'' he cooed of the
banquet of verbal bouquets tossed from the stage, a surfeit of
political flattery by any standard.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton usually has one good joke in his repertoire, thrown
early, like a seasoned pugilist's first left jab, just to find the
range and tune up the muscles. Tuesday's was his allusion to the
absent and much-wondered about Hillary, an extremely popular figure
with Massachusetts Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   What's on your schedule today, dear? related the president. ``
`Oh, I'm going up there to canonize Steve Grossman.' She said,
`Bill, don't say that _ that's the wrong religion!' ''
</P>
<P>
   He segued skillfully into standard riffs: why the Democrats are
the better party for America (they stand for more ``community''
values than the other guys) and his second-term legislative agenda
(Social Security, Medicaid, spreading the economic boom to the
left-behind, spiffing up the schools). ``This is the best economy
in a decade _ maybe ever,'' he said. ``We will never have a better
opportunity to bring the American Dream to poor people who work
hard. If we don't do it now, we never will.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks would not use that stuff, but it's what draws a lot
of the Democrats' to a rainy-day lunch with a politician that a lot
of America left for dead. Clinton knows which buttons to push, when
and how to push them, and he is simply better at playing music on
the political synthesizer than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, like a lot of the talking heads of D.C., just
don't get it. Just one more jibe, one more smear, one more attack,
and this guy will fold like Bertie Wooster, they figure. He's a
draft-dodging, skirt-chasing, oath-bending wimp, they tell each
other. They reinforce each other's mis-reading of the Clinton
phenomenon. So they wind up punching fog.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what they hurl at Clinton, he never acts like dogmeat.
He never curls up and moans. Somehow he keeps coming back, in the
polls, on your TV screen, in the manner in which he's welcomed, if
not in morals. Bill just keeps slugging away. The majority of
Americans like that part about him. And his enemies hate him for
it. It's been said by many; he's lucky in his choice of enemies.
Then again, maybe it isn't just luck; maybe he plans it that way.
</P>

PUT LOVE OF DESSERT IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Valentine's Day just around the corner, here
is a trio of sweet sensations designed to win the hearts of those
you love. They are bound to earn rave reviews from all who indulge.
</P>
<P>
   The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cup Pie and Raspberry Streusel
Bars are copycat versions of creations sampled at the Corner
Bakery, which recently opened in the new Commons shopping center in
Calabasas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The original Corner Bakery opened its doors alongside Maggiano's
Littly Italy restaurant in Chicago in 1991. Today there are 38
Corner Bakery locations in various cities around the country. The
first California Corner Bakery adjoining a Maggiano's restaurant
opened in the South Coast Plaza complex in Costa Mesa, outside the
mall near Sears, in 1997, and a free-standing Corner Bakery is now
open inside the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cup with its three layers _
chocolate crust, peanut butter filling and brownie on top _ sold at
Corner Bakery is an individual-serving size. Although it was
delicious, I found the crust very hard and difficult to cut through
and eat. At first I thought it was overbaked, but the manager
assured me that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   For ease and convenience, I took the liberty of creating a pie
instead of mini cups _ but with the same layers and basic
ingredients. The pie, which took a couple of tries to perfect, came
out great _ and the taste is close to the original. Also, the crust
in the recipe included here is easier to cut through than the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a colleague was in ecstasy about the Corner Bakery
Raspberry Streusel Bars and tipped me off that they would be great
to duplicate. I couldn't wait to try them. The bars are rich,
sinful and fabulous _ and among the best I've sampled. With their
tender and flaky crust and streusel topping, they are layered with
plenty of raspberry preserves in between.
</P>
<P>
   The replica version is a close facsimile and goes together in a
jiffy with butter, sugar, flour and vanilla. To streamline the
recipe, I used the same mixture for the crust and streusel topping.
After reserving some of the mixture for the topping, I added a
little whipping cream to the remainder to bind it together for the
crust. Use red raspberry preserves with seeds, like the Corner
Bakery does (I prefer Knott's Berry Farm brand). The trick to
keeping the jam from overflowing underneath the crust is to build
the crust at least an inch up the sides of the pan prior to
spreading on the preserves. Make a batch of these for your
sweetheart for Valentine's Day _ you won't be sorry!
</P>
<P>
   The Congo Tart at Tahiti restaurant in Los Angeles is a decadent
ending to any meal. Jackie Ravel Knezevich of BakeAway bakery makes
it for the restaurant and was kind enough to share the recipe,
which I tweaked a bit _ with wonderful results. Again, I opted to
make a single tart rather than individual ones like the restaurant
serves. Present the slices embellished with a scoop of coffee ice
cream and a drizzle of hot fudge sauce _ or simply top with
unsweetened whipped cream spiked with bourbon or rum. Any way you
serve it, it's a winner. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE CUP PIE &QL; 
CRUST: &QL; 
1 1/2 cups crushed Oreo cookie crumbs (put Oreo cookies in a food
processor and process until finely crushed) &QL; 
1/2 cup (4 tablespoons) butter, melted &QL; 
PEANUT BUTTER LAYER: &QL; 
1 cup crunchy peanut butter &QL; 
1/4 cup whipping cream &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1 cup powdered sugar &QL; 
BROWNIE LAYER: &QL; 
1/2 stick (1/4 cup) butter &QL; 
1 square (1 ounce) unsweetened chocolate &QL; 
1/2 cup granulated sugar &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/4 cup flour &QL; 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped nuts
</P>
<P>
   For Crust, in a small bowl, combine cookie crumbs and butter,
mixing well. Press into bottom and up sides of ungreased 9-inch
deep-dish pie plate.
</P>
<P>
   For Peanut Butter Layer, combine all ingredients, mixing until
well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Turn into cookie crust and carefully spread evenly.
</P>
<P>
   For Brownie Layer, in a glass bowl or measure, combine butter
and chocolate. Microwave on high power 45 seconds. Mix well and
microwave 30 to 45 seconds longer until chocolate is melted.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in granulated sugar, egg and vanilla and with a fork, mix
well. Stir in flour until well-mixed. Mix in chocolate chips and
nuts. Carefully spread evenly over peanut butter layer.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes or until
brownie is set. Cool to room temperature before cutting into
slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve slices topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Refrigerate
any leftovers. Makes 8 to 10 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RASPBERRY STREUSEL BARS &QL; 
2 cups flour &QL; 
1 cup sugar &QL; 
1 cup butter (2 sticks), softened slightly and cut into 16 pieces &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons whipping cream &QL; 
1 cup red raspberry preserves with seeds!off!
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl of food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine
flour and sugar and process briefly to mix. Add butter pieces and
vanilla and process a few seconds, until mixture is crumbly and
there are many pieces the size of large peas. Do not overprocess.
Remove 1 2/3 cups of mixture and set aside to use for streusel
topping.
</P>
<P>
   To mixture remaining in food processor bowl, add whipping cream
and process until mixture holds together. Press into bottom and
1-inch up sides of a buttered 8-inch square baking pan. Carefully
spread preserves evenly over bottom of crust (NOT up sides).
Sprinkle top with reserved streusel mixture, pressing lightly into
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes or until top
and edges are golden. Cool thoroughly before cutting into 9 large
squares. Store in refrigerator if not eating within a day. Makes 9
large raspberry bars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONGO TART &QL; 
1 refrigerated pie crust (1/2 of a 15-ounce package) OR pastry for
a single crust pie &QL; 
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/3 cup sugar &QL; 
1/8 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/3 cup light corn syrup &QL; 
2 teaspoons flour &QL; 
1/2 cup whole, lightly toasted macadamia nuts &QL; 
1/2 cup lightly toasted pecans &QL; 
1/2 cup lightly toasted walnuts &QL; 
1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut &QL; 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips!off!
</P>
<P>
   Unfold pie crust and turn into an ungreased 9-inch fluted tart
pan with a removable bottom. Carefully press into bottom and up
sides. Line with foil, pressing into crust lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 450-degree oven 5 minutes. Remove foil and
continue baking 4 minutes more. Remove from oven.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a small pan or skillet, melt butter over medium
heat. Cook until butter browns, watching carefully. Do not burn.
Strain butter and cool. In a medium bowl, whisk together butter,
egg, sugar, salt, vanilla and corn syrup until light. Whisk in
flour, mixing until well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in nuts, coconut and chocolate chips. Turn filling into
prebaked crust, spreading carefully and evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 325-degree oven about 35 to 40 minutes or
until set (cover edges of crust with pieces of foil if they begin
to overbrown). Cool to room temperature. Serve warm or chill until
serving time. Serve slices topped with a dollop of whipped cream or
a scoop of coffee ice cream drizzled with hot fudge sauce. Makes 8
servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Use any combination of nuts desired; just be sure to use 1
1/2 cups nuts total in recipe. &QL;

REMEMBERING THE DAY THE MUSIC DIED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
BEHIND THE MUSIC: THE DAY THE MUSIC DIED 
On: VH1, Time: 9 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rock music has been shaken by many end-of-innocence moments,
from the premature deaths of John Lennon and Janis Joplin to the
apparent suicide of Kurt Cobain. But the very first of these
watershed events was 40 years ago today (Jan. 3) when Buddy Holly,
Ritchie Valens, and the Big Bopper died in a plane crash after
their Winter Dance Party concert at the Surf Ballroom in Clear
Lake, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``The Day the Music Died,'' a line from Don McLean's 1972
tribute song, ``American Pie,'' and now the title of a
gut-wrenching documentary Tuesday night on VH1 as part of its
``Behind the Music'' series. The 90-minute program is at 9 p.m. and
will be rebroadcast twice Sunday night at 9 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, it's the finest, most detailed look that
television has ever paid the event. The night of the crash is
brought back in vivid detail _ it was ``a real up night, everybody
was rocking,'' says Waylon Jennings, who was Holly's bassist _ and
then it was ``just like the lights were turned out,'' says Peggy
Sue Gerron, for whom Holly wrote the hit ``Peggy Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was incalculable. Holly was 22 years old and Valens
only 17 (the Big Bopper, born Jiles Perry Richardson, was 28).
Holly was on tour because he needed the money for his family _
remember, these were not days when rock stars were typically
wealthy, since they had to battle record companies and promoters
for every dime. Valens was on tour because he wanted to meet Holly,
one of rock's pioneers. The Big Bopper was there because he needed
money for his wife and unborn child, who grew up to be Jay
Richardson. The son is interviewed here extensively and talks about
dealing with the memory of a father he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your daddy was a good ol' boy and a hell of a crapshooter,''
Jennings tells him. It's a welcome moment of levity, but the
overriding theme is of a catharsis that wasn't fully experienced at
the time by many family members and friends. ``We were told not to
cry,'' says Valens's sister, Connie. ``There weren't many people to
hold us.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most unforgettable anecdotes, actor Lou Diamond
Phillips, who portrayed Valens in the movie ``La Bamba,'' describes
how a tearful Connie hugged him during the taping of the film and
said, ``Ritchie, why did you have to go?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of stories to tell,'' says Gay Rosenthal, who
produced the documentary for VH1. ``Most of the `Behind the Music'
shows are about one artist. This is about three, so you had to
think, `How much of the back story do we tell?' For Buddy Holly,
you could do a whole show on him alone. The same with Ritchie
Valens. It was very challenging, and believe me, we had a lot of
roundtable discussions about it. We must have mapped out the show
in 15 different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The stitching together of the stories is done remarkably well,
relying mostly on interviews because there's a paucity of live
footage from that era. There is just a clip of Holly on ``The Ed
Sullivan Show'' (and a short home movie of him and his Texas band
the Crickets with motorcycles), a clip of the Big Bopper doing his
hit ``Chantilly Lace,'' and some home movie footage of Valens with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary also explains what motivated these artists to
get on the single-engine plane that took off in a snowstorm. The
Big Bopper had the flu and asked to take Jennings's place in the
small four-seat craft. Holly wanted to get to the next concert site
(Moorhead, Minn.) early to do laundry. And they all wanted to duck
the hideous bus ride through the cold. The bus had already broken
down on the tour. Eerily, Jennings says Holly joked that night, ``I
hope your bus freezes,'' to which Jennings replied, ``I hope your
plane crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never a week goes by that I don't think about'' that night,
says Jennings, who went on to sell millions of records in a
successful country-music career.
</P>
<P>
   Other insightful interviews come from Donna Ludwig Fox (the
subject of Valens's hit, ``Donna,'' and now the mother of five
children); Holly's brother, Travis; actor Gary Busey (who starred
in ``The Buddy Holly Story''; and McLean, who sings a solo acoustic
version of ``American Pie.'' The only conspicuous absentee is
Holly's widow, Maria Elena, who wanted to be paid for her
interview, says Rosenthal, which is against VH1's policy.
</P>
<P>
   As for the crash itself, authorities blamed it on ``pilot
error.'' Wildly apocryphal theories have ensued _ that the pilot
(also killed in the crash) was drunk or that someone on board
brandished a gun that accidentally went off and killed the pilot _
but the show addresses none of them. The main reason offered is
that the crash occurred because of a severe snowstorm. Forty years
later, no one is quite sure.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the tour continued the next night with Jennings
singing Holly's songs. It's a testament to the heartlessness of
that era's promoters that the deaths of three stars didn't merit
one day of mourning.

AFTER THE PULITZER IS THE PRESSURE: NOW WHAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Feb. 7) 
(bl) 
By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Winning a Pulitzer Prize can mean many
things. First and foremost is the recipient's sense of justice, and
for Paula Vogel, 47, who won the prize for drama last year, the
moment was especially sweet: she had been rejected not only by the
Yale School of Drama but also by the prestigious Eugene O'Neill
Playwrights Conference _ 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   The play for which she won the Pulitzer, ``How I Learned to
Drive,'' about the incestuous relationship between a girl and her
uncle, had a successful run off-Broadway and was the most produced
new play in America last year, with 26 regional productions.
Another 34 are scheduled for Canada and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Along with justice comes adulation, which is in full evidence
here at Brown University, where Ms. Vogel has taught for 14 years
and was until recently the director of its graduate program in
playwriting. She stepped down to become an ad hoc professor in
order to concentrate on her writing. As she modestly puts it, ``I
had a lot of irons in the fire, and after the Pulitzer they all
heated up.''
</P>
<P>
   On this particular evening, she has entered a cocktail party but
makes only snail's progress past the door; the arms and hands of
professors and administrators reach toward her in a group grope for
luck and fame. She is flushed and happy, warm and gracious to each
person, to whom she devotes her full attention. She never looks
past a shoulder to scope a new arrival. She is not an air kisser.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side to the adulation is envy, and along with the
theater, academia has its own expert backbiters. After a few
drinks, one history professor opines of Ms. Vogel's new play, ``The
Mineola Twins,'' which will open Feb. 18 at the Roundabout Theater
in New York, that when it was done here in Providence last year by
the Trinity Rep, he found it only ``all right.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the circle is complete. Along with winners everywhere,
Ms. Vogel can expect to face people free to sniff, ``She won a
Pulitzer and  &UR; this &LR;  is the best she can do?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel smiles at the scenario. ``I'd probably agree with
them,'' she says evenly. ``I don't take myself very seriously. It's
very nice that I won, but it still feels like a fluke. I wrote
`Mineola Twins' before `How I Learned to Drive,' and I wanted it
produced first, the comedy before the tragedy. It didn't happen
that way, so what I'm concentrating on now is having a terrific
time.''
</P>
<P>
   She is speaking at the Brown Faculty Club, settled in a patch of
winter sunlight, working her way through a tray of crudites. She
has the round merry face of a snowman come to life and the
reassuring bulk of a mom, dressed stylishly in black pants and a
chenille top. She spends an inordinate amount of time worrying
about whether people have eaten or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to have a meal, I always invite a student and
order enough for three or four,'' she says. ``I learned this in
graduate school from two department chairs I won't name. One would
have a Christmas party with Triscuits and cheese, the other had
entire roasted turkeys and hams. At the time I was on food stamps
and he would always have too much and say, `You have to take it
home.' It made me weep.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing that sense of home to the theater has been Ms. Vogel's
way for decades; since her first successful play, ``The Baltimore
Waltz'' _ a surreal take on her brother Carl's death from AIDS,
produced by the Circle Repertory Theater in 1992 _ she has had more
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the real pushes for me as an educator is to promote
theater as a haven,'' she says. ``It's an instinct now. I can tell
when kids are having a bad time and I tell them: `Theater can
change your life. Theater can save your life. It's a safe
addiction. Why be addicted to drugs if you can be addicted to
theater'?
</P>
<P>
   ``For so many years I couldn't get in the door as a playwright,
and when I got the chance at the Brown job, I felt that maybe here
I could devise a program for all the other exceptions to the rule,
those people who were too quirky, too strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mantello, the director of ``The Mineola Twins,'' first met
Ms. Vogel when he acted in ``The Baltimore Waltz.'' ``When I went
to audition, I read it and said, `I have no idea what this is _
it's a mess,''' he recalls. ``What happens with Paula's plays is
that on the first read you think it's unstageable, unactable, but
when the words hit the air, an alchemy takes place. The play as
literature is completely different than the play alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mineola Twins'' is a comic epic history of women from the
1950s to the 1990s. Ms. Vogel uses twins to represent the division
in America between the political right and left; both are played by
Swoosie Kurtz. (The original title was ``Minnesota Twins,'' which
she realized sounded too much like baseball; she chose Mineola, on
New York's Long Island, for its ``white suburban'' appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The play walks a line,'' Ms. Vogel says. ``And I am nervous
about it. In this and in `Drive' I chose the conceit of
big-breasted women because female playwrights are not allowed to do
comedy. I find Borscht Belt humor funny, but what happens when a
woman does it? There are boxes in the contemporary theater: `That's
a David Mamet play, or a Nicky Silver play.' We have the ability to
embrace prodigal sons who critique society, critique the fathers.
If you want to be a funny woman, though, you go into stand-up, and
then it becomes about individual neuroses on display, not about
criticizing society.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel feels she has plenty to criticize. ``I have been
extremely upset at the Republican right taking over our
government,'' she says. ``So, I thought, OK, let's go back to the
'50s, with its quintessential combination of comedy and terror. As
a culture then, we went into science fiction, invaders from Mars,
instead of looking at those who were invading us from within. There
were communists and queers and also Roy Cohn and Joe McCarthy. We
used our fear of aliens to mask our terror at what was at the heart
of America. In terms of theatricality, I chose the image of twins
that war: Jacob and Esau, a blood hatred between them. It's where
we are emotionally as a country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel has never shied away from controversy in her work,
having written about incest, AIDS, gay parenting (``And Baby Makes
Seven'') and prostitution (``The Oldest Profession''). She laughs.
``My nephews and godchildren ask me, `When can I see one of your
plays?' And I say, `When you're 30.' I started thinking, `I've got
to write something the family can see while I'm still alive.'''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she is collaborating with Molly Smith, her college
friend from Catholic University, now the artistic director of Arena
Stage in Washington, on a musical-theater piece, ``A Civil War
Christmas,'' for the year 2000. It was Ms. Smith, in her capacity
as artistic director of the Perseverance Theater in Juneau, Alaska,
who had given Ms. Vogel an artistic home to develop both ``How I
Learned to Drive'' and ``The Mineola Twins.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel's alliance with Arena Stage is a homecoming of sorts.
She was born in Washington in 1951 and grew up in various Maryland
suburbs. Her parents divorced when she was 11. ``Divorce was hard
to talk about back then,'' she says. ``It was a huge scandal. Kids
at school would say: `My parents won't let me play with you
anymore. You come from a broken home.' It was a very painful
adjustment.'' What made it even more so was that her eldest
brother, Mark, went to live with their father, an advertising
copywriter, and Ms. Vogel and her brother Carl stayed with their
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's second wife didn't want me around,'' Ms. Vogel
says. ``And my mother didn't want me seeing my father. It was a
very bad rupture. The night he left, I stayed up all night
weeping.'' Her face grows red. ``There is a grief and a loss at
that age that is equal to death.''
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps because of her torn childhood that Ms. Vogel was
able, as Ms. Smith says, ``to become fearless as a writer, spanning
genres, going to subjects that are often taboo. She takes us to the
place of nightmares, yet in such a gentle way, we go with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel's mother worked as a secretary, and her children went
for long stretches without support from their father. ``We were
living on the brink,'' Ms. Vogel recalls. But Carl took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the divorce, Carl overnight said, `I'm her father,'''
Ms. Vogel continues. ``It was heartbreaking. He was 13 years old.
Neither of my parents had gone to college, but Carl decided that we
would. In a working-class family, college is extremely alien. It's
almost as if you are leaving your class and repudiating your
family. Carl would meet me every night to ask what I was learning
in school. Taking me in hand became his project. He literally said,
`Here are the colleges where I want you to apply.' We were below
the poverty level, so I needed a scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   She got one to Bryn Mawr, but stayed only two years before the
school decided that her concentration in dramatic literature was,
she says, ``not academically valid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My scholarship was cut back to the point where I could no
longer afford it,'' she says. She transferred to Catholic
University in Washington, from which she graduated before doing
graduate work at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Carl, meanwhile, graduated from Johns Hopkins and went to the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville for his doctorate in
English literature. It was the early '70s, Ms. Vogel says, and ``he
was a member of the SDS'' _ Students for a Democratic Society _
``and a gay activist. He was beaten up, blacklisted by faculty. I
had said, `Carl, don't do this, don't go there.' Finally one day he
called me. His apartment had been ransacked, his paintings slashed.
He left there a broken man. Both he and I thought that he'd be the
writer in the family. But he wouldn't write anymore. He became a
librarian.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl died in 1988. ``AIDS never hurt my brother as much as the
homophobia,'' Ms. Vogel says. ``AIDS only killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Vogel was encouraged in her writing by her teachers,
starting in the sixth grade, she says, she always avoided it in
deference to Carl. ``He was the one who was really smart and a
writer,'' she says, ``so I thought that becoming a playwright was
not competing with his short stories and poems. It was my way of
saying he's the brain and I'm the anti-intellectual in the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her inclination to take on difficult topics and themes,
she says: ``At 25 I could tell you exactly why I chose the plays I
chose and what they meant and why. Now, it's instinctual. The
images just come to me. It's all submerged, subconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only as an adult, Ms. Vogel says, that she became
reacquainted with her brother Mark during Carl's illness. ``I
watched his incredible generosity when my brother was dying,'' she
recalls. ``He had no fear of Carl's sexuality or mine, or the AIDS.
At a gut level I felt he was a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   It was harder for her mother to deal with her daughter's
sexuality. ``She was Catholic, from New Orleans,'' Ms. Vogel says.
``She used to ask me: `Do you have to say  &UR; lesbian &LR; ? People aren't
going to get to know you and love you if you say that.''' Ms. Vogel
smiles and shakes her head. ``When `How I Learned to Drive' opened,
I called her and said: `Brace yourself. I'm in Out magazine.' She
did the best she could with it. My father, on the other hand, was a
Jewish New Yorker. When we finally got together to take care of
Carl, we sat down and, over many cognacs, told each other all the
affairs we both had had. He was cool about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father died in September 1997, her mother the following
January. ``She never remarried,'' Ms. Vogel says. ``She kept her
animosity alive for 30 years. Molly Smith said, `She just couldn't
be without your father.'''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Ms. Vogel has considered becoming a mother
herself, but her partner for the last decade, Anne Fausto-Sterling,
a professor of biology at Brown and the author of the well-known
book ``The Myth of Gender,'' was not enthusiastic. Ms. Vogel made
her peace with it. ``By teaching, I get to mother other people's
children,'' she says. She also has her godchildren, the sons of her
best friend, who are now 15 and 21. ``She always told me, `My kids
are your kids.' That helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, she is far too busy for children, working on at
least 10 new projects, including the screenplay of ``How I Learned
to Drive'' for the director Fred Schepisi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lucky woman right now,'' she says. ``I'm also going to
write a novel called `Travels Without Charlie.' After Carl died I
took a trip to the Deep South because I've always been scared of
it. I went to a lot of women's bars and spent a couple of days
getting stories about how people live down there. I've been
carrying the stories, waiting to write about them. It's a way to
process grief on Carl. I can't do that in a play. Plays are in the
present tense. At the beginning of `Baltimore Waltz,' Carl is
alive. In rehearsal rooms and on stages all over the country people
are saying: `Carl is a librarian. Carl likes his rabbit.' The death
occurs at the end, but the next evening he's alive again at 8. You
have to start a novel using the past tense. It's a reflection of
life lived in the past. I'm going to have to say, `Carl died.'
`Carl used to.'''
</P>
<P>
   She sighs. ``I weep every day about him,'' she says. ``I still
write for him. There's something in every play. After I wrote
`Drive,' people said that the relationship I had with Carl in
`Baltimore Waltz' also seemed incestuous. I recognize that, only in
that we were each other's beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my mother at the hospital,'' she goes on, ``while
he was dying. She said to him, `What a shame you won't live long
enough to see your sister a success.' And he said, `I did.'''

`THE INSIDER'S GUIDE TO SAKE': DEMYSTIFYING A BREW AND A RITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sake is largely a mystery in the West, even to many experienced
diners. They may know that this fermented rice liquor from Japan is
served hot or cold, but little more. For them, ``The Insider's
Guide to Sake'' (Kodansha, $14.95) by Philip Harper will be a
revelation. This small, slim book is packed with useful information
on every page _ and even on the inside flaps.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who is originally from Britain, knows sake like no other
Westerner. Not simply because he has lived in Japan for 11 years,
but also because he works in a sake brewery, a rarity for a
non-Japanese. He has come firsthand to understand the brewing
traditions, the subtleties of production and the varieties of rice
used.
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with a brief history, touching on milestones
like the creation of a brewery in the Imperial Palace in the year
689 and the first sale of bottled sake in the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   Harper explains how sake is graded (when it is made from highly
polished rice, it is finer and has a higher grade) and how it is
brewed. Brewing is a craft and, like other crafts, has many
different styles. He tells how to spot the ingredient list on the
bottle and gives a tip: The fewer the ingredients, the higher the
grade.
</P>
<P>
   The information is clear and thorough, but what saves the book
from being too encyclopedic is Harper's anecdotes. For example, he
tells how, at the height of a brewing season, when he and his
fellow brewers were working round the clock, he became so exhausted
that he fell asleep riding his bicycle home and rode right into a
cold river. Though Harper is amusing, he also gets across how
grueling the sake-making tradition is.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than offering sketchy reviews of the nearly 2,000 types
of sake, he gives thorough tasting notes on more than 100, many of
them available in the United States. These notes make sake come to
life. It is as dynamic as wine _ one sake may be acidic, the next
creamy or flowery. Two of Harper's favorite breweries are Kamo
Izumi and Daruma Masamune.
</P>
<P>
   He provides addresses and telephone numbers for breweries in
Japan that can be visited, as well as retailers, distributors and
bars around the world, and even sake sites on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm doesn't stop there. Sprinkled throughout the book
is an A-to-Z selection of sake trivia and general information. You
learn, for example, that water is as crucial an ingredient in sake
as rice, and that Miyamizu water from the Nada region is the most
prized. And that in Japan, sake, which has a higher alcohol content
than wine, is sold in vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has done much research and, despite being so close to the
industry, has managed to write a lively, clear guide to a subject
just waiting to be discovered by the West.

V-22 OSPREY HEADS TO SEA AS MARINES WORK TO ENSURE AIRCRAFT IS
SHIPSHAPE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn. Tx., Pa.) 
(Accompanied by BC-V22-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c. Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS SAIPAN _ After months of testing on land, the
Marine Corps version of the V-22 Osprey is getting its sea legs
aboard the USS Saipan, a huge amphibious assault ship designed to
deliver Marines quickly to hostile shores.
</P>
<P>
   In sea trials that began in mid-January, a team of more than 100
Marine and Navy personnel has been evaluating the tilt-rotor
aircraft's test flights off the Saipan's deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey, developed jointly by Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort
Worth and Boeing Helicopters of Ridley Township, Pa., was designed
as a troop transport for the Marines. It has been tested at the
Naval Air Warfare Center at Patuxent River, Md. Now, the goal is to
find out how well the aircraft performs in the brisk, cold winds of
the Atlantic off the Virginia coast.
</P>
<P>
   Marine pilots fly daily sorties in the V-22, testing it in
situations that can't be simulated on land.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, they said, is how the aircraft performs
close to the Saipan's deck. The pilots put it into hover mode at a
range of heights, for example, to determine how its powerful prop
wash affects the work of crew members on the deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just operating the airplane from the ship is an advantage,''
said Marine Lt. Col. John Rudzis, who is in charge of this phase of
testing. ``The best we can do at Pax River is draw lines on the
deck (ground) and try to simulate moving the airplane around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines plan to use the V-22 as an amphibious assault
aircraft, capable of moving troops from ship to shore much faster
than the lumbering CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters now in service. The
Osprey can use its twin rotors to take off and hover like a
helicopter and then, by tilting them forward, cruise like a
turboprop plane.
</P>
<P>
   During the sea trials, the Osprey has taken off and landed on
all 10 landing pads on the Saipan's deck, which is larger than two
football fields, as evaluators watch how it performs in high winds
and rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance crews have been looking for any mechanical problems
that might crop up in a more demanding environment. They also must
examine how easily the V-22 can be maintained. They log every
detail, even the speed at which the aircraft can be backed onto the
carrier's elevator and lowered below deck for service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also will be assessing how well maintainers and the
aircraft interact with the ship and support equipment they will be
using,'' said Staff Sgt. Tony Huntington, a V-22 crew chief. He
added that the Marines are also looking for any sign that saltwater
or corrosion could pose problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a challenging test period,'' Huntington said. ``The
things that are easy to handle on land, such as engine washing or
refueling, will be increasingly difficult on a ship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marine pilots testing the Osprey aboard the Saipan are eager
to see the V-22 available for use in such trouble spots as the
Persian Gulf region and central Europe. They now transport troops
into harm's way with the Vietnam-vintage CH-46s, which were
developed in the 1950s and have an average age of 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us an obvious and tremendous advantage,'' said Marine
Maj. William Witzig, who has logged more than 200 hours in an
Osprey cockpit. ``It can go faster and farther than the helicopters
we fly now. It will change the way we operate forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Witzig is taking part in this first portion of a two-phase
testing program for the Osprey.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines normally have 12 CH-46s assigned to each assault
ship, such as the Saipan, based in Norfolk, Va. But beginning in
2003, when the first 12-aircraft squadron of V-22s is to become
operational, the Boeing-built choppers will be replaced with
Ospreys.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines have ordered 473 of the $30 million aircraft, and
the Air Force's Special Operations Command has ordered 50, all to
be built over 18 years, according to Bell. The company is also
trying to sell the tilt-rotor to foreign military.
</P>
<P>
   An Osprey can carry six more Marines than a CH-46, a total of 24
combat soldiers. It can fly twice as far and twice as fast as the
Sea Knight, which means the time it takes to put troops ashore will
be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Mike Nowakowski, who commands the Saipan, said he has been
impressed with the Osprey during its sea trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to take an aircraft that can fly tremendous
distances will give the Marines a capability they don't have right
now,'' he said. ``Operations from the sea and power projection
ashore will be greatly enhanced as a result of this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the testing program, designated as
``developmental,'' is to continue until mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the developmental testing program we are continuing to
tweak the system,'' said Rudzis, the lieutenant colonel in charge
of the sea trials. ``But there are no major design changes needed.
The airplane is really ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of tests, called ``operational,'' is to begin
in the fall. The two phases of testing will result in a report,
which will recommend whether production of the tilt-rotor should
continue or be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job will be to be the honest brokers,'' Marine Lt. Col.
Keith Sweaney said. ``If the baby's ugly, we're the people that are
supposed to call the baby ugly.''

   The New Avengers of women warn that if President Clinton is not
convicted of cheating and lying it will mean open season on sexual
harassment in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   They say if feminists let the Philanderer-in-Chief get away with

   At the very most he will be banished from office.
</P>
<P>
   Either way he will be remembered, even by those who think he was
a good president, for not being a very nice man.
</P>
<P>
   That's not getting away with anything.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe that what transpired between Monica Lewinsky and
the president was sexual harassment, he did not get away with it.
If you believe it was wink-wink don't tell consentual sex, he
didn't get away with that either.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was operating under the old rules, that if you have
power you get to take what you want, but he got caught under the
new rules which is you can't get away with it. With his head bowed
and his lip chewed he is the poster boy for the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens to Clinton now, sexual harassment is not
going to be OK again.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, this whole sordid mess should be sending a clear message
not to mess around.
</P>
<P>
   Any man or woman executive who ever thought their job came with
hands-on privileges should be thinking again.
</P>
<P>
   Any employee who thinks putting out for the boss is a good way
to get ahead needs also to think again. Monica Lewinsky didn't get
away with anything either.
</P>
<P>
   The country has had a yearlong workshop in sexual harassment and
while we still don't have full agreement on what it is or isn't,
the discussion has been worthwhile. We're getting smart on this.
We're not going back to those days when men get to cop a feel in
the elevator and women have to put up with it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no pleading ignorance anymore on the subject. People
are on alert. It's part of employee training manuals. It's against
company policy. You can go on the Internet and read state-by-state
laws on harassment. You can also learn how to file a complaint
against a false accusation.
</P>
<P>
   It's a loathsome way to get educated but it's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The New Avengers of women will say that if you don't support
full thrashing for Clinton you can't call yourself a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   Why? He hasn't taken away gender equality. In fact he's been a
good learning tool. For those who ever thought their work status
gave them groping rights what happened in the Oval Office has got
to be the Big Daddy of all Turn-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can be disappointed with someone and still not want
him hanged.
</P>
<P>
   The New Avengers imply that the president sets a bad example and
that men, unchecked, will revert to thinking every woman is up for
grabs. That's pretty patronizing. As well as insulting to men.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old boys notion that young women are there to decorate
the office and to rub up against. I don't think there are many
jerks like that left.
</P>
<P>
   And it's an old girls idea that you can play bimbo with the boss
and get promoted. Monica aside, the majority of women, for some
time now, have been relying on their resumes and not thong
underwear to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Even if someone was operating under the old rules they'd be out
of their mind to try it now. Because whether he walks or not, the
Clinton example is that if you dare to mess around someone will
tell. She will tell her friends and they will tell your enemies and
you'll end up looking more pathetic than studly.
</P>
<P>
   Even your friends will call you a rat, including the ones who've
also transgressed. And your wife? She may stand beside you, but she
will look strong and assured and you will look like a train wreck.
</P>
<P>
   For those women still operating under the old girls' rules, the
Lewinsky example shows that no matter who came on to whom first,
you will be treated like a tramp. They will blame you, call you a
schemer, a stalker and fat.
</P>
<P>
   Better to advance your career the new fashioned way. Be better
than your boss.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is going to become history, sooner or later, one way or
another. But so is sexual harassment. That's because we have laws
and we have new sensibilities and because most people in need of
five minutes of gratification would rather go get a candy bar.

TV NOTES: FOX FALLS SHORT OF SUPER EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Lift for Fox, With a Misstep  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl is always kind to the network that owns it, and
this year it lifted Fox to parity with NBC as the leader, for the
moment at least, among the 18-to-49-year-old viewers craved by
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Fox's Sunday night was surely less super than the
network had hoped. The game itself was down 10 percent from last
year _ attributable to a less-than-thrilling matchup and a game
that was worse.
</P>
<P>
   And Fox hoped its premiere of ``Family Guy'' would do better
than it did as the night's Super Bowl postscript entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The show got a 12.6 rating, which is good, but nowhere near the
19.7 that NBC scored after last year's game with an episode of its
fading comedy ``Third Rock From the Sun.'' Two years before that
NBC followed the game with an episode of a hot series, ``Friends,''
and broke off a huge gain: a 29.6 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The main culprit Sunday was Fox's inexplicably long postgame
show. Though the show followed a game with no suspense and few
story lines, Fox let it run 37 minutes, 7 minutes longer than NBC's
last year, which followed what many people called the best Super
Bowl ever. That meant ``Family Guy'' did not get on the air until
nearly 10:30 in the East.
</P>
<P>
   The special episode of ``The Simpsons'' that followed was thus
shoved almost entirely out of prime time. It drew an 11.6 rating.
(Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives still expressed enthusiasm about the power of the
Super Bowl, and it has indeed moved an organization once dismissed
by an NBC executive as ``the coat-hanger network'' into that
first-place tie with NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox went into the season with both the Super Bowl and the
World Series, while NBC went into battle without them and without
``Seinfeld.'' That had to inspire a whisper of hope inside Fox that
it could overtake NBC.
</P>
<P>
   With no gigantic sports event the rest of the season and NBC's
having revived a bit thanks to its midseason hit ``Providence,''
Fox may have caught up to NBC this week only to find it does not
have a finishing kick left to win the race.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Fox does hope to put some dents in NBC in the rating
sweep month that starts Thursday night. Fox has a full slate of its
trademark down-and-dirty video specials ready to rope in all those
male viewers who deserted NBC in droves in November.
</P>
<P>
   Among this month's titles: ``World's Medical Oddities,''
``Shocking Behavior Caught on Tape'' and one sure-fire new entry,
``Cheating Spouses.''

   Cutting a Long Swath
</P>
<P>
   Comedians come and comedians go, jokes sizzle and evaporate. But
George Carlin seems to be an exception. He apparently has an
unlimited shelf life.
</P>
<P>
   That is what HBO thinks. On Saturday the network will broadcast
his 11th HBO stand-up special live at the Beacon Theater in New
York, setting the HBO record. And this is a network that prides
itself on offering the latest in cutting-edge (and blue-language)
comedy. But executives there say Carlin, at age 61, is exactly
that.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting-edge, to Carlin, does not mean topical. He has a few
jokes about President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, he said in an
interview Monday, but generally avoids topical humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to throw it away too soon,'' he said. ``I'm thrifty
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding new taboos to break, he said, is hard. The latest?
``Children, and religion,'' he said. ``I have some really good
full-bore attacks on both in this show.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite his image as a jaunty, foulmouthed, nose-thumbing
crank, Carlin describes himself as ``obsessive and perfectionist.''
He rewrites repeatedly until he has the language of his show
exactly as he wants it, and then performs it exactly as written. He
has hundreds of files where he has saved virtually every
provocative, funny or simply oddball thought that has occurred to
him. He still does 150 stand-up dates a year.
</P>
<P>
   His work habits are what gives HBO executives the confidence to
keep scheduling specials for him every few years, since the first
one in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done the most, and he will always have done the most,''
said Nancy Geller, vice president for original programming at HBO,
who specializes in comedy and has helped start the careers of Bill
Maher and Chris Rock, among others. ``It's the only thing carried
on our production report constantly: Carlin, Show. Only the number
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he doesn't perform No. 11 until this weekend, Carlin
said he had already written No. 12, scheduled for HBO in 2001.

   Matthew Shepard's Parents
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Matthew Shepard, the young man slain in Wyoming
in what has become the nation's most publicized incident of
anti-gay violence, will speak to Katie Couric on Friday on NBC's
``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Couric said she wrote the Shepards a letter of condolence
after the murder of their son, and her producer, Lorie Beecher,
stayed in touch with the couple until they agreed to do the
interview two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so impressed with them,'' Ms. Couric said in a telephone
interview Tuesday. ``They are down-the-middle, level-headed people.
They're just two grieving parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Couric said that in the interview the Shepards steer clear
of commenting on the two men accused of killing their son, though
she said that Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, ``is clearly
extremely angry.'' She said that the couple also decline to involve
themselves in a movement for hate-crime legislation that has grown
up around the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are uncomfortable with their son being used in
any political agenda,'' Ms. Couric said. ``I don't think they want
him to be the reason for hate-crime legislation. They are not
immersing themselves in the politics of this. I felt they just
wanted to portray Matt as a normal young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Couric said the Shepards did speak to her about learning
that their son was gay. ``I think they had had an inkling for a
while,'' she said. ``Upset is too strong a word for their reaction.
I think they were still taken aback.''
</P>
<P>
   The interview, which will be unusually long for a magazine
program at about 13 minutes, will also be excerpted on Ms. Couric's
``Today'' show Friday morning.

   Shared Favorites
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1996, ``Monday Night Football'' on ABC was the
only prime-time television program among the 20 favorite shows of
both black and nonblack households, according to an analyst who
studies viewing habits for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But in his latest quarterly survey of viewing habits by race,
Steve Sternberg of TN Media, a firm that advises advertisers on
buying television commercial time, found that six shows now rank on
the Top 20 list for both blacks and nonblack households, for the
fourth quarter of 1998. They are ``ER'' (NBC), ``Monday Night
Football'' (ABC) and ``NYPD Blue'' (ABC), and three from CBS, all
on Sunday night: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Touched by an Angel'' and ``The
CBS Sunday Movie.''

FOR TV CHEF YAN, SIMPLE IS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ring in the Chinese Year of the Rabbit with a
feast of creations by Martin Yan, that fun-loving and entertaining
master of public television's cooking show ``Yan Can Cook'' who is
out to demystify Chinese cuisine. The celebration begins Feb. 16
and continues for 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades (and 1,500 shows), Yan has brought
Asian culture and cooking into homes throughout this country. Now
he has compiled his favorite dishes in ``Martin Yan's Feast: The
Best of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay Books; $34.95). It features 200
creations he has been making for years, along with 75 new recipes.
All have been updated and designed for contemporary cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are looking for something fast, quick, healthy
and delicious,'' emphasized Yan during a telephone interview from
his San Mateo home. ``Nobody _ not even the Chinese _ wants to make
Peking Tea-Smoked Duck at home. Very few people want to spend lots
of time (two or three hours) cooking. I've maintained the integrity
and philosophy of the cuisine but made it more accessible to the
general public.''
</P>
<P>
   For a shortcut, Yan recommends using cut-up vegetable
ingredients from a supermarket salad bar and beef, pork or chicken
strips from the meat section. It's also feasible to use
store-bought prepared stir-fry, kung pao or other sauces instead of
making your own.
</P>
<P>
   Yan has also combined cooking steps to streamline his recipes.
For instance, he avoids water blanching vegetables or poaching
meat, each separately, prior to cooking them in a wok. Instead he
cooks the meat in the wok first, removes it and then stir-fries the
veggies, adds the sauce and returns the meat to the pan. Often, he
adds vegetables to pork or chicken in the wok when the meat is 80
percent cooked and then finishes off the dish. Yan also avoids long
ingredient lists, keeping them to a manageable eight to 12 items
when possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yan also pays close attention to presentation,
using modern plates and arranging the food like works of art to
make the dishes look interesting. In the book, as in his television
shows, he tries to encourage and excite _ not intimidate _ his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese home cooking is basically very down to earth,'' he
said. ``We're doing everyday cuisine _ homey, comfort food. The
dish itself is simple _ the way you present the dish is what makes
it appetizing. Cooking isn't just about getting the right answer.
It's also one of life's greatest pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his memories of the Chinese New Year in China,
Yan, who was born in the Year of the Monkey (the Chinese zodiac,
centered around 12 animals, is believed to determine the
personality and fortune of those born during each animal's
respective year), delved into his truly unfortunate growing up
years in China in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much food or much to eat,'' he recalled, adding
that before he was 13, the Chinese New Year was almost nonexistent
for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chinese New Year he actually celebrated _ with
firecrackers, carnivals and different foods _ was in Hong Kong, he
noted, where he went to apprentice in an uncle's restaurant shortly
after his 13th birthday. ``It was just like Christmastime in the
U.S.,'' he recalled, but added, ``The Chinese New Year is more into
celebration and food symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Chinatown during the celebration, he noted, you'll
find tangerines, pomelos and red envelopes (which are filled with
money and given to children and single people to wish them good
luck and good fortune) in the stores. Restaurants feature special
menus with foods such as black moss (a hairlike seaweed which is
tasteless but quite expensive and is used in dishes to bring good
fortune) and dried oysters (to wish people good business and good
fortune).
</P>
<P>
   Lettuce wraps are also served. Lettuce symbolizes giving birth
and wealth and riches. The filling is usually dried oysters. Fish
is traditionally served for Chinese New Year, as is something
stuffed with mushrooms. During this time, the Chinese eat round
cookies, which are a symbol of coins and money.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of his new book includes Yan's reflections on
the road his life has taken in China, Hong Kong, Canada and
California (including the University of California, Davis, where he
earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in food science and met
his wife, Susan). In addition to recipes, the book also includes
technique information and a guide to ingredients. It makes for some
interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who resides in San Mateo with his wife and 6{-year-old twin
sons, believes in cooking healthy food _ lots of fish, vegetables
and tofu _ for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also eat a lot of pasta and noodles. My sons love to eat
raw tofu with soy sauce,'' said Yan, adding that they also like
chili garlic sauce and hot and spicy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cook what you enjoy _ experiment, be passionate and
adventurous,'' advised Yan. ``And always try a dish before you say,
`No.' Food is a reflection of one's life. You have to eat every day
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
MINCED POULT &LR; R &UR; Y WITH WALNUTS IN LETTUCE CUPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my version of a favorite banquet dish that's often
served on festive occasions as a symbol of longevity. The crisp,
chilled lettuce makes a wonderful contrast to the warm filling, and
the sweetness of the hoisin sauce marries all the flavors.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
6 dried black mushrooms &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 cup walnuts &QL; 
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken, turkey OR duck &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon minced ginger &QL; 
1 small carrot, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 small zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 cup diced water chestnuts OR jicama &QL; 
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine OR dry sherry &QL; 
1 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
Hoisin sauce &QL; 
12 small iceberg lettuce cups!off!
</P>
<P>
   Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20
minutes; drain, reserving 1/4 cup of soaking liquid. Discard stems
and chop caps.
</P>
<P>
   Spread walnuts in a pie pan. Toast in preheated 350-degree oven,
stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Let nuts cool, then coarsely chop.
</P>
<P>
   Cut chicken into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in a bowl with
oyster-flavored sauce; stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry 1 minute. Add
carrot, zucchini and water chestnuts; stir-fry 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Add reserved mushroom soaking liquid; cook until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Add wine and sesame oil; cook until
heated through. Add walnuts and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread hoisin sauce on a lettuce cup, spoon in some of
chicken mixture, wrap in lettuce cup and eat out of hand. Makes 4
to 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
WATERCRESS SOUP WITH CRAB &LR;  &QL; 
``This is a popular Cantonese treat, yet ironically watercress is
not of Chinese origin. It was brought to China by Western traders,
and over the centuries it has found a perfect home in Chinese
cuisine, as in this savory seafood broth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
2 teaspoons cornstarch &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
SOUP MIXTURE: &QL; 
1/4 pound cooked crab meat, flaked &QL; 
2 teaspoons vegetable oil &QL; 
3 slices ginger, EACH the size of a quarter, lightly crushed &QL; 
4 cups chicken broth &QL; 
1 cup water &QL; 
1 bunch watercress (about 3/4 pound), coarse stems trimmed &QL; 
1/2 cup sliced carrots &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Marinade ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add crab meat and stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. &QL; 
Place a 2-quart pan over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add crab meat and stir-fry 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Add watercress and
carrots. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. &QL; 
Stir in sesame oil and pepper. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
MANGO BEEF &LR;  &QL; 
``Like many Hong Kong-trained chefs, I love to combine the flavors
of meat and fresh fruit. Here, it's a case of meat meets mango in a
sizzling sweet-and-savory stir-fry. If you can't find mangoes, you
can substitute pears or peaches.'' &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon cornstarch &QL; 
BEEF MIXTURE: &QL; 
3/4 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes &QL; 
1 ripe mango (about 1 pound) OR pear &QL; 
1 large Granny Smith OR other tart apple &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon minced ginger &QL; 
1/4 cup diced red bell pepper &QL; 
2 tablespoons plum sauce &QL; 
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine OR dry sherry &QL; 
2 teaspoons soy sauce &QL; 
1/4 cup whole macadamia nuts OR blanched almonds &QL; 
1/2 fresh jalapeno chile, sliced!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Marinade ingredients in a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add beef and stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes &QL; 
Peel mango and cut flesh from pit; cut flesh into 3/4-inch cubes.
Peel and core apple; cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add 1 1/2 tablespoons
vegetable oil, swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook,
stirring, until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add beef and stir-fry
until no longer pink, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Remove meat from wok.
</P>
<P>
   Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil to wok, swirling to
coat sides. Add mango, apple and red pepper; stir-fry 2 minutes.
Return meat to wok and add plum sauce, wine and soy sauce. Cook
until heated through. Add nuts and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Place on a serving plate and garnish with chile slices. Makes 4
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
CHICKEN AND SEAFOOD TRIO IN A BASKET &LR;  &QL; 
``This delicate stir-fry will be a hit, if you serve it in a
deep-fried edible basket.'' &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 pound asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch lengths &QL; 
1/2 pound mixed seafood (firm white fish fillets, scallops and
shrimp) &QL; 
1/4 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast &QL; 
1 tablespoon cornstarch &QL; 
1 egg white &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL;

1 tablespoon fish sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved in 2 teaspoons water &QL; 
Edible Baskets!off!

tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Drain.
</P>
<P>
   Cut seafood into 1/2-inch cubes. Cut chicken into 1/2-inch
cubes. Coat seafood and chicken with cornstarch, egg white, salt
and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add oil, swirling to coat
sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 10
seconds. Add seafood, chicken and green onion; stir-fry 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth, oyster-flavored sauce and fish sauce; bring to a
boil. Add cornstarch solution and cook, stirring, until sauce boils
and thickens. Add asparagus and toss to mix.
</P>
<P>
   Spoon seafood mixture into 4 Edible Baskets. Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   EDIBLE BASKETS: To make EACH edible basket, you need 2 (6-inch)
metal strainers. In a wok, heat vegetable oil for deep-frying to
350-degrees F. Peel and shred OR finely julienne 1 medium potato
(taro root OR cooked fresh egg noodles also can be used).
</P>
<P>
   Rinse shredded potato under cold running water; squeeze well to
remove as much moisture as possible and pat dry with paper towels.
Toss potato with 1 teaspoon cornstarch.
</P>
<P>
   Dip strainers into hot oil to coat them. Line 1 strainer with
potato to a thickness of about 3/8-inch. Nest second strainer on
top, and immerse strainers in oil. Deep-fry until golden brown.
Remove potato basket and drain on paper towels. Use immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 basket. Repeat 3 more times to make 4 baskets. &QL;

1/2 cantaloupe OR 1/4 honeydew melon &QL; 
1 grapefruit &QL; 
1/4 cup thinly sliced sweet pickled ginger &QL; 
1 medium carrot, shredded &QL; 
1/4 pound (3-inch wedge) jicama, shredded &QL; 
1 tablespoon sesame seeds &QL; 
6 ounces salmon fillet &QL; 
6 ounces firm white fish fillet, such as sea bass &QL; 
1 tablespoon lime juice &QL;

TOMATO BEEF FRIED RICE &QL; 
``Fried rice provides an easy way to convert bits of leftovers into
a quick snack or one-dish meal. There are no strict guidelines for
the embellishments, but you must start with cold cooked rice so the

   ORGAN-MUSIC (New York) _ Western music has generally moved far
from its origins in plainsong and other kinds of religious chant,
but one instrument, the organ, has never been able to heave itself
out of the church. Taking place in church, organ music has to
behave with a certain respect, and few composers have been able to
maintain that posture for long. Bach, of course, was one. The only
other outstanding example is the French composer Olivier Messiaen,
whose complete organ works are to be played in six concerts at
Riverside Church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan by the
American organist Jon Gillock, starting on Tuesday. By Paul
Griffiths. Photo. &QL;

   DEATH-OF-SALESMAN-REVIVAL (Undated) _ A half century after its
premiere, ``Death of a Salesman'' has become an American classic _
a perennial produced around the world, from Baltimore to Beijing,
and routinely taught in high school English classes and mounted in
community theaters. The play has become an institution, part of the
accepted theater canon, and today even boasts its own website
(www.deathofasalesman.com), where, in an ironic twist on its
central theme, you will be able to purchase souvenirs. The new
production of the Goodman Theater's ``Salesman'' will open
Wednesday at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Broadway _ 50 years to
the day from the play's 1949 world premiere. By Michiko Kakutani.

   OSCAR-SUPPORT-NOMINATIONS (Undated) _ Robert Rehme, president of
the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, says
``the supporting categories are very arbitrary. There is a book of
rules, but they don't really mean anything. The nominations are
based largely on where the studios and the actors' representatives
choose to place them.'' By Michele Willens.

<P>
   SUNDANCE-FILMS-ADS (Park City, Utah) _ Where else but in Park
City in late January would a 7-year-old girl be handing out Satanic
postcards on Main Street? Her name was Kathleen and what she was
doing, she said sweetly, was helping to advertise a film made by a
friend of her family's. She was one more sign of how anything goes
during the Sundance Film Festival, and of how desperate anyone who
has a film there is liable to be. By Janet Maslin.

   OKLAHOMA-REVIVAL (Undated) _ Despite the downpours of a British
summer, it was a ``beautiful morning' '' for the choreographer
Susan Stroman when she woke to the enthusiastic reviews of the
revival of ``Oklahoma!'' at the Royal National Theater in London
last July. Almost everyone declared that the show really deserved
its exclamation mark and that Ms. Stroman, a two-time Tony Award
winner, was a prime participant in making this new version a hit.

<P>
   VOGEL-DRAMA-PRIZE (Providence, R.I.) _ Winning a Pulitzer Prize
can mean many things. First and foremost is the recipient's sense
of justice, and for Paula Vogel, 47, who won the prize for drama
last year, the moment was especially sweet: not only had she been
rejected by the Yale School of Drama; she had also been turned away
by the prestigious Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference _ 12
times. The play for which she won the Pulitzer, ``How I Learned to
Drive,'' about the incestuous relationship between a girl and her
uncle, had a successful run Off Broadway and was the most produced
new play in America last year, with 26 regional productions. By
Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   OUR-YOUTH-THEATER (New York) _ The play, ``This Is Our Youth,''
a dark comedy by Kenneth Lonergan, which reopens Sunday night at
the Douglas Fairbanks Theater on Theater Row, follows three
post-adolescents on the Upper West Side through a bungled cocaine
deal. As bleak as that synopsis sounds, the play's warm heart lies
in the awkward romance of Warren Straub and Jessica Goldman: he, a
pot-smoking toy collector with an abusive father, and she, a
teen-age philosopher with a jaded view of love. By Jesse McKinley.

   MUSEUM-MONTEVERDI-MUSIC (Undated) _ Only princes spoil guests
like this. To an exhibition of rare splendors at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, we may, for one night only, add enchantments for the
ear. The show in question is ``Dosso Dossi: Court Painter in
Ferrara,'' on view through March 28. The complementary concert,
``Monteverdi and His Contemporaries: Music and Poetry of the Late
Renaissance,'' on Friday evening, features the glamorous Italian
soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci in her New York debut, with
instrumentalists of the early-music group Accademia Bizantina of
Ravenna. By Matthew Gurewitsch.

<P>
   COUNTRY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The country boom of the early 90s has
leveled off, and now, to regain the momemtum, country has to figure
out _ again _ what it is. Recent albums by Trisha Yearwood and Alan
Jackson, point in a promising direction. The two singers grew up
within 100 miles of one another in Georgia, and their careers have
spanned the ups and downs of country this decade. Perhap's that's
why Ms. Yearwood's ``Where Your Road Leads'' (MCA 70023) and
Jackson's ``High Mileage'' (Arista 07822-18864-Z) sidestep the
confusion. They rely on an almost classical sense of country form
that still leaves room for innovation. By James Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTRIC-MILES (Undated) _ Critics and musicians have come to
regard the electric Miles Davis as remarkably prescient of forms
like trip-hop and electronica. Last year, Bill Laswell's remix of
the electric Miles, ``Panthalassa,'' was released to wide acclaim.
The Fender Rhodes electric piano, first introduced by Miles on his
stunning 1968 album, ``Filles de Kilimanjaro,'' has been heard in
decidedly Milesian arrangements on recent albums by the
saxophonists Greg Osby and Mark Turner. Wada Leo Smith and Henry
Kaiser's ``Yo Miles!'' (Shanachie 5046) is notable for being the
only homage to the electric Miles among recent album-length
tributes to the trumpeter. By Adam Shatz.

   EAST-GERMANY-PHOTOGS (Boston) _ Most Americans probably have
very little idea how East Germans, for instance, saw themselves, or
how their culture asked them to. Some insight can be gained from
``Recollecting a Culture: Photography and the Evolution of a
Socialist Esthetic in East Germany,'' a show of more than 120
photographs at the Photographic Resource Center at Boston
University through Feb. 19. The photographs are from Fotografie,
one of the two state-sanctioned photographic magazines in the
German Democratic Republic (GDR) after World War II; it was
published in East Germany from 1947 on. By Vicki Goldberg.

bubble for television reviewers everywhere. It gets the Golden
Local Double-Thumps-Up or the National Platinum Five-Star A-Plus in
everything from The Denver Post to Elle to The New Yorker. By Jeff

<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PEOPLES-VASE-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ About 20 years ago, Floyd
Whitley, a glass collector and retired oil executive from Houston
went to an auction in Kansas City, Mo., to buy a rare vase. Called
a Peoples vase by collectors, it was amethyst-colored and depicted
dancers celebrating the harvest. Made between 1909 and 1911, the
vase is only one of five known to exist. ``I paid $5,000 for that
vase, which had sold for $250 in the 60s, and everyone in the
auction room wanted to give me a Breathalyzer test,'' he said. But
those who thought Whitley foolhardy were wrong. Last fall, he sold
the vase to a private collector for $50,000. On April 24, at an
auction in Kansas City, 250 items from Whitley's collection are
expected to fetch more than $250,000. By Elisabeth Hayt. Photo.

HEY, IS THAT SOMMELIER OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph Hersom, the sommelier at Le Cirque 2000, was
holding forth on wine on a recent afternoon. ``Some of these wines
are like a hot stock,'' he said. ``What blew me away was Flowers
Chardonnay. It's creamy-slash-buttery but not overly,'' he
continued about this 1996 California vintage. ``You know,
everything is in its place.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hersom sounds more like a young Wall Street trader than one
of the city's top sommeliers, there's a reason: He's only 28. And
even if Hersom doesn't look or act the part _ he doesn't wear a
tastevin around his neck or a scowl on his face _ he is in charge
of one of the largest and most prestigious wine lists in New York
City. He talks about his 700 selections with as much zip and
enthusiasm as he uses moving around the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Hersom is not an anomaly. Suddenly it seems that every
restaurant with an ounce of ambition has a sommelier, and the
sommelier is often very young _ even in the best places. The
sommeliers at Cafe Boulud, Jean Georges, Peacock Alley, Le
Bernardin and Union Pacific are all under 31, a few of them barely
past the legal drinking age. Others may not be as young, but they
are just as new to the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their spontaneity in making us discover new things is more
interesting than their knowledge,'' said Daniel Boulud, the chef at
Daniel and Cafe Boulud, who hired a 25-year-old as sommelier at the
cafe. ``And I think the young sommeliers have less barriers than
the old sommeliers.''
</P>
<P>
   This baby-faced generation is helping to bury the image of the
snooty, aloof wine know-it-all and infusing life into a
traditionally stodgy profession. They approach wine drinking like
missionaries, determined to convert every diner into an open-minded
wine drinker. They enjoy discovering wines from unexpected places
and little-known vineyards, and like wines that don't necessarily
break the bank.
</P>
<P>
   And they do more than just coddle diners through their ordering.
They have to shape the wine list, making it both unique and
cohesive, and buy wine for years to come; these decisions can be
both difficult and risky. Hersom, for instance, has ordered about
$250,000 of 1995 Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, the few sommeliers in New York were found
almost exclusively in French restaurants. They had formal European
training and created rigidly classic wine lists. Now, restaurants
of all scales and cuisines are developing wine programs. Over the
last five years, the membership of the Sommelier Society of America
has almost doubled, from 175 to more than 300.
</P>
<P>
   The profession has grown at a time when American diners have
become increasingly savvy about wine and all the nuances it has to
offer. Rejecting their timid days of chardonnay and merlot,
restaurant goers now scan wine lists for the esoteric _ the
rieslings, cabernet francs and zinfandels.
</P>
<P>
   A sommelier's enthusiasm, however, cannot always make up for
inexperience. Many wine servers, especially those at more modest
restaurants with new wine programs, find themselves on edge day
after day as they try to keep pace with the surging demands of the
dining public.
</P>
<P>
   When Gina Yoshida, a manager at Novita, started buying wines for
this northern Italian restaurant in Manhattan, she recalled, she
was very much in the dark. ``I had people give me advice on wines
that `worked well' and were `popular' and `you should have on the
list,''' she said. ``And I didn't really know why.''
</P>
<P>
   She made a lot of mistakes. But some were lucky. ``I
accidentally bought a lot of good wines,'' she said. ``I remember
having Caymus cabernet on the list for a price that was
ridiculously low, and someone from the Four Seasons kept coming for
it.'' After having his fill, he finally clued her in. She has since
gone to wine school.
</P>
<P>
   The job of sommelier or wine director is still not a standard
position in expensive restaurants. It pays well: Sommeliers can
earn from $50,000 to $100,000, including tips, said Albert
Verdesca, the chairman of the Sommelier Society of America. Many
restaurants, instead, depend on a manager to buy the wines and the
table staff to answer questions from diners, make suggestions and
serve the wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just bluff and point to the wines that you knew and
people would like,'' recalled Glen Goodwin, a server at Bolo. Which
means that on a wine list with 100 wines, the servers would push
just a small percentage and the rest would be left for the diners
who knew. Now, Goodwin said, diners are more knowledgeable and
servers can't get away with that so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, sommeliers and servers must face customers with many
more years' tasting experience. ``I've learned in the past few
years that it's better to keep your mouth shut than say the wrong
thing,'' said Michael Greenlee, 28, the sommelier at Peacock Alley.
</P>
<P>
   This naivete on the floors of great restaurants leaves some
wary. ``The savvy and the savoir-faire that you want to have as a
sommelier takes many more years,'' said Barbara Petroske, a former
member of the Sommelier Society of America and the owner of BP
Marketing, a menu-editing company in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Many of today's leading young sommeliers, like Greenlee, are
quick studies. He got an early start, while in college, serving
wine at the Hyatt hotel in Columbus, Ohio (there he could serve
alcohol at 19). Though he never went to wine school, he worked at a
string of top restaurants including Spiaggia in Chicago, the Four
Seasons Hotel in Manhattan and Le Cirque 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since starting at Peacock Alley seven months ago, he has
increased the wine list from 275 labels to 400 and has even added
his own stamp, bulking up the American representation on a firmly
French list.
</P>
<P>
   And it is their lists that often set these top new sommeliers
apart from their peers. Union Pacific's sommelier, Urs Kaufmann,
31, also has a list with signature touches. He is known for
interesting and obscure German varietals, like gruener veltliner
and muscat d'Alsace. Alexander Adlgasser, 31, at Jean Georges,
specializes in Alsatian and Austrian wines.
</P>
<P>
   Wine lovers have been soaking it up. Greenlee has won a
dedicated following who come more for the wine than the food. So
has Hersom. Many regulars do not even ask for the wine list: He
simply makes his suggestions and reminds them what they drank the
last time they were in. The day of the celebrity sommelier to match
the celebrity chef may not be far off.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   These young stars, though, still admit to having moments of
fear. ``I was completely scared when I got here,'' said Stephen
Beckta, 25, the sommelier at Cafe Boulud, who is from a small town
near Ottawa. ``I went through a two-year sommelier program back
home, but the level of dining, the education level of my customers
here is so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up with the public and getting a solid education is not
easy. Sommeliers and servers who learn on the job may get to know
the restaurant's wine list intimately but may still not make the
sophisticated varietal connections.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the only way to get this big picture is to take
courses. But unlike culinary education, for which there are
accredited schools and recognizable degrees, wine education is a
haphazard process at best.
</P>
<P>
   There are certification courses offered at organizations like
the International Wine Center and the Sommelier Society of America,
both in Manhattan, but no single course can cover the vast world of
wine. And more advanced courses take years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated professional students must read in their spare time
and go to as many wine tastings as possible. Many latch on to a
mentor at a good restaurant for a few years before going out on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, some restaurateurs have realized that a good
wine program is a two-way street and have begun making efforts to
educate their staff. Stephen Loffredo, an owner of Zoe and Cena,
has been one of the most progressive. He organizes formal
twice-a-month tastings and seminars on everything from ports and
pinot noirs to sales techniques. Union Square Cafe has staff
tastings daily.
</P>
<P>
   The American Sommelier Association, a newly formed national
organization, has been making an effort to develop a uniform
certification curriculum to be taught throughout the United States.
Its first course is beginning this month in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate prize for many sommeliers is the Master Sommelier
certification awarded by the Court of Master Sommeliers in London.
Because this takes years to attain, many prepare while working in
the business. At Veritas, for instance, of the four sommeliers on
staff, three are pursuing the certification.
</P>
<P>
   Any experienced sommelier, though, eventually comes to terms
with the fact that learning about wine is a never-ending process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of have to get Zen with the idea that this is the
nature of this beast,'' said Karen King, 44, the wine director at
Union Square Cafe. ``You can never sit back, because every year
there is something new.'' More grapes grow and a new vintage is
born, but there will never be time to taste every wine.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the relative youngsters ruling the top dining rooms
around the city _ though they may have gaps in their wine knowledge
that will take years to fill _ are wise beyond their years in
understanding the pleasures of wine.
</P>
<P>
   They make a wine list feel like a ticket to adventure rather
than an IQ test. They are only too happy to describe wines to you,
to tell you about the wine maker or to steer you gently in a new
direction. At a recent dinner at Cafe Boulud, when a diner was
firmly thinking Northern Italy, Beckta persuaded her to try a 1997
Cave Spring Indian Summer riesling. From Canada.

 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just about every company has one:
</P>
<P>
   The manager who disparages the ``girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The rainmaker whose profit-making genius endears him or her to
the president even though the rainmaker is a boor.
</P>
<P>
   The politically astute charmer who picks a powerless target to
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The solidly entrenched employee who maligns or belittles
coworkers, spreads rumors, or takes credit for colleagues' ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the people who churn rumors and spread gossip,
people who tell tales (almost always untrue) about workers and
peers they dislike or mistrust,'' says John Challenger, president
of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a Chicago outplacement firm.
``They are often super confident and attractive people who engage
in subtle and not-so-subtle character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   People churners are workplace bullies who wreak havoc on morale
but are rarely fired because they are valuable to a company's
bottom line, say experts. Instead, the bullying boss or coworker
tends to drive talented staff away.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of job insecurity, wage stagnation, and layoffs,
bullying has become a serious workplace problem _ one that has
prompted new research on the psychological and physical toll of
emotional brow-beating and has spawned Web sites specifically aimed
at helping victims of such abuse.
</P>
<P>
   One example: San Francisco writer Daniel Levine. His Web site
(www.disgruntled.com) includes a chat room, a collection of monthly
articles, and first-person stories by targets of workplace
bullying. Levine's new book, ``Disgruntled: The Darker Side of the
World of Work,'' (1998, Penguin-Putnam, $12), is a compilation of
stories gleaned from the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1998 study, the International Labour Organization noted
that psychological aggression and bullying were the most frequently
reported complaints among US employees. Meanwhile, social
psychologist Loraleigh Keashly, director of dispute resolution at
Wayne State University, reports in a new study of 147 health care
workers that 82 percent have experienced some form of aggression
from coworkers or supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many workers never report it and tend to internalize their
anger. As a result, a once loyal employee no longer gives 100
percent of his time. In more extreme cases, a worker may steal
information, vandalize company property, sabotage projects, or
explode in anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is very subtle,'' says Gary Namie, coauthor of the
book, ``Bullyproof Yourself at Work: Personal Strategies to
Recognize &AMP; Stop the Hurt from Harassment,'' ($13.95, DoubleDoc
Press, Benicia, Calif.). ``These people can be extremely cruel.
There are bosses, for example, who punish by giving lousy work
assignments. We know of a supervisor at a southwestern university
who assigned the staffers she did not like to unairconditioned
areas, where the temperatures were more than 100 degrees in the
middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Most bullies thrive on divide and conquer, in which the
aggressor quietly and carefully aligns a team of people against one
person he or she has singled out. ``He or she actually says, `You
don't want to be on that person's side because he's going down the
tubes,''' says Namie.
</P>
<P>
   Not all bullies are bosses. Consider, for example, the cliquish
coworkers who deliberately ignore a member of their unit; the
employee who whispers or giggles at the approach of a colleague;
and the ``friend'' who collects highly personal information and
then launches a smear campaign. Remember Linda Tripp?
</P>
<P>
   David Yamada, an associate professor of law at Suffolk
University who is researching the legal protections available to
targets of workplace bullies, says the most obvious protections
involve antidiscrimination laws. While more and more employees are
filing hostile work environment lawsuits, the jury is still out on
their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rhonda Manthe, 31, filed a complaint with the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination after a series of
run-ins with her boss at the Marlborough, Mass. division of
Miami-based Ryder System Inc. She alleged that she was bullied and
discriminated against. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Manthe claimed the situation worsened when she returned to work
after a maternity leave. ``He told me and other people that my
hours would be 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, and then he
changed them twice. He voided my phone card, and changed the locks
in the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I worked 2 1/2 weeks,'' she says, ``I was told I'd have
to work five weeks without pay because he felt I'd taken too much
maternity leave. I checked the records and found out that I had
not. I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Yancey, Ryder's equal employment opportunity officer,
disputes Manthe's story. ``She made some allegations, and we
investigated them, but we did not find them to be true,'' says
Yancey, who noted that the company offered to transfer Manthe to
another unit in Marlborough, but the former company manager
refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not corroborate any of her allegations, and since she
refused a position in the area, we decided to offer her four weeks'
severance pay. We mailed the severance agreement to her, but she
has not responded.''
</P>
<P>
   With discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuits rising, many
US employers are relying on coaches to rehabilitate executive
bullies. Psychologist David Francis, founder of EAP Systems Inc. in
Woburn, Mass., uses videotapes, role playing, and counseling to
turn problem executives into sociable human beings. The cost?
$12,000 for a six-month session.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Francis notes that success is often tied to
company support. ``For coaching to work, someone in the company,
someone at a very high level, must perceive that the individual has
a problem,'' he says. ``And usually, with bullies, that problem is
turnover.''

WHITE HOUSE AIDE TO TESTIFY ON CLINTON COMMENTS ABOUT LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A stellar intellect to his friends and ``Sid
Vicious'' to his detractors, White House speechwriter and media
adviser Sidney Blumenthal goes before House prosecutors and White
House lawyers Wednesday as the last of three Senate impeachment
trial witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   In summoning Blumenthal, House Republican prosecutors are
looking to bolster their case against President Clinton on the
second impeachment article accusing him of obstructing justice. One
example was Clinton allegedly giving aides a false account of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky so they would repeat it to the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a conversation Blumenthal had with President Clinton
on Jan. 21, 1998, the day the Monica Lewinsky story broke in the
Washington Post. On that day, Clinton told Blumenthal that the
former White House intern ``came at me and made a sexual demand on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In grand jury testimony on June 4, Blumenthal said Clinton told
him that he rebuffed Lewinsky and quoted the president as saying:
``I've gone down that road before. I've caused pain for a lot of
people and I'm not going to do that again.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal reported Clinton as saying that Lewinsky threatened
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she would tell people they'd had an affair, that she
was known as the stalker among her peers, and that she hated it,''
Blumenthal told the grand jury. ``If she had an affair or said she
had an affair, she wouldn't be the stalker anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Blumenthal that he felt as though he were
``surrounded by an oppressive force that is creating a lie around
me and I can't get the truth out.'' Clinton, Blumenthal added,
compared himself to a character in ``Darkness at Noon,'' a novel by
Arthur Koestler depicting a political prisoner of the Soviet Union
psychologically tortured to confess offenses against the state he
didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal's grand jury testimony came two months before Clinton
acknowledged on national television that he had, in fact, had an
affair with Lewinsky. That confession, plus Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress on the Lewinsky matter,
set the impeachment process against Clinton in motion.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors will attempt to cast Clinton's encounter with
Blumenthal as an example of witness tampering. Under federal law,
anyone who ``engages in misleading conduct'' in order to influence
that person's testimony in an official proceeding is subject to an
undetermined fine, a prison sentence of up to 10 years, or both.
</P>
<P>
   The White House legal team will respond that Clinton's
statements to Blumenthal can hardly be counted as witness tampering
since Clinton that same month denied the relationship to the entire
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has no legal significance in the impeachment
proceeding, Blumenthal's testimony also provides about the only
close-in view of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's initial
reaction to the breaking news on Lewinsky a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, according to Blumenthal, said the president was
being attacked because he ``ministers to troubled people all the
time,'' and that he does so ``out of religious conviction and
personal temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal reported Mrs. Clinton as saying: ``If you knew
(Clinton's) mother, you would understand it.'' Clinton has often
cited his late mother, Virginia Kelley, as an open-hearted, warm
woman who guided him through the travails of life with an alcoholic
step father.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blumenthal, apart from his role as the third witness behind
Lewinsky and presidential confidant Vernon Jordan, is among the
most colorful characters in the impeachment saga.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist for almost 30 years before going to the White House
in 1997, Blumenthal earned a reputation as a brilliant but abrasive
promoter _ and later defender _ of Clinton and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton. As a writer for the New Republic and New Yorker
magazines, Blumenthal turned in glowing portraits of the Clintons,
leading some of his colleagues to suspect he had dropped any
pretense of professional integrity.
</P>
<P>
   His biting sarcasm and invective led his detractors to give him
the nickname ``Sid Vicious,'' the actual name of a rock 'n' roll
star who died of a heroin overdose in 1979. Blumenthal has been
accused of feeding the press negative stories about members of
Starr's prosecution team and Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal and his defenders deny smearing anyone and suggest
many of his adversaries in the journalism world were simply jealous
of his good relations with the Clintons.

   Meanwhile, several senators who viewed the videotape of Monica
Lewinsky's deposition said they found her impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said she ``appeared very young, credible and
vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She would make an excellent witness,'' Hatch said, adding that
he thinks ``at the very least,'' the videotape should be shown on
the Senate floor and ``at the very best,'' she would appear as a
live witness.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, the no. 4 Republican in the Senate
leadership, said he watched two hours and 14 minutes of the
four-hour Lewinsky videotape and concluded that ``if the tape were
to be viewed on the floor of the American Senate, in no way would
it offend the American people or damage the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he found that Lewinsky is ``calm, friendly and
handles herself very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Peter G. Fitzgerald, R-Ill, another freshmen senator, said
``there may be a few highlights'' of the Lewinsky tape ``that may
be relevant on the Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, a lawyer, said Lewinsky ``appeared to be a
professional witness. She knew in her head all the lawyer tricks.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps the best place to spot pop, rock and rap
superstars, up-and-comers and has-beens in this city is not the
bars and clubs, but the music stores. Making it as a musician may
require talent, persistence and opportunity, but before that one
needs gear. And the Guitar Center, the chain that began here in
1964 as the Vox Guitar Center, ranks among the country's biggest
clearinghouses for ambition.
</P>
<P>
   When musicians sign contracts with music labels, they run to the
Guitar Center to spend their advance money. When bands in studios
blow out an amp or snap a guitar string, they usually replace it at
the Guitar Center. And when an actor or a retired plumber suddenly
decides on a career change, the neophyte's first investment is
often at the Guitar Center.
</P>
<P>
   The store's customer list over the decades reads like a pop
music reference book, including Bo Diddley, Stevie Ray Vaughan,
Stevie Wonder, the Ventures, Jeff Beck, New Edition, Melissa
Etheridge, Smashing Pumpkins and Alanis Morissette, not to mention
less-esteemed aspiring musicians like David Koresh and Charles
Manson. The latter's guitar strings had to be shipped to his jail
separately from the instrument so that they could be used only
under supervision in case he tried anything dangerous with them,
store employees said.
</P>
<P>
   To take the pulse of musical activity in Los Angeles, the dream
factory responsible for much of the country's pop music, one can
just spend a day at the Guitar Center.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday there, Guns 'n' Roses picked up $700 worth of
drum equipment. The alternative pop group Fountains of Wayne
stopped in looking for a vintage yellow guitar for a video they
were filming. Remy Zero and Motorhead called seeking gear for their
tours. The rhythm-and-blues group Sons of Funk, on Master P's No
Limit label, checked out drum machines for their new album. Robert
Downey Jr. picked up some headphones for his music project.
</P>
<P>
   A formerly successful heavy-metal guitarist who reeked of
alcohol at 10 a.m. and asked that his name not be used replaced
equipment he had pawned elsewhere. The country star Clint Black
called to say he would be stopping by. A Los Angeles Dodger phoned
for a price quote on equipment. And Matthew Nelson (a son of Ricky
Nelson and half of the group Nelson) spent hours shopping. Not bad
for what employees called a quiet day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dad got me my first instrument here when I was 7,'' Nelson
said as he stood in the massive guitar section in a cowboy shirt.
``I got a three-quarter-sized bass guitar and my brother got a
little drum set. They thought it would be just a hobby, but we were
back when we were 11 buying real instruments. And the guy who sold
me my guitar then is now general manager of the store.''
</P>
<P>
   The man to whom Nelson referred is Dave Weiderman, who is
actually the store's director of artist relations, as well as a
former touring drummer with Peter Brown and a font of Guitar Center
lore. He likes to talk about when the Sultan of Brunei bought a
roomful of equipment for a party and had the store's staff come to
his hotel to help set it up.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time Eddie Van Halen was approached by a fan
wanting advice about microphones. Not only did the guitarist share
pointers on amplification, he also bought the fan a microphone. In
a similar encounter, Wonder met a boy who came to the store daily
and played the piano wistfully, hoping one day to buy it for his
church. ``You sound good,'' Wonder said before buying the shocked
boy the instrument. And Weiderman recounts the time Bo Diddley
brought homemade barbecue for the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a sense of pride,'' Weiderman said. ``You're
dealing with your heroes, and they're looking to you for advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guitar Center began humbly as an extension of the Organ
Center chain, its specialty intended to capitalize on Beatlemania.
It has expanded along Sunset Strip, filling a former movie theater
and a rehearsal hall next door, once owned by the group War.
</P>
<P>
   The store is filled with guitars, including a basement full of
instruments so rare and awe-inspiring that they led one customer, a
wine salesman named John Perkins, to exclaim to a friend, ``When I
die, scatter my ashes here.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the nearly 40,000-square-foot store is filled with
most everything that a musician, studio technician, DJ or roadie
could want: computer programs, stage lights, mixing consoles,
turntables, synthesizers, travel cases.
</P>
<P>
   The store's critics complain of relentless expansion nationwide
_ the chain's 49th store is scheduled to open in Long Island City,
Queens, New York City, this spring _ and price markdowns that are
driving smaller independent stores out of business. Last year, the
publicly held company had revenues of $391 million.
</P>
<P>
   Weiderman's response is that ``whenever we go into a new
territory, it increases business for the mom-and-pops.'' He cited
several guitar stores that had opened near the flagship in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody who shops at the Guitar Center is famous. Some of
the store's most interesting customers are not familiar faces. As
its salespeople say repeatedly, the store motto is ``Treat a
celebrity like a regular guy and treat a regular guy like a
celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   That Friday, for example, a group of fresh-faced teen-agers
hoping to be as big as the Backstreet Boys bought tens of thousands
of dollars worth of studio equipment. Jonathan Shneidman, a
computer and interface designer for digital video disks, spent
nearly six hours selecting electronic equipment to play live on the
Internet. And representatives of a church in Korea bought a public
address system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evangelical churches are springing up like fire in L.A.,''
said Randall Cunningham, a store salesman and a DJ. ``It's an
unexpected source of business.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere that Friday, Hank Wicke, who hopes to find a Rush
cover band to play with, was buying drumsticks. Kirk Miller, who
leads a Beatles-esque band, brought his synthesizer and hooked it
up to various guitar effects to see how they sounded together.
Sandro Donazzon, the owner of an instrument shop in Italy, looked
for products to take home and sell. And a 54-year-old man born in
Thailand sat in the guitar room picking classic and original
country-and-western songs. He introduced himself as Johnny Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times on a day off, I'm here,'' he said, pointing out the
many guitars, amplifiers and drum machines he had bought with his
savings from working at a furniture company. Johnny Texas went on
to play a few of his songs, mixing blues, country and rock with
humorous lyrics. ``I'm trying to make a different style,'' he
explained, ``like a hamburger with fish in between.''
</P>
<P>
   The cliche music store experience is to walk in and see dozens
of teen-agers playing Led Zeppelin's ``Stairway to Heaven'' on
guitar with no intention of making a purchase. Within a half hour
of the store's opening that Friday the song had already been played
twice, but a new trend seemed to be emerging. In the guitar
section, many customers were experimenting with alternate tunings,
employees said. But more strikingly, most teen-agers who walked
through the door went not to the guitars but to the drum machines
and samplers. What guitar riffing was to kids in the '80s,
beat-making (programming hip-hop and dance rhythms) is to
teen-agers today.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lin, a 16-year-old, and four friends spread out across the
drum machines and samplers as if they were at an arcade. But they
had no plans to buy anything. ``We can't afford any of it,'' he
said sadly. There were no generous, rich musicians like Wonder
within earshot.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for his turn on the samplers was Lamont (Bird) Holbdy,
who had just formed a production company, Money Bag Entertainment,
and built a studio, spending some $50,000 at the Guitar Center. He
was back looking for more. ``There's something new every day,'' he
explained. ``I got to stay on point.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Guitar Center's cachet is its 185 salespeople.
Almost all are musicians, usually older men past their glory days
or younger ones hoping that their big break will come even faster
through contacts made at the Guitar Center. To see a stereotypical
image of the technically minded musician's musician, look around
the store: at one point in the studio-equipment room, the ratio of
employees with ponytails to those without was 4 to 1. ``I put my
hair in a ponytail because it looks more professional,'' explained
one. ``But if I want to relate to a heavy-metal musician, I can
just pop my hair out and let it hang.''
</P>
<P>
   Slade came to the store looking for CDs of drum loops that he
had ordered. The store didn't have them yet and Slade was
crestfallen, explaining that he couldn't work without them. Moved
by Slade's disappointment _ or maybe just bored on this relatively
slow Friday _ an employee, Johnny DeLeon, drove to the supplier's
office half an hour away in Century City to pick up the CD's and
make the $64.84 sale. Slade tried to stuff a $20 tip into DeLeon's
pocket, but he declined.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what led him to go so far out of his way for such a small
sale, DeLeon just smiled and shrugged, reciting the Guitar Center
credo, ``Treat a celebrity like a regular guy and treat a regular
guy like a celebrity.''

LAW ENFORCEMENT CRACKS DOWN ON `CREDIT REPAIR' SCAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal and state law enforcement officials
announced on Tuesday a major crackdown on more than 40 companies in
20 states that prey on people with poor credit by promising to give
them new credit identities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Federal Trade Commission and the National
Association of Attorneys General told a news conference that law
enforcement agencies on Tuesday filed 42 cases against defendants
operating illegal scams in the growing ``credit repair'' business.
One other case was filed in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They prey on people who are plagued by poor credit, people who
may be desperate to develop a clean credit history so they can get
a loan, get a job or buy a car,'' said Jody Bernstein, director of
the Federal Trade Commission's bureau of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson, chairman of the NAAG's
consumer protection committee, said the 43 companies charged were
``just the tip of the iceberg'' since the number of credit scams
has exploded over the Internet in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The openness of the World Wide Web is perfect for them,'' he
said, adding that officials believe thousands of people have been
victims of this type of credit repair scam.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said the companies seek out people who have recently
filed for bankruptcy or have been denied loans or credit cards due
to poor credit histories. Charging anywhere from $29.95 to $400,
the companies promise to provide consumers with instructions on how
to develop a new credit identity.
</P>
<P>
   The instructions usually recommend that people apply to the
Internal Revenue Service for an employer identification numbers, or
EIN, which is required for anyone who has at least one employee,
including a nanny or household help.
</P>
<P>
   Once consumers obtain an EIN, the companies tell them to use
that number instead of their Social Security numbers when they
apply for credit, enabling them to start a fresh credit record.
Some of the companies even advised their customers to get new
driver's licenses with their EIN numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein admitted the instructions often work, but she pointed
out that there is a big catch: ``It's illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, almost all advice from the credit repair companies is
against the law.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said it is a crime to misrepresent a Social Security
number or to misuse an EIN. It is also illegal to make false
statements on a loan or credit application and could become mail or
wire fraud if the mail or phone are used during any part of the
application process.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson said that none of the 43 cases announced Tuesday is
against users of the credit repair scams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of the consumers involved in these scams are
innocent victims or don't fully understand how illegal it is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department estimates that this type of scam costs
American businesses $400 million annually in fraudulent loans and
money lost to illegal credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said consumers should avoid any company that promises
to ``fix'' their credit histories for a fee since information on
their credit background can be obtained for free. The information
can be obtained on by calling credit report companies, such as
Equifax or Trans Union Corporation, which will provide consumers
with a free copy of their credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   She added that legitimate companies can counsel consumers on how
to correct errors in their history and can show them how to rebuild
their credit.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bernstein warned that consumers cannot simply erase
poor history. ``Rebuilding your credit just takes time and hard
work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 43 cases, the FTC filed 17 cases, state attorneys general
filed 21 cases. The Treasury Department also has obtained criminal
search warrants in five other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 state cases were filed in Arizona, California,
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri,
Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed cases in Colorado, Texas, Florida, Washington,
Virginia, Maryland and New York.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains will douse west-facing slopes of the Coastal Range
from Washington to northern California on Wednesday as a powerful
Pacific disturbance arrives from the Gulf of Alaska. Rain may be
accompanied by thunder in some areas as the cold, high-altitude
reflection of the surface low-pressure system swings overhead.
Ocean winds will steadily increase during the day, reaching a
crescendo Wednesday night along the Oregon and southern Washington
Coast, where gusts to 70 mph are possible on exposed beaches.
Farther inland, heavy snow will fall in the Cascades as moist
Pacific air cools while being forced to rise rapidly over the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Precipitation will be rather limited across the rest of the
nation as fast, high-level winds from the west over the Gulf Coast
impede the northward advance of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico.
Nonetheless, a few scattered, generally light showers will dampen
parts of the Gulf Coast states.
</P>
<P>
   Broken areas of snow will fall over parts of the northern Plains
and upper Great Lakes as a low-pressure system moves east from the
Dakotas. A few showers of rain will precede the cold front
associated with the system across the southern Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Northeast will be brighter on Wednesday than on
Tuesday, although clouds and a few snow showers will linger in
northwest New England. Morning low clouds and fog will dull the
start of the day in some of the other mountain valleys in New
England and the northern Middle Atlantic States before the onset of
brightening.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Nadir of Winter
</P>
<P>
   The nadir of winter has arrived. Late January and early February
mark the time when average daily temperatures reach their lowest
levels, a milepost that occurs long after the day with minimum
daylight, December 23. This delay happens because it takes time to
chill the earth's surface, which, in turn, chills the overlying
air. Air temperatures in burrows of groundhogs reach their lowest
marks a bit after the atmosphere's nadir. When burrow chill
threatens to freeze a groundhog's tissue, the animal awakens. These
awakenings typically occur around February 2.

HONDURAS AID HAS DECLINED; NEEDS HAVE NOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It hasn't stopped raining in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   At Instituto Maria Regina, a school in northern Honduras, the
school year begins today as it does every February. But this year,
Sister Marjorie DeStout, the principal, has less room to work with.
Several of her classrooms have high stacks of food and clothes
donated from around the world _ aid that still awaits distribution
because it remains difficult to move anything in her ravaged
country.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Maria Regina and its 525 junior high students are among
the luckier ones. The school is one of the islands of normalcy in a
land still ravaged by the rain, wind and flooding of 1998. Many
schools no longer exist in Honduras. Others will not open on time
because they are still shelters for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The world's attention has moved elsewhere since Hurricane Mitch
visited devastation on the Central American country in October.
Gone are the images of mountainsides collapsing on villages and
rivers swelling wider, their rushing currents sweeping away homes,
farms, neighborhoods and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the community-based food and clothing drives have ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is still very bad,'' DeStout said. ``We have had
almost continual rain the entire month of January, and since all of
the edges of the rivers were destroyed the first time, it does not
take much for them to flood once again.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is attempting to move many of the homeless into
larger shelters so the schools can be reclaimed for education.
</P>
<P>
   Recent visitors to the country from Kansas City tell of the
desperation of the homeless living in the cramped shelters. They
videotaped waterfalls of rain plunging down mountainsides, stagnant
water covering streets and children whose legs were red and swollen
with infections from the water.
</P>
<P>
   The rains continue to wash out temporary bridges, especially in
the rural areas. People cross rivers while tied to a rope to keep
from being washed away, DeStout said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of villages that haven't received any help at
all or very little,'' she said. ``There just isn't any way to get
help out there.''
</P>
<P>
   DeStout is happy to have school beginning. She will also
continue to coordinate all of the aid being sent by the Catholic
Church to the La Ceiba area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think, `When, Lord, when will it be over?' &UR; ''
DeStout said. ``It has just been such a punishing month.''
The Honduran embassy in Washington, D.C., is listing these numbers
as the cost of Hurricane Mitch: 5,657 dead, 8,085 missing, 12,272
injured. The embassy will not speculate on whether the number of
missing should be added to the number of dead.
</P>
<P>
   Officials do admit the country is at times overwhelmed by the
process of rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you recover after a disaster like this?'' asked David
Hernandez, a political counselor for the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy has no statistics for the number of schools unable
to reopen. One early report said 315 schools in the country had
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   The school year in Honduras normally runs from February to
November. Last fall, school ended a month early because of the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the schools are becoming places of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Owens visited three shelters recently in Honduras. Two were
in school buildings. He said it is common for five families, about
30 persons, to share one classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Owens is director of field management for Children
International, a Kansas City-based child-sponsor program operating
clinics and schools in 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a former Peace Corps volunteer, is a veteran worker in
Third World countries, including parts of Africa. He also served in
Calcutta, India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor people always impress me by how they are often so
resilient to their situations,'' he said. ``But I saw desperation
and despondency in the shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   The people are hungry for news of where they will end up living,
Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference here is in the psyche of the people. They are
at their rope's end,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens took many pictures of his visit. One showed a little boy
whose legs were so infected, the skin looked as if it were
decaying.
</P>
<P>
   Children International is planning to build a clinic as part of
a new housing development to be constructed for hurricane victims
in San Pedro Sula. But when officials signed the clinic paperwork
in January, the location of the new neighborhood still hadn't been
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are going on three months of being in these
shelters,'' Owens said. ``They are starting to lose hope that
anything will be done for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Honduran people are noted for their willingness to
cooperate for the good of the country, despite their restlessness
to return to self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Food-for-work programs are common. People earn food for helping
to repair roads, drag rivers of silt and clear areas of debris.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saying now in Honduras is, if Honduras needs to work as
one, `Yo soy Honduras' (I am Honduras),'' Hernandez said.
Shipments of aid continue to arrive in Honduras. Nearly 100,000
pounds of food, medicine and clothing were sent from St. Joseph
nearly two weeks ago. About the same time, nearly 700 boxes of
similar supplies were sent through the efforts of a Honduran man
now living in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military planes have delivered more than 10 million pounds
of humanitarian aid from the United States. Chiquita Brands
International, which has banana farms in Honduras, is continuing to
send aid on its ships. The Olathe-based Heart To Heart
International is planning to send another shipment within a month.
</P>
<P>
   But the big push of aid is clearly over.
</P>
<P>
   A `trickle,' is how many aid organizations characterized current
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an awful lot of supplies shipped, but because
of the extensive damage to the infrastructure, just moving the
supplies through the countryside is a big, big challenge,'' Lamar
Phillips, associate director for Central America for ADRA
(Adventist Development and Relief Agency), said from his office in
Tegucigalpa, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about the loss of Honduras' export crops,
such as bananas, coffee, shrimp and melons. What many are concerned
about is the lack of focus on Honduras' domestic crops: rice, corn
and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no arable soil left,'' said Joe Hagin, vice president
of corporate affairs for Chiquita in Ohio. Like Phillips and
others, Hagin is concerned for Honduras in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then, when the lack of domestic food will become apparent,
is when they will really need everyone's help,'' Hagin said. ``The
challenge will be to keep the focus of the world on the extent of
the tragedy so the aid continues to come.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rodriguez, an official with one of St. Joseph's largest
churches, coordinated an initial aid drive, but is no longer
collecting goods. Instead, he is helping others to get their things
to Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   His latest project is coordinating the milling and shipping of
56,000 pounds of corn being donated by a Tulsa, Okla., company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the most crucial time in the disaster,''
Rodriguez said. ``This is when people start to forget.''

   JOURNAL-CUBA _ HAVANA _ Some come for fun. Some come for love.
Others come to flee the reach of U.S. justice. But whatever the
reason, Cuba has attracted a lot of Americans. While U.S. law does
not prohibit Americans from living in Cuba or traveling to Cuba,
the Trading with the Enemy Act bans U.S. citizens from spending
money in Cuba. Still, the number of Americans mingling with Cubans
grows every year. Austin, Texas-resident Dan Snow, for example,
comes to Cuba at least once a month. He comes for the fishing and
always brings lots of Texans with him. Others come to scout out
business opportunities. So why don't any of the Americans visiting
the so-called forbidden island _ or even living there _ get in
trouble for violating U.S. law? Is the law ever enforced? (Emling,

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Face books are those little booklets
made available by the House and Senate information offices that put
a face beside the name of every legislator along with some basic
facts. It's interesting to thumb through a decade or so of face
books to get a sense of how not only race and gender but
occupations have changed over time. In the 1987-88 face book, 11 of
the 56 Georgia state senators _ all but one of them Democrats _
listed their occupation as attorney. There were two funeral home
directors and a retired veterinarian, but no physicians. This year,
eight senators listed lawyering as their trade, including four
Republicans and three first-term Democrats. That there is only one
Democratic lawyer with experience in the chamber, Sen. Rene Kemp of
Hinesville, marks a huge change from the 1980s. (Baxter, Atlanta

age will change nearly everything we do in the next century, and
even alter the way we think about issues and weigh values. In the
unfolding new world, knowledge becomes the coin of the realm, a new
way to handle and expand time, and even a weapon in business and
economic warfare. Yes, what we used to call competition could
become undisguised combat. (Holsendolph, Atlanta

   DELTA-FOOD _ ATLANTA _Delta passengers may notice something
missing in their Sky Deli bags starting Thursday: the sandwich.In a
cost-trimming move, the airline is taking the sandwiches out of the

crackers or carrots and dip. Delta's also cutting back from full
meals to snacks in first-class on 80 flights and from snacks to
beverage service on another 160. That's still a minority of flights
on which food is served. (Staff, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 10

FOR TV CHEF YAN, SIMPLE IS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (Has sidebar, Yan-Profile) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ring in the Chinese Year of the Rabbit with a
feast of creations by Martin Yan, that fun-loving and entertaining
master of public television's cooking show ``Yan Can Cook'' who is
out to demystify Chinese cuisine. The celebration begins Feb. 16
and continues for 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades (and 1,500 shows), Yan has brought
Asian culture and cooking into homes throughout this country. Now
he has compiled his favorite dishes in ``Martin Yan's Feast: The
Best of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay Books; $34.95). It features 200
creations he has been making for years, along with 75 new recipes.
All have been updated and designed for contemporary cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are looking for something fast, quick, healthy
and delicious,'' emphasized Yan during a telephone interview from
his San Mateo home. ``Nobody _ not even the Chinese _ wants to make
Peking Tea-Smoked Duck at home. Very few people want to spend lots
of time (two or three hours) cooking. I've maintained the integrity
and philosophy of the cuisine but made it more accessible to the
general public.''
</P>
<P>
   For a shortcut, Yan recommends using cut-up vegetable
ingredients from a supermarket salad bar and beef, pork or chicken
strips from the meat section. It's also feasible to use
store-bought prepared stir-fry, kung pao or other sauces instead of
making your own.
</P>
<P>
   Yan has also combined cooking steps to streamline his recipes.
For instance, he avoids water blanching vegetables or poaching
meat, each separately, prior to cooking them in a wok. Instead he
cooks the meat in the wok first, removes it and then stir-fries the
veggies, adds the sauce and returns the meat to the pan. Often, he
adds vegetables to pork or chicken in the wok when the meat is 80
percent cooked and then finishes off the dish. Yan also avoids long
ingredient lists, keeping them to a manageable eight to 12 items
when possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yan also pays close attention to presentation,
using modern plates and arranging the food like works of art to
make the dishes look interesting. In the book, as in his television
shows, he tries to encourage and excite _ not intimidate _ his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese home cooking is basically very down to earth,'' he
said. ``We're doing everyday cuisine _ homey, comfort food. The
dish itself is simple _ the way you present the dish is what makes
it appetizing. Cooking isn't just about getting the right answer.
It's also one of life's greatest pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his memories of the Chinese New Year in China,
Yan, who was born in the Year of the Monkey (the Chinese zodiac,
centered around 12 animals, is believed to determine the
personality and fortune of those born during each animal's
respective year), delved into his truly unfortunate growing up
years in China in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much food or much to eat,'' he recalled, adding
that before he was 13, the Chinese New Year was almost nonexistent
for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chinese New Year he actually celebrated _ with
firecrackers, carnivals and different foods _ was in Hong Kong, he
noted, where he went to apprentice in an uncle's restaurant shortly
after his 13th birthday. ``It was just like Christmastime in the
U.S.,'' he recalled, but added, ``The Chinese New Year is more into
celebration and food symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Chinatown during the celebration, he noted, you'll
find tangerines, pomelos and red envelopes (which are filled with
money and given to children and single people to wish them good
luck and good fortune) in the stores. Restaurants feature special
menus with foods such as black moss (a hairlike seaweed which is
tasteless but quite expensive and is used in dishes to bring good
fortune) and dried oysters (to wish people good business and good
fortune).
</P>
<P>
   Lettuce wraps are also served. Lettuce symbolizes giving birth
and wealth and riches. The filling is usually dried oysters. Fish
is traditionally served for Chinese New Year, as is something
stuffed with mushrooms. During this time, the Chinese eat round
cookies, which are a symbol of coins and money.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of his new book includes Yan's reflections on
the road his life has taken in China, Hong Kong, Canada and
California (including the University of California, Davis, where he
earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in food science and met
his wife, Susan). In addition to recipes, the book also includes
technique information and a guide to ingredients. It makes for some
interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who resides in San Mateo with his wife and 6{-year-old twin
sons, believes in cooking healthy food _ lots of fish, vegetables
and tofu _ for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also eat a lot of pasta and noodles. My sons love to eat
raw tofu with soy sauce,'' said Yan, adding that they also like
chili garlic sauce and hot and spicy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cook what you enjoy _ experiment, be passionate and
adventurous,'' advised Yan. ``And always try a dish before you say,
`No.' Food is a reflection of one's life. You have to eat every day
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
MINCED POULT &LR; R &UR; Y WITH WALNUTS IN LETTUCE CUPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my version of a favorite banquet dish that's often
served on festive occasions as a symbol of longevity. The crisp,
chilled lettuce makes a wonderful contrast to the warm filling, and
the sweetness of the hoisin sauce marries all the flavors.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
6 dried black mushrooms &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 cup walnuts &QL; 
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken, turkey OR duck &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon minced ginger &QL; 
1 small carrot, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 small zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 cup diced water chestnuts OR jicama &QL; 
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine OR dry sherry &QL; 
1 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
Hoisin sauce &QL; 
12 small iceberg lettuce cups!off!
</P>
<P>
   Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20
minutes; drain, reserving 1/4 cup of soaking liquid. Discard stems
and chop caps.
</P>
<P>
   Spread walnuts in a pie pan. Toast in preheated 350-degree oven,
stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Let nuts cool, then coarsely chop.
</P>
<P>
   Cut chicken into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in a bowl with
oyster-flavored sauce; stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry 1 minute. Add
carrot, zucchini and water chestnuts; stir-fry 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Add reserved mushroom soaking liquid; cook until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Add wine and sesame oil; cook until
heated through. Add walnuts and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread hoisin sauce on a lettuce cup, spoon in some of
chicken mixture, wrap in lettuce cup and eat out of hand. Makes 4
to 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
WATERCRESS SOUP WITH CRAB &LR;  &QL; 
``This is a popular Cantonese treat, yet ironically watercress is
not of Chinese origin. It was brought to China by Western traders,
and over the centuries it has found a perfect home in Chinese
cuisine, as in this savory seafood broth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
2 teaspoons cornstarch &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
SOUP MIXTURE: &QL; 
1/4 pound cooked crab meat, flaked &QL; 
2 teaspoons vegetable oil &QL; 
3 slices ginger, EACH the size of a quarter, lightly crushed &QL; 
4 cups chicken broth &QL; 
1 cup water &QL; 
1 bunch watercress (about 3/4 pound), coarse stems trimmed &QL; 
1/2 cup sliced carrots &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Marinade ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>

FOR TV CHEF YAN, SIMPLE IS GOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (Has sidebar, Yan-Profile) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ring in the Chinese Year of the Rabbit with a
feast of creations by Martin Yan, that fun-loving and entertaining
master of public television's cooking show ``Yan Can Cook'' who is
out to demystify Chinese cuisine. The celebration begins Feb. 16
and continues for 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades (and 1,500 shows), Yan has brought
Asian culture and cooking into homes throughout this country. Now
he has compiled his favorite dishes in ``Martin Yan's Feast: The
Best of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay Books; $34.95). It features 200
creations he has been making for years, along with 75 new recipes.
All have been updated and designed for contemporary cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are looking for something fast, quick, healthy
and delicious,'' emphasized Yan during a telephone interview from
his San Mateo home. ``Nobody _ not even the Chinese _ wants to make
Peking Tea-Smoked Duck at home. Very few people want to spend lots
of time (two or three hours) cooking. I've maintained the integrity
and philosophy of the cuisine but made it more accessible to the
general public.''
</P>
<P>
   For a shortcut, Yan recommends using cut-up vegetable
ingredients from a supermarket salad bar and beef, pork or chicken
strips from the meat section. It's also feasible to use
store-bought prepared stir-fry, kung pao or other sauces instead of
making your own.
</P>
<P>
   Yan has also combined cooking steps to streamline his recipes.
For instance, he avoids water blanching vegetables or poaching
meat, each separately, prior to cooking them in a wok. Instead he
cooks the meat in the wok first, removes it and then stir-fries the
veggies, adds the sauce and returns the meat to the pan. Often, he
adds vegetables to pork or chicken in the wok when the meat is 80
percent cooked and then finishes off the dish. Yan also avoids long
ingredient lists, keeping them to a manageable eight to 12 items
when possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yan also pays close attention to presentation,
using modern plates and arranging the food like works of art to
make the dishes look interesting. In the book, as in his television
shows, he tries to encourage and excite _ not intimidate _ his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese home cooking is basically very down to earth,'' he
said. ``We're doing everyday cuisine _ homey, comfort food. The
dish itself is simple _ the way you present the dish is what makes
it appetizing. Cooking isn't just about getting the right answer.
It's also one of life's greatest pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his memories of the Chinese New Year in China,
Yan, who was born in the Year of the Monkey (the Chinese zodiac,
centered around 12 animals, is believed to determine the
personality and fortune of those born during each animal's
respective year), delved into his truly unfortunate growing up
years in China in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much food or much to eat,'' he recalled, adding
that before he was 13, the Chinese New Year was almost nonexistent
for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chinese New Year he actually celebrated _ with
firecrackers, carnivals and different foods _ was in Hong Kong, he
noted, where he went to apprentice in an uncle's restaurant shortly
after his 13th birthday. ``It was just like Christmastime in the
U.S.,'' he recalled, but added, ``The Chinese New Year is more into
celebration and food symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Chinatown during the celebration, he noted, you'll
find tangerines, pomelos and red envelopes (which are filled with
money and given to children and single people to wish them good
luck and good fortune) in the stores. Restaurants feature special
menus with foods such as black moss (a hairlike seaweed which is
tasteless but quite expensive and is used in dishes to bring good
fortune) and dried oysters (to wish people good business and good
fortune).
</P>
<P>
   Lettuce wraps are also served. Lettuce symbolizes giving birth
and wealth and riches. The filling is usually dried oysters. Fish
is traditionally served for Chinese New Year, as is something
stuffed with mushrooms. During this time, the Chinese eat round
cookies, which are a symbol of coins and money.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of his new book includes Yan's reflections on
the road his life has taken in China, Hong Kong, Canada and
California (including the University of California, Davis, where he
earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in food science and met
his wife, Susan). In addition to recipes, the book also includes
technique information and a guide to ingredients. It makes for some
interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who resides in San Mateo with his wife and 6{-year-old twin
sons, believes in cooking healthy food _ lots of fish, vegetables
and tofu _ for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also eat a lot of pasta and noodles. My sons love to eat
raw tofu with soy sauce,'' said Yan, adding that they also like
chili garlic sauce and hot and spicy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cook what you enjoy _ experiment, be passionate and
adventurous,'' advised Yan. ``And always try a dish before you say,
`No.' Food is a reflection of one's life. You have to eat every day
to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
MINCED POULT &LR; R &UR; Y WITH WALNUTS IN LETTUCE CUPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my version of a favorite banquet dish that's often
served on festive occasions as a symbol of longevity. The crisp,
chilled lettuce makes a wonderful contrast to the warm filling, and
the sweetness of the hoisin sauce marries all the flavors.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
6 dried black mushrooms &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 cup walnuts &QL; 
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken, turkey OR duck &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1 teaspoon minced ginger &QL; 
1 small carrot, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 small zucchini, cut into 1/4-inch cubes &QL; 
1 cup diced water chestnuts OR jicama &QL; 
1 tablespoon Chinese rice wine OR dry sherry &QL; 
1 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
Hoisin sauce &QL; 
12 small iceberg lettuce cups!off!
</P>
<P>
   Soak mushrooms in warm water to cover until softened, about 20
minutes; drain, reserving 1/4 cup of soaking liquid. Discard stems
and chop caps.
</P>
<P>
   Spread walnuts in a pie pan. Toast in preheated 350-degree oven,
stirring once or twice, until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
Let nuts cool, then coarsely chop.
</P>
<P>
   Cut chicken into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in a bowl with
oyster-flavored sauce; stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Place a wok over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add chicken and stir-fry 1 minute. Add
carrot, zucchini and water chestnuts; stir-fry 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Add reserved mushroom soaking liquid; cook until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Add wine and sesame oil; cook until
heated through. Add walnuts and toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spread hoisin sauce on a lettuce cup, spoon in some of
chicken mixture, wrap in lettuce cup and eat out of hand. Makes 4
to 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
WATERCRESS SOUP WITH CRAB &LR;  &QL; 
``This is a popular Cantonese treat, yet ironically watercress is
not of Chinese origin. It was brought to China by Western traders,
and over the centuries it has found a perfect home in Chinese
cuisine, as in this savory seafood broth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
2 teaspoons cornstarch &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
SOUP MIXTURE: &QL;

1 bunch watercress (about 3/4 pound), coarse stems trimmed &QL; 
1/2 cup sliced carrots &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon sesame oil &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon white pepper!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Marinade ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add crab meat and stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. &QL; 
Place a 2-quart pan over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,
swirling to coat sides. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until
fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add crab meat and stir-fry 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Add watercress and
carrots. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. &QL; 
Stir in sesame oil and pepper. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
MANGO BEEF &LR;  &QL; 
``Like many Hong Kong-trained chefs, I love to combine the flavors
of meat and fresh fruit. Here, it's a case of meat meets mango in a
sizzling sweet-and-savory stir-fry. If you can't find mangoes, you
can substitute pears or peaches.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Add remaining 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil to wok, swirling to
coat sides. Add mango, apple and red pepper; stir-fry 2 minutes.
Return meat to wok and add plum sauce, wine and soy sauce. Cook
until heated through. Add nuts and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   Place on a serving plate and garnish with chile slices. Makes 4
servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a second here to welcome Latrell Sprewell to
the New York Knicks. That's exactly what New York City needs --
another borderline psychotic with a hair-trigger temper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell Sprewell, as you know, had some trouble with his last
NBA team, with his last coach...but he's now a proud member of the
New York Knicks and already he's adjusting to life in New York City
--he's sleeping with Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different how different people celebrate -- when the
Atlanta Falcons score, they dance around; when I score, I just
leave 50 bucks on the dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in New Jersey lost his hand several years ago...and now
within the last couple of weeks, they have given him a brand new
hand. He is the first recipient of a successful hand transplant.
It's an amazing thing. And the guy was saying it's an incredible
experience. He says now he feels like he's having sex with a total
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Mayor Giuliani, more bad news for New York City.
Mayor Giuliani is now saying New York City has a pit bull problem.
I think he's right. I think we do have a serious pit bull problem.
Earlier today, I saw a pit bull using a wire coat hanger to break
into a Toyota Camry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting. The pit bulls don't seem to be bothering
Mayor Giuliani, though. I guess it's just professional courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks happen to watch the Golden Globe Awards?...The
Golden Globe show, you may not have known this, was produced by
Dick Clark. Dick Clark is an amazing man. He's also producing the
impeachment.''
</P>

   &UR; HOW THE GOP CAN RESCUE ITS IMAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By P.J. O'Rourke author of ``Eat the Rich.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could act on principle, following the dictates
of conscience and putting duty to the nation above personal and
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   They could get body piercings to project a more hip and with-it
image, especially the House Judiciary committee members. Watching
them on television caused all Americans to experience horrible
memories of being met at the door by the father of their prom date.
But, knowing Republicans, they'd probably pierce their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   A sexx-change operation for every male Republican leader would
be too expensive, even for a party with major corporate donors in
the health care field.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could wait for the inevitable financial bust,
but they didn't get much out of that in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could have sordid affairs, solicit tainted campaign
donations and practice highbinding and jobbery of every sort. This
works for Mr. Clinton, plus there's the advantage that the
Republicans are doing it already.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing the Republicans could do is extend a hand of
peace to the Democrats. They could let bygones be bygones, work
together with their opponents and show the electorate that
Republicans trust Democrats _ trust Democrats to have a George
McGovern, a Fritz Mondale or a Michael Dukakis waiting in the
wings. Or, indeed, an Al Gore.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go haywire in other parts of the world it can have
an adverse effect here,'' Mr. Clinton says. For instance, say the
sun dies.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his new budget is a ``new era of opportunity.''
That's also what he thought when Monica Lewinsky first showed him
her thong.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposed budget would spend $1.77 trillion. Soon
someone will have to look up what the next -illion is called.
</P>
<P>
   The new Clinton budget forecasts surpluses totaling $2.41
trillion over the next decade. That works out to about a nickel for
each time the president has taken credit for them.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposed 2000 budget would spend $215.2 billion
in interest on money the government borrows. For that kind of dough
you used to be able to start a nice little country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next fiscal year, the government expects to collect $1.88
trillion. How about $1.8 trillion from Bill Gates and $.08 trillion
from the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants Ken Starr held in contempt for violating
grand jury secrecy rules. Doesn't that depend on the meaning of the
word secrecy?
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have the impeachment trial end by Feb. 12. Yeah,
once pitchers and catchers show up for spring training, who will
pay attention?
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Monica Lewinsky again seems to Aunt Ilse from
Oelwein like one more reporter asking John Elway how the Broncos
won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Boris Yeltin's recent 68th birthday, his wife made him a
cabbage pie. If it happened to us, we'd think she doesn't want us
to last another year.
</P>
<P>
   There's at least a little consistency to the news. Both the
Super Bowl and the Clinton-Lewinsky affair are XXX-rated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  My husband and I were offered a friend's apartment in
Manhattan for the weekend and drove in, bicycles on our car. We
pulled into one space that was too close to a hydrant. We then
biked two blocks north and spotted a better space, safe, large and
legal.
</P>
<P>
   How to secure it in the face of the aggressive New York parker?
Inspiration struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call a cab,'' I said to my husband. He did and directed the
cabbie to park in our spot, meter running. Then he biked back to
the car, secured the bike and drove back to replace the cab.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 tab, including tip, paid for a great parking spot for the
weekend.
</P>
<P>

   A Washington relative of Barbara Fultz saw an exhibition of
angels in Baltimore and heard there were even better angels at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. He called and asked if Ms. Fultz would
find out how long the exhibition would be in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no angels at the Met,'' said the young man who
answered the information line. ``But there are fairies at the
Frick.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, helpfully, ``They both have wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney and Esther Sanders were on the Long Island Rail Road when
the conductor questioned their half-price senior tickets. They
assured him that they were indeed seniors. ``I'm going to test
you,'' he said. ``Who fired Julius La Rosa?'' Mrs. Sanders didn't
hesitate. ``Arthur Godfrey,'' she said. ``Only seniors would know
that,'' he said, and went on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Minnis was explaining that the invasion of the sea lamprey
into the Great Lakes may have been eased by the locks in the canal
that joined the lakes. The 35 students in her environmental science
class at Pace University looked blank. She asked if they all knew
what locks were. A student raised her hand. ``Aren't they what you
have with bagels and cream cheese?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chester Redhead, anxious not to look as if he had just had a
trim, gave his barber specific instructions. ``Just a bit off the
left side, and on the right side a trifle over the ear toward the
back _ don't remove any from the top, just press it down, and at
the back just level it off at the neckline.''
</P>
<P>
   The barber looked at him thoughtfully. ``Doc,'' he said, ``why
don't I just give you a note to say that you have been here?''
</P>
<P>
   A day in the life of a 13-year-old in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  I am in eighth grade and I was sent home from school because
I had a stomach virus. I walked outside into a blizzard and raised
my arm to hail a cab. A couple stepped in front of me and when a
cab pulled up they pushed to get in. I said, ``Excuse me,'' very
loudly but the woman turned and said, ``We're taking this cab.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked to see if there were any other cabs, when a woman hit
me in the back with her umbrella. She kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   I stood on the corner, arm raised, when a meat-delivery truck
pulled up. One of the men came over and said, ``Hey babydoll, I
could give you a ride.'' I refused and raised my arm again.
</P>
<P>
   This time a white town car with a palm tree painted on the back
pulled up and the driver said: ``I don't have a passenger. Do you
want a ride?'' I refused just as a police car pulled up alongside
me. I was expecting an offer of a ride but instead one of the
officers said, ``Why aren't you in school?'' I told him I was going
home because I was sick and the officer said, ``Sure. Get home NOW.
Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a cab pulled up and I jumped in. The driver said, ``I
don't have any change, that OK?'' I had enough singles, so I
agreed. After a long ride, I paid, went into my house, put on my
pajamas, got into bed and went to sleep. _ SARAH CROW

   Peter M. Rowe, who lives in Iselin, N.J., recently parked in
Brooklyn Heights, where he was attending the anniversary party of
friends. Party over, he walked back to the car, where he noticed a
piece of paper taped to the window on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``You left your keys in the door. Come to this address,
press the right-hand buzzer to get your keys back.'' He did and his
keys were returned, reward refused. His conclusion: ``What a nice
city and what nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarita Zeppie on the No. 9 train overheard two teen-age boys
discussing the bombings in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   First boy: ``Do you think they'll bomb New York City?''
</P>
<P>
   Second boy: ``I hope not. What could we do if it happens?''
</P>
<P>
   First boy: ``If you had a dollar, we could take the PATH train
to New Jersey. We'd be safe there. Nobody's going to waste their
time bombing New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman standing at the supermarket meat counter noticed a
sign that read, ``Ask about our chicken and meat dating policy.''
She was so amused that she pointed to the sign and said to the man
standing next to her, ``You know, I've never dated a chicken in my
life.'' He laughed and said, ``No, but I bet you dated a turkey or
two.'' The woman thought a moment. ``Actually, I married one,'' she
said. She and the turkey are, unsurprisingly, now divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Evening, No. 3 train, not particularly crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Older homeless man, standing, talking to
middle-aged woman, sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Matthew W. Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``What's the next stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``Park Place or Fulton.''
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``Can I ask you something?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman, uneasily: ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Man moves directly in front of her and puts a crumpled $1 bill
in her face. She cringes.
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``Gimme a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``I don't have a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The door opens and as the man starts to leave, he says: ``You
know, you have fat legs. You should be glad you're not my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``I was thinking the same thing.''

</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a second here to welcome Latrell Sprewell to
the New York Knicks. That's exactly what New York City needs --
another borderline psychotic with a hair-trigger temper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell Sprewell, as you know, had some trouble with his last
NBA team, with his last coach...but he's now a proud member of the
New York Knicks and already he's adjusting to life in New York City
--he's sleeping with Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different how different people celebrate -- when the
Atlanta Falcons score, they dance around; when I score, I just
leave 50 bucks on the dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in New Jersey lost his hand several years ago...and now
within the last couple of weeks, they have given him a brand new
hand. He is the first recipient of a successful hand transplant.
It's an amazing thing. And the guy was saying it's an incredible
experience. He says now he feels like he's having sex with a total
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Mayor Giuliani, more bad news for New York City.
Mayor Giuliani is now saying New York City has a pit bull problem.
I think he's right. I think we do have a serious pit bull problem.
Earlier today, I saw a pit bull using a wire coat hanger to break
into a Toyota Camry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting. The pit bulls don't seem to be bothering
Mayor Giuliani, though. I guess it's just professional courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks happen to watch the Golden Globe Awards?...The
Golden Globe show, you may not have known this, was produced by
Dick Clark. Dick Clark is an amazing man. He's also producing the
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a moment here to welcome Pope John Paul II to

sun dies.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his new budget is a ``new era of opportunity.''
That's also what he thought when Monica Lewinsky first showed him
her thong.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposed budget would spend $1.77 trillion. Soon
someone will have to look up what the next -illion is called.
</P>
<P>
   The new Clinton budget forecasts surpluses totaling $2.41
trillion over the next decade. That works out to about a nickel for
each time the president has taken credit for them.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposed 2000 budget would spend $215.2 billion
in interest on money the government borrows. For that kind of dough
you used to be able to start a nice little country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next fiscal year, the government expects to collect $1.88
trillion. How about $1.8 trillion from Bill Gates and $.08 trillion
from the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants Ken Starr held in contempt for violating
grand jury secrecy rules. Doesn't that depend on the meaning of the
word secrecy?
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have the impeachment trial end by Feb. 12. Yeah,
once pitchers and catchers show up for spring training, who will
pay attention?
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Monica Lewinsky again seems to Aunt Ilse from
Oelwein like one more reporter asking John Elway how the Broncos
won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Boris Yeltin's recent 68th birthday, his wife made him a
cabbage pie. If it happened to us, we'd think she doesn't want us
to last another year.
</P>
<P>
   There's at least a little consistency to the news. Both the
Super Bowl and the Clinton-Lewinsky affair are XXX-rated.

   &LR;  My husband and I were offered a friend's apartment in
Manhattan for the weekend and drove in, bicycles on our car. We
pulled into one space that was too close to a hydrant. We then
biked two blocks north and spotted a better space, safe, large and
legal.
</P>
<P>
   How to secure it in the face of the aggressive New York parker?
Inspiration struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call a cab,'' I said to my husband. He did and directed the
cabbie to park in our spot, meter running. Then he biked back to
the car, secured the bike and drove back to replace the cab.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 tab, including tip, paid for a great parking spot for the
weekend.

   A Washington relative of Barbara Fultz saw an exhibition of
angels in Baltimore and heard there were even better angels at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. He called and asked if Ms. Fultz would
find out how long the exhibition would be in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no angels at the Met,'' said the young man who
answered the information line. ``But there are fairies at the
Frick.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, helpfully, ``They both have wings.''

   Sidney and Esther Sanders were on the Long Island Rail Road when
the conductor questioned their half-price senior tickets. They
assured him that they were indeed seniors. ``I'm going to test
you,'' he said. ``Who fired Julius La Rosa?'' Mrs. Sanders didn't
hesitate. ``Arthur Godfrey,'' she said. ``Only seniors would know
that,'' he said, and went on his way.

   Peggy Minnis was explaining that the invasion of the sea lamprey
into the Great Lakes may have been eased by the locks in the canal
that joined the lakes. The 35 students in her environmental science
class at Pace University looked blank. She asked if they all knew
what locks were. A student raised her hand. ``Aren't they what you
have with bagels and cream cheese?'' she asked.

<P>
   Dr. Chester Redhead, anxious not to look as if he had just had a
trim, gave his barber specific instructions. ``Just a bit off the
left side, and on the right side a trifle over the ear toward the
back _ don't remove any from the top, just press it down, and at
the back just level it off at the neckline.''
</P>
<P>
   The barber looked at him thoughtfully. ``Doc,'' he said, ``why
don't I just give you a note to say that you have been here?''

   A day in the life of a 13-year-old in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  I am in eighth grade and I was sent home from school because
I had a stomach virus. I walked outside into a blizzard and raised
my arm to hail a cab. A couple stepped in front of me and when a
cab pulled up they pushed to get in. I said, ``Excuse me,'' very
loudly but the woman turned and said, ``We're taking this cab.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked to see if there were any other cabs, when a woman hit
me in the back with her umbrella. She kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   I stood on the corner, arm raised, when a meat-delivery truck
pulled up. One of the men came over and said, ``Hey babydoll, I
could give you a ride.'' I refused and raised my arm again.
</P>
<P>
   This time a white town car with a palm tree painted on the back
pulled up and the driver said: ``I don't have a passenger. Do you
want a ride?'' I refused just as a police car pulled up alongside
me. I was expecting an offer of a ride but instead one of the
officers said, ``Why aren't you in school?'' I told him I was going
home because I was sick and the officer said, ``Sure. Get home NOW.
Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a cab pulled up and I jumped in. The driver said, ``I
don't have any change, that OK?'' I had enough singles, so I
agreed. After a long ride, I paid, went into my house, put on my
pajamas, got into bed and went to sleep. _ SARAH CROW

Brooklyn Heights, where he was attending the anniversary party of

piece of paper taped to the window on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``You left your keys in the door. Come to this address,
press the right-hand buzzer to get your keys back.'' He did and his
keys were returned, reward refused. His conclusion: ``What a nice

time bombing New Jersey.''

   The woman standing at the supermarket meat counter noticed a
sign that read, ``Ask about our chicken and meat dating policy.''
She was so amused that she pointed to the sign and said to the man
standing next to her, ``You know, I've never dated a chicken in my
life.'' He laughed and said, ``No, but I bet you dated a turkey or

ADMINISTRATION MAKES CASE FOR U.S. FORCES IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's top intelligence
officials built the political foundation Tuesday for sending U.S.
troops to Kosovo once a peace plan is in place.
</P>
<P>
   George Tenet, director of the CIA, told the Senate Armed
Services Committed that a NATO ground force ``would be an
indispensable component in trying to bring some solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Patrick Hughes, director of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, said ``there needs to be some kind of security force in
Kosovo in order to stabilize the situation and protect human
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the fighting ceases, Hughes said, the conflict could
spread into the neighboring Balkan states of south-central Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if the warring parties are not in some
way separated and controlled, we all should expect increased
conflict in the coming spring and summer months,'' Hughes said.
``It's indeed a crisis situation, one that needs attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet stressed that a peace agreement is ``an indispensable
prerequisite before a ground force is put in.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony bolstered the efforts of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Sandy
Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, who have
held private discussions with congressional leaders in recent days
about the possibility of sending troops as part of a NATO force.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France have taken the lead in pressing the two sides
in the Kosovo conflict to hold talks this weekend near Paris. The
Europeans are hopeful that the two sides _ the ethnic Albanian
majority in Kosovo and the Serbs led by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia _ can reach an accord to restore peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo once enjoyed relative autonomy as a province of Serbia.
But Milosevic has gradually stripped away self rule, triggering a
rebellion in Kosovo last year that has led to violence between
rebels and Serbian forces, including recent mass killings of
civilians that are blamed on the security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is largely seen as the impetus for the ethnic violence
in neighboring Bosnia, where war raged for more than three years
before a U.S.-brokered peace deal was reached in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's national security team has found a receptive audience
on Capitol Hill for dispatching troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Tuesday, Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the chairman of
the Armed Services Committee, told Hughes and Tenet that _ assuming
a peace plan is in place _ ``it's my judgment that only a ground
force could hopefully provide a deterrence to further conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, said, ``I happen to be one who would favor our
participation'' in a NATO ground force, ``under the right
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., added that ``it's in our
national interest to be with our allies in NATO in the peacekeeping
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet said any ground force in Kosovo would face greater dangers
than troops encountered in Bosnia, in part because the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians are stockpiling arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bosnia, we had a situation where all parties had exhausted
themselves. That's not the situation ... today,'' Tenet said.
``People have a lot of arms, and there's a real threat out there
and we'll have to be very careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not yet made a decision on whether to send U.S.
troops should a peace plan emerge, Cohen said Monday. But he
stressed that any U.S. participation ``should be as small as it
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen declined to discuss specific numbers of troops, but
military officials believe the level would be well under 10,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, Clinton sent about 20,000 troops to Bosnia as part
of an international peacekeeping force. The president said at the
time that the mission would last about a year.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. forces are still in Bosnia, the level has been cut to
6,900 and will be reduced to about 6,200 troops in the next few
months. Cohen said that ``even more significant reductions'' are
planned.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a second here to welcome Latrell Sprewell to
the New York Knicks. That's exactly what New York City needs --
another borderline psychotic with a hair-trigger temper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell Sprewell, as you know, had some trouble with his last
NBA team, with his last coach...but he's now a proud member of the
New York Knicks and already he's adjusting to life in New York City
--he's sleeping with Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different how different people celebrate -- when the
Atlanta Falcons score, they dance around; when I score, I just
leave 50 bucks on the dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in New Jersey lost his hand several years ago...and now
within the last couple of weeks, they have given him a brand new
hand. He is the first recipient of a successful hand transplant.
It's an amazing thing. And the guy was saying it's an incredible
experience. He says now he feels like he's having sex with a total
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Mayor Giuliani, more bad news for New York City.
Mayor Giuliani is now saying New York City has a pit bull problem.
I think he's right. I think we do have a serious pit bull problem.
Earlier today, I saw a pit bull using a wire coat hanger to break
into a Toyota Camry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting. The pit bulls don't seem to be bothering
Mayor Giuliani, though. I guess it's just professional courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks happen to watch the Golden Globe Awards?...The
Golden Globe show, you may not have known this, was produced by
Dick Clark. Dick Clark is an amazing man. He's also producing the
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a moment here to welcome Pope John Paul II to
the United States. Earlier this afternoon, he landed in St. Louis.
It's been quite a trip for this guy -- first, it was Mexico, today
it's St. Louis, and this weekend he'll be in Miami headlining the
big Super Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very odd -- President Clinton is also in St. Louis. He
went there to talk to the Pope. He's trying to get the Pope to
endorse his very narrow definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After Clinton met with Pope John Paul II, the Pope was
immediately subpoenaed by Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pope John Paul II, you probably know about this, he was in the
United States, he was in Missouri yesterday...Yesterday, [he said]
mass for 100,000 people. Unbelievable! It's like the largest indoor
crowd ever in the United States of America. The crowd was crazy.
They even had those big fat guys spelling out P-O-P-E.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire was in St. Louis, he went to see the Pope and he
kissed the Pope's ring. Today -- listen to this -- the Pope
auctioned it off for $3.2 million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're getting your money's worth out of the
impeachment so far? It's fun, isn't it? As your watching it,
remember one thing -- this is your tax dollars at work. The
interstates are crumbling, but we get this all day on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the Senators want to ask a question, they have to
submit it in writing to Chief Justice Rehnquist. And, so far, the
single most often asked question written and submitted to Chief
Justice Rehnquist is, What's the deal with those stripes on your
robe?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the impeachment, whenever Ted Kennedy has a question,
he just writes it out on those cocktail napkins from Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks enjoying the impeachment? I don't think they know
what they're doing. For the second day in a row, the Senate met
behind closed doors for hours and hours and hours. Have no idea
what they're doing. Ted Kennedy came out three times for ice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, Monica Lewinsky flies into Washington, D.C.,
and the House trial managers interview her for three hours in
a...hotel room. Here's the strategy on that deal: they're thinking,
well, maybe we're not going to be able to get Clinton out of
office, but we sure can make him jealous.''

moved toward an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finally starting to happen. The impeachment trial is
dragging on very long, and if it goes on much longer, the bad news
is Clinton will not be able to have another sex scandal in this
term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole today announced that he purchased the Monica Lewinsky
apartment in the Watergate building in Washington. Isn't it crazy?
He apparently lived right next store and he purchased it, and I
understand from my friends at Century 21, he's furious. The deal
closed and he's furious --he found out that Monica doesn't come
with it.''

<P>
   `Decorating the brand-new apartment, that'll be a lot of fun for
Bob -- give him something to do while his wife's out running for
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole purchased Monica Lewinsky's apartment in the
Watergate building down there in Washington. Did you hear that?
Talk about odd coincidences. Turns out the apartment was a
cooperative and so, apparently, was Monica.''

   &UR; HOW THE GOP CAN RESCUE ITS IMAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By P.J. O'Rourke author of ``Eat the Rich.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could act on principle, following the dictates
of conscience and putting duty to the nation above personal and
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   They could get body piercings to project a more hip and with-it
image, especially the House Judiciary committee members. Watching
them on television caused all Americans to experience horrible
memories of being met at the door by the father of their prom date.
But, knowing Republicans, they'd probably pierce their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   A sexx-change operation for every male Republican leader would
be too expensive, even for a party with major corporate donors in
the health care field.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could wait for the inevitable financial bust,
but they didn't get much out of that in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could have sordid affairs, solicit tainted campaign
donations and practice highbinding and jobbery of every sort. This
works for Mr. Clinton, plus there's the advantage that the
Republicans are doing it already.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing the Republicans could do is extend a hand of
peace to the Democrats. They could let bygones be bygones, work
together with their opponents and show the electorate that
Republicans trust Democrats _ trust Democrats to have a George
McGovern, a Fritz Mondale or a Michael Dukakis waiting in the
wings. Or, indeed, an Al Gore.

   Questioning Monica Lewinsky again seems to Aunt Ilse from
Oelwein like one more reporter asking John Elway how the Broncos
won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Boris Yeltin's recent 68th birthday, his wife made him a
cabbage pie. If it happened to us, we'd think she doesn't want us
to last another year.
</P>
<P>
   There's at least a little consistency to the news. Both the
Super Bowl and the Clinton-Lewinsky affair are XXX-rated.

   &UR; CITY STREETS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  My husband and I were offered a friend's apartment in
Manhattan for the weekend and drove in, bicycles on our car. We
pulled into one space that was too close to a hydrant. We then
biked two blocks north and spotted a better space, safe, large and
legal.
</P>
<P>
   How to secure it in the face of the aggressive New York parker?
Inspiration struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call a cab,'' I said to my husband. He did and directed the
cabbie to park in our spot, meter running. Then he biked back to
the car, secured the bike and drove back to replace the cab.
</P>
<P>
   A $3 tab, including tip, paid for a great parking spot for the
weekend.

   A Washington relative of Barbara Fultz saw an exhibition of
angels in Baltimore and heard there were even better angels at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. He called and asked if Ms. Fultz would
find out how long the exhibition would be in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no angels at the Met,'' said the young man who
answered the information line. ``But there are fairies at the
Frick.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, helpfully, ``They both have wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney and Esther Sanders were on the Long Island Rail Road when
the conductor questioned their half-price senior tickets. They
assured him that they were indeed seniors. ``I'm going to test
you,'' he said. ``Who fired Julius La Rosa?'' Mrs. Sanders didn't
hesitate. ``Arthur Godfrey,'' she said. ``Only seniors would know
that,'' he said, and went on his way.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Minnis was explaining that the invasion of the sea lamprey
into the Great Lakes may have been eased by the locks in the canal
that joined the lakes. The 35 students in her environmental science
class at Pace University looked blank. She asked if they all knew
what locks were. A student raised her hand. ``Aren't they what you
have with bagels and cream cheese?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chester Redhead, anxious not to look as if he had just had a
trim, gave his barber specific instructions. ``Just a bit off the
left side, and on the right side a trifle over the ear toward the
back _ don't remove any from the top, just press it down, and at
the back just level it off at the neckline.''
</P>
<P>
   The barber looked at him thoughtfully. ``Doc,'' he said, ``why
don't I just give you a note to say that you have been here?''
</P>
<P>
   A day in the life of a 13-year-old in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  I am in eighth grade and I was sent home from school because
I had a stomach virus. I walked outside into a blizzard and raised
my arm to hail a cab. A couple stepped in front of me and when a
cab pulled up they pushed to get in. I said, ``Excuse me,'' very
loudly but the woman turned and said, ``We're taking this cab.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked to see if there were any other cabs, when a woman hit
me in the back with her umbrella. She kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   I stood on the corner, arm raised, when a meat-delivery truck
pulled up. One of the men came over and said, ``Hey babydoll, I
could give you a ride.'' I refused and raised my arm again.
</P>
<P>
   This time a white town car with a palm tree painted on the back
pulled up and the driver said: ``I don't have a passenger. Do you
want a ride?'' I refused just as a police car pulled up alongside
me. I was expecting an offer of a ride but instead one of the
officers said, ``Why aren't you in school?'' I told him I was going
home because I was sick and the officer said, ``Sure. Get home NOW.
Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a cab pulled up and I jumped in. The driver said, ``I
don't have any change, that OK?'' I had enough singles, so I
agreed. After a long ride, I paid, went into my house, put on my
pajamas, got into bed and went to sleep. _ SARAH CROW

   Peter M. Rowe, who lives in Iselin, N.J., recently parked in
Brooklyn Heights, where he was attending the anniversary party of
friends. Party over, he walked back to the car, where he noticed a
piece of paper taped to the window on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``You left your keys in the door. Come to this address,
press the right-hand buzzer to get your keys back.'' He did and his
keys were returned, reward refused. His conclusion: ``What a nice
city and what nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarita Zeppie on the No. 9 train overheard two teen-age boys
discussing the bombings in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   First boy: ``Do you think they'll bomb New York City?''
</P>
<P>
   Second boy: ``I hope not. What could we do if it happens?''
</P>
<P>
   First boy: ``If you had a dollar, we could take the PATH train
to New Jersey. We'd be safe there. Nobody's going to waste their
time bombing New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman standing at the supermarket meat counter noticed a
sign that read, ``Ask about our chicken and meat dating policy.''
She was so amused that she pointed to the sign and said to the man
standing next to her, ``You know, I've never dated a chicken in my
life.'' He laughed and said, ``No, but I bet you dated a turkey or
two.'' The woman thought a moment. ``Actually, I married one,'' she
said. She and the turkey are, unsurprisingly, now divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Evening, No. 3 train, not particularly crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Older homeless man, standing, talking to
middle-aged woman, sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Matthew W. Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``What's the next stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``Park Place or Fulton.''
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``Can I ask you something?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman, uneasily: ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Man moves directly in front of her and puts a crumpled $1 bill
in her face. She cringes.
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``Gimme a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``I don't have a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The door opens and as the man starts to leave, he says: ``You
know, you have fat legs. You should be glad you're not my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``I was thinking the same thing.''

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a second here to welcome Latrell Sprewell to
the New York Knicks. That's exactly what New York City needs --
another borderline psychotic with a hair-trigger temper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell Sprewell, as you know, had some trouble with his last
NBA team, with his last coach...but he's now a proud member of the
New York Knicks and already he's adjusting to life in New York City
--he's sleeping with Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different how different people celebrate -- when the
Atlanta Falcons score, they dance around; when I score, I just
leave 50 bucks on the dresser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy in New Jersey lost his hand several years ago...and now
within the last couple of weeks, they have given him a brand new
hand. He is the first recipient of a successful hand transplant.
It's an amazing thing. And the guy was saying it's an incredible
experience. He says now he feels like he's having sex with a total
stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``According to Mayor Giuliani, more bad news for New York City.
Mayor Giuliani is now saying New York City has a pit bull problem.
I think he's right. I think we do have a serious pit bull problem.
Earlier today, I saw a pit bull using a wire coat hanger to break
into a Toyota Camry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting. The pit bulls don't seem to be bothering
Mayor Giuliani, though. I guess it's just professional courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks happen to watch the Golden Globe Awards?...The
Golden Globe show, you may not have known this, was produced by
Dick Clark. Dick Clark is an amazing man. He's also producing the
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take a moment here to welcome Pope John Paul II to
the United States. Earlier this afternoon, he landed in St. Louis.
It's been quite a trip for this guy -- first, it was Mexico, today
it's St. Louis, and this weekend he'll be in Miami headlining the
big Super Bowl halftime show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very odd -- President Clinton is also in St. Louis. He
went there to talk to the Pope. He's trying to get the Pope to
endorse his very narrow definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After Clinton met with Pope John Paul II, the Pope was
immediately subpoenaed by Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pope John Paul II, you probably know about this, he was in the
United States, he was in Missouri yesterday...Yesterday, [he said]
mass for 100,000 people. Unbelievable! It's like the largest indoor
crowd ever in the United States of America. The crowd was crazy.
They even had those big fat guys spelling out P-O-P-E.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark McGwire was in St. Louis, he went to see the Pope and he
kissed the Pope's ring. Today -- listen to this -- the Pope
auctioned it off for $3.2 million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're getting your money's worth out of the
impeachment so far? It's fun, isn't it? As your watching it,
remember one thing -- this is your tax dollars at work. The
interstates are crumbling, but we get this all day on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the Senators want to ask a question, they have to
submit it in writing to Chief Justice Rehnquist. And, so far, the
single most often asked question written and submitted to Chief
Justice Rehnquist is, What's the deal with those stripes on your
robe?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``During the impeachment, whenever Ted Kennedy has a question,
he just writes it out on those cocktail napkins from Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You folks enjoying the impeachment? I don't think they know
what they're doing. For the second day in a row, the Senate met
behind closed doors for hours and hours and hours. Have no idea
what they're doing. Ted Kennedy came out three times for ice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the weekend, Monica Lewinsky flies into Washington, D.C.,
and the House trial managers interview her for three hours in
a...hotel room. Here's the strategy on that deal: they're thinking,
well, maybe we're not going to be able to get Clinton out of
office, but we sure can make him jealous.''

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS SAIPAN _ Since the dawn of aviation, people have
looked skyward and pondered, ``What the heck is that?''
</P>
<P>
   So it is with the V-22 tilt-rotor.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pentagon brass and the Marines who fly it can't seem to
make up their minds exactly what the Osprey is.
</P>
<P>
   The V-22 will serve as a troop transport aircraft for the
Marines. It can hover like a helicopter and, by tilting its giant
twin rotors forward, cruise like a turboprop plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's more airplane than helicopter,'' said Marine Lt.
Col. John Rudzis, who has logged more than 60 hours flying the
Osprey. ``It's an airplane that can do helicopter tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Mike Nowakowski, who has watched the Osprey conduct test
flights from the deck of his ship, the USS Saipan, considers the
V-22 a helicopter. ``It's got two rotors, and when it comes to me,
it lands and takes off like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Nowakowski made his statement, an Osprey hovering on the
Saipan's deck, turned toward the water and bolted away with
breathtaking speed, in stark contrast to the lumbering pace of the
aging CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters it will replace.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Maj. William Witzig, who has about 200 hours in an Osprey
cockpit, smiled after watching the V-22 maneuver and declared:
``It's a tilt-rotor. ... It's just a unique aircraft. There is
nothing else like it. You can call it an airplane or you can call
it a helicopter, but you are probably shortchanging it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marine Lt. Col. Keith Sweaney agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can hover better than any helicopter and fly better than
any turboprop,'' he said. ``It is the best of both worlds.''

<P>
   ``Busy day down there in Washington. If you're following the
impeachment proceedings, here's what happened: the Democrats moved
to dismiss, the Republicans moved for witnesses, President Clinton
moved toward an intern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's finally starting to happen. The impeachment trial is
dragging on very long, and if it goes on much longer, the bad news
is Clinton will not be able to have another sex scandal in this
term.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole today announced that he purchased the Monica Lewinsky
apartment in the Watergate building in Washington. Isn't it crazy?
He apparently lived right next store and he purchased it, and I
understand from my friends at Century 21, he's furious. The deal
closed and he's furious --he found out that Monica doesn't come
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   `Decorating the brand-new apartment, that'll be a lot of fun for
Bob -- give him something to do while his wife's out running for
President.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole purchased Monica Lewinsky's apartment in the
Watergate building down there in Washington. Did you hear that?
Talk about odd coincidences. Turns out the apartment was a
cooperative and so, apparently, was Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Dole likes Monica Lewinsky's apartment so well, I
understand he's going to try and buy Paula Jones' trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW THE GOP CAN RESCUE ITS IMAGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By P.J. O'Rourke author of ``Eat the Rich.'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could act on principle, following the dictates
of conscience and putting duty to the nation above personal and
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Nah.
</P>
<P>
   They could get body piercings to project a more hip and with-it
image, especially the House Judiciary committee members. Watching
them on television caused all Americans to experience horrible
memories of being met at the door by the father of their prom date.
But, knowing Republicans, they'd probably pierce their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   A sexx-change operation for every male Republican leader would
be too expensive, even for a party with major corporate donors in
the health care field.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans could wait for the inevitable financial bust,
but they didn't get much out of that in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could have sordid affairs, solicit tainted campaign
donations and practice highbinding and jobbery of every sort. This
works for Mr. Clinton, plus there's the advantage that the
Republicans are doing it already.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing the Republicans could do is extend a hand of
peace to the Democrats. They could let bygones be bygones, work
together with their opponents and show the electorate that
Republicans trust Democrats _ trust Democrats to have a George
McGovern, a Fritz Mondale or a Michael Dukakis waiting in the
wings. Or, indeed, an Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go haywire in other parts of the world it can have
an adverse effect here,'' Mr. Clinton says. For instance, say the
sun dies.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says his new budget is a ``new era of opportunity.''
That's also what he thought when Monica Lewinsky first showed him
her thong.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposed budget would spend $1.77 trillion. Soon
someone will have to look up what the next -illion is called.
</P>
<P>
   The new Clinton budget forecasts surpluses totaling $2.41
trillion over the next decade. That works out to about a nickel for
each time the president has taken credit for them.
</P>
<P>
   The president's proposed 2000 budget would spend $215.2 billion
in interest on money the government borrows. For that kind of dough
you used to be able to start a nice little country.
</P>
<P>
   In the next fiscal year, the government expects to collect $1.88
trillion. How about $1.8 trillion from Bill Gates and $.08 trillion
from the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   The White House wants Ken Starr held in contempt for violating
grand jury secrecy rules. Doesn't that depend on the meaning of the
word secrecy?
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have the impeachment trial end by Feb. 12. Yeah,
once pitchers and catchers show up for spring training, who will
pay attention?
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Monica Lewinsky again seems to Aunt Ilse from
Oelwein like one more reporter asking John Elway how the Broncos
won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Boris Yeltin's recent 68th birthday, his wife made him a
cabbage pie. If it happened to us, we'd think she doesn't want us
to last another year.

Super Bowl and the Clinton-Lewinsky affair are XXX-rated.

Manhattan for the weekend and drove in, bicycles on our car. We
pulled into one space that was too close to a hydrant. We then
biked two blocks north and spotted a better space, safe, large and

angels in Baltimore and heard there were even better angels at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. He called and asked if Ms. Fultz would
find out how long the exhibition would be in New York.

back _ don't remove any from the top, just press it down, and at
the back just level it off at the neckline.''
</P>

don't I just give you a note to say that you have been here?''

   &UR;  &LR;  I am in eighth grade and I was sent home from school because
I had a stomach virus. I walked outside into a blizzard and raised
my arm to hail a cab. A couple stepped in front of me and when a
cab pulled up they pushed to get in. I said, ``Excuse me,'' very
loudly but the woman turned and said, ``We're taking this cab.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked to see if there were any other cabs, when a woman hit
me in the back with her umbrella. She kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   I stood on the corner, arm raised, when a meat-delivery truck
pulled up. One of the men came over and said, ``Hey babydoll, I
could give you a ride.'' I refused and raised my arm again.
</P>
<P>
   This time a white town car with a palm tree painted on the back
pulled up and the driver said: ``I don't have a passenger. Do you
want a ride?'' I refused just as a police car pulled up alongside
me. I was expecting an offer of a ride but instead one of the
officers said, ``Why aren't you in school?'' I told him I was going
home because I was sick and the officer said, ``Sure. Get home NOW.
Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a cab pulled up and I jumped in. The driver said, ``I
don't have any change, that OK?'' I had enough singles, so I
agreed. After a long ride, I paid, went into my house, put on my
pajamas, got into bed and went to sleep. _ SARAH CROW

<P>
   Peter M. Rowe, who lives in Iselin, N.J., recently parked in
Brooklyn Heights, where he was attending the anniversary party of
friends. Party over, he walked back to the car, where he noticed a
piece of paper taped to the window on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   It read: ``You left your keys in the door. Come to this address,
press the right-hand buzzer to get your keys back.'' He did and his
keys were returned, reward refused. His conclusion: ``What a nice
city and what nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarita Zeppie on the No. 9 train overheard two teen-age boys
discussing the bombings in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   First boy: ``Do you think they'll bomb New York City?''
</P>
<P>
   Second boy: ``I hope not. What could we do if it happens?''
</P>
<P>
   First boy: ``If you had a dollar, we could take the PATH train
to New Jersey. We'd be safe there. Nobody's going to waste their
time bombing New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman standing at the supermarket meat counter noticed a
sign that read, ``Ask about our chicken and meat dating policy.''
She was so amused that she pointed to the sign and said to the man
standing next to her, ``You know, I've never dated a chicken in my
life.'' He laughed and said, ``No, but I bet you dated a turkey or
two.'' The woman thought a moment. ``Actually, I married one,'' she
said. She and the turkey are, unsurprisingly, now divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Evening, No. 3 train, not particularly crowded.
</P>
<P>
   Participants: Older homeless man, standing, talking to
middle-aged woman, sitting.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Matthew W. Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``What's the next stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``Park Place or Fulton.''
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``Can I ask you something?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman, uneasily: ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Man moves directly in front of her and puts a crumpled $1 bill
in her face. She cringes.
</P>
<P>
   Man: ``Gimme a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``I don't have a cigarette.''
</P>
<P>
   The door opens and as the man starts to leave, he says: ``You
know, you have fat legs. You should be glad you're not my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman: ``I was thinking the same thing.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Last June, Takaharu Akimoto's boss politely and
apologetically asked him to quit his job as a production manager at
Shoshiba Manufacturing Co., a midsized engine parts maker
affiliated with the beleaguered Nissan Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Impossible!' &UR;  &LR; '' Akimoto recalled. ``I told
him I didn't want to quit, please let me stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But in today's Japan, the impossible has become possible, and in
December, seven years shy of his retirement, Akimoto ``quit'' and
joined the 2.91 million other Japanese who are officially looking
for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst period of my life,'' he said. ``I've had
some serious setbacks before, but this is totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is suffering its highest rate of unemployment, 4.1
percent, since the government started keeping statistics in 1953.
Almost twice as many people are looking for jobs as there are job
openings, and many of the available positions are in low-paying,
unskilled areas.
</P>
<P>
   That strikes a blow to the heart of Japan's self-image, and the
whole country is reeling. Although Japan's unemployment is low
compared with the rate in many other countries, full employment, or
close to it, is a key clause in the social contract that has kept
the public complacent and one political party in power almost
consistently since World War II. Now, for the first time since the
lean years after Japan's defeat in the war, most people here know
someone who is out of a job _ and fear that they could be next.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the challenge of finding work, the jobless are
battling shame and despair. Akimoto, for instance, kept his job
loss a secret from his wife for a week. ``I was at a loss as to how
we would survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliation sometimes flares into anger, an emotion rarely
on public display in Japan. An irate job seeker waved his fist in
the face of a television reporter filming at one branch of the
government employment agency known as Hello! Work, accusing the
reporter of invading his privacy and seeking to capitalize on his
woes. Job seekers at another branch merely turned their faces away
the instant they saw a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese people are ashamed to be unemployed,'' said Masahide
Naito, who is in charge of job seekers over 45 at the Iidabashi
branch of Hello! Work. ``It's an embarrassment, something that you
hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese employment system, heavy on lifetime loyalty
guaranteed by seniority-based pay, has been crumbling since 1993,
when a slew of corporate titans started campaigns to trim their
work forces.
</P>
<P>
   But that erosion moved at the pace of molasses compared with
what happened last year, when the unemployment rate jumped an
alarming seven-tenths of a percentage point, to the current rate of
4.1 percent. Compounding the problem, companies struggling to avoid
layoffs cut wages, which fell 6.8 percent in December, the worst
decline on record.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics have rocked the psyche of a nation that has
previously regarded itself as blessedly immune from the economic
afflictions suffered by other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been hearing about such things on television, but now
I'm hearing these stories directly from my classmates, and I'm
hearing not just from one but from many,'' said Hisako Aoyama, one
of three women in a class of 28 studying janitorial services at the
Tokyo Metropolitan Shinagawa Technical College, a vocational school
financed by the city government.
</P>
<P>
   It is a deeply unsettling experience for most Japanese,
particularly the men over 45 who are being forced en masse out of
companies they joined as college graduates. Their high salaries and
looming lump-sum retirement payments provide an obvious target for
corporate cost-cutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 51, I'm at a time of change in my life,'' said Shigeru
Kikuya, a classmate of Mrs. Aoyama, who lost his job as a
procurement officer in a factory last March. ``The only thing I can
do is persevere and hope I can turn my life around.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects of landing a job for most men his age are slim
at best, according to officials at Hello! Work.
</P>
<P>
   After Akimoto, the former Shoshiba manager, finally told his
wife of his plight, she urged him to seek help from the Tokyo
Managers' Union, a group set up four years ago to represent middle
managers who are not union members.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime employee of Shoshiba whose salary had increased in
lock step with his seniority, Akimoto had expected to work at the
company until he retired at age 60. But with Nissan fighting for
its life, Akimoto's company could no longer afford to keep him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry,'' he said. ``But I don't know where to direct my
anger. The company did try to help me find another job at least.''
</P>
<P>
   The only jobs he has found so far are as a driver or as the man
who waves a light baton at construction sites to direct traffic. He
would earn less than 200,000 yen a month after tax, or about $1,770
at current exchange rates. That is less than the unemployment
benefits he receives, but those will run out in late March unless
he enrolls in a job training course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, rather than immediately taking a job as a driver, I
would like to continue to look for a while,'' Akimoto said. ``But
there is no question that my income will be less than half what I
was earning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the social costs that may accompany frustration of
the sort Akimoto is experiencing, the government goes to great
lengths to try to keep unemployment figures from rising, providing
generous public subsidies to companies to keep workers on their
payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so-called invisible unemployment in corporations
today that may become visible in the future, in which case the rate
will become much higher than it is now,'' warned Akira Amari, the
Labor Minister, at a recent press gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Amari refused to make any estimates about what the real level
would be. ``These kinds of figures can drive up the insecurity of
the Japanese consumer, so, excuse me, I cannot say what the figures
are,'' he said. ``It's my corporate secret.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret, though, that the need to create jobs provides
much of the impetus behind the vast sums of money the government
has spent on public works in the last several years. But although
the government has spent upward of $800 billion to stimulate
economic activity, the unemployment rate has climbed steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just after the measures are implemented, the number of jobs
that comes open increases a little,'' said Kazuaki Mishima, an
official at the Iidabashi Hello! Work office. ``But the effect
doesn't last long, the measures don't really have that much
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the record unemployment rate, what is remarkable is that
so many workers have retained their jobs. Automobile production
dropped more than 8 percent last year, for instance, and yet it is
rare to hear of an unemployed auto worker.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the head count is often the last resort for struggling
companies. The obligation binding employer to employee is still
strong here _ so strong that in some cases, business owners have
committed suicide so that their life insurance proceeds can be used
to pay workers and creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor Co. halted production at its plant in Thailand last
year but has kept workers on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And Mitsubishi Corp. encourages marginal workers to take a year
off for retraining at its expense, after which they can either find
work elsewhere or come back to the company. ``We cannot restructure
in the U.S. way,'' said Minoru Makihara, the chairman of Mitsubishi
and an outspoken proponent of greater labor mobility in Japan.
``The Japanese way of insuring the way of life and living is a very
respectable thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there are shortages of labor in important areas of
the economy, like computer technology. ``We're very good at making
computers but not so good at using them,'' he said. ``This is a
highly educated population. In six months, we could produce a whole
new corps of people who would be in great demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Masue Otani is someone who lost out to a computer. After working
seven years in the mail room at the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, she had to leave her job because she was being
replaced by a computer. ``Because I cannot use a computer, I'm
afraid I cannot find a job,'' she said as she scanned the job
offerings at the Iidabashi Hello! Work. ``Every available job asks
for someone who can use a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Otani, whose husband cannot work because of a chronic
stomach problem that periodically puts him in the hospital, is
making ends meet with her unemployment insurance, and her sons, who
live at home, give her a portion of their incomes. ``It's very
difficult and frightening,'' she said. ``I don't know what will
happen to us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many people are turning to vocational schools for retraining,
generating an explosion in demand for courses in gardening, home
health care and hotel and restaurant services, among others.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tokyo Metropolitan Shinagawa Technical College, 113
people applied for a class in business accounting that had room for
15 students. A class on home health care, a burgeoning business in
Japan, where the population is aging, was had 10 times as many
applicants as students.
</P>
<P>
   The college is unlikely to expand to meet the demand, however.
The bulk of its budget comes from the Tokyo metropolitan
government, which is effectively bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of students has changed markedly in the last year, said
Naomitsu Kondo, the school's director. ``We've always had some new
college graduates seeking training, but recently there has been a
big influx of people coming in because of restructuring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshi Kono is one of the new breed of students. Now 58, Kono
has lost two jobs to restructuring in the last three years. For
much of his working life, he was an employee of a major supermarket
chain, most recently the director of building security and safety.
He lost that job a couple of years ago and began driving a delivery
truck for a smaller supermarket company.
</P>
<P>
   That job, too, evaporated, and now Kono is learning how to use a
mop to put a high-gloss shine on linoleum floors and how to dispose
of garbage that has to be separated for recycling most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that my experience is totally useless in getting a
job,'' he said. ``There seem to be a lot of positions available
cleaning office buildings after hours, so I'm taking this class.''
</P>
<P>
   Kono expects to earn about one-third of his previous income. He
no longer goes fishing and hiking with his friends, although he has
scraped together enough money to send his daughter to college.
</P>
<P>
   For all his hard work and effort, Kono may never find work
again. As of last December, only 25 percent of the school's March
graduates had found jobs _ and men over 45, whose former salaries
were high, have extremely limited opportunities. At the Hello! Work
office in Iidabashi recently, there were only four new listings of
jobs for men over 45, while the bulletin board featuring new
listings for women under 35, a group that is also marked by high
unemployment, is covered with job descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Kikuya, Kono's classmate, has been out of work since March, but
he still finds his situation incomprehensible. He looked for months
for another clerical job where he could make use of his experience
administering a midsized machine tools manufacturer but found
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people will say I was too optimistic,'' Kikuya said. ``I
expected it to be difficult, but I never expected it to be
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the traditional Japanese employment system to
sitting in a tub of lukewarm water, a favorite metaphor here for
describing a life that is not overly comfortable but not unpleasant
either. But he was thrown out of the tub and feels colder leaving a
tub of lukewarm water than one filled with scalding water. ``If you
are in lukewarm water,'' he said, ``you are lulled into
ignorance.''

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Members of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force, announced Tuesday that they
would attend peace talks in France over the weekend and meet their
Serbian opponents at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Jakup Krasniqi, a spokesman for the rebel force, made the
announcement after an assembly of key military commanders in the
village of Likovac in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some objections to the proposed document, but we are
certainly ready to go,'' Krasniqi told local reporters in Likovac,
adding that delegates would be named on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, in Rambouillet, outside Paris, have been called to
force an end to the conflict in the separatist Serbian province.
The Yugoslav government, which is under the threat of NATO
bombardment if it fails to pull back its forces and stop the
fighting, has yet to say whether it will attend the talks. Serbia
is one of two republics remaining in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the guerrillas to take part in the peace talks,
alongside the political leadership of Kosovo, will bring world
attention to the little-known Kosovo Liberation Army, known as the
KLA. Members will probably have only four places on a negotiating
team of 15 from the ethnic Albanian side, but their participation
is seen as crucial to ending the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   If the talks take place, it will be the first time that Serbian
officials sit down with members of what they have consistently
called a ``terrorist organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The West is sending signals to the KLA that Paris is a chance
for its political coronation,'' said Dukagjin Gorani, editor of the
local Albanian daily newspaper, Koha Ditore, who is close to
leading members of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace on the ground will depend on the Albanians and not the
Serbs,'' Gorani said. ``The Serbs simply have to deal with them.''
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue is the status of Kosovo, a once-autonomous area
where 90 percent of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Albanians.
The Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, rescinded Kosovo's
autonomy 10 years ago and his government insists that Kosovo remain
part of Serbia, under Belgrade's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Krasniqi, who is expected to head the rebel group's delegation
to the talks, said his group demands that Kosovo be given the
status of an international protectorate for three years and that
the people of Kosovo make the final decision on its status in a
referendum at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the Kosovo Liberation Army to take part in the
talks was not unanimous. Adem Demaqi, a veteran dissident and major
political figure in the organization, said Tuesday that he was
opposed to having the organization go to the talks and said he
would not take part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not being asked to France to make peace _ we are being
asked to France to capitulate,'' he said at a news conference here
in the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats dismissed Demaqi's outburst, describing him as
a ``marginal character.'' Instead a core of young commanders is
emerging as the important political force in the rebel group, said
the editor, Gorani.
</P>
<P>
   Hashim Thaci, a 30-year-old former military commander and now
leader of the political directorate, is expected to attend the
talks. He has emerged as the main advocate of participating in the
talks as the beginning of a political process toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the upcoming political figure and is making a deeper
impression as the voice of reason in the KLA,'' said Gorani.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel group's decision to go to the talks was widely
welcomed in Kosovo, where an upsurge in fighting in the last month
has forced 45,000 civilians to flee their homes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For the Albanian people, the talks must take place, even
though we no longer have any trust,'' said Izmet Emini, 45, a
factory worker. Emini was among a crowd of people waiting outside
the town hospital in Pristina on Tuesday trying to claim the bodies
of relatives killed by Serbian forces in the village of Racak more
than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Emini pulled a chunk of bone from his pocket. He said it was a
piece of the skull of his dead brother, Ajet Emini, whose head had
been shattered when he was killed. After the slaying of the 45
villagers, family and friends had laid out the bodies in the
village mosque in preparation for burial, when the Serbian police
forced their way into the village and removed the bodies, taking
them to Pristina for autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been for three weeks with tears in our eyes,'' Emini
said. ``We came to take them home today.'' But he left
empty-handed, saying the authorities had ignored the families.
</P>
<P>
   Fatima Salihu, a young woman in a white head scarf, was beside
him. Her brothers _ Yashar, 24, Raif, 20, and Shukre, 18 _ had been
killed. ``We are scared,'' she said. ``But we hope the talks will
help. We hope that world opinion will help us get out of this
situation.''

`DHARMA &AMP; GREG' STAR MAKES THE LEAP TO THEATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You have a hit TV show. You've just won a Golden
Globe and a TV Guide award, and you have two highly anticipated
movies coming out.
</P>
<P>
   In short, you're a hot property.
</P>
<P>
   So what are you doing rehearsing a one-act play for no pay at a
99-seat Equity-waiver theater? Oh, and one more thing, the only
other play you've been in was in high school, and now you'll have a
live audience up close and personal _ no cameras, no retakes, no
one yelling ``cut.'' So why take the chance that you'll fall on
your face, or that the critics will dismiss you as just a TV
actress.
</P>
<P>
   If you're Jenna Elfman, it's because you're not one to rest on
your ``laurels and get comfortable.'' So you take a role in
``Visions and Lovers: Variations on a Theme,'' written and directed
by Milton Katselas and co-starring ``Lateline'' regular Miguel
Ferrer. ``I'm doing it to stretch myself into new areas. I want to
surprise people. I want to surprise myself,'' says the star of the
highly rated ABC series ``Dharma &AMP; Greg.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking to Elfman, you instantly see how she connects with her
TV character. For Dharma and Jenna, the glass is never half empty.
Yet in some ways TV stars can be too identified with their
characters.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if taking a ``sexy role'' in a play was motivated by
wanting people to take her seriously as an actress, she assures you
it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never take a part just to legitimize myself in other
people's eyes, because you're bound to fail because it's the wrong
reason for doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she wanted to do ``Visions'' after she saw it performed
in one of Katselas' workshops. ``Visions'' is two one-act plays.
(Because of their schedules, Elfman and Ferrer will not be in all
performances at the Skylight Theatre in Los Angeles.)
</P>
<P>
   In the second one, Elfman plays a fashion model who becomes
involved with a successful writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool thing about this play is ... it's completely how
relationships are,'' says Elfman. ``You know, they start off great.
Then you get into (she makes a creaking sound) ... (It's about) how
people cover a lot in life, saying, `No, things are fine,' or `No,
it's cool,' even though there is something there you should be
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that Elfman, Ferrer and Katselas have come
together for this play. Katselas has been Elfman's acting coach for
many years, and she credits him with helping her put her career
back on track after she had quit for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of went back because he (Katselas) thought I could do
it, and I thought, `If he thinks I can do it, then I probably can
do it,' because I respect his opinion immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran director, who has been teaching for more than 30
years and has directed the likes of Al Pacino on stage, remembers
the first scene Elfman did for him in class. ``It was a kind of
sexy scene, a combination of humor and sensuality ... and I
thought, `If this is the first scene ... wow, this girl has got
something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Katselas says that when Elfman wanted to quit, he told her it
was ridiculous, that she was going to be a star. ``I just saw in
her what I still see in her, which is a courage to do anything.
Then there was this enormous likability about her ... She has this
great sense of humor that I think helps her in all of what she
does.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer, the son of Oscar-winning actor Jose Ferrer and singer
Rosemary Clooney, last studied with Katselas 15 years ago. But
Ferrer says he was happy to be working with the director again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider him a mentor. Almost like a big brother that I
never had,'' says Ferrer, who notes that Katselas directed his
father in a play in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Katselas, for his part, believes Miguel is ``up there with his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfman and Ferrer, however, didn't know each other when the play
began rehearsals more than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know how Jenna looked, says Ferrer. ``I had
never seen `Dharma &AMP; Greg.' I had heard the name, of course. And
she had never seen my work; so we both came to this thing without
any preconceived notions of one another, which turned out to be a
great way to approach the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfman says she feels lucky to be working with Ferrer, who says
he hasn't done a play himself in 12 or 13 years. ``Miguel and I
really trust and support each other,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Which has been necessary because it's been a long rehearsal
process due to Elfman and Ferrer's taping schedules. They began
working on the play last summer, and Katselas has done a fair
amount of rewriting since as part of the workshop process.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how much rewriting, Ferrer laughed and said ``a
lot.'' For both actors, it's been frustrating at times _ but worth
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit of a slow study, so when I got to relearn all that
stuff, it can be a bit daunting,'' says Ferrer. ``But the fact of
the matter is that every time he changed something it was better,
so I couldn't really bitch too loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's coming down to the wire, and Katselas says he's
continuing to rewrite, and things are getting tight at the end.
</P>
<P>
   As the opening nears, Elfman is both excited and a bit
apprehensive and wonders if the fans and critics will be
``supportive and into it, or hypercritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the sensation of it all, because it's very exciting and
unpredictable, and I like that,'' says Elfman. ``I'm very confident
of the play. I just have to get through opening night and see,''
she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has performed before live crowds as a ballerina
(she trained classically) and as a go-go dancer on a ZZ Top tour,
her only stage experience was in a high school play written and
directed by Jake Kasdan (the son of director Lawrence Kasdan), who
has gone on to direct his own films (``Zero Effect''). So the
prospect of putting herself face-to-face with an audience is
``thrilling and scary'' for Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything, as she talks Elfman keeps stressing that
she's doing this for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One, to work with Katselas: ``Milton's quite an extraordinary
artist. He's a photographer and a painter, a teacher, a writer, a
director. And he's not a dilettante. He's a complete ass-kicker in
every single one.''
</P>
<P>
   Two, as a learning experience: ``Because there are no sets or
props (there's a box), and there are locations, you have to create
the ocean, create the art gallery, create it for the audience and
hold it in place for them. It's really challenging and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Being on stage has given Elfman enthusiasm for the theater (not
that she needs any more enthusiasm), and she talks about taking a
year off from her film and TV commitments and doing more theater
when the time is right.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, on a trip to New York City, she saw Holly Hunter in
``The Impossible Marriage'' and Nicole Kidman in ``The Blue Room.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kidman, Elfman is playing a provocative role on stage, but,
unlike Kidman, she doesn't bare her bottom. ``I do take my clothes
off, but I have a bra and underwear on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Elfman also has two major films on the way. The first is Ron
Howard's ``EDtv,'' in which Matthew McConaughey plays a video store
clerk who allows his life to be the subject of a television
program. Elfman plays his girlfriend. The film hits theaters in
late March. The other one is ``Town and Country,'' set for
September, with heavyweights Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton and Goldie
Hawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Elfman tries to keep a perspective on things.
She still visits her parents in the San Fernando Valley (``The same
house since I was born.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going there because it keeps me grounded. My husband
(actor Bodhi Elfman) keeps me grounded. Milton keeps me grounded. I
kind of love having a normal life ... I love the Northridge mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Does it bother her when people come up to her and say, ``Hey,
Dharma!''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I get that everywhere. It very sweet, and it doesn't bother
me. It means they're kind of relating to the character, and that
was my goal. ... People are always respectful about it, and I like
that it touches them. ... It makes me happy,'' she says.

HEY BUDDY, LEGENDS NEVER DIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Don McLean's claim in ``American Pie'' that it was the
day the music died is debatable, but one thing isn't: When Buddy
Holly was killed in a plane crash 40 years ago today, his
</P>
<P>
   legend was born.
</P>
<P>
   You know the story. Holly, Richie Valens and the Big Bopper died
when their plane crashed on takeoff in Clear Lake, Iowa. Holly, one
of rock's first stars, became one of its first martyrs, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've never heard a note of Holly's music, you're
doubtless aware of his status as a rock icon _ youth, innovation,
rebellion and tragedy all captured in a scratched pair of
horn-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Holly's band, the Crickets, will be in Clear Lake today, playing
a concert, along with some of Holly's peers. Gary and Ramona
Tollett were invited, but they aren't leaving the warmth of their
home in Arizona City, Ariz., to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go,'' Ramona said, ``but my husband said no, we
don't have clothes for it _ `We're not going to buy $2,000 worth of
clothes to go up there for that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Tolletts can do without the concert. They still have their
memories. They sang background vocals on Holly's first big hit,
``That'll Be the Day,'' in 1957. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Buddy who?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they were there at the start. How unknown was
Holly? Gary wanted to make a record himself. He and Ramona were
married and living in Lubbock, Texas, and he needed musicians. His
cousin pointed out a young guitar player _ Holly. They rehearsed
for months. ``In the meantime,'' Gary said, ``he said he had a song
he wanted to record.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Gary and Ramona if they would sing on ``That'll Be the
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   They would drive the 100 miles to the studio in Clovis, N.M.,
where Holly and Gary were recording. ``The way Buddy drove, it
didn't take very long,'' Gary said, laughing. ``He had a heavy
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way the Tolletts talk about Holly. To them he's not a
dead icon. He's a friend who's no longer around. They don't dwell
on the plane crash. They dwell on the guitar player they knew, and
remember the year or so they hung around together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time we spent with him was just drinking Cokes and
eating Fritos and singing,'' Ramona said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And working on music,'' Gary added.
</P>
<P>
   Gary and Ramona left the music business. They've lived in
Arizona most of their lives. Gary recently retired from a
cotton-seed company. Ramona worked for a few years for the
sanitation district in Arizona City; she's retired, too.
</P>
<P>
   But they still sing gospel music, and they still enjoy their
brush with Holly. Told that they probably didn't want to be
pigeonholed as the couple who sang with you-know-who, Ramona begged
to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me to be known as a backup singer to Buddy
Holly,'' she said. ``I'm proud of it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still gaining fans &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gary released a record called ``Go Boy Go!'' last year.
It's what he recorded _ with Holly playing guitar _ in 1957. They
still attend Buddy Holly festivals, like the one in England two
years ago where they met a 14-year-old fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just gushed, gushed, gushed,'' Gary said. ``That shows you
that we have new fans coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   But why? Why is Holly still gaining fans 40 years after he drew
his last breath?
</P>
<P>
   His music, of course, is part of the answer. But the Tolletts
know there is something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is the mystique that he didn't go on,'' Ramona
said. ``He's frozen at the age of 22. We all still think of him as
that onstage presence, the charisma he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Distasteful as it sounds, untimely death can be a great career
move in rock and roll. Neil Young was wrong _ it's not really
better to burn out than fade away. But when a star dies on top,
like Kurt Cobain or Jimi Hendrix or Holly, we never see their
decline. We see the promise of what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had big plans,'' Ramona said of Holly. But his death made
him bigger than those plans could have. He won't grow older. He'll
just continue to rave on. &QL;

FIRING, FELONS CAUSE UPROAR 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHINO VALLEY, Ariz. - For its town manager, the council here
hired a convicted felon who stole nearly half a million dollars
from a trust for the blind.
</P>
<P>
   Council members knew about William Sizemore's past, but decided
to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Next, a town official hired a paroled killer _ brother-in-law of
a council member _ to help run Chino Valley's motocross track.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sizemore and the council fired Police Chief Pat Huntsman, a
popular official who was an instructor at the FBI Academy,
Arizona's first woman police chief and the American Legion's pick
as among America's top 40 cops.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint: She didn't place enough trust in her superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a problem here?
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly, says 82-year-old Hank Bisjak, a former
councilman and state representative and the town's elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could film `America's Most Wanted' here and never leave
Town Hall,'' Bisjak groused.
</P>
<P>
   In this town of 7,000, Town Hall has become the focus of a
political dogfight that's both typical of many small towns and a
reflection of the changes coursing through Yavapai County.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees and other outsiders are streaming into this water-rich
plateau. And newer arrivals in town government say a chasm has
developed between the good old boys and immigrants with a more
urbane approach toward local issues.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime residents say it's simply a matter of cowboys vs.
cons.
</P>
<P>
   And the cowboys are raising a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   A recall election for Mayor Kate Nelson and four council members
is set for March. Outrage at Town Council meetings led
administrators at first to cancel public input.
</P>
<P>
   Then they put it back in _ as the last agenda item deep in the
night _ and they gave permission for all town officials to leave
except the sergeant-at-arms.
</P>
<P>
   But such tactics don't discourage Jack Coon.
</P>
<P>
   Coon, a gruff retired Marine sergeant who carries a briefcase
covered with anti-Jane Fonda bumper stickers, goes to the lectern
at each meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He uses his three minutes to read from the court record of
Sizemore's 1986 conviction in Oregon for bank larceny, interstate
transportation of stolen money and receipt of stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   Coon spends much of the rest of his time documenting Sizemore's
town expenses and checking out rumors of skeletons in the closets
of other town employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a disgrace to have a town manager who stole from the
blind,'' Coon said, ``and I'm going to see that this comes to an
end.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sizemore said last week that he wishes people
would be more forgiving. He said he paid his debt to society by
making furniture for the government during his 27 months behind
bars. Sizemore later became town manager in St. Croix Falls, Wis.,
and Beloit, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   But those posts were not without controversy. When the mayor of
St. Croix Falls tried to keep Sizemore's background a secret and
town residents found out, she was recalled from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 10 years working in municipal government since I was
released,'' Sizemore said. ``You would think that I would be looked
at as a success story for trying to get my life together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore was an attorney working in Tigard, Ore., in the early
1980s when one of his clients, Harry Ludwig, asked him to set up a
trust fund that would provide loans for blind college students.
Ludwig died shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   After Ludwig's death, Sizemore got permission from fund trustees
to move more than $400,000 into another account that Sizemore said
would provide the money to the needy. Instead, he used it to pay
off a vehicle and house loan and transferred the rest to Swiss and
German banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, Chino Valley's mayor, said last week people should let
bygones be bygones. She said Sizemore has been an excellent
administrator who has modernized personnel policies and grant
applications for the rapidly growing town of 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson also noted that Sizemore isn't bonded to handle money.
</P>
<P>
   And money was the key in Sizemore's hiring, Councilman Carl
Clickner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line is other applicants with his qualifications were
asking for $100,000 a year. He asked for $60,000. He wanted us to
be low key about his past and we decided to gamble that the public
reaction wouldn't be too extreme,'' Clickner said.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Main, a former councilman who backed Sizemore's hiring
and is running against Nelson in the recall election, said he made
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Sizemore) acknowledged that he was convicted of a
felony,'' Main said. ``It was our fault for not investigating. I
just thought he was a young lawyer who had screwed up by illegally
transfering funds across state lines. It obviously was a lot worse
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The town also got a lot more than just a motocross track worker
when it hired John Earl Brinnon last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brinnon was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in California in
1992 and sentenced to eight years in prison. Court records in El
Centro, Calif., indicate that Brinnon shot to death his sister's
abusive boyfriend. He also was charged two years ago in a
California domestic violence case, which is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was as surprised as everyone else when they offered him a
job,'' said Clickner, Brinnon's brother-in-law. ``Given his
situation, it was a most excellent opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Findlayson, the town's recreation director, said
Brinnon had been a volunteer at the track before he was hired.
Findlayson said she talked to Brinnon's parole officer after being
informed of his background and was satisfied that Brinnon would be
a good town employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has committed no crimes against children. In fact, he's
great with children,'' Findlayson said. ``Hey, he was protecting
his sister from an abusive boyfriend. I would have done the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, town residents also have been supportive of Huntsman,
the former police chief who was fired last month despite national
recognition for expertise in counseling children and community
policing.
</P>
<P>
   Signs are posted in the windows of houses throughout town. A
defense fund was set up for a $4 million federal lawsuit she filed
against the town last week.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore's job review of Huntsman last June gave her an
unsatisfactory rating only on the question of loyalty to her
superiors, saying that ``she has a mistrust of elected officials
and town management in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that, jokes Frank Rodrigues, as he strolls to his
regular seat inside the town's Ugly Green Cafe. He loosens his
vest, doffs his Stetson and notes that the snow clouds are hanging
mighty low in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a wildfire burning like crazy in this town,''
Rodrigues said. ``Looks to me like it's about to consume city
hall.'' &QL;

FIGURE IN BOLLES BOMB MURDER CASE DIES IN POVERTY  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Phoenix attorney Neal Roberts, a shadowy figure in the
1976 car-bomb murder of ``Arizona Republic'' reporter Don Bolles,
died in poverty last week at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who asserted that his life was ruined by the notorious
murder case, was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was unknown, but Roberts, once a fine tennis
player and a ladies' man, had long suffered from multiple
sclerosis, which caused him to lose the use of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services will be private.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was never charged in the Bolles murder and asserted that
he was not involved. But he was closely linked to people and events
involved in the killing, and was often described as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Sellers, who was the lead investigator on the Bolles murder
for the Phoenix police, said he believes Roberts knew much more
about the case than he ever told.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Sellers, mysteries remain in the wake of Roberts'
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that we'll never be able to fully explore what Neal
Roberts knew or didn't know in relation to the bombing of Don
Bolles,'' said Sellers, now a private investigator. ``Whatever
secrets he had he took with him to the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are still interested in any leads in the Bolles
case that turn up, said George Weisz, Gov. Jane Hull's executive
assistant for criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   Weisz spent years digging into the murder as case agent on the
investigation for the Arizona Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bolles, 47, died 11 days after a remote-control dynamite bomb
exploded underneath his car at a midtown Phoenix hotel June 2,
1976.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' name surfaced early in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Bolles' death, after being given limited
immunity, Roberts theorized to police that Kemper Marley Sr., a
wealthy rancher and liquor wholesaler, had ordered the slaying in
an act of ``rangeland justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent motive, Roberts said, was that the reporter had
written stories unfavorable to Marley that may have cost Marley a
seat on the Arizona Racing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   That theory appeared to be borne out later in the case when John
Harvey Adamson, an arsonist and clothes thief who aspired to be a
hit man, testified that Phoenix contractor Max Dunlap hired him to
kill Bolles.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Adamson, was that the reporter had upset
Marley, who was Dunlap's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Marley was never charged in the crime and steadfastly
denied any involvement in it up until his death in 1990 at age 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters in the case all seemed to swirl around
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Adamson, a drinking buddy of Roberts, and Dunlap, one of the
lawyer's clients, met at or near Roberts' home-office in central
Phoenix on the morning of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dunlap's lawyers later asserted that Roberts, not
Dunlap, masterminded the killing.
</P>
<P>
   And, for a variety of reasons, police long suspected that he was
involved in the murder in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts chartered a plane so that Adamson and his wife could fly
to Lake Havasu City, Ariz., after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A one-legged gambler named Hank Landry told investigators that
Roberts talked about the bombing before it happened.
</P>
<P>
   And Dunlap, who delivered a payoff to Adamson after the bombing,
claimed Roberts had duped him into doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But Adamson always said Roberts had nothing to do with the
reporter's killing.
</P>
<P>
   There were several trials in the Bolles murder over the course
of many years.
</P>
<P>
   Adamson, who admitted he put the bomb on Bolles' car, was
convicted of the murder and served more than 20 years in prison. In
1996, he was placed in the federal witness protection program after
testifying against Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap was twice convicted of Bolles' murder and was sentenced
in 1994 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   James Robison, a plumber who Adamson said touched off the bomb
by remote control, was acquitted of the murder, but pleaded guilty
to trying to have Adamson killed to keep Adamson from testifying
against him.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts drifted along for years in the wake of the case, a man
slowly degenerating from disease, lack of work and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the murder, Roberts was prominent and politically
well-connected.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Roberts, the case ruined him. Adverse
publicity destroyed his law practice, he said, and the stress of
being investigated undermined his health.
</P>
<P>
   Though Roberts was never arrested in the Bolles murder, he was
put on trial for hiring Adamson to blow up a government-leased
building in Phoenix in which Roberts held an interest. Roberts was
eventually acquitted of that attempted bombing, which went awry
when the bomb was found before it could explode.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, and in the ongoing Bolles investigation, Roberts
contended that he was hounded by police for years. The stress drove
him to drink, he said. &QL;

GIFT OF GAB GENERATES MORE DISCUSSION _ WITH TEACHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mom, my teacher wants to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No! A thousand times no!'' screams the legion of voices in
my head.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of dissolving into a puddle of anxiety before my
impressionable baby child, I smile at him and calmly say, ``Really?
Why does your teacher want to talk to me?''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno. Maybe it's about me being so smart that they want me
to skip a grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his last report card, I have serious doubts that
his genius IQ will be the topic of conversation. You know there's a
problem when the teacher wants a conference. No one is going to ask
you to take time off work and come to school just so they can tell
you that you have a great kid.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, I already knew what they were going to tell me. It's
the same thing they tell me every year. Usually, I'm summoned
before the first six weeks are up. This time we made it halfway
through the year. I guess that's progress. Basically, my son talks
too much and he likes to clown around. He's the same way at home.
We've tried everything to make him focus and be more serious, to no
avail. So here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   On the designated day, I found myself perched in a kid-size
chair with my thighs peering over the side looking for gum beneath
the seat.
</P>
<P>
   The first teacher said, ``I want you to know how much I enjoy
having your son in my class. He's a great kid.''
</P>
<P>
   I thanked her and braced myself for the ``however'' part.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very popular with the other children. He has great social
skills,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   I recognized that one. That's nice teacher lingo for, ``He talks
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the second teacher spoke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just concerned that he's not applying himself. He gets
his work done but he doesn't always give it his complete focus. We
think he could do better.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, ``He doesn't have an attention deficit disorder, he
just talks too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting went on a while but, ultimately, it boiled down to,
``He talks too much.'' I pledged to work with the teachers to
improve my son's performance in the classroom. We discussed various
techniques, from points to prizes to reward positive behavior. When
the meeting was done, I stood, brushed the carpet lint off my hips
and thanked the teachers for their time and dedication toward
educating the youth of our country.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, my husband and I talked with my son about
the meeting. My son crossed his heart and pledged to turn over a
new leaf.
</P>
<P>
   After he left the room, my husband asked, ``Do you think he'll
make it until summer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I averaged two conferences a year until high
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding! Ms. Honor Roll got into trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell me,'' he said. ``You talked too much, right?''
</P>

BOSTON POPS CROSSES OVER WITH GRAMMY-NOMINATED `THE CELTIC ALBUM`

   LOS ANGELES _ This year's Grammy Award nominations provide
several firsts _ a new category for best classical crossover album
and the first nod for the Boston Pops Orchestra and its conductor,
Keith Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, only the 20th conductor of the orchestra since its
inception in 1885, led the Boston Pops in the recording of its
nominated disc, ``The Celtic Album'' (RCA Victor), a collection of
traditional and contemporary Celtic music, featuring ``Riverdance''
fiddler Eileen Ivers and the Irish-American musical ensemble
Cherish the Ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The album is crossover in its truest sense,'' Lockhart
explained. ``It takes you from the core of the symphonic repertoire
through movie music through Celtic folk music and the obligatory
`Riverdance' segment through Celtic rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing the disc, which also features ``The Hebrides'' by Felix
Mendelssohn, is a medley of reels, including one by Irish pop star
Van Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something unique to the Boston Pops rather
than do a rehash,'' the conductor said. ``This crossover bird is a
strange one indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lockhart and the Boston Pops signed a four-year,
six-album contract with RCA, the orchestra's original label for
which conductor Arthur Fiedler made countless popular recordings.
``The Celtic Album'' is the third disc in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, considering the long history of the Pops on TV and
on tour, the orchestra has never won the record academy's highest
honor, even with the world-renowned Fiedler and later John Williams
(the composer of ``Star Wars'' and numerous film scores) at the
helm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to be the first to bring one back to Boston,''
Lockhart, 39, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the Celtic effort came from RCA executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us a lot of latitude,'' Lockhart said, adding that
he and the orchestra's artistic administrator Dennis Alves ``sat in
a closed room and listened to CD after CD and score after score to
come up with something that resembled an album.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off. Along with the Grammy nod, the album has
lingered in Billboard's Top Classical Crossover chart for nearly a
full year.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Lockhart, who was last year appointed music
director of the Utah Symphony, plans to attend the Grammy ceremony
Feb. 24 at the Shrine Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big thrill, and the hoopla and hype is what it's all
about,'' he said. ``This is, of course, my first nomination. That
in itself makes this a very special occasion no matter what
happens. It's wonderful to have one's work and the work of the
Boston Pops recognized.''

 &HT;    Wilkins set to try NBA again after European stint
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blunted in his attempt to return to the Atlanta Hawks,
Dominique Wilkins is trying to catch on with another team in the
NBA, agent Steve Kauffman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman listed Orlando, Phoenix, Houston and Miami as potential
homes for Wilkins, the No. 8 all-time scorer in league history and
the highest-scoring Atlanta Hawk ever.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Wilkens wanted to return to the Hawks five years
after being traded to the Clippers for Danny Manning, he did not
think that he would be welcome, Kauffman said. ``He told me, 'No
way Lenny will have me back on the team.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hawks general manager Pete Babcock disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three conversations with Steve, and I explained to him
that we at one time had problems at 'Nique's position (of small
forward) but that this was no longer the case. I made it clear that
we were after LaPhonso Ellis, that we really liked our rookie
(Roshown McLeod) and that we wanted to keep both Tyrone Corbin and
Chris Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply had no room for Dominique,'' Babcock said, ``but I
can state categorically that he would be welcomed back here as a
player under different circumstances and that when he leaves the
game, we will retire his number, and we will do it up right.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins' No. 21 already has been removed from the club's list of
available uniform numbers. It is not even used in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman said he expects Wilkins, 38, to be under contract
somewhere by Friday, opening night, or shortly thereafter, probably
playing for the league's 10-year player minimum of $1 million.
``Excepting Rod Strickland, he and Jim Jackson are the two best
unsigned free agents available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he can play next year, too,'' Kauffman said. ``He
showed last year in Europe (at Bologna) that he's in great shape
and he can still play. He averaged 18 (points) and nine (rebounds).
That's tough to do over there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is some resistance to Wilkins from teams who
wonder if he can accept a subordinate rule. ``There's no question
he can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman pointed out that Wilkins is not the only former Hawks
player who sought unsuccessfully to return here. ``They don't bring
players back like the Pacers or the Lakers do. For example, Tree
Rollins had a couple of coaching offers and landed in Orlando. Doc
Rivers has had opportunities with other teams, but not with the
Hawks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not entirely true, and there's certainly no plot,''
Babcock said. ``We brought Johnny Davis back (as community affairs
director and later as an assistant coach). We brought Mike Glenn
back (as a broadcaster). The thing with Doc is he wants to be a
general manager or a head coach. I'm not going to give him my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers did come back to the Hawks' parent company, Turner
Broadcasting, as a national cable game analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing, Babcock added, ``Doc wants to be a g.m., and I don't
want to give him my job.''

 &HT;    Georgia teams hope to obtain good commitments
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech's recruiting effort closed fast, while
Georgia is hoping the same is true for its group of prospects on
today's national signing day for college football.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan hopes to wrap up a second consecutive
nationally ranked class when three highly regarded prospects make
their decisions during a four-hour period this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Parade Magazine All-America wide receiver Reggie Brown, The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution state player of the year, will decide
between Georgia and Ohio State at a noon news conference at
Carrollton High School. Brown, regarded as the nation's top wideout
prospect by most recruiting services, has eliminated Tennessee from
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's announcement will be followed by a 3:30 p.m. decision
from wide receiver Durrell Robinson of Duncan, S.C., who will
decide between Georgia and Tennessee. Finally, at 3:45 p.m., Parade
All-America running back Nick Maddox of Kannapolis, N.C., will
choose from Georgia, Florida, Florida State, North Carolina and
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting those three would definitely put Georgia in the top 10
nationally,'' said Bobby Burton, managing editor of the Austin,
Texas-based National Recruiting Advisor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Yellow Jackets capped off their recruiting effort
Tuesday with a commitment from defensive lineman Greg Gathers of
East St. John High School in Reserve, La. Gathers, a 6-foot-2,
248-pound defensive end, picked Tech over Notre Dame, Southern
Methodist, Florida and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about my chances of playing early because Tech
recruited three other defensive ends and we're all coming in at the
same time,'' said Gathers, who holds the East St. John record with
42 career sacks, including 20 during his senior season. ``The ACC
is a passing league, which plays into my strength as a pass-rusher.
I feel good about my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary expects to sign 23 players
today, including all-state running back Sidney Ford of Pepperell
and free safety Jeremy Muyres of Parkview. Tech also expects to
sign highly regarded running backs Mike Kitchen of Lebanon, Pa.,
and William Glover of Tampa. Parade All-America kicker Luke Manget
of Rockdale County also will sign with the Jackets.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Florida State landed Americus High quarterback
Fabian Walker, the state's all-time career passing-yardage leader.
Walker, who must improve his standardized test score to become
academically eligible, joins Americus defensive end Alonzo Jackson,
who committed to the Seminoles on Sunday.

 &HT;    Falcons angered at Times article, but writer stands by story
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons coach Dan Reeves and several players reacted
with shock and anger Tuesday to a New York Times story that quoted
players saying anonymously that free safety Eugene Robinson wasn't
the only player last week to visit a seedy area of Miami rife with
prostitution and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 35, was arrested Saturday night on the eve of Super
Bowl XXXIII and charged with solicitating an undercover female
police officer for oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   The story, written by Times NFL writer Mike Freeman, did not
identify any player making the accusation. Freeman wrote that some
Falcons said other teammates were in the vicinity of Biscayne
Boulevard and 22nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys had been going there all week,'' the Times quoted a
Falcon starter as saying. ``It's just that Eugene was the only one
who got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, who had extensive dealings with Freeman when Reeves was
coach of the New York Giants from 1993-96, was more angry than
shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me, because it's the kind of journalism I
saw for the four years I was in New York,'' Reeves said.
``(Freeman) always quotes a lot of people, but he never says who it
is. He always says 'un-named player,' et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I can deny that maybe he's right, but it would
surprise me. I've talked to some of the guys, and nobody has said
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman defended the story, and expressed surprise that anyone
would doubt that more than one player visited the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was willing to go on the record,'' Freeman said. ``I
don't want to go into who I talked to or how many, because, as Dan
did in New York, he gets paranoid and starts calling players in his
office to find out who was talking. If anybody thought that Eugene
is the only one who did this, he's a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and five teammates were on an all-day flight Tuesday to
Honolulu to play in the Pro Bowl. Many others have already
scattered around the country, but several who are still in town
disputed the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it very hard to believe (that other players frequented
the area), and this article doesn't do anything to change my
beliefs,'' defensive end Lester Archambeau said. ``Journalism-wise,
it's a terrible article because he didn't put anybody's name in
it.'' Rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam said he didn't hear
anything about players visiting the area, although he conceded that
it would not mean that it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear about that all week,'' Salaam said. ``People can
say anything. It's almost like it's irrelevant,though.''
</P>
<P>
   The story quoted anonymous players as saying Robinson had heard
about the area ``and wanted to see it for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Running back Gary Downs said that, even if the report were true,
it's hard to believe teammates would say those kinds of things _ on
or off the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what area it was, and even if there is such an
area, I don't think anybody would go there. It was a total shock,''
Downs said. ``I would really be suspicious of him saying
(anonymous) players. Nobody would be stupid enough to say those
things. Nobody on our team had anything negative to say about
Eugene.'' Also in the article, Freeman wrote that security in the
team hotel was so tight that friends of some players, including
agents, were unable to visit and that players could not receive
telephone calls in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Players could receive calls, but only if callers knew their name
and room number, a normal screening process used by NFL teams.
Also, the security was anything but tight at the Airport Hilton and
Towers, as the lobby was crawling all week with fans and family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found people in the lobby claiming to be relatives who
weren't,'' Downs said. ``I called a few guys and said somebody was
downstairs to see them, and they'd say, 'I don't want to talk to
him; he's been bugging me all day.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wanted to could, practically, (go in there),
although once (a visitor) went up to the players' floors, there was
security. As long as you had a guest pass, though, and the Falcons
gave as many guest passes as you wanted, you could visit players.''
</P>
<P>
   The article also said that not only was Robinson's arrest a
distraction before the Falcons' 34-19 loss to the Broncos, but that
the morning of the game was especially tense because of it.
</P>
<P>
   No Falcons have disputed the likelihood that the incident was
disruptive, but Salaam denied that Robinson's arrest had an
overwhelming affect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fine. As far as I could see, guys had come so far (and)
they wanted to play the Super Bowl,'' Salaam said. ``They weren't
worried about anything that happened the night before.''

 &HT;    Grammy site gets glitzy introduction
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (f) Financial and (e) Entertainment
categories.)By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``This was a rabbit patch when I lived here,'' said
Recording Academy President/CEO and Marietta, Ga. native Michael
Greene. He was speaking of IBM's super-sleek offices in east Cobb
County.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was back in town for the official launch of the Grammy
Awards Web site, built and powered by IBM and the staff of its
Atlanta-based ``Artz Cafe'' team of Web creatives. An unusual horde
of television and print media representatives were on hand to
witness the Web site's official launch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch limo outside added extra glitz.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM Web development team has built a solid reputation by
creating outstanding Web sites for marquee events such as the
Masters, Wimbledon and now the Grammys (http://www.grammys.com).
The computer maker recently consolidated its Web units under the
direction of Bruce Culbert, vice president of e-business services,
in Atlanta. Culbert says IBM's combination of creative Web
developers and technology support makes it a logical
start-to-finish provider of Web services.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and the Recording Academy are pouring around-the-clock
resources into the Web site, including hourly updates, historical
information on previous winners, information on this year's crop of
nominees, polls, chat and other ways to involve the millions of
viewers it expects to receive each day from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   A key feature of IBM's Grammy site will be its ``special
correspondents,'' which include College Park, Ga. native and first
time Grammy nominee Monica. The 18-year-old singer was presented a
top-of-the-line IBM Thinkpad to chronicle her adventures in
Hollywood attending Grammy-week parties and assorted media events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as computer-literate as I should be,'' she said. ``But
I'm here to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   She also introduced her mother, Marilyn Best, calling her the
real family computer whiz. ``Mom is on the computer all day,'' she
said. ``I call and ask her how to do the things I need to do on the
Net, and she tells me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Monica plans to do more with her laptop computer than
provide detailed descriptions of designer gowns. ``I want to go
online and talk with the teenagers who might feel there isn't
anyone there for them. I want to connect with teens who feel
there's no one to help them out. I can't answer computer tech
questions,'' she said, laughing, ``but I can take anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grammys give IBM one of its biggest challenges, according to
senior producer Kelly Johnson. ``It's like two weeks of a tennis
event jammed into three hours in terms of the material we will
cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty IBM staffers are working on the project. A team will also
head to Los Angeles to provide backstage and behind-the-scenes
coverage. The Atlanta-based Web team will be sharing backstage
floor space with the likes of MTV, VH1, E! Entertainment
Television, the broadcast networks, and _ according to IBM _ it
will have more floor space than the networks, too.

CHINO-`WILDFIRE' (Chino Valley, Ariz.) - The town manager stole
nearly half a million dollars from a trust fund for the blind. The
town council concealed his past. A Parks and Recreation employee
who runs the town motocross track is a convicted killer. The town
conducted no background check. Needless to say, Chino Valley is in
an uproar. Especially since the former prisoner town manager was
very instrumental in the firing of the popular town police chief,

national academy. A recall election for the mayor and four council

execution by lethal injection for a murder committed in 1980. He
will be the first Native American to be executed in Arizona since
the death penalty was restored in 1976. He is the first Native
American with a death warrant to be allowed to have the ancient
ceremony as part of his last rites. With PHOTOS. By KELLY
ETTENBOROUGH. Story moved in the ``A'' category. &QL;

ROBERTS-OBIT (Phoenix) - Phoenix attorney Neal Roberts, a shadowy
figure in the 1976 car-bomb murder of ``Arizona Republic'' reporter

ROACH (Phoenix) - After 50 years of performing, Irish funnyman Hal
Roach is still known as the King of Blarney, dividing his time

BOTH SIDES ARE NERVOUS IN CRISIS OVER EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ The Indonesian authorities and East Timor's
pro-independence group have little in common.
</P>
<P>
   But they agree that a sudden withdrawal of Indonesian security
forces would lead to more violence in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   Security has worsened sharply over the last two months as the
Indonesian military has armed several thousand anti-separatist
paramilitary troops _ a development at odds with proposals
announced last week by Foreign Minister Ali Alatas aimed at
resolving the East Timor crisis. Indonesia invaded the Portuguese
colony in 1975 and annexed it the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Alatas said that Indonesia would continue to press for
acceptance of a broad autonomy package, but that if this proved
unacceptable, the Cabinet would ask Indonesia's highest
constitutional authority, the People's Consultative Assembly, to
grant East Timor independence within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say that 7,000 automatic weapons have been
distributed to pro-government paramilitaries and that the army has
started recruiting people for the groups.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Wiranto, head of the Indonesian armed forces, denied on
Tuesday that the military was arming paramilitary groups. But
militiamen have been seen on Dili's streets, brandishing their
weapons in broad daylight, and near the homes of Timorese
separatist leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Such actions, particularly in rural areas, are a major reason
that some 5,000 people have been displaced from their homes and
forced to seek sanctuary in Suai, on the south coast, and in Dili.
</P>
<P>
   But Col. Tono Suratman, the Indonesian military commander here,
blamed guerrillas for the worsening security situation in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of East Timor, Abilio Soares, was installed by the
Indonesian government and is an ardent opponent of independence. In
an interview here in the capital, he described the independence
proposal by Alatas as ``regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If independence has to be forced, it's the same as having a
war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the possibility of civil war if Indonesia
withdraws its troops quickly, Soares replied: ``Definitely, it is
as one plus one equals two.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Indonesian military headquarters here, Suratman said the
biggest challenge facing his forces was getting anti-Indonesian
factions to negotiate their differences. A sudden withdrawal of the
Indonesian troops, which some Western intelligence analysts say
number 17,000, would result in ``bloodshed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior rebel strategist, Antonio Joao Gomez da Costa, echoed
that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the veranda of his dilapidated cottage on Dili's
outskirts, Gomez da Costa said he had fought for 17 years against
Indonesian rule, and he appealed to the government to accept a plan
for a transition of 10 years before allowing a vote on
self-determination. Such a plan has been proposed by a
pro-independence leader, Xanana Gusmao, and is broadly supported by
many other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid war,'' Gomez da Costa said. ``Our people are
suffering for a long time. We don't want war here again in East
Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was in close contact with armed separatist
guerrillas, whose strength he put at 800 jungle-based fighters, up
from 400 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged mountain terrain and dense jungle lend themselves to
guerrilla war. In 1942 an Australian commando force of just 400
tied down 20,000 Japanese soldiers here.

 &HT;    Grammy site gets glitzy introduction
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (f) Financial and (e) Entertainment

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``This was a rabbit patch when I lived here,'' said
Recording Academy President/CEO and Marietta, Ga. native Michael
Greene. He was speaking of IBM's super-sleek offices in east Cobb
County.
</P>
<P>
   Greene was back in town for the official launch of the Grammy
Awards Web site, built and powered by IBM and the staff of its
Atlanta-based ``Artz Cafe'' team of Web creatives. An unusual horde
of television and print media representatives were on hand to
witness the Web site's official launch Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch limo outside added extra glitz.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM Web development team has built a solid reputation by
creating outstanding Web sites for marquee events such as the
Masters, Wimbledon and now the Grammys (http://www.grammys.com).
The computer maker recently consolidated its Web units under the
direction of Bruce Culbert, vice president of e-business services,
in Atlanta. Culbert says IBM's combination of creative Web
developers and technology support makes it a logical
start-to-finish provider of Web services.
</P>
<P>
   IBM and the Recording Academy are pouring around-the-clock
resources into the Web site, including hourly updates, historical
information on previous winners, information on this year's crop of
nominees, polls, chat and other ways to involve the millions of
viewers it expects to receive each day from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   A key feature of IBM's Grammy site will be its ``special

   She also introduced her mother, Marilyn Best, calling her the
real family computer whiz. ``Mom is on the computer all day,'' she
said. ``I call and ask her how to do the things I need to do on the
Net, and she tells me.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Monica plans to do more with her laptop computer than
provide detailed descriptions of designer gowns. ``I want to go

anyone there for them. I want to connect with teens who feel

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton plans to visit Atlanta on Friday
to attend Hank Aaron's 65th birthday party, mark the 25th year
since his record-breaking 715th home run and pay tribute to his
role in the country's tumultuous flight from segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is to arrive in Atlanta Friday evening aboard Air Force
One, spend two hours paying tribute to Aaron at a downtown hotel,
then return to the White House late that night.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president wants to go to honor Hank Aaron for his great
career, for his steadfastness of character, for the work he does,
to this day, to improve the lives of other people, especially young
people, and probably to relive a little bit of his youth,'' said
deputy White House spokesman Barry Toiv. ''He's pretty excited
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was 11 in 1957, the year Aaron was named the National
League's Most Valuable Player for leading the Milwaukee Braves to
their World Series victory over the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   That same summer, from the governor's mansion Clinton would
later occupy, Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus called out troops to
prevent nine black children from attending a Little Rock high
school, in a searing moment in the civil rights struggle that left
its mark on Clinton's life and Aaron's.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hank Aaron is someone who, even at the height of his career,
was forced to confront segregation off the field, and, like many
others, he overcame that,'' Toiv said in a telephone interview.
''I'm sure the president will address the struggles that Hank Aaron
and other African American athletes had to deal with in the years
of segregation.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron received racist hate mail and even death threats a quarter
of a century ago, the year he shattered Babe Ruth's all-time home
run record by blasting his 715th homer. He hit a total of 755
before retiring in 1976 after 23 years playing major league ball.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron, playing for the Atlanta Braves, hit his 715th home run on
April 8, 1974, before a crowd of nearly 54,000 at the old Atlanta
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   President Nixon, at the time the subject of House impeachment
proceedings that would lead to his resignation four months later,
placed a congratulatory call to Aaron in the Braves' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Friday will mark Clinton's first visit to Atlanta since he was
impeached by the House in December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton last visited Atlanta in July to kick off an anti-drug
campaign and to help raise money for the U.S. Senate race of
Democrat Michael Coles, who lost in November to Republican
incumbent Paul Coverdell.

 &HT;    Column: Glory era of information bound to change the rules
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The flowering of the Information Age will change
nearly everything we do in the next century, and even alter the way
we think about issues and weigh values.
</P>
<P>
   In the unfolding new world, knowledge becomes the coin of the
realm, a new way to handle and expand time, and even a weapon in
business and economic warfare. Yes, what we used to call
competition could become undisguised combat.
</P>
<P>
   The new world will be marked by contrasts, however, where
wealthy societies benefit in large ways, and the developing world
will see the new and old juxtaposed, often in troubling ways. This
is the underlying thesis of a new book, ``The Information
Revolution: Current and Future Consequences,'' by the faculty and
staff of Georgia Tech. The 300-page book is a collection of essays,
some old, some new, but all analyzing the impact of the information
society on our way of life, including the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus among the writers is that the emergence of
computer-driven knowledge pushes aside some basic economic theories
that ruled this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of `new growth theory' is that if we keep
finding new ideas, keep innovating and keep discovering, then there
are no limits to growth,'' said William H. Read, professor of
public policy at Georgia Tech. ``The theory holds that the process
of creating ideas and innovative techniques will fuel long-run
improvements and sustain an ever-improving standard of firm
competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Read, who embraces the ideas of economist Paul Romer, said the
march of information could expand old theories of wealth building
and even rules of assembly line efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The implications of the new thinking, Read tells his management
students, is to regard the modern organization as basically ``a
knowledge-based, information-processing organization,'' and the
appropriate manager of that organization must be strong in
analytical skills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sections on management in the Information Age,
other sections deal with implications for the workplace, academic
life, political affairs and society.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interesting concepts are the business warfare theories
of Myron L. Cramer, who says successful businesses will have to
wage a two-front battle to keep an information edge over
competitors and adversaries. In this murky war, he said, there will
be manipulation, even deadly feints, in which some players will
make false claims of inventive ideas only to make others abandon or
change research programs.
</P>
<P>
   Other new concerns, he said, will be the struggle to keep
information secure, even as workers access data from home from
around the world, and while working in their houses.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most entertaining portions of the book is the finale,
when the writers make predictions about the impact of information
on our futures.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, does the emergence of the information society mean
more leisure? Don't count on it, says Judith P. Carlisle of the
management school.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusion of information may improve a lot of work processes,
said Carlisle, ``but information technologies will not decrease the
length of the workday. Rather they will allow organizations to
claim more hours of the worker's day as these technologies continue
to be more accessible and mobile. Work will permeate more and more
of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   In other glimpses of the future, Donghua Zhu of the Tech's
Technology Policy and Assessment Center said there may be some
relief for red-eyed computer workers who spend endless hours
searching online. In the future, he said, computers will work with
other computers automatically to produce the research.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries too poor to keep up with technology there will
be odd juxtapositions, said Peter G. Sassone of the school of
economics. ``In one example a peasant may walk a half a day over
dirt roads to reach a village doctor in a hut equipped with a
satellite link to a distant medical center.''
</P>
<P>
   As science moves online, research will change in several ways,
said Scott Cunningham, an NCR executive who serves on Tech's
committee assessing change. With the rapid move of information, the
life cycle of findings and publication will be shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collaboration, authorship, submission and review will become
more entwined as science moves online. Quality assurance will be
provided by electronic labeling services, which will be neither
academic, corporate or government in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Other writers say the speed of information and change will be so
great that copyright concerns may give way to another consideration
_ how to validate facts and findings as they spin past us.
</P>
<P>
   Said Julie Yang, Tech librarian: ``Organizing information will
not be so important in the future; evaluating, validating and
analyzing information will be.''

 &HT;    MediaOne acquiring subscribers in swap
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time Warner, the nation's largest cable television
operator, and MediaOne, the third largest, announced Tuesday they
will swap several systems, including some in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The total swap involves 660,000 subscribers, including 71,000
Time Warner customers in Georgia who will move to MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   The trade is fairly typical for the cable industry, where
companies would prefer to have systems next to each other rather
than as isolated islands across the country. The advantages of
having a ``cluster'' of cable systems increases as companies spend
millions of dollars to upgrade their systems to handle high-speed
data and phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of our cluster strategy,'' said MediaOne
spokesman Dave Wood. ``The larger your clusters are, the more you
can tie your networks together.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver-based MediaOne is the biggest cable operator in metro
Atlanta with about 540,000 customers. The company has already
poured hundreds of millions of dollars into an upgrade of its
system. So far, those new lines pass about 75,000 homes. Sections
of Gwinnett and Clayton counties, including about 40,000 homes, are
slated for the upgrade within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner will get systems in Maine, California and Ohio,
where the company is the state's largest cable operator. MediaOne
will get systems in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's holdings include parts of Cherokee, Cobb and
Fulton counties, as well as Marietta, Roswell and Woodstock,
according to Time Warner spokesman Mike Luchtman. All will be
moving to MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Broussard, Time Warner vice president for metro
Atlanta, said the upgrade of its systems here should be completed
by the middle of next year. Broadband cable now passes about 25,000
homes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will not be completed for several months. When it is,
Time Warner subscribers may have to adapt to a different channel
lineup, Wood said. ``There may be some changes, but it won't be
anything dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner has more than 100 employees in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne has made no decisions about how to consolidate
operations, but no severe job cuts are contemplated, Wood said.
``If you are a Time Warner employee, I don't think you are looking
at dramatic changes. Your services will still be needed. We will
still be running a cable operation.''

 &HT;    Forum probes readiness of private companies providing government
servicesBy Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ United Water Services, the private company that now
manages Atlanta's water and sewer systems, is just getting its feet
wet tackling the city's Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   But that may not matter much, according to Chick Vossen,
executive assistant to Atlanta's commissioner of administrative
services. That is because most of the Atlanta's water and sewage
control equipment is not run by computers.
</P>
<P>
   John M. Abrera, the United Water Services' information
technology director at a Y2K forum for utilities companies last
Friday, said that his company had just finished ``a preliminary
assessment'' of the problem ``in the last two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, that was a scary disclosure because,
normally, Y2K work involves at least six stages _ inventorying the
problem, assessing it, the equivalent of triage, fixing the
problem, testing the fix, and contingency planning in case things
still go wrong. As a rule of thumb, the bulk of a Y2K project,
two-thirds of the time involved, should be spent on testing.
</P>
<P>
   The private company said it will complete its inventory and
assessment along with its contingency plan this quarter and then go
into rewriting and testing, all of which, it said, will be done
before the Y2K witching hour.
</P>
<P>
   Critical software relating to customer information and asset
management, Abrera said, has been identified and is currently being
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Abrera's presentation and that by Ken Fraker of the
DeKalb system was disquieting. Each county has less than a week's
water supply in its reservoirs. Telephone and power outages could
cripple the systems. A severe lowering of water pressure or an
interruption of the flow of chemicals could unleash bacteria,
requiring shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Jokingly but with an edge, Fraker began his presentation by
recommending that the audience ``get as many five gallon buckets''
as it could.
</P>
<P>
   Water was the only dampener in the daylong series of
presentations. There were 625 people from various occupations in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a lot better at the end of the day than I did at the
beginning,'' said J. B. Coram, a pilot who had driven down from
Highlands, N.C. for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, held at the Georgia International Convention center
near Hartsfield Airport, was sponsored by the Atlanta Year 2000
Users' Group.
</P>
<P>
   The kick-off speaker, Gov. Barnes set the tone by announcing his
commitment to fixing things. That included his appointment of
Southern Company head, A. W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg, to head a private
citizens panel, proposed new Y2K legislation
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is causing us to rebuild ``the very infrastructure of the
information economy,'' Barnes said, pointing out a little-noticed
benefit of all the fuss.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights of the forum included:
</P>
<P>
   _ The assertion by Southern Company presenter Mike McClure that
few of the embedded chips throughout his company's system are date
date-sensitive, and the statement by Oglethorpe Power spokesman
Thomas Smith that his company's system had few embedded chips.
</P>
<P>
   _ There will be ``minimal impact from Y2K'' on the nation's
privately-owned power companies' ability to operate, according to a
spokesman for their association, Dave Swanson of the Edison
Electric Institute. He also said, ``I don't think so,'' when asked
about the possibility that a non-compliant company or two could
knock out a regional electrical power grid.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Stephenson, chief of staff for Y2K-concerned U.S. Sen.
Robert F. Bennett (R-Utah), provided a moderately negative overview
of U.S. readiness and the assertion that Congress, if need be, can
respond in a hurry to Y2K problems. In the Southeast, ``Georgia and
Florida are in good shape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Natural gas companies appear to be in relatively good shape
and in little need of remediation. Marty Berry, the presenter for
Atlanta Gas Light, said that his company has spent $3 million thus
far on Y2K and will has budgeted another $9 million this year _ a
pittance in relation to Southern Company, say, which had spent $68
million by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``We will be ready,'' said Rick Harder, chief information
officer for BellSouth Telecommunications, a view that was also the
theme of the presentation by Michael Donnelly of AT&AMP;T.

CITING NUTRITION, SCHOOL STOPS SELLING SODA TO STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I. , Fla. ,  Ore.)  (Eds: Jess in 3rd to last graf CQ) 
 (nk) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST GREENWICH, R.I. _ Erin Gallogly's less prepared classmates
drool over the lunch her mother packs for her, but not because of
the chicken sandwich or the chocolate chip cookies. They are more
interested in her can of soda.
</P>
<P>
   ``People try to pay me for my Coke,'' said Erin, a senior at
Exeter-West Greenwich Regional High School. ``They're like, `I'll
give you a dollar!'''
</P>
<P>
   The offer has become a familiar one since the soda machines that
line the school's hallways began refusing the students' coins. Soda
had become so big a part of students' daily diet that in January
the superintendent of schools ordered the machines turned off
during the school day. (Business at the machines continues as usual
in Exeter-West Greenwich's after-hours role as a community center.)
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown here in this town southwest of Providence is the
latest backlash against a deluge of soda that has flooded American
schools in recent years because revenue-hungry school districts
have been signing lucrative contracts with soft-drink manufacturers
to sell their products exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash has been encouraged by the watchdog group Center
for Science in the Public Interest, which, in a report titled
``Liquid Candy,'' found last year that the average American
teen-age boy drank 868 cans of soda annually, and the average girl
more than 600 cans. That kind of consumption, the center says,
contributes to obesity, tooth decay, osteoporosis and heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Department of Education began cracking down on
carbonated beverages last year, ordering in all the state's schools
a shutdown similar to the one here. A local school board in Oregon
has taken a different approach, simply putting a moratorium on new
soft-drink machines.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his own crackdown, Robert Hicks, the Exeter-West
Greenwich superintendent, said: ``In health classes we're teaching
students one thing about nutrition. And they leave those classes
and go to the lunchroom, and we're promoting candy and soda sales.
We should live our words better.''
</P>
<P>
   If students were dismayed at their loss of sodas, so were some
administrators. Mary Christian, the high school's principal, said
soda sales had brought in thousands of dollars that paid for things
like the literary magazine and buses for field trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nutrition aspect is important, but I'm ambivalent about
it,'' Ms. Christian said of the new policy as she looked over her
budget for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the policy hope that students will spend their
money on other, healthier foods. Exeter-West Greenwich has also
suspended candy sales by student groups and the cafeteria, although
students can still buy cookies, pretzels, chips and ice cream at
the snack bar there. Unlike soda, those foods comply with
Department of Agriculture school lunch guidelines _ that is,
federal law does not bar their lunch-hour sale at schools receiving
government lunch support.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, that they are available while soda and candy sales
are banned strikes some as hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this little bar of death, OK, and everything there
contains fats and cholesterol,'' said Benjamin Johns, a student
representative on the school's food advisory committee. Instead of
banning foods, he said, administrators ``really need to have more
of a diversity of choices.'' Benjamin, a vegetarian, longs for a
salad bar.
</P>
<P>
   The principal is not sure what impact the new policy will have
on health, because students are free to bring soda and candy from
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think students eat too much sugar and non-nutritional
foods? Absolutely,'' Ms. Christian said. But 35 years ago, she
said, she felt precisely the same way, ``without ever even having
vending machines in the school.''
</P>
<P>
   Jess Walsh, the president of the senior class council, said
administrators should worry about other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug problem is a lot bigger than whether we eat lunch
healthy,'' she said. ``They always tell us in our classes, `You're
adults, we're going to treat you like adults.' But they're letting
the adults choose if they want soda, and we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Already one student, eager to buy a Sprite, has been caught
sneaking into the teachers' lounge, where the soda machine stays
on.

`HOUSE/LIGHTS': A CASE FOR CUBISM AND DEALS WITH DEVILS
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review . ) 
(bl) 
By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gertrude Stein was right, after all. So it would
seem, in any case, from the testimony provided in the bedazzling
new theater piece from the Wooster Group, ``House/Lights.''
</P>
<P>
   This multimedia collage, inspired by Stein's opera libretto of
1938, ``Dr. Faustus Lights the Lights,'' makes nothing less than a
case for Cubism, which Stein famously advocated as a patron of
painters and practiced as a writer, as  &UR; the &LR;  dominant sensibility
of this century. It's the perfect show to see in 1999, finding in
the prophecies of artists of decades ago the disjunctive present in
which we now live.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the groans, please, and the dismissive rolling of the eyes.
While the intellectual ambitions of ``House/Lights,'' now in an
open-ended run at the Performing Garage in Soho, may be arrogantly
grand, there is nothing dry or academic in the experience of the
show. As a mind-scrambling entertainment, there's nothing else like
it around; it turns disorientation into a primary sensual pleasure,
even as it raises terrifying thoughts about the deeply mixed
blessings of technological progress.
</P>
<P>
   Through the use of the latest tools of that technology, the
Wooster Group has assembled a portrait, both fractured and fluid,
of a world in which any set sense of chronology, culture or
identity can no longer be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Faustian bargain that Stein deals with, in her
typically elliptical way, in her original text, in which the Faust
figure is the inventor of artificial light, altering forever the
natural order of time. Under the incisive, spectacularly
resourceful direction of Elizabeth LeCompte, that text acquires at
least another 60 years' worth of levels of displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Live performance is juxtaposed with what emerges from an
assortment of television screens that record, splinter and
transform what is happening onstage until you're no longer sure
which image has the greatest reality. Voices, too, are mechanically
distorted and fragmented. What is the source of what you're
hearing? (Since this sort of aural confusion is now an unwanted
commonplace in overmiked Broadway musicals, it is especially
gratifying to find the Wooster Group making sardonic use of the
same phenomenon.)
</P>
<P>
   Stein wrote that movies would change forever the very way we
look at things. Ms. LeCompte makes it clear that this was just the
beginning. Jim Findlay's metal grid of a set features, in addition
to phalanxes of video screens and assorted electric bulbs (the
uncanny lighting is by Jennifer Tipton), a laptop computer at
center stage.
</P>
<P>
   And in the evening's master of ceremonies, the magnificent Kate
Valk, we have a creature of astonishing artificiality, a tin-voiced
1930s-style beauty with marcelled hair and bee-stung lips who might
be a digitally manufactured composite of movie stars. She's the
ultimate screen siren, happiest in two dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   There is something unnervingly languorous about Ms. Valk's
presence, even as she adjusts microphones, angles herself for yet
another small-screen close-up and goes through some frenetically
choreographed pantomimes. She suggests a centuries-old vampire
prostitute, tired of turning tricks but still amazingly proficient
at doing so. She may not look like Faustus, the role the program
says she is playing, but she is clearly someone (or is it
something?) who has sold her soul, or lost it, a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is to Ms. Valk that the principal duties of reading Stein's
text fall, including narrative, song lyrics and stage directions.
(In reading ``Dr. Faustus,'' it's not always clear which of these
elements is which.) Her rushed, mechanical, Betty Boop-ish voice,
swathed in synthesizer-induced reverberations, oddly matches the
neutrality that Stein aimed for in her cadenced, repetitious prose.
(Quick sample: ``You fool you devil how can you know, you can you
tell me so, if I am the only who can know what I know then no devil
can tell me so. . . .'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Valk is clearly the (oops, I was about to say soul) center
of the evening, but it is impossible, as in all Wooster Group
productions, to disassociate her from the other performers. Here
they include Suzzy Roche, looking like someone who never left the
Electric Circus, as a snaggle-toothed Mephistopheles; gray-haired
Roy Faudree as the Boy who visits Faustus and Ari Fliakos as
Faustus' dog, who says nothing but ``thank you'' in a raspy,
hung-over-sounding voice. Both Tanya Selvaratnam and Helen Eve
Pickett play the Marguerite figure, who is given two separate names
in Stein's text.
</P>
<P>
   This fission of character is typical of the evening. In addition
to telling the story of Faust according to Stein, ``House/Lights''
weaves in the plot of ``Olga's House of Shame,'' a 1964 cult film
by Joseph Mawra. It's like a seedier, more sinister version of a
Roger Corman movie, with buxom and studly jewel thieves inflicting
all manner of sexual torture upon one another. (It also involves
the initiation of a young woman into this ring of sadism, so there
is a Faustian parallel of sorts.)
</P>
<P>
   The live ensemble acts out the scenes from the movie that are
concurrently being shown on the video screens. Sometimes the
simulcast images from the stage bleed into those of the film; at
other moments, snippets of other movies, from Busby Berkeley
spectacles to Mel Brooks' ``Young Frankenstein.'' (The video
collages are the astonishing work of Philip Bussmann.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to trust me when I say that there is nothing
random-feeling about this mixture of elements, which also feature
danced segments that seem choreographed by a tornado but are
actually the work of Trisha Brown and Ms. Pickett. (The music is by
Hans Peter Kuhn.) The performers and the technical team, which
includes sound designers James (J.J.) Johnson and John Collins and
costume designer Elizabeth Jenyon, work as if they had all been
generated by the same computer program. Everything in
``House/Lights'' seems to ricochet and echo off everything else.
</P>
<P>
   It also never loses sight of the idea of the increasing
uncertainty of identity in the modern age, a theme that fascinated
Stein, especially after she achieved worldwide fame with ``The
Autobiograpy of Alice B. Toklas.'' The ways in which
``House/Lights'' carries out the confusion of flesh and technology,
of self and the projected image, are often breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   One thinks, particularly, of Ms. Valk running a finger across
her lips, while at the same time the mouth turns red on the
black-and-white image of her face on the screens. There is also the
moment when the physical gyrations of Ms. Valk and Faudree, acting
out a sex scene from ``Olga's House of Shame,'' are caught (and
utterly desexualized) in the overamplified sounds of cloth rubbing
against cloth.
</P>
<P>
   There is a splendid sequence in which Ms. Valk prepares a
serpent for its big scene in the Faust play. The serpent is a
microphone wearing a mask, with the voice of a boozed-out, aging
stand-up comic (provided by Collins). Though the evening, which
runs about 90 minutes, is intermissionless, it does adhere to
Stein's given structure of five acts. The divisions are signaled by
the image of a red curtain falling on each of the video screens.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Wooster Group has mostly used its
deconstructive tools on familiar classics, like O'Neill's ``Hairy
Ape'' and ``Emperor Jones'' and Chekhov's ``Three Sisters.''
Frankly, the idea of this troupe's taking on Stein seemed to
promise an evening of the obscure leading the obscure. This simply
isn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stein's reputation, of course, has never been universally solid.
There are still many who regard her as the ultimate intellectual
fraud. ``A cold, black suet pudding,'' was how Wyndham Lewis
described her writing. ``All fat, without nerve.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, accusations of arty, posturing pretentiousness have
habitually dogged the Wooster Group. In asking us to listen anew to
Stein, to something other than ``rose is a rose is a rose,'' this
company illuminates what remains enduringly relevant in Stein's
voice while confirming the troupe itself as part of an intellectual
continuum that began in the age of Picasso. The world that
``House/Lights'' portrays may be in atomistic shards, but there's a
strangely comforting wholeness in this century-enfolding symmetry.

`PIZZICATA': IN HAPPY ITALY, IT'S RAINING MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good fortune literally falls out of the sky in Edoardo
Winspeare's ``Pizzicata,'' a winsome Italian film set in southern
Italy in 1943. A handsome Italian-American soldier named Tony
Marciano (Fabio Frascaro) is forced to parachute into rural Italy,
near the place where he was born. He also falls into the midst of a
family including a beautiful, lonely young woman named Cosima
(Chiara Torelli).
</P>
<P>
   Since Tony speaks fluent Italian, it's not difficult for the
head of the family, Carmine, to pass the young man off as a distant
relative, and so Tony's inauguration into rustic Italian life
begins.
</P>
<P>
   It's a life that includes a lot of the impassioned, barefoot
dancing from which the film takes its composite title. The joyous
pizzica is an amorous and festive dance, set to the percussive beat
of tambourines, and bearing a resemblance to Greek folk dancing.
The tarantata is a mad dance of grief and longing, and within the
story of ``Pizzicata'' there is room for both.
</P>
<P>
   Winspeare, who previously made documentaries, calls this first
feature ``a declaration of love for my country.'' It's easy to see
why. Unfolding at a lovely, soothing tempo until it occasionally
bursts forth with vibrant dance scenes, ``Pizzicata'' warmly evokes
the landscape of Salento and the modest lives of peasant farmers in
that region.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? There is a strong sense of community and
fellowship here, not to mention such charming local color as
chickens roaming outside Carmine's farmhouse, melodious singing,
serene leaf gathering and fence building, and frequent references
to local olives and wine.
</P>
<P>
   There are even folksy truisms like ``A married woman means a
loaded donkey,'' which comes up when Cosima finds herself pursued
by the son of the wealthiest landowner around. Meanwhile she and
Tony are seen falling gently and inevitably in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the actors to imagine that they were in love without
touching,'' Winspeare has said about the two main characters as
they danced pizzica scenes. Certainly they remained true to the
spirit of that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pizzicata'' makes the connection between emigration and war as
two reasons that so many men in the region are missing. ``America
to us is pain,'' says Carmine. ``It takes away our sons, like the
war.'' Thus there is something gratifying in the ease with which
Tony slips back into the gentle ways of his homeland, finding
respite so easily there.
</P>
<P>
   All would be far more simple and exultant, even beneath the
shadow of wartime, if the warm reception accorded Tony did not
prompt outrage from Pasquale (Paolo Massafra), the rich man's son.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the film's minor players appear to be local villagers,
including the toothless grandmother who gives Cosima advice. ``I'm
90,'' says the old woman, offering reason enough to be listened to.
They contribute greatly to the inviting naturalness of
``Pizzicata,'' which is colorfully offset by the passions that love
and music arouse.

A SWISS EXHIBITION FIGHTS CHAIN SAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland _ The quiet galleries of the Fondation
Beyeler in this prosperous Swiss city may seem a million miles from
the chain saws at work in the Amazon. Yet one of Ernst Beyeler's
objectives when he opened his museum 15 months ago was ``to link
art with life.''
</P>
<P>
   And the new exhibition here does just that. While illustrating
the privileged place of trees in modern art, ``The Magic of Trees''
aims to prompt reflection on the accelerating destruction of the
tropical rain forests.
</P>
<P>
   The link is crucial for Beyeler, a 77-year-old Swiss collector
and dealer. In the catalog, he states that the exhibition should
``heighten our awareness of the gifts trees give us, of how they
protect us, of our obligation to provide them with special
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   In tandem with the show, which runs through April 5, he has also
organized benefit events for the World Wide Fund for Nature and for
Greenpeace and has found space nearby for them to present their
forest conservation projects in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``The Magic of Trees'' is an exhibition of art, not
ecology. Indeed, most of the 120 paintings and sculptures on
display are by artists who were working in the first half of this
century, long before the environment became a major issue. The tree
is celebrated as a symbol and as a visual artifice as much as a
marvel of nature. In art, it seems, a tree is not always a tree.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, soon after the exhibition opened on Nov. 21, Christo
and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, wrapped 178 trees in the gardens and
pastures surrounding the Fondation Beyeler, drawing no fewer than
300,000 people during the two weeks the installation was in place.
And inside the minimalist museum building, designed by Renzo Piano,
there are paintings and sculptures in which trees are even harder
to identify among swirling colors or abstract shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 20th century, trees had a good run at being trees,
presiding over realistic or imaginary landscapes as confidently as
trees of life. Yet the oldest painting in this show, Caspar David
Friedrich's ``Oak Tree in the Snow'' (1829) shows that artists have
long understood that trees can serve as more than scene setters.
Friedrich's tree is no longer idealized: With its top and many
branches broken off, it seems to be preparing for death.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th century, trees were still trees, but the
impressionists began to observe them for the way light played with
their forms and colors.
</P>
<P>
   Two versions of Monet's ``Poplars on the Banks of the Epte''
capture the same scene _ one at twilight, the other transformed by
sunlight. Trees were also central to Van Gogh's composition,
although his quasi-religious faith in nature led him to give them
human qualities or moods. In ``The Sower,'' a single gnarled tree
seems to underline the sower's solitude.
</P>
<P>
   With Cezanne, however, trees and leaves become stepping stones
for the transition of art from the figurative through cubism to
abstraction. This process is deftly illustrated here with paintings
by Cezanne, with their characteristic rhythmic brush strokes,
followed by Picasso's 1908 precubist landscape ``La Rue-des-Bois''
and climaxing with Mondrian's ``Eucalyptus Tree (Black)'' of 1910
and ``Eucalyptus'' of 1912, where colors and recognizable shapes
have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, trees as we know them were doing better. They look
somber in Munch's turn of the century Nordic landscapes, desiccated
and distraught in Egon Schiele's ``Autumn Tree'' of 1912, full of
life in several tree portraits by Ferdinand Hodler (except in his
``Woodcutter'' of 1910), heavy with fruit in Klimt's ``Apple Tree
II'' of 1916 and Cuno Amiet's ``Apple Harvest'' of 1907,
surrealistic in Max Ernst's ``Large Forest'' of 1927, and
reassembled as an arch in Picasso's ``Vert-Galant'' of 1943.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conventional and at the same time most touching
paintings in the show is ``The Almond Tree in Bloom,'' painted by
Pierre Bonnard in 1946 and January 1947 and thought to be his last
work. From a window of his house, Bonnard would watch the tree
record the passing of the seasons. In the spring of 1946, after a
severe winter, he caught it literally bursting with blossom, the
ground beneath it bubbling with yellows, reds and browns.
</P>
<P>
   Even after World War II, trees continued to attract artists, at
times as metaphors. For Giacometti, nine of his narrow elongated
figures become ``The Glade'' (1950), and seven figures and a head
become ``The Forest'' (1950).
</P>
<P>
   It is also not obvious that Jean Dubuffet's white cut-out
figures with black designs from 1969 should be called ``The Group
of Trees.'' And yet Alexander Calder's 13-foot-high steel mobile
that stands outside the museum seems to deserve its title of ``The
Tree.''
</P>
<P>
   The main part of the exhibition, which has been organized by
Beyeler himself, includes more modern works by Roy Lichtenstein,
Jean Tinguely, Anselm Kiefer, Georg Baselitz and Gerhard Richter as
well as a selection of wooden sculptures and statues from the
museum's small but remarkable collection of African and Oceanic
tribal art.
</P>
<P>
   In the museum's basement, which has enough natural light to
dispute this name, the Fondation Beyeler's director, Markus
Bruederlin, has brought ``The Magic of Trees'' to the present day,
and here _ ``in view of the advanced state of nature's
devastation,'' as he puts it _ trees no longer survive intact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bruederlin has resisted denouncing deforestation in a
documentary fashion; in Richard Long's ``Puget Sound Driftwood
Circle'' of 1996 and Wolfgang Laib's yellow square of ``Pine Tree
Pollen'' of 1998, it is rather as if trees have simply been
deconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Viola's installation, ``The Theater of Memory,'' a real
tree with leafless branches and roots lies on the ground,
accompanied by flickering lanterns and stuttering television images
and sounds that give the impression that it is in its final throes.
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Penone's ``Tree 11 Meters Long'' (1975), on the other
hand, can be seen as an expression of hope: He has taken a
construction beam and, on one side, recreated a tree trunk,
suggesting that humans can reverse the damage they have caused to
nature.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is of course less simple. An area larger than all of
Switzerland goes up in flames in the Amazon every year, and logging
of tropical hardwoods continues apace in Africa and Asia. Still,
through ``The Magic of Trees,'' Beyeler has been able to link his
two loves: art and nature. And he can only hope the message gets
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exhibition visitors should take home with them not only
impressions of this great artistic event, but also thoughts about
the fragile equilibrium inherent in nature,'' a museum flier urges.
And while they are at it, Beyeler adds, why not join an
environmental protection group?

WEILL (KURT) COMES TO WEILL (HALL) FOR A LYRICAL BROADWAY SONGFEST
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is, more or less, a consensus about what
constitutes fine operatic singing. There is much less consensus
about singing in the American musical, and this is especially true
of the pre-amplification era. Today, any pop belter with a body
microphone can be a Broadway star. But when Rodgers and Hammerstein
were writing shows, the techniques of singing in the opera house
and the Broadway theater were not that far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are differences, and no music provokes them more
than the American theater songs of Kurt Weill, a program of which
was offered to a nearly full house at Weill Recital Hall in a
concert Monday night called ``One Touch of Weill at Weill.''
</P>
<P>
   If Weill's great German stage works, especially those he wrote
with Bertolt Brecht, were attempts at popular opera, or people's
opera, his American stage works might be considered elevated
musicals. He worked with veteran Broadway lyricists like Ira
Gershwin (the 1941 show ``Lady in the Dark'') but also collaborated
with poets, like Ogden Nash (``One Touch of Venus'') and Langston
Hughes (``Street Scene''). Yet the modernist composer in him could
not resist adding adventurous harmonies and operatic lyricism to
his Broadway songs. So the Weill singer must have vocal culture,
but rhythmic lilt, and the ability to put words across in natural,
vivid ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's a difficult balance to achieve, and this program presented
four singers who were variably successful at it. The soprano
Angelina Reaux has won acclaim as a Weill interpreter, and her
performance here reminded you why.
</P>
<P>
   Her operatic technique allows her to float the high-lying
phrases of ``September Song'' with full, warm sound, yet she has a
musical theater performer's communicative way with words. She can
sometimes get too cute, as in her teasingly sexy rendition of ``The
Saga of Jenny.'' But she brought wistful beauty to ``What Good
Would the Moon Be?'' from ``Street Scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Ollmann's robust baritone voice is in its operatic prime,
which is why his ability to tailor his sound and style to this
theater music was so impressive. The title song from ``Lost in the
Stars'' was written for the commanding baritone Todd Duncan, who
created the role of Gershwin's Porgy. But Ollmann's less opulent,
more conversational rendition was refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael DeVries, a veteran of Broadway, has perhaps gotten used
to amplification. Even in this reverberant hall, minus a
microphone, he felt compelled, it seemed, to push his voice, which
made the melancholic ``Lonely House'' sound belted. Joanna Simon's
frayed mezzo-soprano voice was sometimes wobbly, and her pitch was
insecure. Yet she sang with an understated quality _ sometimes wry,
sometimes sad _ that was often affecting.
</P>
<P>
   When the singers joined together at the end for several songs,
what had sounded like four different approaches to Weill came off
as four badly mismatched voices. Still, the chance to hear this
music does not come along often, and the pianist, Scott Dunn,
played stylishly.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be repeated Thursday night at 8.

`CINDERELLA AND COMPANY': HOW AN ELUSIVE ESSENCE TURNED INTO A
BLESSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end.) 
(JT) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manuela Hoelterhoff's backstage look at the Cecilia Bartoli
phenomenon and the opera world in general is the most perceptive
and hilariously honest book on the making and marketing of opera to
come along in some time.
</P>
<P>
   But it did not turn out quite the way Ms. Hoelterhoff, a
Pulitzer Prize-winning former critic and editor at The Wall Street
Journal, intended. The original idea was to provide a
behind-the-scenes report on an indisputably excellent singer who
had achieved sensational popularity before her 30th birthday. For
two years, leading up to a new production of Ms. Bartoli's
signature opera, Rossini's ``Cenerentola'' at the Met in 1997, Ms.
Hoelterhoff had enviable access to the singer and her circle: her
mother, a former chorus soprano and still Ms. Bartoli's most
trusted vocal coach; her worldly Italian boyfriend; her savvy
manager, Jack Mastroianni, and a whole cast of recording executives
and attendant conductors who pass through the story like
comprimario characters in an opera buffa.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though Ms. Bartoli was quite cooperative, she proved an
exasperating subject. Ultimately the reason this particular Italian
mezzo-soprano, gifted as she is, has generated such tenacious
loyalty, particularly among her American fans (the Italian public
has never been quite as enthralled), is a bit inexplicable, and
after a while you sense Ms. Hoelterhoff's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a typical case of a biographer growing jaded the
more she learns about her subject. From the first time Ms.
Hoelterhoff encountered Ms. Bartoli's singing, on a recording of
Rossini's ``Barber of Seville,'' she was smitten. Here was ``a
smooth, glimmering truffle of a voice,'' she writes in ``Cinderella
&AMP; Company,'' ``astonishing in its virtuosity and range.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Bartoli material must have seemed insufficient for an
entire book. So, happily for readers, Ms. Hoelterhoff introduces us
to just about everyone operatic she met during those two years,
interspersed with collected bits of wisdom and gossip. We read
about the great Renata Tebaldi's first visit to the United States
in 20 years, opera's self-absorbed new love couple, Roberto Alagna
and Angela Gheorghiu, the surreal planning meetings for James
Levine's gargantuan 25th-anniversary celebration, Renee Fleming,
the new generation and much more. The resulting book is a bit of
this, a bit of that. But Ms. Hoelterhoff is such an interesting
observer and beguiling writer that you eagerly follow her anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Her snappy sentences often end with surprise punches: she
defines the period of bel canto as a tradition in which
``embellishments, fluid scales, interpolations and good taste were
expected even of tenors.'' She has a novelist's ability to capture
a person in a few wry phrases. Here she is on Joseph Volpe, the
general manager of the Met: ``A blunt guy with an opera villain's
chin beard and a healthy hunger for prestige, the 55-year-old Volpe
had now muscled his way past Levine on the totem pole, acquiring
excellent suits and independent taste along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have found Ms. Hoelterhoff's irreverence overly
harsh, as when she writes that the only singer of her knowledge who
smokes is the Wagnerian tenor Siegfried Jerusalem, ``who puffs like
Fafner the dragon and sounds like it too.'' But, an enduring love
for opera and compassion come through in her account. Yes, the
coloratura June Anderson is described as ``another singer tethered
to the ground by a fraying silk thread.'' But later in the same
paragraph, reflecting on why Ms. Anderson seems determined, despite
her success, to be miserable, Ms. Hoelterhoff writes: ``Of all the
artists I have ever met, she made me most aware of how hard it can
be for shy singers to come to terms with a mysterious gift that
requires them to face several thousand strangers who do not
necessarily wish them well.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing of Ms. Hoelterhoff's reputation as an unsparing critic
and reporter, it's amazing that so many people in the business
talked with her so freely, notably the powerful manager and public
relations maestro Herbert Breslin, whom Ms. Hoelterhoff calls a
``motor-mouthed, bullet-headed, forever tan egomaniac.'' Breslin's
soliloquy on how he and his prime client, Luciano Pavarotti, showed
everyone how real money could be made in opera is breathtaking in
its honesty and shamelessness.
</P>
<P>
   The sections on Ms. Bartoli are the heart of the book. There is
ample evidence of her superb musicianship, determination and
unconventionally interesting career choices, like that of making
her Met debut in Mozart's ``Cosi Fan Tutte'' in the relatively
small role of Despina, the maid. ``I want to have some pleasure out
of my debut,'' Ms. Bartoli is quoted as saying, ``and maybe change
perceptions of what is a debut at the Met.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans will gain some perspective on Ms. Bartoli's penchant for
missing performances. Several notable cancellations seem to have
been genuinely precipitated by illness, travel snafus and even
personal tragedy: during the years covered in the book, Ms.
Bartoli's beloved younger brother died of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes her cancellations are maddening to read about, as
when a healthy Ms. Bartoli pulled out of a live Saturday broadcast
of ``Cosi'' because two lead male singers were ill, and Levine,
also ill, was stuck in another city. That millions in the
international radio audience were counting on hearing her did not
seem to matter. Ms. Hoelterhoff does not disguise her astonishment.
</P>
<P>
   But never the most mellow bunch, opera singers have to put up
with pushy managers, clueless directors and drafty rehearsal rooms
and still exercise their unearthly voices in the most difficult
vocal music ever conceived. If anything, with the current economic
squeeze in the recording industry, not to mention instant worldwide
communications, there is more pressure than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bartoli's career is a juggernaut, and one can only hope she
keeps her balance. Ms. Hoelterhoff makes few predictions, either
about Ms. Bartoli or the field in general. But it is immensely fun
and informative to read her account of the problems.

JUDGE BARS GROUPS FROM PROTESTING AT JASPER COURTHOUSE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A judge has forbidden groups from demonstrating
within two blocks of the courthouse where the first of three white
men is on trial for the brutal dragging death of a black man.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden issued the order Tuesday as
lawyers continued individual questioning of jurors in the capital
murder trial of John William ``Bill'' King, 24.
</P>
<P>
   King and two other men are charged with dragging James Byrd Jr.
for almost three miles along back country roads in the early
morning hours of June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer several Ku Klux Klan and armed black militant groups
demonstrated around the Jasper courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any display of firearms or other conduct that might be, in any
manner, construed to intimidate, influence, or otherwise disrupt or
endanger the trial of this sensitive matter is strictly prohibited
within a two block radius of the Jasper County Courthouse,'' Golden
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to ordain civil obedience and respect for all
parties involved in this matter, you are prohibited from displaying
firearms, destructive devices, or any other dangerous weapons, or
any signs calculated to cause a breach of the peace or obstruction
of justice,'' he wrote in an order called an ``open letter to all
groups and persons making public appearances during this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles and Jasper Police Chief
Stanley Christopher said officials haven't heard of any groups
planning to come to Jasper during the trial. Testimony, which
should last from one to two weeks, is expected to begin Feb. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the 110-year-old courthouse is the tightest in its
history, with visitors having to go through metal detectors for the
first time. That security is about to get even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Bureau of Investigation technicians Tuesday began
installing surveillance cameras inside and outside of the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Jasper Police Department is also issuing photographic
identification cards for courthouse workers, members of the media
and others visiting the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers certified seven more potential jurors Tuesday, bringing
the total to 34. In all, 20 white men, eight white women, three
black men and three black women have been certified for possible
service on the jury. Lawyers plan to certify about 50 jurors before
picking the 12 who will be on the jury and two alternates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the white men certified Tuesday told lawyers that last
March he hired King to help him install a metal roof on a building.
He said King worked for him about four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Trial dates have not been set for Shawn Allen Berry, 23, and
Lawrence Russell Brewer Jr., 31, who also are charged with capital
murder in Byrd's death.

IN JAPAN, CONCERN OVER INTEREST RATES IS GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also JAPAN-JOBLESS) 
(lb) 
By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As Japan struggles to revive its economy, concern is
growing that market pressure to lift interest rates could choke off
a recovery just as it is beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are saying that Japan's economy could
rebound this summer, but it is around that time that some private
economists are saying that long-term rates could spike and drain
the energy from an incipient revival.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is stuck in its worst postwar recession and has been
trying to emerge from economic stagnation for eight years, so the
pessimists tend to have prominence over the optimists. But these
days, as Japanese officials voice their views on the economy _
starting with their forecast that it will grow by half a percent in
1999 _ it sometimes seems as though they and private analysts are
talking about two different countries.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, some economists worry that with the economy's
future uncertain, politicians seem to be sinking into a feeling of
complacency, now that they have enacted a huge-scale bank bailout
and a $200 billion package of lending and spending to stimulate the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, crisis is inevitable because without action, there
will be crisis and without crisis, there can be no action,'' said
Andrew Smithers, a longtime analyst of Japan who runs his own
economic advisory business. ``It's amazing how big a crisis it has
to be in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the bailout and the stimulus packages in place, Japan
faces an array of formidable challenges, from a recently
strengthened currency _ which makes its exports expensive abroad _
to the need to work off the consequences of an investment boom that
has left the economy with far more productive capacity than it can
easily use.
</P>
<P>
   If the stronger yen does not stifle growth, then a rise in
long-term interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, could.
Some economists are forecasting a significant rise in long-term
rates, to 3 percent or 4 percent by the end of this year. In
October, the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond was a little more
than 0.7 percent, an extraordinarily low rate of return by world
lending standards.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government is beginning to spend its way out of its
economic troubles, that comes at a cost. Japan's budget deficit for
the next fiscal year is likely to reach 10 percent of output. And
as tax revenue falls, the nation's accumulated debt is poised to
exceed the size of the entire economy.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the annual deficit in the United States reached
6.3 percent of the gross domestic product in 1983, the highest
since shortly after the end of World War II. Apart from the war,
accumulated government debt reached a peak in the mid-'90s at
roughly 70 percent of output.
</P>
<P>
   One problem in Japan is that to finance the huge debt burden,
along with the stimulus packages, the government will have to
embark on a large program to raise revenue, about 60 trillion yen,
or $535 billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year
beginning on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The government has also acknowledged that it will no longer use
the shadow budget, a rich coffer of public funds, to absorb some of
the bonds it is offering, meaning that investors will have to buy
the bonds on the market. Japanese savers are known for their
extraordinarily deep pockets. Still, with other government entities
and localities forced to issue debt as well, competition for bond
investors could push up long-term interest rates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government must also prepare for the repayment of more than
100 trillion yen _ now almost $900 billion _ in 10-year postal
savings deposits that come due in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is an onrushing truck,'' said William D. Campbell,
fixed-income strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities Asia, adding that
Japanese officials ``are terrified they'll be unable to meet the
capital outflow from the maturing postal savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The amount is far larger than repayment demands in other years.
Officials here expect most depositors to roll over much of their
money, but even if one-fifth of the funds are withdrawn, the
government will have to turn over nearly $180 billion to pay back
depositors.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and other analysts say that the trust fund bureau,
which manages Tokyo's accounts, would probably have to sell a
portion of its holdings in government bonds. And these actions,
they say, could throw the bond market into distress, similar to the
rout that occurred late last year when the Finance Minister, Kiichi
Miyazawa, said that the shadow coffers would no longer absorb
government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The risk to the economy is that if rates rise significantly,
this might choke off economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   But Xinyi Lu, fixed-income strategist at Paribas Capital Markets
here, suggested that adverse economic consequences could be avoided
if higher rates turned out to be only a temporary spike. If rates
rose much higher than 3 percent, he predicted, investors would
probably push them back down by pouring money into higher-yielding
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The yield would rise and then it would come down,'' he said.
``There will be a shock, but it's not like they will keep rising.
They will come down.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials also play down the risks of a big
oversupply of bonds. They argue that most Japanese investors do not
like risk and will probably roll over their postal savings
deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who parked money overseas, they say, have watched in
dismay as the yen strengthened, cutting into their returns. To
avoid foreign-exchange risks again, they should keep more money at
home, in safe government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they say, interest rates at 3 percent to 4 percent may
not be so worrisome _ especially if the economy is growing.

 HOLBROOKE AGREES TO PAY $5,000 TO END INFLUENCE CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's choice to be the top
American delegate to the United Nations, has agreed to pay $5,000
to the Justice Department to settle civil charges that he violated
federal lobbying laws in his contacts with the American Embassy in
South Korea, government officials and friends of Holbrooke said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the settlement did not require an admission of
wrongdoing by Holbrooke and should allow his nomination for the
U.N. post to be submitted this month to the Senate for
confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the settlement, which was reached between Holbrooke
and the Justice Department public integrity section, are expected
to be announced in days, after a final review by senior officials
at the department, including Attorney General Janet Reno.
Government officials said it was highly unlikely that senior
officials would order major changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department had accused Holbrooke of violating
federal lobbying laws when, shortly after having resigned from the
State Department in 1996, he contacted the embassy in South Korea
for help in setting up an appointment with the president of South
Korea and other Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal ethics laws bar officials leaving the government from a
variety of contacts with former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional officials said that because there were
no allegations of criminal wrongdoing by Holbrooke and because the
lobbying violations appeared to have been minor, his nomination
should be approved with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Holbrooke gained the admiration of many lawmakers,
Democrats and Republicans alike, when he led the marathon
negotiations that produced the Dayton peace accord that ended the
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination still has to be reviewed by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and its often unpredictable chairman, Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C. A leading congressional critic of the United
Nations, Helms has promised that he will scrutinize the Justice
Department investigation to determine whether prosecutors had
treated Holbrooke leniently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to walk through the evidence, walk through every
step that the Justice Department took,'' said Marc Thiessen, a
Helms spokesman. ``We're not going to take the Justice Department's
word on this. Sen. Helms is going to come to his own independent
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Helms would closely question Holbrooke about the
senator's call for significant budgetary and bureaucratic changes
at the United Nations and about the perception that Holbrooke is
too close to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement in October between Holbrooke and Milosevic that was
supposed to have ended the fighting in the Serbian province of
Kosovo has collapsed in recent weeks, leaving the United States and
its NATO allies on the verge of a new round of talks and, possibly,
air strikes against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This confirmation won't be a cakewalk,'' said a senior
congressional official who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, whose nomination has been stalled for eight months as
a result of a joint ethics investigation by the Justice and State
departments, has denied wrongdoing in his contacts with the embassy
in Seoul and Ambassador James Laney.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Holbrooke say the contacts, which occurred within
weeks of his resignation from the State Department in February
1996, were approved by senior State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Former senior American diplomats say that Holbrooke had been
asked to contact American embassies as he traveled in his new job
as vice chairman of the investment banking firm of Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who remained an unpaid adviser to the State
Department after joining Credit Suisse, visited South Korea in the
spring of 1996 to deliver a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted Laney for help in setting up a meeting with
President Kim Young-sam. Laney, a former president of Emory
University, has said that the contact was ``entirely appropriate''
and that it would have been an insult to the embassy had Holbrooke
not sought his help in scheduling the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Holbrooke began in late June, when an
anonymous letter to the State Department accused him of a possible
violation of ethics laws involving his contacts for a consulting
contract with the embassy in Hungary in 1995.

   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Promising a peaceful revolution to remove
the ``cancer'' of corruption, Hugo Chavez Frias was inaugurated as
president on Tuesday, almost seven years to the day after he
started a failed coup.
</P>
<P>
   Trembling as he took his oath, Chavez declared, ``I swear over
this moribund constitution that I will press necessary democratic
transformations.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before Congress and 14 world leaders, Chavez gave an
emotional two-hour address describing a Venezuela that is rotting
to the core, how its 23 million people fell far short of their
potential and how a ``social time bomb'' of hunger, disease and
malnutrition was going ``ticktock, ticktock.''
</P>
<P>
   Interspersing poetic allusions from Walt Whitman and Pablo
Neruda with more muscular anecdotes from the life of Simon Bolivar,
Chavez pleaded with Venezuelans to work to escape ``this terrible
labyrinth we find ourselves in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gave few details on how he planned to remove Venezuelans
from their maze of high unemployment, high inflation and decrepit
services from a government dependent on shrinking oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for a middle position,'' he said, ``the
invisible hand of the market and the visible hand of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   After campaigning as a populist friendly to Cuban President
Fidel Castro, Chavez sought to reassure business leaders and
foreign investors by promising to attack the government's widening
budget deficit. He pledged his support for a regional currency in
the next decade, called for closer relations between the Andean and
Mercosur trade zones, and said he would use the military for
antipoverty efforts like road-building.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary on inauguration days, there were cannon salutes,
the laying of a wreath of flowers in honor of Bolivar and folk
music accented by sweet flutes played in the streets. But what made
the day particularly memorable, and frightening to many among the
traditional political elite, was the emergence of this unlikely,
enigmatic man as leader of Latin America's pre-eminent oil exporter
and leader in diplomatic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The son of schoolteachers, Chavez grew up in the prairies,
selling sweets to other children to buy food and books. As a
teen-ager, he entered the military academy, where he studied
strategy and honed his skills as a baseball pitcher with a strong
curveball.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point of his life occurred in 1989, when food riots
here led him and other young officers to start the coup three years
later against President Carlos Andres Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The coup failed, and Chavez spent two years in jail. But his
attacks against corruption made him a folk hero. In his speech
Tuesday, Chavez unabashedly paid tribute to his comrades from the
coup attempt who listened on a Senate balcony. Television cameras
broadcast a close-up of Andres Perez, now a senator, wincing and
crossing his arms as others joined in mild applause.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez promised again to seek a referendum that would lead to an
assembly to rewrite the constitution. Chavez's aides said he wanted
the new constitution to remove the judiciary from politics, add
checks and balances between branches of government and remove the
one-term limit for presidents, breaking the advantages that the two
main opposition parties enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   A new constitution, Chavez said, is necessary to help remake a
country that he described as being in the deepest of crises.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much riches, the largest petroleum reserves in the world,
the fifth largest reserves of gas, gold, the immensely rich
Caribbean Sea,'' Chavez said. ``All this, and 80 percent of our
people live in poverty. What scientist can explain this?''
</P>
<P>
   For several years after the coup attempt, the United States
refused to extend an entry visa to Chavez. Last week, however, he
visited Washington and met President Clinton. Tuesday, Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson, who led the U.S. delegation here,
cautiously praised the inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set a good tone for a very ambitious agenda,'' Richardson
said. ``It's a good start in the American-Venezuelan
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro took copious notes throughout Chavez's speech. Afterward,
the Cuban leader embraced Chavez in a bearhug at a street ceremony
and directed a smart salute to the Venezuelan military high
command, some of whom fought guerrillas financed and trained by
Cuba 35 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Venezuelans, many wearing the trademark red
beret worn by Chavez's paratroopers from the 1992 coup attempt,
cheered the along a parade route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our previous governments only knew how to steal,'' said Ofelia
Banza Carillo, 48, a homemaker who waved a Venezuelan flag.
``Everything, everything, everything will change now. It has to.''

 &HT;    AOC chief still points to Young
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in the (i) International and (s) Sports
categories.)
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The head of the Australian Olympic
Committee had kind words Tuesday for Andrew Young but declined to
retract his allegation that the former Atlanta mayor and United
Nations ambassador dispensed U.S. government aid to African nations
during the bid process for the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did John Coates offer any details to support his claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I would say is, we were impressed with the support that
Andrew Young managed to obtain throughout Africa,'' Coates said.
``We certainly understood that there were programs of support for
various developing nations around the world, . . . prior to the
(Atlanta) Games, and for their athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, in discussing (bid) strategy for the Sydney Games, we
identified the need to help developing countries. From the little I
understand of what was happening (in Atlanta), I heard about the
LaGrange (training center) and the good feeling it generated.''
</P>
<P>
   Young has denied any role in U.S. aid to Africa in connection to
the Atlanta bid or even being in position to direct such support.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a response to Young's denial, Coates said: ``I would
never question Andrew Young. He's a fantastic person. If I am
mistaken or misunderstood, I apologize to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But without any proof or willingness to provide specific
information, Coates said it is still his understanding that Young
played a role in aid received by ``one of the countries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it ourselves,'' he said. ``We did it in Mauritius, and
counter-signed with the Australian government in putting out some
equipment. I have it in my mind it also happened with Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates said he also believes that a training center for African
nations was made by Atlanta before the city was awarded the Games.
Young and others who lobbied the African continent acknowledge that
the idea of a camp was mentioned but no guarantees were made. They
reminded African representatives that Young had established a
month-long camp for their athletes in Atlanta before the 1984 Los
Angeles Games.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for an African nations' training camp took shape
shortly after Atlanta won the bid in 1990, and eventually wound up
in LaGrange after city and business leaders there took interest.
The Atlanta Olympic organization claims to have contributed no
funding.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Davis, who ended up serving as head coach at the LaGrange
program, had lobbied leaders while on a government coaching grant
in Africa and helped arrange a meeting between Young and African
IOC members in Mauritius. Athletes began arriving in 1992 and were
housed on the LaGrange College campus. College officials say that
15 to 20 a year received presidential scholarships to attend
school.
</P>
<P>
   Coates cited the LaGrange program in setting up an African
nations training program at the Australian Institute of Sport in
Camberra. It was under scrutiny until Tuesday, when the
International Olympic Committee cleared the Australians by
concluding that cash payments to the Kenya and Uganda Olympic
committees were legitimate. ``I noted what Atlanta had done after
they won, the commitments (given) to the (African) athletes,''
Coates said. ``I'm sure it must have been offered before they were
awarded the Games. But so was our commitment to pay all the
airfares of all the athletes (to the 2000 Games at a cost of) $30
million. So was the commitment to pay $7 million to bring in the
(competitors') boats and horses. They were all conditional on us
winning the bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Atlanta, Coates said, Sydney bid officials didn't lobby
IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga from the Republic of Congo, who heads
the African nations sports federation and is a key figure in the
Salt Lake City bribery scandal. Ganga was viewed as a strong
supporter of the Beijing bid because he once served as an
ambassador to China. Chinese officials suspect the treatment
afforded the African nation sports federations and the general bid
climate may have sabotaged their campaign to bring the 2000 Games
to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   He Zhenliang, a former IOC vice president, joked Tuesday that
the Beijing bid failed because the Chinese couldn't offer what
interests some IOC members _ scholarships for family and friends,
along with training bases for their national athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was everywhere, and nobody asked if we could provide
scholarships or any of this,'' he said. ``We feel China was at a
disadvantage. You have all these universities in the United States
and elsewhere, all this scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, we have none of this. Because of the language
(barrier), what good is a scholarship?''
</P>
<P>
   He poked fun at the practices of the Salt Lake City and Sydney
bid groups but turned serious when recalling that Beijing lost by
two votes to Sydney. ``You can understand how difficult that was,''
he said. ``Now this (scandal). It is quite natural to feel it was
wrong. You lose by only two votes, and you wonder if this was the
reason. I assure you, none of this happened with our bid.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials support keeping the Games in Sydney and Salt
Lake, although they also plan to push for reforms to make the bid
process fairer and less expensive.

 &HT;    Many oppose IOC-run doping agency

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Barry McCaffrey wants to put the fear of
God into world-class athletes. He advocates they be subjected to
possible drug-testing 365 days a year. Test the millionaire pros
and the pixie gymnasts alike. Check them for performance-enhancers
and recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control
Policy, led the parade of government leaders Tuesday addressing the
World Conference on Doping in Sport. Many stressed that sports is
losing the battle to chemists and challenged the International
Olympic Committee to take the lead in anti-doping efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be an independent agency, and it can't just test
at the point of competition,'' McCaffrey said. ``We need to provide
an environment where the world-class athletes, perhaps the top 50
or 100, face a common standard and testing procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey has questioned the integrity of the IOC while calling
for reform, but he toned down his words noticeably when he spoke
before a hall full of IOC members. He managed an odd reference to
spectator risk of ``a marijuana-affected bobsled driver traveling
at speeds upwards to 120 kilometers per hour.'' Left out of the
speech was a scathing paragraph in the written text that addressed
the IOC's legitimacy and lack of accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was quite so diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC has to be transparent, so we can see the money, and
know where the money is going,'' said Otto Schily, the German
sports minister, referring to the bribery scandal involving Salt
Lake and other bid cities. ``How can we have a (doping) policy if
the IOC can't answer these questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Danish minister of culture Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen urged the IOC
to emphasize the importance of values rather than of its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps the IOC should consider the possibility of preparing
ethical accounts as a supplement to the impressive financial
accounts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC is expected today to pick up debate on how best to
implement a proposed independent doping agency and a standard of
penalties for future offenses. IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch's suggestion that the agency be directed by the current
head of the medical commission, Prince Alexandre de Merode, has
been criticized by those outside the IOC. Any proposal with the
beleaguered Samaranch's hands on it is widely viewed as only an
illusion of reform and cannot be sold as a truly independent
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For complete credibility, it (the agency) must be headed by
someone other than an IOC member,'' U.S. Olympic Committee
executive director Dick Schultz said. Spanish Secretary of State
for Sports Francisco Villar added that the agency ``must not depend
on the IOC. It must be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism drew an angry response from de Merode. ``I don't
understand this lack of confidence, saying we do something not
completely correct. I find that a semi-insult,'' he said. ``Ask
people in the streets if there is a great confidence in
politicians. I have some doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most individual sports federations support a two-year ban for
athletes caught using steroids and other performance-enhancing
drugs. In a bid to appease tennis, cycling and soccer officials, de
Merode has suggested imposing fines along with forcing athletes to
sit out key international competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said de Merode's alternative proposal has only marginal
support.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are advocating a substantial research effort to
develop methods to test for the current drugs of favor, human
growth hormone and EPO _ neither of which can be detected by
current procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Schultz and McCaffrey propose that the new doping
agency move quickly to test world-class athletes and establish a
database that can be evaluated again as more advanced equipment
becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no statute of limitations on cheating and drug
abuse,'' McCaffrey said. ``So if it's learned in subsequent years
that you won by cheating, then you would be stripped of your
Olympic honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our purpose isn't to catch cheating. It's to guarantee the
world-class athletes that they don't have to participate in doping
if they expect to win.''

SURGEONS HOPE TO AID KENYAN CHILDREN BLINDED IN BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ One of the children still carries glass embedded in an
eye. All three suffered deep, vision-threatening cuts when the Aug.
7, 1998, bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi shattered nearby
windows.
</P>
<P>
   But the three schoolboys from Kenya, whom a private-public aid
mission has brought to Boston for restorative surgery, have a good
chance of growing up with more-or-less normal sight, doctors at the
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary said Tuesday after examining
two of them.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign sparked by a US embassy employee has enabled the boys
to be evaluated and treated at MEEI.
</P>
<P>
   Their transportation and lodging have also been donated, said
Maria Stephens, a Foreign Service economist affiliated with the US
Embassy in Nairobi. She got the project rolling by getting in touch
with MEEI officials after seeing a newspaper photo of one of the
injured boys.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said at a briefing Tuesday, ``I knew if anything could
be done for children with eye injuries, it would be in Boston.''
The eye and ear infirmary agreed to provide free care for up to
seven children, said Mary E. Leach, an MEEI spokeswoman. So far,
just the three have been chosen for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Suresh Patel, 17, Sandeep Patel, 13, and Diveyesh Vekaria, 7,
were riding in a school bus that was passing the embassy just as
the terrorist bomb exploded in a catastrophe that killed 213 people
and ionjured 5,400 _ many of them by fragments as the blast
shattered nearby glass-sided office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of a truck that was between the schoolbus and the
embassy building were all killed, said Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really horrible,'' recalled a nervous Suresh Patel at
Tuesday's briefing, adding he was blinded and was taken to a
hospital for surgery. He and Sandeep Patel are not related.
</P>
<P>
   The three boys, who were selected by doctors in Nairobi for
further treatment in Boston, all had excellent immediate care to
suture their eye wounds, said the MEEI doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But the stitched-up cuts in their corneas have left scars, and
at least two of the three will need corneal transplants, said the
physicians. Sandeep Patel has not yet been evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very challenging injuries,'' said Dr. Kathryn Colby,
a corneal surgeon who examined Diveyesh Vekaria along with Dr.
Dmitri Azar, who heads the MEEI corneal service. The doctors said
that the 7-year-old has developed a cataract in one eye as a result
of the wound. He will have the clouded natural lens removed and
replaced with a plastic implant. The other eye needs to have the
scarred part of the cornea replaced with a transplant from a
cadaver eye, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy this kind of surgery because with someone so young''
it's rewarding to see vision restored with a lifetime ahead, said
Colby.
</P>
<P>
   Azar said that a small fragment of glass that remains embedded
in one of the boy's eyes will be examined and removed if it can be
done safely: otherwise it can left in place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Klaes Dohlman, senior cornea specialist, said that Suresh
Patel's injuries were similiar.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cuts in his eyes were ``artfully'' sutured by
doctors in Nairobi, they left scars on the cornea _ the clear
covering of the front of the eye _ that dim his vision. Sight in
one eye can be improved simply by fitting a hard contact lens, said
Dohlman. The other will need a corneal transplant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the several things one must like about Latrell
Sprewell of the newly hatched New York Knicks is that he could have
meshed sweetly with the sainted old Knicks of the Red Holzman glory
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who?'' you might be justified in asking with skepticism, ``the
guy that's been compared to Al Capone in shorts?''
</P>
<P>
   Off the Knicks' two exhibition games and leading into the start
of their regular season Friday at Orlando, the recently acquired
Sprewell has been the consummate team player.

   Sprewell, who was last seen on a National Basketball Association
court strangling his Golden State coach, P.J. Carlesimo, 14 months
ago, has rarely forced the issue with a drive or a jump shot _
taking them when he's open or springing himself free.
</P>
<P>
   He has waited for his opportunities, cooling it in the first
half and then exploding for 17 and 11 points in the lone pair of
third quarters made available to him.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit the famed and opportunistic open man on passes. He is
quick on defense, and made several steals. He has had some
turnovers, but, well, early in most seasons so had Clyde Frazier
and Earl (the Pearl) Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was on the line against the Nets last Friday, he
was not afraid to take the shot that won or lost the game _ some
players run from that responsibility. The 6-foot-5-inch guard got a
last-second rebound and swiftly went out to the 3-point area for a
shot in a 92-90 game that would have given the Knicks a 1-point
victory. The shot was short, but next time it may not be.
</P>
<P>
   He has been getting on swimmingly with his teammates. And during
one break in the action Friday night, Sprewell put his hand on the
shoulder of Coach Jeff Van Gundy, only inches from Van Gundy's thin
neck _ but the gesture was purely comradely.
</P>
<P>
   In the first exhibition game, the free Sprewell waved his arms
for the ball from the point guards. In the past decade and more,
only one Knick was permitted to call for the ball, and that was the
sovereign center, Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But will Sprewell continue to do what he is best at, or placate
Ewing, as did Allan Houston, Larry Johnson and Chris Childs, whose
productivity dropped once traded to the Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   And upon first meeting and speaking with Sprewell, one is in for
a surprise if the expectation is to find a hooligan. He is
approachable and thoughtful and as wised-up as someone who has had
a bucket of cold water thrown in his face _ a result, perhaps, of a
suspension that cost him $6.4 million and a sense of being reviled
and hated for what he has called, unfortunately, ``having a bad
day'' with Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to get a lot of boos on the road,'' Sprewell said the
other day, and he did get that reception in the Continental Arena
on Friday. ``But I'm going to take it as, hey, they always boo the
better players on the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being cheered by Garden fans after scoring 27 points in
his debut, he said: ``I'm glad they gave me the chance to prove
myself. But I know that can change'' _ he smiled _ ``if my game
goes south.''
</P>
<P>
   It was mentioned to him that in recent years, there have been
three distinctive hair styles in the NBA _ Michael Jordan's (the
bald coif), Dennis Rodman's (technicolor tresses), and his,
corn-row braids.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson, who wears corn rows but not the braids, had
acknowledged that some people think corn rows are ``supposed to be
some thug image,'' but Iverson doesn't consider himself a thug,
just someone with a personal preference for a head-topping. As does
Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like to be different,'' he said. ``I know some people
might be threatened by the hair style, but I like not being like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   He was signed to help the Knicks become champions, and this from
a 29-year-old player who has played in just one playoff series _
his team was swept in three games _ in his five full seasons in the
league. He was never noted for being a selfless player. He shot a
lot and scored a lot on bad teams, hit a relatively low percentage
(around 45 percent) and had a greater turnover-to-assist record
than most starting NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   And most troublesome, he has also demonstrated an anger that
will have to be controlled. Besides the Carlesimo incident, he also
threatened to kill a teammate, kicked another in the groin and had
words, even on the court during a game, with his Warrior teammates
Tim Hardaway and B.J. Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if Sprewell maintains his current posture and helps lift
the Knicks as fans hope, then soon the whole town may be wearing
corn-row braids.

 &HT;    Blumenthal next as impeachment interviews wind down
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House prosecutors will question their third and
possibly last witness today in President Clinton's impeachment
trial after interviewing Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan for more
than three hours on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House aide Sidney Blumenthal, a former reporter in whom
Clinton confided shortly after his affair with Monica Lewinsky
became public, will be questioned in a secure room of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   While House prosecutors interviewed Jordan, senators had their
first opportunity to watch a videotape of Lewinsky's deposition,
which was taken Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several GOP senators said they saw nothing new in Lewinsky's
testimony, but at least one key Senate Republican said he thought
the former White House intern's testimony was compelling enough to
put her before the Senate as a live witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seemed young, she seemed vulnerable and she seemed
credible,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee. ``I think she would make an excellent witness.
I think the American people should be given that opportunity and
make up their own minds ... about this whole matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether to call Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal before the
Senate will be among the first issues the Senate will have to
decide when it reconvenes as a court of impeachment Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Before a vote on live witnesses, however, senators will first
vote on whether to admit the depositions, either in written form or
on videotape, into the public record.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are firmly opposed to the release of the videotapes.
Republicans appear to be somewhat more divided, with Hatch and
others firmly in favor and moderate Republicans somewhat more
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.), who watched a tape of Lewinsky's
deposition Tuesday, said he had not yet decided whether it should
be made public, but he added the tape contained nothing
objectionable or salacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that if it came before the Senate, it would not
offend the institution,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Other senators noted that Lewinsky's testimony seemed rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appeared to be a professional witness,'' said Sen. Peter
Fitzgerald (R-Ill.). He added that as an attorney, it appeared that
Lewinsky ``knew in her own head all of the lawyer's tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) described Lewinsky as
``heartbreakingly young.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is scheduled to vote on the two articles of
impeachment against Clinton by Feb. 12, provided White House
lawyers or House prosecutors do not delay the proceedings with
calls for more witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are still issues we have to address,'' said Rep. Asa
Hutchinson (R-Ark.), who questioned Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Before the deposition, Hutchinson said he intended to explore
Jordan's assistance in helping Lewinsky find a job in New York
City. Republican prosecutors contend Jordan's assistance was
intended to keep her from telling the truth in a civil lawsuit
filed by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who claimed
the president made an unwanted sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky has repeatedly testified that no one ever promised
her a job in exchange for her untruthful testimony in the Jones
suit.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of depositions, it became clear that no
``bombshell'' had yet materialized. But that did little to dissuade
the House prosecutors from pursuing their goal of removing the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have helped if there was new information,'' said Rep.
Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.
``But confirming the accuracy and the reaffirmation of her previous
statements under oath is something worthwhile, because she is
already on record in many areas that are helpful to the
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senators met behind closed doors Tuesday to discuss a
proposal by Sens. Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine to have the
Senate adopt so-called findings of fact regarding Clinton's
conduct, before a vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Although the wording is still under discussion, the findings of
fact would essentially affirm the accusations contained in the
impeachment articles but stop short of convicting Clinton and
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the majority whip, said the proposal
was gaining momentum but was still unresolved within the caucus.
``A lot of people are interested in it,'' Nickles said. ``Not a lot
are interested in the censure proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) is heading a group of seven senators
assigned with the task of producing the final findings of fact. He
said the group is close to completing that document.
</P>
<P>
   Several skeptical GOP senators said they are now convinced that
findings of fact would be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, is it the right thing to do inside the
impeachment process?'' said Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho). ``The one
thing we don't want to do is introduce something that is outside
the impeachment process.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, are mounting a vigorous campaign against
the finding of fact proposal. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) said the
idea would take Clinton's impeachment ``into a dark alley for a
mugging of the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), a Democratic moderate, said the
findings of fact was ``well-intentioned,'' but also expressed
serious reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to be careful that we are not seeming to convict
the president of particular crimes in these findings, because that
would clearly be unconstitutional,'' Lieberman said. ``That's not
the role of the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. The
Framers made that quite clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch has an alternate proposal that would adjourn the trial
before a vote on the impeachment articles and include language in
the adjournment to the effect that Clinton ``gave false and
misleading testimony under oath'' and ``impeded the justice
system's search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's proposal would also declare the impeachment articles the
``highest form of condemnation, other than removal.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties, however, are opposed to Hatch's
proposal because it would avoid an up or down vote on the articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the odds of an adjournment resolution passing, Craig
said dryly, ``There could be another snowstorm between now and
spring, but I doubt it.''

FIRING OF SOCCER COACH HAS ENGLAND SEETHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ An Englishman, not Shakespeare, once said football, as
soccer is called here, is more than a game _ it is life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, that adage seemed more than hyperbole as the manager of
England's national soccer team was fired after nearly every one in
Britain, including the prime minister, had given their own verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, Glenn Hoddle's transgression was to expound on his
well-known belief in reincarnation by giving a newspaper interview
in which he appeared to suggest that people with disabilities are
being punished for sins in a previous life.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle's unconventional views, and the feeding frenzy they
unleashed, have obsessed the British public and news media for
three days, relegating to the back pages such weighty matters as
the world economic conference in Switzerland and attempts to hash
out a peace agreement for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But more than prove just how seriously this country takes its
soccer, the tempest over what Hoddle said or didn't say has also
left some people complaining that the kind of hypersensitivity that
has chilled free speech in the United States is seeping across the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest the sort of intolerance to unpopular religious
views that drove the Pilgrims and Puritans to America nearly four
centuries ago has never gone away. And still there are others who
believe the reason given for Hoddle's sacking was a smokescreen,
that he was really fired because the team did not perform as well
in the World Cup as England fans expected.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the last reason for which Hoddle was fired, his
successor, whomever it is, will have little job security, because
the English lust after glory on the soccer pitch even more than
they lament their long lost empire.
</P>
<P>
   When Hoddle was hired in 1996, after money squabbles between his
predecessor and the Football Association, the country's ruling body
on soccer, he was viewed as a breath of fresh air: a clean-living,
born-again Christian who would whip into shape an England team that
had a reputation for performing better in the pub than on the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle's unconventional views on spirituality and the afterlife
rubbed many the wrong way. After he led England to the European Cup
final in 1997, however, most fans were willing to overlook beliefs
that the ordinary fan considered barmy. But when England bowed out
of the World Cup finals in the second round last summer, despite
having what media commentators claimed was the strongest team in a
generation, Hoddle was mercilessly second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   England was eliminated from the World Cup in dramatic fashion,
losing to Argentina on penalty kicks after their game ended in a
tie. Not only did commenators question the five players Hoddle
chose to take the kicks, it later emerged that Hoddle never had the
team practice penalty kicks, an elementary part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Hoddle later said his only regret was that he had not been
allowed to bring along his personal faith healer and spiritual
adviser, most fans concluded the manager was daft.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle's undoing came in an interview with The Times of London.
In it, he was quoted as saying, ``You and I have been physically
given two hands and two legs and half-decent brains. Some people
have not been born like that for a reason. The karma is working
from another lifetime. It is not only people with disabilities.
What you sow, you have to reap.''
</P>
<P>
   Many disabled people were outraged. Talk shows talked about
nothing else. Even Prime Minister Tony Blair said Hoddle had to go.
Tuesday, under pressure from sponsors, the Football Association
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   David Aaronovitch, a cultural commentator, worries that
intolerance of unpopular religious views is being cloaked in the
guise of sensitivity to the disabled and other minorities who have
suffered discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it more insulting to believe disability is a legacy of a
previous life than that it's God's will?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that there are many Hindus and Buddhists in Britain who
share Hoddle's belief in reincarnation, Aaronovitch asks whether
they, too, should be barred from coaching the English team.
</P>
<P>
   All meaty questions, which will be posed for days, weeks, months
and probably years. There is a generation of Englishmen not yet
born who will one day ask why Glenn Hoddle let an obscure player
named David Batty take the final, futile kick against Argentina.

GORGEOUS SPECTACLES, FOR BOTH THE EYE AND EAR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal, The Atlantic Monthly, Opera International and other
publications.

<P>
   Only princes spoil guests like this. To an exhibition of rare
splendors at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, we may, for one night
only, add enchantments for the ear. The show in question is ``Dosso
Dossi: Court Painter in Ferrara,'' on view through March 28.
</P>
<P>
   The complementary concert, ``Monteverdi and His Contemporaries:
Music and Poetry of the Late Renaissance,'' on Friday evening,
features the glamorous Italian soprano Anna Caterina Antonacci in
her New York debut, with instrumentalists of the early-music group
Accademia Bizantina of Ravenna.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening of the Dossi show last year in Ferrara, the
evening so delighted the audience of invited dignitaries that
museum officials and the Italian Cultural Institute decided on the
spot to replicate it in New York. Not only have they managed to do
so; they have also secured the funds to present the event free of
charge, as a gift to the Met public. No tickets are required. The
doors are open to all.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who responds to the subtle yet brilliant sounds of the
decades on either side of 1600 will understand the appeal,
particularly of Ms. Antonacci's contributions: among them, two
supreme set pieces by Monteverdi. ``Lamento d'Arianna''
(``Ariadne's Lament'') is the lone surviving fragment of his opera
on the popular subject of the runaway princess from Crete,
abandoned on a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda'' tells of the
long-drawn skirmish between a Christian knight and an infidel. The
Christian wins, only to discover that his haughty, belligerent
antagonist was not a knight, as he thought, but the enemy maiden he
loves.
</P>
<P>
   The text is set straight from Tasso's epic ``La Gerusalemme
Liberata'' (``Jerusalem Delivered''), still new at the time and
wildly fashionable. Published in Monteverdi's celebrated book of
madrigals of love and war, ``Il Combattimento'' is a prime example,
perhaps (italics)the(end italics) prime example, of his ``stile
concitato,'' or ``excited style,'' invented expressly to lend song
the breath and fire of drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Met rendition will be a special tour de force. Most
performances of the work use three singers: the titular pair (whose
interjections, though crucial, are few), and a hard-working
narrator, whose spell must never falter over the course of the
lengthy tale. Ms. Antonacci goes it alone.
</P>
<P>
   But where, one may ask, is the link between Dosso's art and
Monteverdi's? Not in synchronicity; not in place or conditions of
employment. Dosso died in 1542 in his mid-50s; Monteverdi, who
would live to his mid-70s, was not born until 1567. Dosso's career
unfolded at the court of the Este family at Ferrara.
</P>
<P>
   Monteverdi's activities centered first on the rival court of
Mantua, then on St. Mark's in Venice, coincidentally just at the
moment that the proud republic was recasting the formerly
aristocratic art form of opera as an entertainment for the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is the artists' difference in stature. Dosso's
contemporaries spoke of him in the same breath with Leonardo,
Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, but they can hardly have failed
to see that Dosso's poetic originality was that of a follower
rather than a founder. Monteverdi, on the other hand, marked a new
beginning, in theory and practice.
</P>
<P>
   Would it have been wiser, therefore, and more to the point, to
complement the exhibition with music of Dosso's own place and time?
It might have been done, quite worthily.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the mid-15th century, the court of Ferrara took a
peacock's pride in its chorus, its instrumental virtuosos and its
procession of great Northern European contrapuntalists, attracted
by lavish incomes underwritten by the Roman church. (Early in the
16th century, the illustrious Josquin Desprez himself accepted
employment there, though his tenure was brief, perhaps cut short by
an outbreak of plague.) Conceivably, a genius at interdisciplinary
studies might tease out illuminating correspondences, but as a
pendant to Dosso's paintings, the music from Ferrara in the early
1500s might well strike the pleasure seekers among us as academic
in the dusty sense.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the connection that matters in the attempt to yoke
the fine arts and music is never some blank historic given but an
elective (therefore arbitrary) affinity, existing first of all in
the mind of a beholder. By this criterion, Dosso and Monteverdi
make a splendid pair: twins in their love of chivalric fantasy as
practiced by Ariosto and then Tasso (who sparkled like Dosso, as
jewels in the Este crown).
</P>
<P>
   Not only that. Dosso's and Monteverdi's literary predilections
chime with a shared flair for drama and a sheer gorgeousness of
surface. No less than brush and canvas, music makes a capital
vehicle for spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The turbaned beauty at the center of Dosso's ``Melissa'' helps
make the case. Armed with torch and occult tablets, seated in a
circle of cryptic symbols, attended by a dog of pensive,
disconcertingly human aspect, she gazes at a clutch of tiny
manikins lashed high on the trunk of a tree. Armor lies on the
ground, cast off like a shell. What souls and bodies await the
mystic lady's pleasure?
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, who is she? Not Ariosto's benign Melissa at
all, some experts insist, but Circe, the wicked witch of antiquity
who transformed lovers to pigs _ as if among divas, good and evil
were not flip sides of a single coin. What bewitches us in them is
not political allegiance but the fierceness of their personal
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Such a notion would hardly be lost on Ms. Antonacci, a singing
actress of uncommon fascination. On opening night of the season at
La Scala in 1996, in the title role of Gluck's ``Armide,'' she
commanded the stage as the latter-day Circe out of ``Jerusalem
Delivered,'' brought low by her affections, vengeful and amorous by
turns, possessed of godlike powers yet the plaything of her
passions.
</P>
<P>
   By Gluck's day in the 18th century, the tale of Armida and
Rinaldo (as Tasso called them) was no longer the novelty it was for
Monteverdi, but their popularity endured. Giambattista Tiepolo
painted the pair on more than one occasion, depicting the sorceress
in sullen possession of her sometime love slave, inveigling him
with a mirror.

ANTIBIOTICS REDUCE HEART ATTACKS, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding weight to a theory that infections may cause some heart
attacks, Boston University researchers are reporting that people
who took certain antibiotic drugs during a three-year period had
substantially fewer first heart attacks than those who had not
received antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The antibiotics presumably were protective because they battled
infections caused by a type of bacteria that has been implicated in
heart disease in previous studies.
</P>
<P>
   While the findings strengthen an association between infections
and heart disease that several studies have made in recent years,
they don't confirm the notion, the scientists pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crude, indirect way of looking at the data, but the
results are certainly worth paying attention to,'' said Dr. Hershel
Jick, an author of the report in the current Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The study in no way suggests that people should take antibiotics
in an effort to prevent or treat heart disease, emphasized an
editorial accompanying the report.
</P>
<P>
   Even if further research confirms the link between germs and
heart attacks, wrote Dr. Aaron R. Folsom, a University of Minnesota
epidemiologist, widespread taking of antibiotics ``would need to be
undertaken cautiously because of the likelihood of promoting
drug-resistant bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the addition of infections to the known heart attack
risk factors lessen the need for attention to smoking, diet,
obesity, physical activity, and other factors, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is authored by Jick, Christoph R. Meier, and their
colleagues at the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program in
Lexington, Mass. It is a unit of Boston University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The drug surveillance program has unique access to a database
containing detailed records of the treatment of patients in 350
general practices in the United Kingdom. The database has been used
for about 300 studies on the effects of drugs, including the first
to show that aspirin can prevent heart attacks, said Jick.
</P>
<P>
   For the current study, the researchers analyzed the records of
3,315 people (three-fourths of whom were men) who had first heart
attacks between 1992 and 1997, and compared the drugs they had
taken with those used by 13,139 other patients without heart
attacks. All of the patients were healthy and had no important risk
factors for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis showed that people who took antibiotics belonging
to two categories _ tetracyclines or quinolones _ once or momre in
the three years had about one-third fewer heart attacks than those
who hadn't taken antibiotics during that time. Those antibiotics
are effective against a type of bacteria, chlamydia pneumoniae,
that has been linked to heart attacks.

   But patients who had taken other kinds of antibiotics, known as
macrolides, sulfonamides, penicillins, or cephalosporins, suffered
heart attacks at the same rate as those taking no antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern suggests, the scientists say, that the drugs fought
chlamydia infections and protected some men from heart attacks. It
is not known how the bacteria would cause heart attacks, but there
are several scenarios, including one in which the germs attack the
lining of coronary arteries, causing an injury that leads to a
buildup of clots and formation of a plaque that later ruptures.

 UNDATED: a mirror.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In point of fact, a detail from Tiepolo graced the cover of the
Scala program book, raising the hope that the production would pay
tribute to the painter. Gluck a la Tiepolo is a seductive notion,
and Luchino Visconti produced just that at La Scala four decades
ago with an ``Iphigenie en Tauride'' starring Maria Callas.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Pier Luigi Pizzi, the designer and director of
``Armide,'' took his inspiration in the all-around material and
mechanical extravagance of the Baroque theater. The award-winning
results were ravishing to look at, but more ravishing than the
stage pictures was the atmosphere Riccardo Muti's orchestra painted
in translucent, subtle tints of sound.
</P>
<P>
   We are a long way from Dosso's ``Melissa'' _ or are we? The
painter died too soon to have read Tasso, but they belong to the
same world of the imagination. In May, when Muti revives ``Armide''
at La Scala, with a cast once again headed by Ms. Antonacci, more
than one viewer may place her willowy, spellbinding heroine in a
direct line of descent from Dosso's moody sybil. Never mind that in
the mid-1510s, when Dosso painted ``Melissa,'' opera as we know it
lay a century in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect we see clear as day how his picture aspires to the
condition of opera, where personal beauty, gesture, costume and
setting combine with music in fleeting moments of all but
hallucinatory intensity. This same synthesis is what one hopes for
in the soprano's selections at the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Gathered as they are from many media and scattered over
centuries, these illustrations drive home a stubborn point: arts
thought to ``speak'' to each other cannot very well mimic each
other. The eye wanders, sweeping vistas in a glance, alighting at
random, choosing what to see _ which is how we look at pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The ear monitors, registering sound as it unfolds; we hear music
on its own timetable or not at all. Yet by different means,
different art forms attempt to reach the same end: to capture
experience on the wing, to rescue for eternity impressions
otherwise doomed to pass without a trace.
</P>
<P>
   The impressions in question may originate in anything:
observation of the world that whirls around us, private sessions of
our thoughts and, most emphatically, our experience of art _ any
art. But once gathered, such impressions need to be transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Can one ``dance'' a Bach fugue? Yes, by opening up spatial
dimensions that leave the time-bound architecture of the music
behind. The first step toward dancing a fugue in pure Platonic
form, as Twyla Tharp has shown, is to (italics)abandon(end italics)
music. Her celebrated ``Fugue'' is literally composed in step
sequences, the acoustic element consisting of nothing but the sound
of three dancers' boots striking a miked floor.
</P>
<P>
   Choreography, as generally understood, is the art of marrying
dance and music. With ``Fugue,'' Ms. Tharp combined sound and
movement as aspects of a single act. So perfect a union of music
and image or music and story would be hard to find. Though popular
candidates abound, from Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons'' to Prokofiev's
``Peter and the Wolf,'' the ``descriptive'' cues in the music are
mostly quite sparse.
</P>
<P>
   Without having seen Mickey Mouse in ``Fantasia'' or reading the
program notes, does a listener visualize the ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice'' of Dukas? ``Pictures at an Exhibition'' manages,
thanks to the recurrence of the emotionally neutral Promenade
between varied set pieces, to suggest to an uncanny degree the
experience of a museumgoer passing through a gallery. But without
Mussorgsky's general title (plus the names of each picture) would
one listener in a thousand guess the intention?
</P>
<P>
   Suggestion is worth more in these cases than fact. At the
National Symphony in Washington, Leonard Slatkin once tried to help
audiences out with a slide show of the universally ignored pictures
of Viktor Hartmann that inspired the composition. Hartmann's
visions paled beside Mussorgsky's; the wonder is that the composer
saw anything in them at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jackson Pollock retrospective this season, the Museum of
Modern Art turned the tables, setting up listening stations stocked
with the jazz selections Pollock played while executing his action
paintings. A formalist might point out analogies between the
musicians' free yet highly channeled themes and variations on one
hand and the artist's strange marriage of randomness and modularity
on the other.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of looking at the pictures and that of listening
to the music were not a bit alike. Jazz put Pollock in the mood, it
seems. We may wonder why, and we will never know.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Dossi show, ``Allegory of Music'' reflects the
painter's interest in a sister art, though what his symbols import
is obscure. Three thickset nudes are shown, a blacksmith and two
females, handling or ignoring various objects: a discarded viol,
numbered mallets (perhaps keyed to notes of the scale), tablets
incised with intricate canons of the sort Ferrara admired in his
time.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, however, Dosso depicts musicians making music, and
here he is not arcane at all. In the Aeneas frieze, Orpheus is
found by the entrance to the Elysian Fields. In the manner of
Dosso's age, the mythic master plays not the lyre of antiquity but
a ``lira da braccio,'' a forerunner of the violin.
</P>
<P>
   That is the instrument, too, in the magnificent ``Apollo'' at
the Galleria Borghese in Rome, which shows up in the Met's
catalogue though, alas, not in the exhibition. The grief-struck god
is just finishing his elegy for Daphne, releasing bow from string
with the flourish of the virtuoso.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot hurt to imagine that he has been singing Monteverdi,
several decades early. Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
are sweeter.

MAKING MUSIC SOMETHING TO BE SEEN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Predictions of doom issuing occasionally from this column refer
less to music itself than to the business of music. The sounds will
survive. The electronic revolution can surely make a place for
Stravinsky's ``Symphony of Psalms'' and the Schubert piano sonatas.
As to new music, expect not less but more.
</P>
<P>
   Don't, however, necessarily expect it from the concert or opera
stage. Look also to the various ethnic ghettos of the world, the
nightclubs of Rio de Janeiro or the storefronts of Avenue A in New
York City. Rock music has already seen the richness emanating from
the wreckage of Britain's industrial cities. People will still
create piles of bad music and snippets that will change our lives.
Thus it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   It is the enclave we call classical music that is most
beleaguered. Like its pop, rock and jazz counterparts, it has been
suffering a drought in creativity; and the way it presents itself,
though cherished by an older generation, is being resisted by a
younger one.
</P>
<P>
   Some defenders of the faith like the old ways enough to embark
on campaigns of education for newcomers. Once the unwashed are
indoctrinated into the ritual of tail coats, entrance and exit
applause, and don't-you-dare-clap-between-movements decorum, then
they will belong.
</P>
<P>
   And so a 200-year-old tradition prevails. The process works
piecemeal; indeed, opera attendance is evidently healthy. But the
old ways don't have a chance with the bright, inquisitive and
well-educated young people now in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Seen through their eyes _ by novices who find no reason to make
the necessary suspensions of disbelief _ the classical concert
looks irrelevant if not patently ridiculous. The guardian of
tradition has an easy response to their amazement, and that is to
identify this new and unwilling generation as ignorant and
uncultured.
</P>
<P>
   Let's load it down with reading and listening material, make it
sit at home and prepare, then herd it into music-appreciation
courses and preconcert panel discussions. There is also on-the-spot
training: the swiveled neck and hard stare as a further remedy to
the transgressor of concert behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will not be sorry to see the old formats crumble, but
we do worry that a lot of beautiful music might be dragged down
with them. Our chief concern, again, is the large body of outsiders
(a telling word) that is genuinely curious about this
classical-music stuff but is not about to put up with the apparent
nonsense with which it is packaged.
</P>
<P>
   Concert givers are beginning to figure all this out. In New
York, more and more of them have tried to do things differently and
have watched _ with surprise, I suspect _ as the hip and the cool
have bought their tickets and filed in the door.
</P>
<P>
   The adventures in Brooklyn are well known. The visual element
and the connections with popular culture (``Time Rocker'' and
``Maria de Buenos Aires'') help, but even the strictly musical
programs of the Brooklyn Philharmonic under the direction of Robert
Spano have been drawing interesting audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lincoln Center, a fortress of the status quo, is getting the
idea. Jane Moss, who runs the Great Performers series, is taking
some of her events out of their home base altogether and putting
them in churches or Broadway theaters. Song cycles are being
staged. People I've never seen at the opera or at concerts are
showing up. Carnegie Hall's projected high-tech space, Zankel Hall,
should interest them, too.
</P>
<P>
   The policy of bringing new audiences to classical music is, I
think, a failure. Music must come to them, not on its knees but in
some kind of halfway meeting of spirits. Cloaking Mahler in pop
iconography won't work. Young people see through it in a second.
</P>
<P>
   Crossover concerts, moreover, present the weakest of both
worlds. Crossover audiences, like pops-concert audiences, rarely
take the bait and subscribe to symphony orchestra seasons. This is
statistical fact.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition that Three Tenors concerts are a gateway to the
opera house and a source of new patrons is, likewise, so much
wishful fiction. Three Tenors patrons like the Three Tenors and the
comforting familiarities they program. They are happy where they
are.
</P>
<P>
   The current wisdom that new audiences want to see at concerts as
well as hear may be right on. We shall have seen and heard this
season actual productions of pure music like Mahler's
``Kindertotenlieder'' and of semipure music like Schoenberg's
``Pierrot Lunaire,'' both from Lincoln Center. The Brooklyn Academy
of Music dressed James Maddalena in a trench coat and sent him
through Schubert's ``Winterreise,'' discreetly staged.
</P>
<P>
   How well mixing media works varies. I thought that the ``Pierrot
Lunaire,'' played, acted, lighted, directed and danced by John
Kelly in Lincoln Center's ``Moondrunk'' at the New Victory Theater,
was too much to take in. Yet the images of the costumed, harshly
lighted and languidly perambulating soprano Lucy Shelton worked
brilliantly.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose the criterion must be: Does the added sensory load
make one concentrate on music and poetry (and again I am assuming
that ``Pierrot Lunaire'' is mainly about those two), or does it
distract from them?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I am selfish in wanting music to be the top priority.
That may also be why most ballet performances I go to _ at which
music is played badly and not paid attention to anyway _ so disturb
me.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music has to trust in its material while at the same
time divesting itself of the pomposity inherent in old rituals. As
someone who grew up with pompous rituals, I retain a certain
fondness for them. I shall miss them, but they have to go.

   About 20 years ago, Floyd Whitley, a glass collector and retired
oil executive from Houston, went to an auction in Kansas City, Mo.,
to buy a rare vase. Called a Peoples vase by collectors, it was
amethyst-colored and depicted dancers celebrating the harvest. Made
between 1909 and 1911, the vase is one of only five known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I paid $5,000 for that vase, which had sold for $250 in the
60s, and everyone in the auction room wanted to give me a
Breathalyzer test,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those who thought Whitley foolhardy were wrong. Last fall,
he sold the vase to a private collector for $50,000. On April 24,
at an auction in Kansas City, 250 items from Whitley's collection
are expected to fetch more than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The vase is an example of Carnival glass, a rainbow colored,
iridescent, elaborately patterned turn-of-the-century collectible,
which was once given away as a carnival prize (hence the name).
Mainly produced by glass manufacturers in the Ohio Valley like
Northwood, Fenton and Millersburg, Carnival, as collectors refer to
it, was the last hand-shaped, mass-produced glass made in America.
</P>
<P>
   A team of glass makers carved elaborate molds, poured hot,
colored glass into them, sprayed the designs with iridescent salts
and fired the surface. Since each piece of glass was hand wrought,
no two plates, pitchers or punch bowls, with all their ruffles,
crimps and flutes, are exactly alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are approximately 2,000 patterns, and while most come
only in a marigold color, there are more than 50 colors
documented,'' said Dave Doty, author of the recently published ``A
Field Guide to Carnival Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnival was a knock-off of the more expensive Tiffany glass,
and as a result it also came to be known as ``poor man's Tiffany.''
Sold mostly in department and general stores throughout the
American heartland, Carnival was popular in middle-class households
until it fell out of favor around World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20s, Carnival manufacturers emptied their warehouses,
selling leftover glass by the barrel for as little as $1. Bought by
local carnivals, the glass was distributed as prizes for games,
like pitching pennies. Today, Carnival glass, a staple of flea
markets, tag sales and rural auctions, has regained a following
across the country and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 25 formal Carnival glass clubs, including a Web site
and clubs in Australia, Canada and England,'' said Tom Mordini, a
dealer in Freeport, Ill., who is the vice president of the
International Carnival Glass Association. ``There are 8,200
registered collectors. In 1998, there were 36 auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some collectors who can well afford museum-quality glass covet
Carnival because of its accessibility. ``We have bought Tiffany and
Galle, but there was much more Carnival available in this area,''
said Don Hamlet, the owner of a meat-packing plant, who, with his
wife, Becky, lives in Asheboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Their collection includes a Peoples vase that they bought at
auction for $43,000 and a one-of-a-kind punch set, made by
Northwood, in a rare aqua opalescent color and grape and cable
pattern, which at $95,000 is the most expensive example of Carnival
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival can be bought for as little as $10 for a candlestick
all the way up to five figures for an exceptional piece. ``An
ornate pattern is more desirable than a simple one, and a rare
color, like pastels or red, and a particular shape, like a punch
set versus candlesticks, or a vase versus a butter dish, goes a
long way,'' said Mordini, who, with his wife, Sharon, publishes
``Carnival Glass Auction Prices'' annually. ``The manufacturer is
important, but most of all, intensity of color and iridescence make
the glass desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Seecks, owner of Seecks Auctions in Mason City, Iowa, said
auctions were more like family reunions than sales. Collectors get
together, swapping and selling their glass at conventions and
auctions held at airport hotels around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most collectors, who range from construction
workers to college professors, were middle-aged, with both the time
and money to track down a long-lost lid to match a sugar bowl or to
complete a set of tumblers. But Seecks said the field had begun to
attract young professionals in their 30s and 40s &UR; . &LR;  ``In the last
five years, the average age of the collector has dropped 10
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors, young and old alike, have seen the investment value
of Carnival as the glass has appreciated in the last two decades.
``In 1980, my first auction had approximately 300 pieces, which
grossed about $35,000,'' said Mickey Reichel, owner of the Antique
and Auction Center in Boonville, Mo. ``In 1998, the average auction
I did, with 375 lots, usually ran into the low six figures.''
</P>
<P>
   The record is $526,000 for a 1993 auction of 400 lots held in
Richfield, Ohio, by Tom Burns, an auctioneer from Bath, N.Y. An
aqua opalescent, peacock and urn pattern bowl fetched $31,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think that when this glass gets to be a hundred years
old in 2009, this stuff will take off,'' said Whitley. ``If I live
long enough, maybe one of my $50,000 vases will ultimately be worth
$200,000. And that's better than oil or cows.''

RED SOX SIGN NO. 1 KOREAN AMATEUR   PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Over the last two years, the Red Sox have expressed a
fondness for Korean pitchers. That sentiment has paid off with the
signing of Seung Jun Song, the No. 1 pick in the Korean amateur
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Song, 18, led Kyung Narm High School of Pusan to the national
championship in a 52-team tournament. The 6-foot-1-inch, 190-pound
righthander pitched nine innings of the final game, striking out
14. Song, who won three ``best pitcher'' awards in 1998, chose
Boston over several Korean professional teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will get a look at Song this month in spring
training at Fort Myers, Fla. General manager Dan Duquette says he
like what he hears about Song, who was scouted and signed by Ray
Poitevint, Boston's executive director of international operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Song is a workhorse who possesses a fastball in the 92-93
range with good movement,'' said Duquette in a statement. ``He has
shown at a very young age the potential to be a future front-line
big league pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Song is the third highly touted Korean to sign with Red Sox. Jin
Ho Cho rose from Single A Sarasota to Boston in less than a year.
He made four starts for the Sox in 1998, all in July (0-3, 18 2/3
IP, 8.20 ERA). Sun Woo Kim spent the entire 1998 season at
Sarasota, where he started 24 games (12-6, 4.82).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sox still have two players awaiting arbitration, outfielder
Midre Cummings and pitcher John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings, 27, who made $250,000 last year, is seeking $750,000,
while the Sox have offered $600,000. His hearing will be Monday.
Cummings batted .283 in 67 games after being acquired on waivers
from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, 26, is asking for $675,000, a raise of $448,000 over his
1998 salary. The Sox are offering $470,000. His hearing is
scheduled for Feb. 16. Wasdin appeared in 47 games in '98, eight as
a starter, and posted a 6-4 record with a 5.19 ERA.

 &HT;    Georgia Republicans unwavering in impeachment question
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia's House Republicans are standing by their
13 colleagues who are prosecuting the impeachment case against
President Clinton in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two are even questioning the political courage of Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As three witnesses testify in closed sessions this week,
Democrats and some House Republicans have criticized the
prosecutors for needlessly extending the proceedings, now in their
fourth week.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have called for a quick end to the trial after
procedural votes in the Senate last week that showed that there are
nowhere near the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton and remove him
from office.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this negativism has seeped into the Georgia
Republican delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Hyde and his gang have done a wonderful job of making
sure they followed through with our commitments,'' said Rep.
Charlie Norwood. ``I am delighted they're having witnesses, because
you could call it a sham trial without witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's eight Republicans voted as a bloc in December for the
four proposed articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One Georgian, Rep. Bob Barr, is a prosecutor, and another,
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, resigned his seat before the
start of the new Congress last month.
</P>
<P>
   Two impeachment articles, alleging perjury and obstruction of
justice, passed the House with overwhelming Republican support, the
culmination of an ugly fight between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has tried to take a less partisan approach, stressing
civility and keeping lines of communication open, even in the wake
of several party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators' view of themselves as more judicious has
prompted criticism from some House members who view the Senate as a
den of elitism.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit around and try to sound like they're some superior
species of politicians is absurd,'' Republican Rep. Jack Kingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-term congressman said the Senate's restrictions on
time and witnesses indicate that they lack ``the stomach for a fair
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans cast what may be unpopular votes, but they
took a stand and explained their votes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Kingston said the Senate is saying, ``We're going
to go ahead and vote and let history reflect that we're the Senate
of cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder agreed with Kingston. ``The Senate is going to
find a way to wiggle out of the tough decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder is among those House members who fear that the bitter
taste of the impeachment battle may linger well into the new
Congress, preventing the House from accomplishing much in the way
of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Norwood and Rep. Saxby Chambliss said they are hopeful that
the House will not be paralyzed by the partisan rancor that marked
the end of the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that people would not carry this impeachment
proceeding on their shoulder throughout this session of Congress,''
Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's exit may lead to more cordial relations between
Georgia Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Rep. John Lewis, the senior Georgian in Congress, has
invited his House colleagues to a 6 p.m. meeting today. It would be
the first time the delegation has met on an interparty basis in
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston, the informal chairman of the Georgia Republican
delegation, said he welcomed Lewis' initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But Linder doubts the value of the meeting. ``It's just surface
cordiality. We have two points of view that are so divergent,'' he
said. ``We've always cooperated when it comes to helping MARTA, and
we'll continue to do that. But there's not much else to talk
about.''

COMMENTS COST ENGLAND'S SOCCER COACH HIS JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Glenn Hoddle, the manager of England's soccer team, was
dismissed from his job Tuesday, several days after he declared that
disabled people's handicaps were the result of bad ``karma'' from
their previous lives.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle, a born-again Christian who has never made a secret of
religious views that include a belief in reincarnation and
spiritual healing, made the remarks in an interview with The Times
of London late last week. Although he spent the weekend apologizing
and saying that he had been quoted out of context, his strenuous
efforts to keep his job ultimately proved unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation had become increasingly untenable,'' David
Davies, the acting executive director of the Football Association,
the governing body for English soccer, said at a news conference
Tuesday afternoon announcing the decision. ``After more than 24
hours of meetings and discussions, it became apparent to all those
concerned that this was the right decision for English football.''
</P>
<P>
   While Davies read his statement, a spectator interrupted the
news conference before he was wrestled to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said that the association's director of football, Howard
Wilkinson, would serve as manager of the England team during next
Wednesday's exhibition game against France.
</P>
<P>
   In more than two years as manager, Hoddle, 41, had a 17-7-4
record. He had alienated supporters and players alike with what
many felt was his arrogance, high-handedness and inability to
instill loyalty among his players.
</P>
<P>
   The nadir undoubtedly came during the World Cup last summer,
when he made a series of unpopular selection decisions. The English
team lost in the second round to Argentina in a penalty-kick
shootout for which, Hoddle admitted later, it had not practiced
taking penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Hoddle wrote a book revealing unflattering details
about several players. He also wrote that his biggest regret was
that he had not taken his long-time faith healer, Eileen Drewery,
along to the World Cup to help provide the ``extra 20 percent'' the
team would have needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to draw negative publicity, in particular for his
deeply felt spiritual views, was compounded by last week's
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``You and I have been physically given two hands and two legs
and half-decent brains,'' Hoddle told The Times of London. ``Some
people have not been born like that for a reason. The karma is
working from another lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that everyone pays the price for previous lives,
saying: ``What you sow, you have to reap.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks raised an immediate outcry from groups that
represent disabled people and from the government of Prime Minister
Tony Blair. The government's minister for sports, Tony Banks, said
that Hoddle's remarks had been so embarrassing that ``it would be
best if Glenn just walked.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Blair weighed in, saying that if Hoddle had been quoted
accurately, ``it would be very difficult for him to stay'' in his
job.
</P>
<P>
   Hoddle had met with FA officials to try to save his job, and his
13-year-old daughter, Zara, sent a letter to the British
Broadcasting Corp. with a plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this situation is the most pathetic reason for someone
to maybe lose their job and to have so much hassle over,'' she
wrote. ``If you would take time to listen to what his explanation
is then maybe you would understand it a bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying desperately to salvage the situation, Hoddle gave a
series of interviews in which he said that he had long supported
and worked on behalf of the disabled. And he tried further to
clarify his views on past lives, saying that he ``was not some
crackpot who just comes out with stupid reasons to cause
controversy'' and that The Times had unfairly quoted him out of
context in a long interview that was supposed to be about sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that we have all lived before and that those who were
wicked or evil in past lives are not blessed with happy lives when
they come back is not mine,'' he said. ``Believe me, reincarnation
was not something invented by Glenn Hoddle. I'm not sure about it,
but some of it makes more sense than just dismissing the unfairness
in life as the luck of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   But the FA was having none of it. After Davies announced that
Hoddle's contract had been terminated, Hoddle himself read a brief
statement acknowledging that his departure was imminent. He again
apologized for his remarks about the disabled, saying that he had
made a ``serious error of judgment'' that had caused
``misunderstanding and pain to a number of people.''

TIMES/CBS POLL FINDS DISAPPROVAL OF SENATE HANDLING OF IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans now condemn the Senate for its handling of the
impeachment trial as much as they did the House, and Republicans
are taking most of the blame. The party's image has taken such a
battering that even conservative Republicans say their party's
prospects for the 2000 elections have been damaged, the latest New
York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   While senators had pledged that they would not engage in the
brutal partisanship that marked the House deliberations, the public
views the entire matter in both chambers as more a Republican drive
to undermine President Clinton than an honest investigation of
possibly serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now have grown so exasperated with their lawmakers
that most people do not expect the Senate trial to end in two weeks
as Senate leaders have promised.
</P>
<P>
   And in a collective judgment that might be summed up as ``Enough
already!'' Americans said impeachment by the House was adequate
punishment for Clinton. While there is still public support for
censure, the public would be just as happy if the whole matter were
dropped without any final vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of those polled said the Senate does not
need to call witnesses to help them decide how to vote on the
articles of impeachment. Nearly-three quarters said the videotaped
testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal
should not be made public. More than three-quarters said they have
learned nothing new about the whole situation from the Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Americans also think that voters' exasperation with impeachment
will come at the expense of Republicans in the elections next year.
Forty-eight percent of Republicans said the way House and Senate
Republicans have handled the matter would make it harder for
Republican candidates to win elections in 2000; 28 percent said it
would be easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have definitely cooked their goose on this
one,'' said Charlotte, a Republican poll respondent and retired
grocery clerk from Bedford, Pa., who, in a follow-up interview,
declined to give her last name. ``A lot of these politicians have
been in Congress too long, and I think they have been trying to
hang the president from Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican poll respondent, Marcia Campbell, 50, a
teacher in Ballston Lake, N.Y., said: ``I don't think the
investigation is going to end any time soon. They'll find something
else to draw it out a little longer. I've lost all faith in the
process. It's like a circus at this point in time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that while the current situation may not lead her to
voting against a Republican in 2000, it ``would certainly make me
think about it more.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most striking findings, the Senate's efforts to
contain the trial by calling only three witnesses has done little
to reassure Americans, who seem to view the matter as a painful
ordeal they want to be over. Fifty-six percent disapprove of the
way the Senate is handling the trial, while 37 percent approve.
Only three weeks ago, in a poll by CBS News, 41 percent disapproved
of how the Senate was handling the trial while 46 percent
registered their approval. Even among self-identified conservative
Republicans in the new poll, nearly a third said they did not
approve of how the Senate was conducting the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide telephone poll of 1,058 adults, conducted
Saturday through Monday, was replete with signs that the Republican
Party has not recovered from its dispiriting performance in the
November election _ and continues to suffer from how impeachment
has been handled on Capitol Hill. The senators, who are serving as
jurors, are viewed by the public as unable to work together in a
bipartisan matter _ and Republicans draw the most blame for that.
</P>
<P>
   Even on issues long considered the province of Republicans like
reducing taxes and curbing crime, Democrats are viewed at least as
qualified as Republicans. While Republicans are still viewed as the
party best capable of upholding traditional moral values, Democrats
are still considered most able to tackle issues like Social
Security, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, while supporting efforts to preserve Social
Security, have recently pressed the party's longstanding mantra of
cutting taxes. But the poll found that majorities of people who
call themselves Democrats or Republicans said they want any budget
surplus to shore up the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice among cutting taxes, playing down the national
debt, preserving Social Security and anything else, 64 percent of
respondents said they wanted any surplus money to be used for
Social Security. Only 12 percent said they would prefer to have
taxes cut instead. The survey has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After months of often acrimonious debates and hearings and a
stop-and-go-trial in the Senate, Clinton is still as popular as
ever. He is seen as doing a good job as president by 65 percent of
the public, including 36 percent of Republicans. And despite his
predicament as a president who is on trial in the Senate, a
majority of Americans said he can govern effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the interminable news coverage, only 19 percent of
Americans said they had been following recent news about the trial
very closely. Forty-four percent said they had been following it
somewhat and 29 percent said not too closely.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that most people were unfamiliar with the
central congressional players in the impeachment matter.
Seventy-one percent of Americans said they were undecided or did
not know enough to have an opinion about Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi. And 61 percent said they were undecided
or did not know enough to have an opinion about Rep. Henry J. Hyde
of Illinois, the chief prosecutor for the Republicans. Seventeen
percent said they had a favorable opinion of Hyde; 20 percent
unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the public's plea for Congress to move on, the Times/CBS
News Poll, 62 percent said they cared a lot about the way the trial
turns out. Two-thirds of Americans want their senators to vote
against convicting the president so he can remain in office.
Sixty-one percent of the public said Clinton's conduct was not
serious enough to warrant his ouster from office _ and an
overwhelming majority said they were not likely to change their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   Americans fully expect that the Senate will not remove Clinton
from office, and they said the Senate should be paying attention to
the public's desire.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans said each party's public image has flagged
because of the impeachment matter, Democrats have endured far
better than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans said House and Senate Republicans have
hurt their party's image in how they have handled impeachment. Of
those people, 40 percent said House Republicans were more
responsible; 24 percent said Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of Americans have a positive impression of the
Democratic Party; 37 percent hold a negative view. But only 41
percent have a favorable view of the Republican Party; 52 percent
view the party unfavorably.
</P>

   ``This thing should have been concluded a long time ago _ God
knows they've spent enough money on it,'' said Ruth Amick, 72, a
poll respondent from Indianapolis who is a Democrat and a retired
automobile plant worker. ``It's about two parties fighting each
other to see who's going to win, either getting Clinton or keeping
him in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Hirsch, 29, a homemaker from Orlando, Fla., who is a
Republican, defended her party. ``I don't like the fact that people
just want to get this over with without coming to a conclusion,''
she said. ``The Republicans are in uncharted territory, and they
are trying to follow the Constitution. The Democrats seem to want
to take shortcuts and doctor up the process somewhat. Both parties
are going to have to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the discouraging polls, many prominent
Republicans persist in asserting that the Senate is on the right
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the argument that it's going to hurt
Republicans,'' Dick Cheney, a former Republican leader in the House
and Secretary of Defense, said in an interview from his office in
Dallas. ``The guys are doing a very difficult assignment that all
of them would prefer not to have to deal with. But when I watch
Henry Hyde, who's a close friend, and several other people there,
it's a bear to be called upon to deal with issues like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that if people are not interested in the matter now,
they surely will not punish Republicans over it in 2000, Cheney
added, ``I don't think people outside Washington are spending as
much time thinking about what's going on in Washington as people in
Washington think they do.''

JUDGE RAISES HEALTH-CARE QUESTIONS IN PRISON HEARING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Midway through a monthlong hearing about prison
conditions, senior U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice on
Tuesday indicated his displeasure with the state's system of inmate
health care, which relies heavily on the services of medical
schools based in Galveston and Lubbock.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the complaints of inmates and their expert witnesses,
Justice raised questions about whether prison guards routinely
ignore work restrictions for injured convicts. He also asked why so
many inmates turn up with broken jaws, and he wondered whether the
system was using older, less effective drugs just to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The judge aired the concerns during his personal interrogation
of Dr. David R. Smith, president of the Texas Tech University
Health Sciences Center, who also serves as chairman of the state
Criminal Justice Managed Health Care Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   After testifying about eight hours, Smith was about to leave the
witness stand when Justice hit the doctor with a series of
questions. Smith had described _ and vigorously defended _ the
state's efforts to treat ill and injured inmates, using a
combination of contract physicians and medical residents at
scattered teaching facilities of Texas Tech in Lubbock and the
University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Justice, who is in the process of deciding whether to retain
judicial oversight of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice,
acknowledged that inmates seem to be getting good care at prison
hospitals and other medical institutions, but he suggested that
follow-up care at prison units was lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran judge has handled the Ruiz prison reform case for
about 20 years. Based on a class-action suit filed in 1972 by
inmate David Ruiz, the case resulted in Justice's takeover of the
Texas prison system and a number of reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They complain about what happens back at the units,'' Justice
told Smith, adding that ``medical orders are not complied with and
ignored by officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, formerly the state's commissioner of health, said the
unit-level treatment is scrutinized in a system of peer review and
audit of medical charts ``that can result in corrective action''
when security officials don't comply with medical orders.
</P>
<P>
   Justice said he heard inmates complain that doctor-prescribed
work limitations were ``simply ignored,'' with guards ``saying, in
effect, `to hell with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smith responded by saying inmates have several avenues to
complain when that occurs, to which Justice replied, ``I have no
doubt that's the theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice asked Smith whether guards should be punished when they
ignore work restrictions, and Smith said ``it may be one of the
tools you could use in personnel management.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also queried Smith about whether there had been a
study of the most prevalent injuries to inmates, including ``any
undue propensity for broken jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining, Justice said ``a number of (inmate) complaints
indicate a large number of facial injuries as a result of prisoners
falling with their hands handcuffed behind their backs, sometimes
in disturbances with security guards.'' Some of the inmates also
had testified that it took several days to convince medical
personnel to X-ray their injured jaws.
</P>
<P>
   As for Justice's questions about use of outmoded medicines ``to
hold down costs as opposed to trying to achieve the best results,''
Smith said he hadn't heard that allegation before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might want to check into that,'' Justice replied. Experts
had testified that appeared to be the case with costly medicines
used to treat inmates with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Smith defended the overall system by saying that Texas is
nationally recognized for its innovative reliance on medical
schools, adding, ``the ratio of doctors and mid-level practitioners
has increased remarkably'' in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that in 1996, internal and external audits detected
unusually high numbers of health-care complaints at the Estelle and
Stiles units. But he said those findings led to improvements,
proving the value of the system's overlapping ``checks and
balances.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton sandwiched in an education
announcement between fund-raising meals of imported sea bass with
big Democratic Party donors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared at an elementary school in the working-class
Brighton section of Boston on Tuesday afternoon to draw attention
to a previously announced education proposal to turn around failing
schools. The president said Tuesday he was asking Congress to
approve the use of $200 million in federal education aid to reward
school districts that take steps to improve or close declining
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the school appearance, Clinton spoke to party
donors in Boston and New York who paid $10,000 a person to attend
the fund-raising events for the Democratic National Committee.
White House officials said the lunch and dinner, which were
expected to raise $1.7 million, were the first fund-raisers the
president has attended since he was impeached in December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's education proposal is part of a broader administration
plan to use the incentive of federal money to bring greater
accountability to local school districts. Schools will be required
to end ``social promotion,'' the practice of moving students from
grade to grade even if they have not mastered the material. Clinton
wants assurances that teachers are qualified to teach their
subjects. School districts that fail to adopt these policies risk
losing their federal education grants.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has drawn criticism from Republicans, who call it an
example of unwarranted federal meddling in local affairs.
Republicans tend to prefer federal education money to be returned
to states and cities in the form of block grants with few strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about more than money,'' Clinton said at Jackson Mann
Elementary School in Boston. ``Some people argue that the federal
government has no business whatsoever holding school districts
accountable for results.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he disagreed, and said he intended to use
some of the $15 billion in federal school aid to encourage policies
that work and end support for failing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen billion dollars is not chump change,'' Clinton said.
``It's real money and it can make a real difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser, said
that 19 states already had programs in place to rescue failing
schools. He defended the federal role in encouraging such efforts
against Republican criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to have that debate,'' Reed told reporters aboard
Air Force One en route to Boston. ``If anyone in Congress wants to
step over and say continuing social promotion ought to be a local
option, that having unqualified teachers ought to be a local
option, or that ignoring failing schools ought to be a local
option, we challenge them to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Before visiting the school, Clinton spoke at an early afternoon
luncheon and reception at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, using the
occasion to review themes raised in the State of the Union message
and in his budget submission to Congress. He boasted that his plan
to reserve most of the ballooning federal budget surpluses for
Social Security and Medicare over the next 15 years would have the
effect of reducing the national debt to the lowest level since
1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody had come before you in 1992 and said, `Vote for me
for president, in a few years we'll be paying down the national
debt,' you would have given them a quick exit home,'' Clinton told
the party contributors. ``You'd have thought, that guy's been, you
know, chewing on funny reeds or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The guests were served salad, sea bass and mascarpone pastry
with strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew from Boston to New York, where he entertained about
100 donors at Le Cirque 2000 restaurant on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The menu there also included sea bass, along with mixed
vegetables and assorted desserts.

DR. JOHN B. PENNEY JR., 51; NOTED NEUROLOGIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John B. Penney Jr., a neurologist who was an expert in the
diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases,
died, apparently of a heart attack Sunday in his home in Boston. He
was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Penney was a member of the staff at Massachusetts General
Hospital and a professor at Harvard Medical School. For nearly 20
years he was a consulting neurologist to the US-Venezuela
Collaborative Huntington's Research Project, whose work led to the
cloning of the gene that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dr. Jang-Ho Cha, a neurologist at MGH, remembered Dr.
Penney as a brilliant, modest man who was ``fiercely motivated to
cure neurological disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the world's top movement disorders neurologists
and was instrumental in starting Parkinson's and Huntington's
national study groups to test possible therapies and treatments for
those diseases, '' said Dr. Cha.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Penney was born in Winthrop, Mass. He graduated from
Dartmouth College in 1969. After earning his medical degree at
Johns Hopkins University Medical School, he got additional training
as a neurologist at the University of California at San Franciso.
</P>
<P>
   He was a faculty member at the University of Michigan School of
Medicine before joining the staff at Mass. General Hospital. He was
director of the new MIT-MGH Parkinson's Disease Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dr. John Growdon, director of the movement disorders
unit at MGH, said ``despite being a well-known and well respected
researcher and investigator, Jack always made sure that he spent
whatever time his patients needed to provide his special kind of
outstanding care. He showed great concern for their well being, and
he was truly committed to being an excellent doctor who was always
there for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Dr. Anne B. Young;two daughters, Jessica and
Ellen, both of Boston; his father, John B. Sr. of Center Strafford,
N.H.; a sister, Janet P. Cronin of Newton, Mass.; and a brother,
Stephen E. of Richmond, Vt.

BOSTON MAYOR MAKES ONE LAST PITCH FOR DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the gift of a souvenir watch and the signing-on of
a giant Internet firm, Mayor Thomas Menino made his last personal
pitch to President Clinton Tuesday to choose Boston for the 2000
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Menino is hoping Clinton will wear the watch bearing Boston's
skyline, and the slogan, ``It's all right here,'' during the final
weeks approaching a decision on where to hold the convention. The
decision is expected by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But more persuasive may be the addition of Lycos Inc., the
Waltham, Mass. company visible recently as the official search
engine of the Superbowl, as a key technology provider for Boston's
bid to host the Democratic bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the clincher? No,'' said Menino. ``But we want to make
it very difficult for them to say no to us,'' he said. ``And nobody
else had a computer company step forward and say they'd do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Those nobodies are Los Angeles and Denver _ Boston's
competition, which are also massaging their bids in the final days
of a 15-month bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   Over that stretch, Boston's bid has evolved from a glimmer in
Menino's eye to a serious proposition, one that might even succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Menino's designs on the prize were bouyed by Clinton's remarks
on the way to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all began here,'' Menino said Clinton had mused aloud.
``Bunker Hill, the Revolution...''
</P>
<P>
   Menino quickly plugged in Boston's successes that reflect on
Clinton's priorities: community policing, cleaning the harbor,
improving education and childcare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five to six issues you really care about are right here,''
the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   While Los Angeles has kept secret its bid changes following what
several insiders indicated was a disastrous December visit by a DNC
panel, Boston has announced its additions, albeit it,
incrementally, in an effort to raise the city's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People haven't paid as much attention to details as we have,''
Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   The pencil-sharpening by the finalist cities comes with the
motivation of the $175 million in economic benefits the city of
Chicago reaped from the 1996 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Boston buffed up its $32.4 million bid with an
additional $1 million in cash and in-kind services in hopes of
outstepping Los Angeles and its perceived bottomless pit of
contributions from Hollywood Clinton fans.
</P>
<P>
   With the money boost, Boston answered the call from leaders of
the Democratic National Committee to exploit the Hub's muscle-bound
high-tech industry for a highly interactive convention.
</P>
<P>
   Unveiling the ``American Web of democracy,'' Boston added a plan
for two-way communication with delegates and a proposal for
``virtual press conferences'' to entertain voters at home.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, spearheaded by local software pioneer John J.
Cullinane, also included plans for a separate educational site for
kids and an Internet kiosk to spotlight successful programs of the
Clinton-Gore administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinane also was the linchpin in landing Lycos, which would
get recognition in lieu of payment as a sponsor of the convention,
said Howard Leibowitz, Menino's point person on the convention bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding Lycos to our team,'' said Menino, ``is like adding
(baseball sluggers) Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   Lycos says it is the second most visited Internet hub and boasts
the largest online community, especially after making some
significant acquisitions just over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of Lycos is its capacity to handle millions of
simultaneous users; provide chat rooms for delegates, nominees, and
party leaders; and do daily polling.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos also could provide one-stop Internet shopping for travel
and hotel plans for delegates, which may streamline the logistics
of convention planning, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, outgoing co-chair of the DNC, said the site
decision has been delayed because the Republican party's choice of
Philadelphia last November for its convention removed the urgency
of the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, who concedes he is dropping the objectivity required
in his national post, said Boston is no less vital to a Democratic
presidential win just because it lacks California's 54 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is playing on very strong ground,'' Grossman said. ``I
don't recall walking around LA or Denver and seeing graves of
Samuel Adams or others from defining moments in American
Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this city,'' said Grossman, then added the ever-present
dampener: ``We'll see though.''

ELECTRIC MILES REDUX  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)

   WADADA LEO SMITH AND HENRY KAISER: `YO MILES!' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shanachie, CD, 5046. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, only four years after Bob Dylan plugged in his guitar
at the Newport Folk Festival, incurring the wrath of acoustic-music
purists, Miles Davis surrounded himself with electric guitars and
keyboards in a seeming attempt to court listeners of popular music.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five years, he created some of his most challenging
music: a weird and disquieting fusion of Jimi Hendrix, James Brown
and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many older jazz listeners disparaged the
music as a Faustian sell-out to pop; one black critic, Bill Cole,
called it ``an insult to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then critics and musicians have come to regard the
electric Miles as remarkably prescient of forms like trip-hop and
electronica. Last year, Bill Laswell's remix of the electric Miles,
``Panthalassa,'' was released to wide acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   The Fender Rhodes electric piano, first introduced by Miles on
his stunning 1968 album ``Filles de Kilimanjaro,'' has been heard
in decidedly Milesian arrangements on recent albums by the
saxophonists Greg Osby and Mark Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Wadada Leo Smith and Henry Kaiser's ``Yo Miles!'' is notable for
being the only homage to the electric Miles among recent
album-length tributes to the trumpeter. Smith has been a quietly
lyrical force on the trumpet since his early 70s work with
Chicago's black music collective, the Association for the
Advancement of Creative Musicians. Kaiser is a veteran guitarist on
the new-music scene.
</P>
<P>
   The electric Miles is tricky tribute material. While bursting
with ideas about sound, tone color and rhythmic texture, the music
offers little in the way of composition. Miles was intrigued by the
hypnotic potential of simple, repeating vamps and by blocks of pure
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Such forms as there were emerged out of extended improvisation
rather than the other way around _ and often only after
post-production editing by Miles' producer, Teo Macero. Even then,
the music was often pompously overlong, aspiring to a dark majesty
but sounding more like a bad LSD trip.
</P>
<P>
   Like most Miles tributes, ``Yo Miles!'' suffers from excessive
reverence toward its subject. Instead of interpreting the electric
Miles, Smith, Kaiser and their associates _ a first-rate line up of
avant-garde heavies, including the Canadian pianist Paul Plimley
and members of the Rova Sax Quartet _ have sought to recreate him,
virtually note for note. For music that journeyed to the far-out
borders of consciousness, it's a strangely rationalist approach.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it make a strong case for the material. The nervous,
disturbing pulse, and the sonic delirium of the electric Miles make
it strikingly contemporary. But the music's meandering
improvisations and Fender bass grooves are about as fresh as a 70s
action-film soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo Miles!'' isn't without moments of real beauty. ``Ife,'' a
35-minute suite, undulates with the mystery of a symphony performed
underwater. But this straight-ahead account all too often points up
the ways in which the electric Miles has aged, rather than ripened.

15 ARRESTED OUTSIDE GOVERNOR'S MANSION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Fifteen protesters, most in wheelchairs, were
arrested outside the Governor's Mansion on Tuesday afternoon in a
dispute over housing choices for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators were charged with criminal trespass, a
misdemeanor, after Texas Department of Public Safety officers had
to physically remove some of them from the mansion's locked back
gate.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was sparked by Texas Attorney General John Cornyn's
decision to support in the U.S. Supreme Court Georgia's challenge
of a lower federal court ruling that promotes community care under
the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocacy groups for the disabled fear the challenge, if
upheld by the high court, could force more people into nursing
homes and other institutions against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush said he had discussed the issue with Cornyn
and agreed with him, but said the decision to enter the case was
the attorney general's alone.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the court ruling he is trying to overturn would
allow a ``federal court to deprive Texas of the right to make its
own plans for treatment of disabled citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters turned most of their anger on the governor,
who wasn't home when they came calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is compassionate conservatism, he (Bush) is in a lot
of trouble. Forcing people to live in institutions is not going to
work,'' said Bob Kafka, as he sat in his wheelchair, hands cuffed
behind his back, waiting to be bused to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kafka is a leader of Americans Disabled for Attendant Programs
Today, or ADAPT, an advocacy group for the disabled, which has
staged several aggressive demonstrations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition of Texans with Disabilities also was represented
in the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is believed to be eyeing a race for president, calls
himself a ``compassionate conservative,'' a term that already has
been ridiculed by potential opponents for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his budget request to the state Legislature includes
enough money to increase the number of people in community care in
Texas by 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I hear the call. I hear the call for more community care. I
just believe they ought to understand I want the decision made in
Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ADAPT said in a written statement that Bush had met with
advocates for the disabled Jan. 15 and promised to ``get back with
us with his decision by Jan. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did he blow that off, his attorney general has shown
the intent of the state to keep people with disabilities warehoused
in nursing homes and other institutions _ against their will,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he met with two advocates and promised only to talk
with Cornyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained to them that I strongly believe Texans can manage
our future better than a federal judge can manage our future. I
also explained to them that our attorney general is independently
elected, he'll make his decisions based upon the law, and he has
done so,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor noted that Tuesday wasn't the first time ADAPT had
protested at the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They criminally trespassed. They were given due warning,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the so-called Olmstead case from Georgia, the lower courts
ruled that disabled plaintiffs had the right to choose to live in
the community instead of a state institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case about an individual's right to choose where she
or he lives and receives services,'' said ADAPT organizer James
Templeton.
</P>
<P>
   But Cornyn said he believed the U.S. Supreme Court should
``reverse such a transfer of sovereign power to the federal
courts.'' That power, he said, should be exercised by the ``elected
officials of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminal trespass is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a
maximum sentence of six months in jail and a $2,000 fine.

REEBOK SAYS INCOME DROPPED IN FOURTH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buffeted by global economic turmoil and slack demand for
athletic shoes and apparel, Reebok International Ltd. reported
declining income in 1998 and a fourth quarter loss Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials and analysts said that business is unlikely to
improve markedly for the Stoughton, Mass. manufacturer in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic footwear and apparel industry is going through a
period of significant change,'' Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Paul Fireman said. ``The domestic market is suffering from
overcapacity due to significant retail expansion during a period of
softening consumer demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Net income from operations for 1998 was $47.6 million or $0.83
per share, compared with $134.3 million or $2.30 per share for
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok losses totaled $7.1 million, or 13 cents a share,
compared with net income of $18.6 million, or 32 cents a share, in
the same quarter of 1997. The average analyst forecast was of a 14
cents per share loss, according to First Call Corp., which tracks
corporate results.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997 and in the first quarter of 1998 the company
recorded special pre-tax charges in connection with re-engineering
efforts and the restructuring of some underperforming marketing
contracts, officials said. Including charges related to
restructuring, 1998 net income totaled $23.9 million, or 42 cents a
share.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales were off 18 percent for the fourth quarter, and 11. 5
percent, to $3.225 billion for the year. Quarterly net sales sank
to $705.6 million from $863.4 million for a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Company official said that worldwide, sales of its Reebok brand
_ footwear and apparel _ fell to $574.8 million from $735.8 million
from last year.
</P>
<P>
   Adversely affecting the company was financial turmoil in the
Asia-Pacific region, Latin America and Russia, said company
officials, who offered little hope for any improvement in those
areas this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Reebok officials expressed skepticism about any marked
change in the business patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general we're not planning on sales growth in 1999 for the
Reebok brand,'' said Kenneth Watchmaker, Reebok's chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts agreed that indications are not good, for the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their backlog is down 10 percent, and its down 19 percent in
the US,'' said Margaret Mager, of Goldman Sachs. ``It raises the
bar in terms of Reebok's challenge to turn things around and gain
back market share. Business is going to shrink this year, at least
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some good news is that they have done a great job managing
their balance sheet,'' Mager said. ``Also, there have been some
increases in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Reebok closed at 14 7/8, down 1/8.

GEPHARDT RULES OUT PRESIDENTIAL RACE TO FOCUS ON HOUSE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Tenn., Mass., N.J., Neb., Minn., Texas, Calif., Kan.)   (jw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., plans to take himself
out of the running for president on Wednesday and devote himself
full time to recapturing the House for Democrats in 2000 with the
expectation that he will become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Gephardt recognized two strong political
perceptions _ that Vice President Al Gore had already laid a
formidable claim to the Democratic nomination, and that House
Republicans were vulnerable to a takeover because their impeachment
of President Clinton was so unpopular with the public.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Gephardt said that he did not have the fire in
the belly to run for president. ``It's not in his gut,'' this
confidant said, adding that Gephardt was more drawn by the fight
for the House. ``We're tantalizingly close, he cares about the
House and he cares about the party,'' the friend said.
</P>
<P>
   His departure from the field may also entice at least one other
Democrat _ Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts _ into the race. So
far, only former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey has announced his
challenge to Gore for the nomination. Two other senators, Bob
Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, have backed
off.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt began privately telling his Democratic colleagues
Tuesday of his decision, which he is to announce formally on
Wednesday. Friends described him as wistful about forgoing a run
for president but confident that he was making the right decision
because of Democrats' success in the 1998 elections, when analysts
predicted they could lose more than a dozen seats but instead
picked up five. They need a net gain of six seats in 2000 to regain
control.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues said that Gephardt's staying to oversee the House
drive would be crucial to that effort because he was one of the few
House Democrats with a national fund-raising base and familiarity
with almost every district.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who delivers our message the best, he's a good
fund-raiser and a unifying force for the Democratic caucus,'' said
Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, the caucus chairman. ``This is the best
possible scenario for us for retaking the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, a top Democratic fund-raiser who is close to
both Gephardt and Gore, said of Gephardt's decision: ``They are
very close to getting the House back, and Dick is the guy to lead
that. And he wants the party to be unified. A divisive primary
would not be unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that the public is fed up with Republicans
in Congress for dragging out the impeachment process. Democrats are
already identifying Republicans like Rep. Tom Campbell of
California, whose pro-impeachment votes have hurt them, and
Democratic Party officials say that impeachment has prompted bigger
contributions and earlier interest from potential candidates.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The picture is cloudier for Democrats on the presidential front.
A national poll released Monday by The Los Angeles Times showed
Gore losing to two Republicans _ Gov. George Bush of Texas, by 18
points, and Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red
Cross, by 8 points.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic analyst said these numbers suggested that Gore
was vulnerable, not that no Democratic candidate could win. Still,
Gore's clear-cut advantages as an incumbent in delivering federal
largesse and organizing the party apparatus to his liking have
discouraged potential rivals. The most recent polls show Gore way
ahead of other Democrats. This weekend's Marist College poll, for
example, shows 44 percent of Democrats favoring Gore, 16 percent
for Bradley and 11 percent for Jesse Jackson, who has not announced
whether he is running. Gephardt had 7 percent and Kerry, 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's supporters said that he was fully prepared to
challenge Gore and had built up a national network since his failed
presidential bid in 1988. But others suggested that it might have
been hard for Gephardt to give voice to a positive message that was
distinctive enough from Gore's to capture a national following.
Gephardt's history as an economic populist, and strong backer of
labor, might have cast him as a naysayer at a time when Gore could
boast of a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's supporters said that he had invested himself so much
in the House that his decision had been essentially made for him
when the Democrats made such a strong comeback in November.
Gephardt's own stock rose in the House at the same time, and as he
evolved into the role of Clinton's chief defender, he and Gore
found themselves working toward a common goal that left the
Democrats uncharacteristically united.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said the party's prospects for recapturing the
House appeared so strong that more potential candidates were
expressing an interest in running for Congress than the Democrats
had experienced since they lost the House in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to give up a ranking position in a state
legislature or a mayorship if they're going to be in the
minority,'' Smith said. ``We're seeing a lot of interest.''

 &HT;    Bread and butter issue: Delta to end sandwiches on some flights
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines passengers soon may notice something
missing from their SkyDeli food bag: the sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   To pare food costs, Atlanta-based Delta is taking the sandwiches
out of SkyDeli bags on 140 flights and replacing them with crackers
and cheese, or carrots and dip.
</P>
<P>
   SkyDeli bags are offered to coach passengers as they board
flights at certain times of the day.
</P>
<P>
   First-class fliers won't escape the cuts, which take effect
Thursday. Delta is downgrading from full meals to snacks in first
class on 80 flights and from snacks to beverage service on another
160 flights, spokeswoman Katie Moussouri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flights affected are either shorter flights or between
mealtimes,'' Moussouri said, adding SkyDeli contents and
first-class menus are unchanged on most flights. Delta operates
more than 2,600 daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   She said Delta also will start announcing the type of food
service at the gate _ an apparent effort to ensure passengers don't
expect more than they get.
</P>
<P>
   The cutbacks, expected to save $14 million annually, come on the
heels of a $1 billion profit in 1998. They also come as the
airline's new management touts efforts to rebuild Delta's service
reputation, which fell amid a financial crisis in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Chris McGinnis, an Atlanta business travel consultant, said he
was stunned Delta would trim costs in an area as visible as food.
</P>
<P>
   ``SkyDeli has never been very popular anyway with people I know,
because it just seems cheap. So in that sense it's not a major
downgrade,'' he said. ``But I'm still amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussouri noted Delta, which slashed per-passenger food expenses
42 percent during the lean years of the financial crunch, last year
reversed the trend somewhat by beefing up SkyDeli contents and
adding variety to first-class menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continually looking at food service,'' she said. ``From
time to time we add things, and sometimes we make changes like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Moussouri noted Delta is spending heavily on other
service-related items such as new planes, airport boarding
technology and improved business-class cabins on international
jets.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Delta led the industry in raising prices 2 percent
for business-type tickets and 4 percent for leisure fares.

KRAFT WANTS DECISION ON STEAM PLANT BEFORE SIGNING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft will not sign a
final agreement to move the team to Connecticut unless he is
convinced within the next few days that a steam plant on the
proposed site of the new stadium in Hartford can be taken down by
the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy meeting with Connecticut officials in Hartford
Tuesday, Patriots business manager Andy Wasynczuk emerged
unconvinced _ but expressing hope _ that the power plant can be
relocated in time for the team to play its first game there in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we make a commitment to this thing we want it to be
real,'' Wasynczuk said. ``And that's what we have to be confident
in over the next three to four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is scheduled to sign the final development agreement with
the state Friday, already about a month later than originally
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's comments by Wasynczuk were the first indication that
the Patriots are growing concerned over the steam plant issue.
Although both team and state officials said relocating the plant
would be the most complicated part of the deal, they appeared
optimistic it would be moved in time.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Wasynczuk said that before Friday's signing, the
Patriots are looking for a ``a confidence level from the state that
they can deliver the site and have us free to begin construction
roughly in the summer of the year 2000 to be ready for the 2002
season.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves about 17 months for the site to be acquired, cleared
of the steam plant, and cleaned of environmental contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   While a growing sense of urgency has developed over the
negotiations, no one Tuesday wanted to contemplate what might
happen if Kraft refused to sign the development agreement on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although alternative sites in Hartford have been discussed,
Governor John W. Rowland insists the primary site, known as
Adriaen's Landing, is the only location he would consider for the
stadium _ part of a $1 billion development project there. Rowland
has said the plant could be moved quickly since the Connecticut
General Assembly passed a $350 million bill in December to pay for
the open-air facility and infrastructure. But the target date for
the team to play its first game in Hartford has already slipped by
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said Tuesday's meeting firmed up the timeline needed
to move the team by 2002, a year later than the original goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In working towards 2001, it's become more and more clear as
the schedule has been laid out that's not likely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the site can be ready in time for 2002, ``There's
still more information that they are collecting on that front,''
Wasynczuk added. ``We're also expecting to get some additional
costing information to make sure this is feasible from the state's
perspective . . . but everyone on their side is confident it can be
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, getting the site on schedule ``is the most
important issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The development agreement combines elements from the Memorandum
of Understanding Kraft and Rowland signed Nov. 19 and the
authorizing legislation passed in December. The document is
hundreds of pages long and contains complex legal language
outlining exactly how the stadium will be built and when.
</P>
<P>
   Jeopardizing the timeframe is the stalled negotiations between
CTG Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant that heats and cools
many of Hartford's buildings, and the quasi-public Connecticut
Resources Recovery Authority plant, which burns garbage from 64
communities and produces electricity.
</P>
<P>
   CTG is considering buying steam from the nearby Connecticut
Resources Recovery Authority plant so that there would be no
service disruption downtown.
</P>
<P>
   If no deal is struck between the two power producers, however,
the state could take the land by eminent domain and reimburse CTG
for its value. But that would be the option of last resort and also
the most time consuming, those involved in the negotiations say.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the sticking point is, Connecticut Resources Recovery
Authority president Robert Wright replied: ``Money. Timing.
Pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, CTG wants more money and more time and does not
want to pay to clean up the hazardous chemicals that contaminate
the site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland, who has garnered headlines nationwide with his
powerplay to lure the Patriots from Foxborough, may not be willing
to give up so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor of the state of Connecticut is not a guy who has
trouble making a decision,'' Wright added. ``If he sees that date
(for signing the development agreement) is in jeopardy, he will
make the appropriate decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Like what?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can cut a deal. Somebody can come in and throw a whole
bunch of money on the table. Somebody can come in and buy (the
steam plant company) I guess. There's a lot of options,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wright cautioned, ``the parties' positions will be
crystallized this week. And I don't think there will be a (steam
plant) deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for CTG could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``CTG is committed to this,'' Rowland said after the meeting
Tuesday. ``I don't think they want to be the skunk at the party.''

EXPERTS ON URBAN SPRAWL SWAP IDEAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Reflecting what several called the birth of a new mass
movement, more than 950 New England public officials, planners and
developers gathered Tuesday to brainstorm ways to promote ``smart
growth'' in the region and curb the kind of sprawl that plagues
much of the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a daylong session convened by the US Environmental Protection
Agency, participants swapped everything from practical zoning
strategies to authoritarian daydreams _ including $4-a-gallon
gasoline taxes and bans on advertising sport-utility vehicles to
discourage people from moving far outside urbanized areas.
</P>
<P>
   The huge turnout for the conference, which astonished EPA
officials, reflected a commonly voiced fear that many parts of the
region are losing their traditional New England character as new
growth follows Sun Belt-style patterns of strip malls, office parks
on highway interchanges and far-flung residential subdivisions
where people need a car to get anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking for a preservation of their sense of
place,'' said Marilyn Cohen, planning and development director in
North Kingstown, R.I., in the state's rapidly developing South
County region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing sprawl happen even in the most remote corners of
Maine,'' said Beth Della Valle, a senior state planner. But for
now, she said, ``Zoning is a four-letter word in the state, and
often you're run out of town on a rail if you use the Z-word.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that many people like owning homes on
two-acre lots in exurban areas, several officials agreed that most
local zoning codes make that the only choice and forbid the more
concentrated, walkable, village-style development many other people
crave.
</P>
<P>
   Given New England's strong tradition of local decision-making on
land use, participants said ``smart growth'' _ steering new
businesses and homes toward areas with the roads, transit and
sewers to handle them while preserving farms and open space _ will
rely on local officials and town meetings agreeing they want their
communities to grow this way.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Reitsma, Massachusetts's outgoing undersecretary of
environmental affairs, said, `` `Smart growth' is not going to
happen if it depends on professional government officials and
planners. Smart growth is going to happen only if communities adopt
it . . . and we make it worthwhile for developers to implement
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But state-level leaders could do much more, many said. John P.
DeVillars, the regional EPA chief, who announced a new $3 million
agency effort to encourage local anti-sprawl efforts, said with the
exception of Vermont's Howard Dean and Maine's Angus King,
combatting sprawl ``is not enough of a political issue for our
governors today.''
</P>
<P>
   While changing the way much of New England is growing remains a
daunting task involving everything from rewriting zoning and tax
incentives to shoring up urban school systems, several people at
the conference said they were encouraged so many people suddenly
seem committed to the effort.

ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR ON BAD PROGRAMMING, SAYS VIEWER
ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dorothy Swanson thinks it's time to take the gloves off in her
dealings with the TV industry. For what it's worth, she might be
able to add a bow and arrow to her arsenal, now that ABC has put
out a contract on ``Cupid.''
</P>
<P>
   For almost 15 years, Swanson has run Viewers for Quality
Television as a sort of benign provocateur out of her home in
Fairfax, Va. In its heyday, VQT's membership swelled to 5,000
lovers of good programming, and it could take credit for having
stayed the inevitable executions of acclaimed shows like ``China
Beach,'' ``Homefront'' and ``Brooklyn Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two seasons ago, Swanson thinks, VQT had a hand
in keeping ABC from whacking ``The Practice,'' a drama that was
drowning in the shallow end of the ratings pool. ``The people at
`The Practice' think my open letter to Jamie in Variety made a
difference,'' Swanson said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie'' would be ABC Entertainment president Jamie Tarses.
``Variety'' would be the trade paper that may be the only thing
some people in Hollywood ever read.
</P>
<P>
   ABC eventually switched ``The Practice'' from its Saturday
graveyard to a decent spot on Monday nights last year, then moved
it to Sundays at 10 p.m. this season just as the show was winning
the Emmy as best dramatic series. It is one of the rare stories of
a network staying with a good show in spite of bad ratings.
</P>
<P>
   More common is the story of ``Cupid.'' The quirky relationship
drama premiered last fall to a warm buzz from critics, but it shut
down production last week and will be yanked from the schedule next
week. ABC's reason: poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of shows like ``Cupid'' is part of the reason Swanson
thinks it's time for VQT to cop an attitude, to stop being simply
an advocate for quality programming and to start being a critic of
dumb decisions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely that such venting will save any shows from the
guillotine, but Swanson says the networks need to know that viewers
are not pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The viewer has become a disposable television commodity,''
Swanson wrote in a recent VQT newsletter. ``The networks are
catering only to the stockholders and the advertisers, everybody
but the viewer. That is the business of television. But do we have
to accept that, conduct our business as usual regardless?''
</P>
<P>
   For Swanson, the question is pretty much rhetorical, for she has
watched the landscape change dramatically from the days when a
group of devoted fans managed to save ``Cagney &AMP; Lacey'' from
cancellation. That effort led to the formation of VQT in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Swanson senses a different dynamic. So much so that she has
changed the title of a book she's writing. It was going to be
called ``Quality Television Is Not an Oxymoron,'' but Swanson now
feels squeamish about that title. She persuaded her publisher to
change it to ``Quest for Quality: The VQT Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Due out later this year, the book will say a lot of the things
Swanson has been loath to utter as head of VQT, a position that is
part gadfly, part diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks don't really want to hear what's wrong,'' she
said. ``They want you to like what's there. But how are they going
to improve and give us shows we'll watch with more enthusiasm if
they don't give us shows we want to see?''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of ``Cupid'' is a case in point. ``Once again,'' she
said, ``a show is being blamed for the fact that the network
doesn't have a time slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Practice,'' ``Cupid'' started out on Saturday, when
TV watching is light. Though intelligently conceived and crisply
written about a hopeless romantic who might be the god of love or
might simply be a sandwich short of a picnic, ``Cupid'' did poorly
against CBS's ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and NBC's ``Profiler.'' ABC
then moved it to Thursdays at 9 opposite ``Frasier,'' one of the
highest-rated shows in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson agrees with legions of TV critics who find it
shortsighted and counterproductive for a network to dump a good
show without giving it a reasonable tryout. Networks argue that 14
episodes _ the current life expectancy of ``Cupid'' if it goes off
the air Feb. 11 _ is reasonable. But scheduling a show on a
Saturday night is like playing hide-and-seek with your little
brother and then going off to play baseball with your friends
without telling him. The chances of his finding you are somewhere
between slim and Olive Oyl.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for Saturday night shows. ``Walker'' and ``Profiler,''
neither of which is in the same league as ``Cupid,'' have built
decent audiences _ at least by Saturday night standards _ because
their networks have been patient over several seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody watches on Saturday night,'' Swanson argued, ``so it
ought to be a safe haven.'' She continued: ``We've not seen
anything like `Cupid' before. It's not cookie-cutter. It's not
formulaic. It is unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Unique doesn't pay the bills, of course, but Swanson, a
58-year-old former schoolteacher, thinks there should be room on TV
for something other than schlock _ and the rising tide of copycat
newsmagazine shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're not the mainstream viewer,'' Swanson said of the
VQT membership, which has dwindled to about 2,000. ``Maybe we're
not the ones they make TV shows for. But they sure are proud when
they get a `Homicide' or a `Practice' or a `Frasier.' They know the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, when a show wins a VQT endorsement or, better still, a
VQT award, the networks are quick to hype it. But it's no guarantee
of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My one unfulfilled dream,'' Swanson said, ``is that I wanted
the (VQT) endorsement to carry enough weight that a quality show
would have a full season.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds as if VQT is calling it quits, it may well be,
though not immediately. Swanson's change to a more pugnacious
stance is proof that there's still some fight left in her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said: ``I always felt there would be a time frame for
this. Our purpose was to educate viewers how to advocate for
quality television. ... People know now. We have educated the
public on how not to be passive.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but without VQT, I worry that the bad will get even
worse.

<P>
   KADUNA, Nigeria _ Weakened by malaria, chilled by the harmattan
blowing down from the Sahara, his left ankle still healing from a
recent fall off his pony, the retired colonel was going through a
bad stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Abubakar Umar, his eyes blotted out by dark sunglasses, sat
by himself at the Kaduna Polo Club on a recent Saturday afternoon.
He had hoped to resume playing Sunday. But a sudden bout of malaria
had derailed his plans and left him sitting in a folding chair by
the sidelines, facing an empty field, with not even the strength to
pick up the hard-cover book on a table beside him, ``Colonial Army
and Society in Northern Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The military was used by the British to conquer territories,''
said the colonel, who was Kaduna state's military governor in the
1980s. ``It is seen as a tool of colonialism. The kind of people
they had had no choice but to serve the interests of the British.
Some people argue that the military is a continuation of colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' the colonel added quickly, ``the Nigerian military
after independence is totally different from what it had been in
colonial times.''
</P>
<P>
   After ruling Africa's most populous nation for many years,
Nigeria's military is going through a collective bad stretch these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Abroad, its soldiers in a West African force were embarrassed in
Sierra Leone when, under their watch, the capital, Freetown, almost
fell to rebels in January. At home, a presidential election is
scheduled for Feb. 27, as a step toward a handover to a civilian
government in May.
</P>
<P>
   Many Nigerians believe that powerful generals, who are playing a
big role in the election, will retain their influence over the next
government and that a truly civilian government will emerge only in
four or five years. But the possibility of losing official
political power _ amid a growing public outcry that any civilian
candidate is better than a military one _ has unsettled many old
soldiers in Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this city is the seat of Nigeria's military, which
has ruled the country for all but 10 years since independence from
Britain in 1960. Frederick Lugard, the British governor general who
cobbled various territories together to create Nigeria in 1914,
founded Kaduna and made it the seat of power of the north.
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than three decades after Nigeria's military academy
was created here, Kaduna has also become something of a retirement
community for senior officers. In the 1970s, the governor of Kaduna
state started giving out free lots of land in the city to senior
officers. Once they began building houses on the lots in recent
years and looked over their gates, prairie dog-like, they saw they
were all neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Inside one of the gated houses, Yohanna Madaki, a retired
colonel and a former military governor in eastern Nigeria, was
fuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to stand by and see anyone exclude me from my
country,'' he said. ``To now say that we need a clean break from
the military _ there is no such thing as a clean break, because
everyone is guilty. The politicians resisted only in the last five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside his office, Madaki reached for a Webster's dictionary
and, turning to the list of U.S. presidents, yelled out the names
of those who had been senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is most unfair and most painful to have the people lump us
and say that we are incompetent because we are the military,''
Madaki said, his voice alternating between full-throated statements
and high-pitched protests. ``It is painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that he was a young 56, he added: ``That's why it's
so painful. At 56 and condemned! No way! No way!''
</P>
<P>
   The colonel's longtime next-door neighbor, a brigadier general,
had died. But his brother-in-law, Ike Nwachukuru, a retired major
general and a former foreign minister, was visiting Kaduna and
huddling with some advisers in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``To deny us the opportunity to run for office would be like
denying us our citizenship,'' the major general said, adding that
he was mulling over a run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps at the Kaduna Polo Club _ on Waff Road, named
after the West African Frontier Force, which the British
established to protects its colonies in this corner of Africa _
that the military finds its social and spiritual center.
</P>
<P>
   The British introduced polo in 1904 in Lagos, the country's
commercial capital in the south. But it was in the north, in the
horse-riding cultures of the military and the emirs, that polo's
popularity spread quickly; today, most of Nigeria's 11 polo clubs
dot the north. Until the late 1970s, when economic hard times
strained the military's budget, polo was even mandatory at the
national academy, Umar said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, though, the Kaduna Polo Club has become a magnet
not only for the military but also for powerful businessmen and
politicians. Not joining could prove costly.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, a Marxist who during a brief
period of political openness in the late 1970s was elected governor
of Kaduna State. Soon after taking office, Musa received a written
invitation, along with a mallet, to join the club.
</P>
<P>
   He threw away the invitation and gave the mallet to a servant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play polo,'' Musa said recently. ``It is the game of
the rich and powerful, of neo-colonialists.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, after all his choices of commissioners were rejected by
the legislature, Musa was ousted from office. But he had no
regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neo-colonialist,'' he added, ``is a person who is a shadow,
a caricature, a zombie. He does something and doesn't know the
meaning of it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday, no such talk could be heard in the bar of
the Kaduna Polo Club. Instead, between one of the three matches,
Ibrahim Abdullahi, a retired major and the secretary of the Nigeria
Polo Association, waxed on about the different breeds of ponies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pure Sudanese,'' he told a visitor, ``and the
landing cost is now about $15,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional players, businessmen and the sons of sultans
dominated the three matches.
</P>
<P>
   Umar, still recovering from malaria, sat in the front row in the
viewing stands, with a couple of fellow retired officers.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, the officers did not play. But after each match,
all the players filed past them and, in northern Nigeria's
traditional gesture of respect, bowed their heads and raised
clenched fists before them.

REVOLUTION ACQUIRE RIGHTS TO HARKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Harkes has been rejected by the US national team
and by D.C. United, but the Revolution are willing to take a chance
on him.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution Tuesday acquired MLS rights to Harkes from D.C.
United in exchange for two choices in the 2000 college draft. The
move is part of a continuing effort by player-coach Walter Zenga to
remake the team.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, 32, was stripped of his captaincy of D.C. United last
year, and he clashed with teammates and US national team coach
Steve Sampson before being dropped before the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a general sense, I have heard about a variety of things
with John,'' said general manager Brian O'Donovan. ``We've heard
things about other players, as well. But Walter realizes that
leadership requires combining diverse personalities. I believe
Walter can do that. Walter has a way of getting this team and these
type of players to play for him in a team concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players have demonstrated on previous teams that they
can compete at a high level. Walter also has an eye for perhaps
less-predictable players, looking at some of those he has in camp
and his insistence that they go with the team to Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution apparently are welcoming the contentious and the
forthright, and Harkes follows others who have clashed with
coaches, such as former Los Angeles Galaxy captain Dan Calichman
and former Sparta Rotterdam striker Ze Rodrigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is littered with players who fell out of favor with
national teams and club teams and have come back to confound the
critics,'' O'Donovan said. ``I can't guarantee that with John, but
anyone who has seen D.C. United realizes John has been a key
contributor to their success the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter's ability to absorb everything that is happening and
face reality and to build a team around the reality of MLS has been
astounding. The team that is being built here is being built to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are hoping Harkes will be in Miami for their
opening game March 28. But Harkes is currently performing on a
90-day loan from the MLS to Nottingham Forest, which has until
March 16 to exercise an option to sign him. If Harkes receives a
satisfactory offer from the Premier League club, he will not return
to the US.
</P>
<P>
   Nottingham Forest signed coach Ron Atkinson and acquired Harkes
and his former Sheffield Wednesday teammate Carlton Palmer last
week to wage a desperate relegation battle. Nottingham Forest had a
20-game winless streak before defeating Everton, 1-0, in Liverpool
Saturday, but remained in last place with a 3-13-7 record and 16
points, a point behind Charlton Athletic, 4 behind Southampton, and
6 behind Blackburn Rovers. The bottom three teams will be
relegated.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes is essentially on a seven-game trial, and among the most
crucial matches will be one against Manchester United Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Harkes has gone from first to worst. The question
is, which last-place team is he going to play for? If he receives a
Premier League offer, he will likely stay, since the average salary
is nearly $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes, who will turn 32 March 8, played 82 games and scored six
goals for the US national team. He was a starter in the 1990 and
'94 World Cup finals, then helped the team qualify for France '98
as its captain. Former United coach Bruce Arena promoted Marco
Etcheverry over Harkes as captain, reasoning that Harkes would be
missing much of the MLS season because of the World Cup. United
then swept through the regular season and playoffs before losing to
Chicago in the MLS Cup final, then recovered to upset Vasco da Gama
for the InterAmericana Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   United has exceeded the MLS salary cap the last two years, and
has made Harkes available while protecting players such as
Etcheverry, Jaime Moreno, and Eddie Pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have done something else, but it would have
required losing four or five players, or losing one of their four
top-salaried players,'' said Harkes's agent, Craig Sharon. ``At
this time, they feel John is expendable. John is disappointed to be
leaving D.C. but if he has to go somewhere else, New England is the
place he prefers.''

BRAZIL SACKS CENTRAL BANK CHIEF; NAMES SOROS AIDE AS SUCCESSOR
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ The government unexpectedly replaced
its central bank president, Francisco Lopes, on Tuesday, just a
week after he had been confirmed in the job. It named a fund
manager for international financier George Soros to direct Brazil's
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The newly-appointed central bank president, Arminio Fraga Neto,
drew praise from investors, who said he would bring to the job
practical experience and knowledge of how international investors
operate. But politically, the replacement of Lopes so soon after
his appointment reflected the recent unpredictability of a
government desperate to find ways to turn around an economy in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The move came shortly after Stanley Fischer, the first deputy
managing director of the International Monetary Fund, arrived in
Brazil for talks with government officials, who hope to speed up
delivery of a second $9 billion infusion from a $41.5 billion loan
the IMF has pledged. The timing left the government open to
opposition criticism that the IMF had played a role in the
reshuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by Fischer's participation in the talks, the Brazilian
currency, the real, rose for the second day, halting a plunge that
began Jan. 13, when the government floated the currency, then
trading at 1.21 reals to the dollar. The real closed at 1.76 to the
dollar Tuesday, down from 1.91 Monday. The Bovespa stock index fell
by 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Brazil has been hit full force by the
economic turbulence that earlier shattered economies in Asia and
Russia. The crisis exploded here after Itamar Franco, governor of
Brazil's third richest state, Minas Gerais, declared a moratorium
on his state's debt to the federal government, fueling fears the
country could not meet is debt.
</P>
<P>
   Since Brazil is South America's leader by every measure _ in
land, population, and economy _ its instability is slowing
economies throughout Latin America, which buys 20 percent of all
U.S. exports. Brazil is also the home of more than $36 billion in
accumulated direct foreign investment, much of it by U.S. companies
like Ford and General Motors, MCI, Whirlpool, Citibank and
Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Fraga bolstered Finance Minister Pedro Malan,
a strict monetarist rumored to have been on his way out. In a
television interview Tuesday, Malan said he and Lopes offered their
resignations to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, but that only
Lopes' was accepted. Malan added that it was he who had proposed
Fraga's name, though he did not say in what capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraga is the man of the hour to restore the confidence of
investors, because he's one of them,'' said David Fleischer,
publisher of a Brasilia-based newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Ferraz, of Banco Bozano Simonsen, said Fraga's appointment
was ``a confirmation of the government's willingness to go by the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   With confidence in the government at a low, however, many warned
that credibility for the new central bank president would not come
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Rabello de Castro, a political consultant here, said Fraga
must announce his stand on exchange and interest rate policies, as
well as debt management ``to build up this credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   An IMF negotiating team has been discussing a range of issues
with Brazilian officials, including the financial standing of
Brazilian states, new rules for government intervention in currency
exchange markets and new targets for inflation and interest rates.
The IMF has supported high interest rates, now at 39 percent, to
control inflation and draw capital to Brazil, despite a recession
that some economists predict will reach 6 to 8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders immediately criticized the nomination.
``Brazil has just delivered the Central Bank to one of the biggest
speculators in the world,'' said Jose Dirceu, leader of the leftist
Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, a former Brazilian president who has become Cardoso's
arch-enemy, was equally caustic. ``Brazil has a new finance
minister _ Fischer _ and a new central bank president _ Soros,'' he
told a local wire service. ``Now it will be much easier to
renegotiate our foreign debt. The only thing left to do is perfect
our English.''
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for Soros denied rumors that the financier had
had role in Fraga's appointment. ``It was as much of a surprise to
Soros and Soros Fund Management as it was to the market,'' said
Shawn Pattison, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Princeton University, Fraga, 41, has been a
manager of the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund since 1993, considered
a top performer for its class. Before that, as chief of
international operations for the Brazilian central bank, he
negotiated with foreign banks to restructure Brazil's debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked very effectively to bring Brazil back into contact
with the international markets,'' Fleischer said.

<P>
   Paul Mellon, the patrician art collector who tenaciously turned
philanthropy into his personal art form, above all through his
stewardship of the National Gallery of Art, died on Monday at his
home in Upperville, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A son of enormous wealth, Mellon turned from his family's world
of banking and business to become an endlessly inventive benefactor
of the nation's cultural life. The Mellons' total contributions to
museums and other causes from parks to poetry has been estimated at
nearly a billion dollars. The money has gone to save seashores and
encourage scholars. It established the Yale Center for British Art
and America's top poetry award, the Bollingen Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, the greatest monument to the family's fortune, and
to Paul Mellon's personal dedication, is the National Gallery of
Art in Washington, originally conceived as a gift to the people by
his father, Andrew W. Mellon (1855-1937), the financier and
longtime secretary of the Treasury. The elder Mellon did not live
to see his wish fulfilled. But Paul Mellon, who could never share
his father's love for commerce, more than inherited a dedication to
giving something back to society. For the son it became a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giving away large sums of money nowadays is a soul-searching
problem,'' he once said. ``You can cause as much damage with it as
you may do good.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many patrons of the arts insist that their names
be chiseled on a museum's facade, Paul Mellon was remembered for
avoiding self-promotion and refraining from narcissistic exercises
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it, I suppose, is just a natural shyness on my part,''
Mellon once said. But there were other reasons. In ``Reflections in
a Silver Spoon,'' his 1992 autobiography, written with John
Baskett, he said, ``If my father had created `the Mellon Gallery of
Art' in Washington, would other donors have been willing to support
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically he insisted that the Yale Center not bear his
name either, ``in the hope that other future donors of works of art
and of funds would be more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon was born in Pittsburgh on June 11, 1907, the only
son of Andrew W. Mellon and his first wife, the English-born Nora
McMullen. The couple had a daughter, Ailsa, six years earlier.
Andrew Mellon, a partner in the private bank founded by his father,
Judge Thomas Mellon, in Pittsburgh in 1870, became one of the most
successful American financiers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   As Paul once put it, Andrew ``had an astonishing flair for
recognizing nascent industrial potentialities.'' Among the Mellon
Bank's earliest loans was one to Andrew's friend Henry Clay Frick
to develop coke ovens. The bankers approved the loan, noting
privately that Frick may have been ``a little too enthusiastic
about pictures, but not enough to hurt.'' Those pictures became the
Frick Collection in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his 60s, after having established and consolidated an
international commercial empire, Andrew Mellon entered public life,
serving as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1932, under three
presidents, and as the United States ambassador to Britain in 1932
and '33.
</P>
<P>
   He might have had a predestined crown prince in his only son,
but from the very first Paul found neither happiness at home nor
any hope of fulfillment in his father's offices. By the time he was
2, his parents' marriage was effectively at an end. As he put it
with characteristic concision, ``Within 18 months of my parents'
marriage in 1900, my mother fell in love with an Englishman who
would have described himself as a gentleman but who was, in fact,
nothing more than a devious adventurer.'' The couple divorced in
1912.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon recalled that ``it was not much fun to be a divorced
person or to be the offspring of divorced parents in Pittsburgh in
1912.'' He spent portions of his childhood in England, where he
began to develop a lifelong love of British culture.
</P>
<P>
   When he did see his father, relations between them were not
easy. ``I do not know,'' Paul wrote, ``and I doubt if anyone will
ever know, why Father was so seemingly devoid of feeling and so
tightly contained in his lifeless, hard shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his school days at Choate, in Connecticut, and later
during his years at Yale and at Clare College, Cambridge, Paul
Mellon developed in ways that defined and strengthened his
character, even if they did not always delight his father.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the United States or in England, he loved the
countryside. It was there that he could indulge his passion for
horses, a passion that was requited.
</P>
<P>
   When his horse Mill Reef won the English Derby in 1971, Mellon
was naturally euphoric. But what crowned the whole experience, he
said, was that three generations of Mill Reef's ancestors had come
from Mellon's Rokeby Stables in Virginia, long his adopted home
state.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to see his horses win, he said, but ``the sights and
sounds of the countryside, as well as the color and action and
excitement of the racecourse, are what turn me on: the mare
suckling her foal, the renegade foal bothering all the others, the
yearling who is boss of the field.'' To watch them, to ride them
and to breed them gave him satisfaction. He was a champion trail
rider until well into his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   At Cambridge he also came to love English literature as it was
imparted at that time by gifted teachers. He had heard many other
lectures on the subject at Yale, including one by Gene Tunney, the
former heavyweight champion, who had spoken without notes on
Shakespeare's ``Troilus and Cressida.'' ``It wasn't a bad lecture
at all,'' Mellon remembered.
</P>
<P>
   His feelings for England went deep. He had been baptized in St.
George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He enjoyed rowing, and he kept
his oars from Cambridge above the bookshelves in his personal
library on his Virginia estate.
</P>
<P>
   As a landowner and an independent scholar in England before
World War II he might have been very happy. But when he left
Cambridge in 1931 and went back to Pittsburgh, he agreed, almost as
a courtesy to his father, to enter the Mellon Bank as a trainee
clerk, moving from one department to another.
</P>
<P>
   His father's employees never dared to evaluate the boss' son,
and in due time he was invited to join one corporate board after
another. Besides the Mellon Bank, the family had large holdings in
Gulf Oil and Alcoa, among other corporations.

BRAZIL'S BANKING CHIEF REPLACED BY SOROS AIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO _ Brazil removed its top banking official
Tuesday, then moved to calm fears that the world's eighth-largest
economy was rocking toward recession, hiring a chief aide for
global economics guru George Soros as new Central Bank chief.
</P>
<P>
   Arminio Fraga, the nation's third Central Bank chief in less
than three weeks, becomes a key player in the fight by Latin
America's biggest economy to avoid the economic slide suffered by
Asia and Russia last year.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was made on the same day government leaders met with
officials from the International Monetary Fund to discuss the
second installment of a $41 billion financial plan for Brazil
approved late last year. Although Fraga's nomination has not yet
been confirmed by congress, he participated in those discussions
Tuesday, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Lopes, who took over the top banking position on Jan.
13 after the unexpected resignation of Gustavo Franco, was best
known for his controversial decision to allow Brazil's currency,
the real, to float freely against the dollar. Since then, the real
has lost 32 percent of its value against the dollar and has already
brought price hikes in everything from new cars to beans and rice.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lopes' decision was applauded by many financial
specialists, who argued the real was overvalued. But the move was
harshly criticized by many ordinary Brazilians, who saw it as an
admission by the Cardoso administration that its highly touted
four-year-old economic plan had all been a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in our country is disastrous because the
government has tricked us again,'' said Carlos Henrique Azevedo,
38, the son of an orange farmer, as he walked through a bustling
square in downtown Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Pedro Malan, speaking at a press conference in
the capital Brasilia, called the Princeton-educated Fraga, former
managing director of the New York-based Soros Management Fund,
``one of Brazil's best economists.'' He also said the bank would be
overhauled to operate better under the country's new exchange
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga's predecessor is also a highly regarded economist. But
among specialists and analysts, he is widely believed to have more
experience with volatile markets and currencies than Lopes did.
</P>
<P>
   Fraga previously worked for the Central Bank as an international
affairs director. He has spent the last five years overseeing the
Soros fund, which is worth about $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fraga's strength is that he knows the world,'' Juarez
Rezziere, director of the Institute for Economic Research at the
University of Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview. ``He is a
very competent operator and he brings an important component of
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sao Paulo stock exchange, the region's largest, closed down
3.12 percent Tuesday after gaining more than 8 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On currency markets, the real closed lower, at 1.75 to the
dollar. Analysts said both markets were more preoccupied with the
outcome of the IMF meetings than they were with the Central Bank
shake-up.
</P>
<P>
   Malan assured investors Tuesday that the real would continue to
float freely against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the Finance Ministry also stressed that Fraga
was no longer associated with Soros, who has recently criticized
the Cardoso administration for sharply raising interest rates to
keep capital from flowing out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The higher interest rates, which are now around 39 percent, have
made it more expensive for Brazilians to finance credit cards and
loans.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with a Brazilian television network last year on
the US bailout of the Mexican economy during its own currency
crisis in 1995, Fraga said, ``We learned that to get money from the
outside to solve international problems is bad. We learned that to
get money to finance consumption is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers saw the move at the Central Bank as an attempt by
Cardoso to demonstrate his control of the worsening economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being re-elected in October by a landslide margin on the
hope that he would quickly restore Brazil's economy and defend the
real, Cardoso's approval rating lately has plummeted to about 22
percent, mostly because of fears among residents that the country
could be headed back to a period of painful hyperinflation and
excessive government debt.
</P>
<P>
   That panic swelled on Friday, when rumors swirled the government
would close banks on Monday and restrict people's ability to
withdraw their money, an unpopular strategy used earlier this
decade by former President Collor de Mellor. Cardoso was quick to
dispel those rumors, and banks have been operating normally this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the speculation on Friday, Malan and Lopes both submitted
their resignations to the president. Cardoso accepted Lopes's
offer, but insisted Malan stay in his job.
</P>
<P>
   One of the topics being discussed with the IMF is how the
government plans to pay its $50 billion foreign debt service this
year. Administration officials are also expected to show how the
federal government will deal with a rebellion among a handful of
opposition governors who have called for a moratorium on state debt
payments to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's economy, Latin America's largest, had seen impressive
growth since a currency stabilization plan was created by Cardoso
in 1994. This year, however, most economists expected it to shrink
by 5 to 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The country received $9 billion last December as the first
installment of the IMF package. The government used the money to
replenish its reserves, which have dwindled to $36 billion _ less
than half what they were last July.

 UNDATED: other corporations.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Mellon began amassing his own collection of British art in
1934 when he bought a painting of a horse by the 18th-century
artist George Stubbs, who would remain a Mellon favorite. The
following year Mellon was married in New York to Mary Elizabeth
Conover Brown; the couple had a son, Timothy, and a daughter,
Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their marriage, the Mellons, seeking to learn the
source of Mary's asthma, went to Switzerland to seek out C.G. Jung,
the founder of analytical psychology. He became a friend and guided
them in some of their early philanthropy. But before that Mellon
had to tell his father that he could never settle down in the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial meeting took place on Nov. 29, 1936, when Andrew
Mellon was already in failing health. (He was to die nine months
later.) Paul had taken great trouble to prepare his case. He
recalled telling his father that he could not be ``an inadequate
replica of yourself, or a counterfeit.'' Nor, he said, could he
retreat into silence and mental compromise. He was not a man of
business, and never would be.
</P>
<P>
   To his surprise, his father told him that it was really not
necessary for Paul to take any active part in the business. He
should consider himself as an owner who ``kept vaguely in touch
through the head people.'' In the end, Andrew said, good management
was the only thing that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   But if they could never share a love for business, father and
son were ultimately joined in another sphere. Just two months
before Andrew died in 1937, construction began on the National
Gallery of Art, which had been approved by Congress earlier that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mellon had provided funds for the initial gallery, now
known as the West Building, which was designed by John Russell
Pope. He also gave a collection of 115 paintings, 31 of which had
been sold by the cash-poor Soviet government from the Hermitage in
Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, 1941, Paul Mellon officially presented the National
Gallery to President Franklin D. Roosevelt along with the Andrew
Mellon Collection, which included Raphael's ``Alba Madonna,'' van
Eyck's ``Annunciation,'' Botticelli's ``Adoration of the Magi'' and
a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Mellon said that he hoped that the gallery ``would
become a joint enterprise on the part of the government, on the one
hand, and of magnanimous citizens, on the other.'' Magnanimous
citizens did come forward and have continued to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon was the National Gallery's president and a trustee from
1938 to 1939, rejoining the board in 1945. He served again as
president from 1963 to 1979 and as board chairman from 1979 to
1985, when he became an honorary trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years he made clear that he did not wish anyone on
the staff to bow and scrape at his arrival. To his final days, he
would call the gallery's director, Earl A. Powell 3d, and ask,
``Would it be all right if I came to lunch tomorrow?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when he retired from the board in 1985, he told the
trustees that he would haunt the museum for the rest of his life.
``And who knows?'' he said. ``Perhaps from beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   The same year that the nation accepted the gallery from Mellon,
it accepted another offer from him. He enlisted in the Army and
asked to join the cavalry. After nine months he was made a second
lieutenant and spent two years at Fort Riley, Kan., as an
instructor in horsemanship. The Army later sent him to England, and
by the end of World War II he had become a major in the Office of
Strategic Services.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Conover Mellon died in 1946. Two years later Mellon married
Rachel Lambert Lloyd, universally known as Bunny, an heir to the
Listerine fortune. A spectrum of new interests _ domestic,
decorative and horticultural _ came into Mellon's life. So did his
wife's particular fondness for French painting of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. In addition to his wife, Mellon is survived
by his son, Timothy, of Lyme, Conn.; his daughter, Catherine M.
Conover of Washington, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Gallery the great business of the postwar years
was the completion in 1978 of the East Building. With its huge
aerial inner space and its dexterous use of a difficult
trapezoid-shaped ground plan, the East Building was from the outset
a crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   It also proved itself well able to display 20th-century art of
many kinds and to attract substantial gifts in that field. But the
Mellons consistently donated French and American masterworks. Their
gifts of 20th-century art included works by Matisse, Magritte and
Giacometti as well as earlier ones by David and Gericault.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came to build an East Building that would
complement the West and yet not be at all like it, many problems
had to be solved. Andrew Mellon had stipulated in his original gift
that Congress should reserve an additional area on the Mall for the
gallery's eventual expansion. After 30 years this had become the
most desirable unused site in Washington, and there were fears that
Congress might refuse to hand it over.
</P>
<P>
   But John Walker, then the gallery's director, was able to tell
the Committee on Public Buildings that the money for construction
would be provided privately: Paul Mellon and his sister, Ailsa
Mellon Bruce (who died in 1969), had agreed to underwrite the
costs, which were estimated at around $20 million. In his memoirs,
Mellon said that by the time the East Building opened, ``the final
figure had risen to slightly over $94 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The building committee for the project had held more than 60
meetings, and Paul Mellon was there for every one of them. It was
Mellon who commissioned I.M. Pei to be architect of the East
Building after being charmed by his designs for the Everson Museum
of Art in Syracuse and the Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon gave 913 works to the National Gallery over the years,
including Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red Waistcoat,'' two paintings by
Mark Rothko, Alexander Calder animal sculptures, Winslow Homer's
``Dad's Coming,'' Picassos, Gauguins, Bonnards, Vuillards, a Manet,
the original wax version of Degas' ``Little 14-Year-Old Dancer''
and postcards that had been written by van Gogh and Matisse. The
gallery is organizing a memorial exhibition to highlight some of
his gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures he donated were not bought expressly for museums,
but were works he valued intimately. Most had been hung in his
homes, often on nails he drove himself. Like his love of literature
and horses, Paul Mellon's love of art was authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gifts that he and his wife made to the National
Gallery on its 50th anniversary in 1991 were two paintings in his
father's collection that he would never forget. One was the
portrait of a very young Miss Willoughby by George Romney that he
had found quite irresistible when he was 5 and had cherished ever
since. ``In Pittsburgh, that painting was like an oasis in a desert
of smog,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another was the portrait of the Marchesa Balbi by van Dyck,
which had been the first thing he saw when he walked in through the
front door of his father's apartment in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But if he lavished attention on the National Gallery, many other
museums were dear to him, too, including the Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond, where in 1963 he first revealed the extent of his own
growing holdings in British art.

 &HT;    TBS, Philips to share sponsorship, products
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta and Charlie Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A one-of-a-kind marketing relationship that combines
the strengths of two international companies persuaded Philips
Electronics to pay top dollar to place its name on Atlanta's new
sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands and Turner
Broadcasting System have entered into a 20-year agreement that
includes naming rights, marketing and technology exchanges. Turner
Broadcasting would confirm only that the deal to name the sports
facility Philips Arena was valued ``in excess of $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the transaction said the package was
worth at least $180 million _ and could end up being worth $200
million or more as the complex partnership develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great deal,'' said Ted Turner, vice chairman of Time
Warner, parent of Turner Broadcasting. ``It's not just about money.
It's joint cooperation in a lot of different areas. It's a real,
true partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   The naming rights-marketing partnership deal almost covers the
cost of building the new arena, under construction as the home for
the Atlanta Hawks basketball team and the Atlanta Thrashers hockey
franchise. Scheduled to open this fall, the total arena project
will cost about $213 million.
</P>
<P>
   Turner officials emphasized this is a unique deal, made possible
by the potential business relationship between the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the biggest arena naming rights deal was for the
Staples Arena, under construction in Los Angeles. That deal was
valued at $116 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest arena deal ever done and the biggest
strategic alliance ever announced around an arena deal,'' said
Steve Heyer, president and chief operating officer of Turner
Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't looking for someone to put a billboard on a box,''
said Stan Kasten, chairman of the arena project and president of
the Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta Braves baseball team. ``We were
looking for a company whose identity could be consumed by the
building. It's a marriage between the two companies. We really are
providing software for each other's hardware.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turner-Time Warner and Philips partnership will begin with
the companies making a commitment to use each other's products. For
example, more than 1,000 Philips video monitors will be used in the
arena. All video components and lighting in the facility will be
Philips products.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of digital technology products could stretch far
beyond the arena into other Turner Broadcasting entities.
</P>
<P>
   Although few details were offered, the deal includes an
advertising package that gives Philips access to Turner's worldwide
television networks, including CNN, as well as space in Time
Warner's magazines, such as Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are exploring the potential for a stronger
business relationship in the future. They will create a task force
to study how they can develop, integrate and market their products.
For example, Philips might use Cartoon Network character Dexter to
market radios to children. Or it might ask Time Warner to produce
TV shows and movies in a new digital format, such as DVD, that
would dovetail with Philips' latest electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Philips is not the first international electronics company to
try to profit from a strategic alliance with a U.S. media company.
The company's arch-rival Sony tried it with a Hollywood studio in
the 1980s; that venture was considered a fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   But John Losier, president and chief executive officer of
Philips Electronics North America, said this deal would be
different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of our industries _ media and hardware _ are at
breaking-out points,'' he said. ``Time Warner has the high-speed
network to deliver digital content and we have the exciting digital
devices through which people can receive this content.''
</P>
<P>
   While executives of both companies heralded their agreement,
they said it was too early to offer specific details of
cooperation. ``I haven't thought of anything concrete,'' said
Turner. ``But we will be spending a good deal of time over the next
couple of years figuring out how to use this alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we invent just one new company or accelerate the acceptance
of one new product, whatever the differential (of the value of the
deal) is washed away with the noise,'' Heyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips Arena will provide a great opportunity to showcase
to the world the latest technology, Philips officials said.
Already, Philips lights up the Taj Mahal, the Eiffel Tower and the
Coliseum in Rome, said Losier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many synergies between the two companies,''
Losier said. ``We are cementing a very important business
partnership for the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Philips became a major player in Atlanta two years ago when it
moved the North American headquarters of Philips Consumer
Electronics from Knoxville to Dunwoody, headed by President and CEO
Robert Minkhorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to having a visible presence on
Atlanta's corporate skyline,'' Minkhorst said of the arena. ``It
will be a working showcase for Philips technology.''

 UNDATED: British art.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through his friendship with an English scholar, Basil Taylor,
Mellon became fascinated by aspects of English art that ``seemed to
me long neglected or even abandoned, not only in this country but
in its homeland,'' he said. This was the not English art of the
formal portrait and the ``fancy picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's take it seriously,'' he said when he opened the Richmond
exhibition of his collection. ``Let's re-evaluate it, let's look at
it. Let's enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   He once maintained that ``collecting is the sort of thing that
creeps up on you.'' That was certainly true of his panoramic
enthusiasm for English art in all its forms. Before long those
holdings seemed to call out for a home of their own. From this came
his decision to create the Yale Center for British Art, a museum
and research institution that is the largest collection of British
works outside Britain. It opened in April 1977 in a memorably
beautiful building by Louis Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon remembered his encounter with Kahn in California. ``He
was eccentric,'' Mellon once said. ``I had gone to see him in La
Jolla, where he was working on the Salk Institute, to talk about
his designing the Yale Center. He came to breakfast at the hotel
and made pencil drawings all over the tablecloth. I always regret
not having asked to keep it: one work of art I was never able to
collect.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his love for art, Mellon was a single-handed and
single-minded environmentalist. In 1956, foundations that had been
started with his sister published a report, ``Our Vanishing
Shoreline.'' As a result of this alarm, and with considerable
amounts of Mellon funds, parts of the Cape Hatteras National
Seashore, the Great Beach of Cape Cod and Cumberland Island off the
coast of Georgia have been preserved. He bought Virginia the
2,600-acre Sky Meadows State Park and Washington the outdoor chess
tables in Lafayette Square. He used his resources to help insure
that riding and hiking trails would remain available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Through his family foundations Mellon was also instrumental in
supporting libraries as well as organizations in the arts,
education and public health. He bought the papers of Samuel
Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, when they turned up in a
castle in Ireland, and gave them to Yale. When he was offered 835
volumes from the private library of the philosopher John Locke _
cataloged, annotated and shelf-numbered in Locke's own hand _ he
bought them forthwith and before long gave them to the Bodleian
Library at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   He gave $500,000 for restoring Monticello and $1 million for
saving monuments in Britain. The Bollingen Foundation, which he
established, not only created the nation's top poetry prize but
also published an idiosyncratic array of elegantly designed books
in a series that has no parallel in this country. The series
included the complete works of Jung and Coleridge; a four-volume
edition of Pushkin's ``Eugene Onegin,'' translated into English and
annotated by Vladimir Nabokov; the ``I Ching''; Joseph Campbell's
``Hero With a Thousand Faces,'' and scores of other studies in
esthetics, cultural and art history, philosophy, psychology,
mythology and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon did not give money to every cause that came by. In
``Reflections in a Silver Spoon,'' he recalled his encounter with
Vanessa Redgrave, a distant relative, in the 1980s. ``She arrived
dressed in jeans and some kind of Daniel Boone leather jacket.''
Over tea, Ms. Redgrave explained ``that she was raising funds for
the revolution and that she wanted some money from me to help in
her fight for the proletariat.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to enlist in her battle. ``I tried to explain to
her,'' he wrote, ``that for my part, I was really not in favor of a
revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Mellon's generosity deprive him of a supremely
comfortable life. Besides buying art and raising horses, the
Mellons maintained homes simultaneously in Washington, Manhattan,
Paris, Antigua, Cape Cod and other places, as well as their
4,000-acre estate in Virginia. The Mellon jet was decorated with
work by George Braque, Paul Klee and Ben Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon always entered a room as if he believed himself to be
inconspicuous, and he maintained an air of never having had to
raise his voice and not intending to begin now. His clothes never
called attention to themselves, nor did they ever look quite new.
His taste in neckties was in the area of the ``winter regimental.''
When he had to carry speeches and papers around, they came not in
zippered containers of Italian leather but in a brown paper
accordion folder with an elastic tie.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mellon's countless awards were the National Medal of Arts,
presented by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the National
Humanities Medal, awarded by President Clinton in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1967 Mellon was the commencement speaker at the Carnegie
Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, which was about to merge
with the Mellon Institute as Carnegie-Mellon University. He advised
the graduates to experience great works of literature and art for
themselves, saying, ``There is no intellectual or emotional
substitute for the authentic, the original, the unique
masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he went further: ``Just as there is no substitute for
original works of art, there is no substitute for the world of
direct sensual experience.'' Among them he listed the sound of
birds, the smell of flowers, the taste of ``the evening's first
cold and dry martini'' and ``perhaps the most important, the thrill
and mystery of touching, of love between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Such poetic thoughts were not rare for Mellon, who once said
that ``what this country needs is a good 5-cent reverie.''
</P>
<P>
   He even wrote light verse, usually for family consumption. But
when one of his racehorses won a prize, Mellon read the awards
dinner guests a poem expressing the horse's appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; As I browse through my field in Virginia &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And muse, at the close of the day &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Once again they will give me a medal &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Made of silver, although it ain't hay ... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Another man with Mellon's wealth might have aimed for high
office. But ``for many reasons the idea of power has never appealed
to me,'' he once said. ``What has appealed to me is privacy. To me,
privacy is the most valuable asset that money can buy.''

CLINTON CONFIDANT PROVIDES LITTLE NEW INFORMATION, HYDE SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential confidant Vernon Jordan apparently
provided no new evidence Tuesday during closed-door questioning in
President Clinton's impeachment trial as some Republican senators
cast doubt on the need for additional, live testimony from Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Grilled for nearly three hours in a secure room at the Capitol,
Jordan was asked to clarify purported contradictions in his
testimony before a grand jury investigating whether the president
violated federal law while trying to conceal his affair with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Senate Republicans continued seeking a way to blunt
Clinton's ability to declare victory when, as early procedural
votes indicate, he is acquitted of the perjury and obstruction of
justice charges passed in a party-line vote by the GOP-controlled
House.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senators have drafted a resolution declaring that
Clinton provided false and misleading testimony under oath, a
proposal that could be passed by a simple majority, not the
two-thirds vote required to convict and remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Rep. Henry Hyde, an Illinois Republican and lead
prosecutor, acknowledged that Jordan provided little new
information. ``We have gotten some amplification, and we have
strengthened some points'' from earlier testimony, Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if either Jordan or Lewinsky provided startling evidence
that might strengthen their arguments for terminating Clinton's
presidency, Hyde said House prosecutors ``never felt we needed any
bombshells to have a compelling case; we needed to validate
previous testimony.'' A third witness, White House aide Sidney
Blumenthal, will be deposed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Republican prosecutors so far ``have accomplished our
goals'' during the deposition, closed-door questioning of the three
witnesses that he predicted would ``advance the cause of
impeachment, conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   When the presidential impeachment trial, only the second in U.S.
history, resumes at 1 p.m. EST Thursday, Hyde said he would ask for
Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal to be summoned to provide live
testimony on the Senate floor. Calling witnesses would require a
majority vote of the Senate _ which has 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a handful of Republican senators, after viewing a
videotape of Lewinsky's sworn testimony, said the prosecutors are
losing ground in their bid for live witnesses, particularly the
former intern, during the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate's 45 Democrats remain opposed to live testimony,
as expected, they would need only six Republicans to join them to
move the trial into closing arguments, possibly this weekend, and a
vote on the articles of impeachment well before the Feb. 12
target-date for ending the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what my staff told me, there is nothing new. If there
in fact is nothing new, I would not expect her to be called,'' said
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether anything could be gained by having Lewinsky
provide live testimony, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, responded:
``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said after seeing the videotape he
believes Lewinsky should testify before the Senate, or at least
that the public should view her videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appeared to me to be young, vulnerable and credible. And
she would make an excellent live witness,'' Hatch said. ``I
personally believe it would be helpful to the American people to
see, in the very least, the videotape.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, each of the senators said there was nothing
salacious in the question-and-answer session videotaped Monday at a
Washington hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tape were to be viewed on the floor of the United
States Senate, in no way would it offend the sensibility of the
American people or would it in any way damage the Senate,'' Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Videotapes of Jordan's deposition will be made available for
senators to view privately early Wednesday. Blumenthal's testimony
will be available Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican and House prosecutor
who led the questioning of Jordan on Wednesday, said he ``was
satisfied that we covered the areas that were needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson refused to reveal specifics from the deposition. ``We
had questions today ... for almost three hours,'' the lawmaker
said. ``And we completed that and will move on to the next phase of
this trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's deposition ended after Clinton's legal team posed two
questions. On Monday, they asked none of Lewinsky, instead reading
an apology ``on behalf of the president'' for the ordeal Lewinsky
has gone through, including 22 interviews under oath by federal
prosecutors and one by House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with Jordan's deposition described it as
occasionally heated with his voice rising when he denied telling
Lewinsky, as she testified earlier, that he asked her to destroy
drafts of love letters to the president.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful Washington attorney who has been a close Clinton
associate for years, Jordan became involved in the White House
sex-and-perjury scandal when he helped her find a job in New York
and steered her to a lawyer who drafted an affidavit she signed
denying any sexual contact with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has denied that the job hunt was related to Lewinsky
being summoned to testify in Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton. White House lawyers have pointed out that the job
hunt began five months before Lewinsky was subpoenaed. House
prosecutors say Jordan's efforts on Lewinsky's behalf intensified
when her name appeared on the Jones witness list in early December
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky last summer testified before the grand jury that she
told Jordan about some of her sexual encounters with Clinton, such
as engaging in telephone sex. Lewinsky said she showed Jordan some
of the gifts she had received from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After she had a draft of her affidavit, Lewinsky said she
discussed details of it with Jordan, including the wisdom of
removing a passage.
</P>
<P>
   During his five appearances before the same grand jury, Jordan's
testimony differed on all those points.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not recall seeing Lewinsky's gifts from the
president or hearing about phone sex. Jordan said he accepted a
denial from Lewinsky when he asked her directly about having sex
with the president. Jordan said he glanced through a draft of
Lewinsky's affidavit, but didn't recall talking about proposed
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators are bracing for the trial to end
without enough votes to convict the president. The senators are
promoting the idea of a ``finding of fact'' that would outline what
Clinton did wrong but not assess guilt or punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say there has been some momentum for it over the
weekend,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the No. 2 Republican in the
Senate, said there was still a distance to go to get Republican
agreement. ``I think a lot of people are very interested, but there
was no conclusion,'' he said. ``We're still not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a resolution ``violates directly the Constitution,'' said
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, adding that the statement
of facts or a censure resolution should be considered after the
trial ends.

<P>
   Paul Mellon, the patrician art collector who tenaciously turned
philanthropy into his personal art form, above all through his
stewardship of the National Gallery of Art, died on Monday at his
home in Upperville, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A son of enormous wealth, Mellon turned from his family's world
of banking and business to become an endlessly inventive benefactor
of the nation's cultural life. The Mellons' total contributions to
museums and other causes from parks to poetry has been estimated at
nearly a billion dollars. The money has gone to save seashores and
encourage scholars. It established the Yale Center for British Art
and America's top poetry award, the Bollingen Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But to many, the greatest monument to the family's fortune, and
to Paul Mellon's personal dedication, is the National Gallery of
Art in Washington, originally conceived as a gift to the people by
his father, Andrew W. Mellon (1855-1937), the financier and
longtime secretary of the treasury. The elder Mellon did not live
to see his wish fulfilled. But Paul Mellon, who could never share
his father's love for commerce, more than inherited a dedication to
giving something back to society. For the son it became a way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon was born in Pittsburgh on June 11, 1907, the only
son of Andrew W. Mellon and his first wife, the English-born Nora
McMullen. The couple had a daughter, Ailsa, six years earlier.
Andrew Mellon, a partner in the private bank founded by his father,
Judge Thomas Mellon, in Pittsburgh in 1870, became one of the most
successful American financiers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   In his 60s, after having established and consolidated an
international commercial empire, Andrew Mellon entered public life,
serving as treasury secretary from 1921 to 1932, under three
presidents, and as the United States ambassador to Britain in 1932
and '33.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his school days at Choate, in Connecticut, and later
during his years at Yale and at Clare College, Cambridge, Paul
Mellon developed in ways that defined and strengthened his
character, even if they did not always delight his father.
</P>
<P>
   Whether in the United States or in England, he loved the
countryside. It was there that he could indulge his passion for
horses, a passion that was requited.
</P>
<P>
   His feelings for England went deep. He had been baptized in St.
George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. He enjoyed rowing, and he kept
his oars from Cambridge above the bookshelves in his personal
library on his Virginia estate.
</P>
<P>
   As a landowner and an independent scholar in England before
World War II he might have been very happy. But when he left
Cambridge in 1931 and went back to Pittsburgh, he agreed, almost as
a courtesy to his father, to enter the Mellon Bank as a trainee
clerk, moving from one department to another.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon began amassing his own collection of British art in
1934 when he bought a painting of a horse by the 18th-century
artist George Stubbs, who would remain a Mellon favorite. The
following year Mellon was married in New York to Mary Elizabeth
Conover Brown; the couple had a son, Timothy, and a daughter,
Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their marriage, the Mellons, seeking to learn the
source of Mary's asthma, went to Switzerland to seek out C.G. Jung,
the founder of analytical psychology. He became a friend and guided
them in some of their early philanthropy. But before that Mellon
had to tell his father that he could never settle down in the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   But if they could never share a love for business, father and
son were ultimately joined in another sphere. Just two months
before Andrew died in 1937, construction began on the National
Gallery of Art, which had been approved by Congress earlier that
year.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mellon had provided funds for the initial gallery, now
known as the West Building, which was designed by John Russell
Pope. He also gave a collection of 115 paintings, 31 of which had
been sold by the cash-poor Soviet government from the Hermitage in
Leningrad.
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, 1941, Paul Mellon officially presented the National
Gallery to President Franklin D. Roosevelt along with the Andrew
Mellon Collection, which included Raphael's ``Alba Madonna,'' van
Eyck's ``Annunciation,'' Botticelli's ``Adoration of the Magi'' and
a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon was the National Gallery's president and a trustee from
1938 to 1939, rejoining the board in 1945. He served again as
president from 1963 to 1979 and as board chairman from 1979 to
1985, when he became an honorary trustee.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Conover Mellon died in 1946. Two years later Mellon married
Rachel Lambert Lloyd, universally known as Bunny, an heir to the
Listerine fortune. A spectrum of new interests _ domestic,
decorative and horticultural _ came into Mellon's life. So did his
wife's particular fondness for French painting of the late 19th and
early 20th centuries. In addition to his wife, Mellon is survived
by his son, Timothy, of Lyme, Conn.; his daughter, Catherine M.
Conover of Washington, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon gave 913 works to the National Gallery over the years,
including Cezanne's ``Boy in a Red Waistcoat,'' two paintings by
Mark Rothko, Alexander Calder animal sculptures, Winslow Homer's
``Dad's Coming,'' Picassos, Gauguins, Bonnards, Vuillards, a Manet,
the original wax version of Degas' ``Little 14-Year-Old Dancer''
and postcards that had been written by van Gogh and Matisse. The
gallery is organizing a memorial exhibition to highlight some of
his gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But if he lavished attention on the National Gallery, many other
museums were dear to him, too, including the Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond, where in 1963 he first revealed the extent of his own
growing holdings in British art.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his love for art, Mellon was a single-handed and
single-minded environmentalist. In 1956, foundations that had been
started with his sister published a report, ``Our Vanishing
Shoreline.'' As a result of this alarm, and with considerable
amounts of Mellon funds, parts of the Cape Hatteras National
Seashore, the Great Beach of Cape Cod and Cumberland Island off the
coast of Georgia have been preserved. He bought Virginia the
2,600-acre Sky Meadows State Park and Washington the outdoor chess
tables in Lafayette Square. He used his resources to help insure
that riding and hiking trails would remain available to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Through his family foundations Mellon was also instrumental in
supporting libraries as well as organizations in the arts,
education and public health. He bought the papers of Samuel
Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, when they turned up in a
castle in Ireland, and gave them to Yale. When he was offered 835
volumes from the private library of the philosopher John Locke _
cataloged, annotated and shelf-numbered in Locke's own hand _ he
bought them forthwith and before long gave them to the Bodleian
Library at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   He gave $500,000 for restoring Monticello and $1 million for
saving monuments in Britain. The Bollingen Foundation, which he
established, not only created the nation's top poetry prize but
also published an idiosyncratic array of elegantly designed books
in a series that has no parallel in this country. The series
included the complete works of Jung and Coleridge; a four-volume
edition of Pushkin's ``Eugene Onegin,'' translated into English and
annotated by Vladimir Nabokov; the ``I Ching''; Joseph Campbell's
``Hero With a Thousand Faces,'' and scores of other studies in
esthetics, cultural and art history, philosophy, psychology,
mythology and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Among Mellon's countless awards were the National Medal of Arts,
presented by President Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the National
Humanities Medal, awarded by President Clinton in 1997.

GLEAMS OF CREATIVITY THROUGH A POLITICAL WALL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Authorities, of whatever persuasion, have a proprietary
interest in images. Egyptian rulers sometimes had the faces of
their predecessors wiped out and replaced with their own.
</P>
<P>
   Some religions prohibit any human imagery. During the
Counter-Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church ordered the nudes in
Michelangelo's Last Judgment painted over where it mattered. In
mid-19th-century France, it was illegal to caricature anyone
publicly without first obtaining his (or just conceivably her)
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Photography, because it makes convincing likenesses of an object
and because of its wide potential distribution, has received
particularly heavy attention from anyone who has a stake in what is
seen. The Soviet Union is an obvious example, what with Lenin's
call for ``a political and social journalism infused with images''
and the long history of Stalin's victims' being carefully excised
from official photographs as a means of erasing the dead from
history.
</P>
<P>
   By now the western world is fairly well acquainted with Soviet
post-Revolutionary photography, which has been elevated to a new
kind of glory by becoming an expensive item for capitalist
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Much less is generally known about photography in the other
countries that were behind the Iron Curtain, perhaps because they
were less thrilling, less glamorous and less threatening, not
having stirred up a major revolution or wreaked such terror
themselves. Most Americans probably have very little idea how East
Germans, for instance, saw themselves, or how their culture asked
them to.
</P>
<P>
   Some insight can be gained from ``Recollecting a Culture:
Photography and the Evolution of a Socialist Esthetic in East
Germany,'' a show of more than 120 photographs at the Photographic
Resource Center at Boston University through Feb. 19. John P.
Jacob, executive director of the center, is the curator of this
show and editor of a catalog with the same name, published by the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs chosen by Jacob are from Fotografie, the only
state-sanctioned magazine for professional photographers in the
German Democratic Republic after World War II; it was published in
East Germany from 1947 on. In the end it was hopelessly out of
touch. Pictures of the Berlin Wall being torn down in 1989, a major
event for the East Germans if ever there was one, were not even
published in Fotografie until a year later, and by then western
material was so widely available that the party-line magazine was
no longer important; it folded in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recollecting a Culture'' is the first show from the archives
of the magazine's publisher since the two Germanies were reunited.
It includes a few pictures from Czechoslovakia and China as well as
some historical work from the 1920s and '30s; the magazine
published some photographs from other socialist countries and
occasional images from Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the photographs on view are good, some bad, but quality
as it is usually conceived was not the point. These particular
authorities demanded a view of a society racing toward utopia, full
of happy workers and photographers committed to changing the world
with their images.
</P>
<P>
   The idea went something like this: if you picture the perfect
society, people will believe they are living in it and strive
harder to make it come true. Photographers followed directions in
order to work, but some circumvented them in whatever small ways
they could.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1970s or '80s the images here are essentially
journalistic and hew to expected subjects. Right after the war
there were pictures of women and children clearing rubble and a
slightly sentimental but moving image of a statue stretching out a
hand high above a blasted city, ``A Stone Cries Out in
Accusation,'' 1945, by Richard Peter Sr.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and into the '60s, there were heroic images of
scientists, doctors, workers and industry itself very much along
the lines of Soviet photography a quarter of a century earlier. The
standard subjects of people watching parades and peasants on market
day are supplemented now and then by reminders of the party line: a
general kisses a farmer, a bemedaled veteran of the Communist Party
enjoys his encounter with eager Young Pioneers and, in a scene in a
Dresden train station, all the people in the foreground blur as
light streams in on the clearly focused figure of a nurse helping
an elderly woman down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the later years things loosened up a bit, and a few
out-of-the-ordinary and more ``artistic'' photographs were
published. In the 1980s, when disillusion was rampant, there were
even some pictures critical of society in the GDR, some manipulated
photographs and portraits of young people wearing punk hair and
studded leather. Some of the photojournalists, like Thomas Sandberg
and Sibylle Bergemann, have gone on to successful careers in the
new Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Photography in East Germany was so strictly regulated by the
state that it cannot be considered outside the realm of politics,
but it is clear that the field was not monolithic, and if it was
ever unified it never remained so for long. Jacob specifically says
that the situation in the GDR was not so neatly divided as we might
choose to think, not simply official versus unofficial or
dissident, but more ambiguous and unstable, with cultural
resistance taking subtle forms. (Milan Kundera's novels describe
another Communist regime that could answer to that description.)
</P>
<P>
   Jacob also points out that socialism itself wore different faces
in different lands; by 1973, the Czechoslovaks could photograph
industrial and chemical pollution but the Germans still could not.
</P>
<P>
   Cultural restrictions in East Germany underwent minor ups and
downs at various times: in 1958, when the Central Commission for
Photography was established and began its careful monitoring of the
magazine; in 1961, when the Wall went up; in 1964, when Khrushchev
was ousted; in 1971, when the East German regime changed; and
during the 1970s and '80s, as television took over much of the task
of transmitting information, allowing still photography to stray a
bit, and the sense that socialism was not going to work began to
infiltrate the cultural realm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (For a more thorough account of the photography and politics of
the East Germans, see Karl Gernot Kuehn's ``Caught: The Art of
Photography in the German Democratic Republic,'' University of
California Press.)
</P>
<P>
   The necessity of changing the world through art goes back to
Marx, and the idea that art could help lift the working classes up
to a better life was boldly taken up by the Soviet Revolution. In
Germany, the goal was formalized in 1927, when the German
Association of Worker Photographers was founded to teach workers
how to take the production of information into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob points out that in the GDR, historians traced the
beginning of modern photographic history to worker photography
rather than to stylistic changes like modernism.
</P>
<P>
   The second and third decades of this century had seen an immense
increase in photographic illustration in the print media, and
during the 1920s German publishers in effect invented the photo
magazine. It was perfectly clear to the worker photographers that
workers were not controlling the imagery that reflected and helped
mold daily life; they intended to use the camera for overt class
struggle to counter the covert, unannounced purposes the mainstream
press depended on.
</P>
<P>
   The worker association's program announced that ``the capitalist
press uses photographic techniques via a flood of illustrated
magazines to politically influence the masses and diminish their
intellectual growth.'' Industrialists, not surprisingly, saw the
worker photographers as enemies, accused them of being industrial
spies and advised that photography be prohibited in factories.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, in 1962 the heirs to the worker photographers in
East Germany were forbidden to photograph in factories without
proving to the authorities that it was necessary to do so and
getting their permission, for fear of industrial espionage.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Soviets carved out the GDR, the Germans had had
superb examples of the way a state can use imagery to sway a
populace and consolidate power, not only in the Soviet Union but in
Hitler's Germany as well. The engineering of imagery reached
heights in these two countries that had never been attained before.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of who controls the media and what their influence is
is still very much with us. Photographic theorists and
multiculturalists have come down hard on the documentary tradition
of white, western, middle-class photographers (and writers,
filmmakers, etc.) producing the public image of poor people,
minorities and foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
   America has no central photography authority, but that does not
mean that our imagery is free of politics of one sort or another:
the politics of the dominant classes, the strictures of political
correctness, the tyranny of commerce (meaning that what is shown is
most often what sells, and what sells is often the lowest common
denominator), the fearsome power of a few corporate giants owning
so much of the media.
</P>
<P>
   In the socialist paradise that failed, art was supposed to join
the battle to create a new classless utopia on its unstable
antecedent, capitalism. Jacob has done a real service by reprinting
some articles from Fotografie that give an idea of what was
required of photographers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960: ``Under the new social conditions, photography, for the
first time, completely serves to communicate and propagate the
great humanist ideas of peace, of friendship among the peoples, and
of human happiness.'' In the same year: ``The battle against
formalism, as expressed in so-called subjective photography and
other expressions of the decay of late bourgeois society, is a form
of ideological class struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   When the GDR was absorbed by West Germany, photographers from
the East raced to embrace formalism, subjectivism, or simply the
freedom to choose, even to turn themselves into capitalists if they
could. This was not entirely a happy move.
</P>
<P>
   In company with large numbers of the bourgeoisie they had been
encouraged to despise, the idealists among them mourned the failure
of a utopian experiment. It was an experiment that had never
succeeded but had partially managed to (italics)picture(end
italics) itself as successful, chiefly to convince the subjects of
the experiment that their world was new.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, it wasn't, and ultimately people could not be
convinced of something they knew was not so. Photography and other
media are powerful instruments, but there is still something out
there called reality, no matter what anyone tells you, and in the
end it wins out even over representation.

KRAFT WANTS DECISION ON STEAM PLANT BEFORE SIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft will not sign a
final agreement to move the team to Connecticut unless he is
convinced within the next few days that a steam plant on the
proposed site of the new stadium in Hartford can be taken down by
the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy meeting with Connecticut officials in Hartford
Tuesday, Patriots business manager Andy Wasynczuk emerged
unconvinced _ but expressing hope _ that the power plant can be
relocated in time for the team to play its first game there in
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we make a commitment to this thing we want it to be
real,'' Wasynczuk said. ``And that's what we have to be confident
in over the next three to four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft is scheduled to sign the final development agreement with
the state Friday, already about a month later than originally
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's comments by Wasynczuk were the first indication that
the Patriots are growing concerned over the steam plant issue.
Although both team and state officials said relocating the plant
would be the most complicated part of the deal, they appeared
optimistic it would be moved in time.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Wasynczuk said that before Friday's signing, the
Patriots are looking for a ``a confidence level from the state that
they can deliver the site and have us free to begin construction
roughly in the summer of the year 2000 to be ready for the 2002
season.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves about 17 months for the site to be acquired, cleared
of the steam plant, and cleaned of environmental contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   While a growing sense of urgency has developed over the
negotiations, no one Tuesday wanted to contemplate what might
happen if Kraft refused to sign the development agreement on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Although alternative sites in Hartford have been discussed,
Governor John W. Rowland insists the primary site, known as
Adriaen's Landing, is the only location he would consider for the
stadium _ part of a $1 billion development project there. Rowland
has said the plant could be moved quickly since the Connecticut
General Assembly passed a $350 million bill in December to pay for
the open-air facility and infrastructure. But the target date for
the team to play its first game in Hartford has already slipped by
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said Tuesday's meeting firmed up the timeline needed
to move the team by 2002, a year later than the original goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In working towards 2001, it's become more and more clear as
the schedule has been laid out that's not likely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the site can be ready in time for 2002, ``There's
still more information that they are collecting on that front,''
Wasynczuk added. ``We're also expecting to get some additional
costing information to make sure this is feasible from the state's
perspective . . . but everyone on their side is confident it can be
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, getting the site on schedule ``is the most
important issue for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The development agreement combines elements from the Memorandum
of Understanding Kraft and Rowland signed Nov. 19 and the
authorizing legislation passed in December. The document is
hundreds of pages long and contains complex legal language
outlining exactly how the stadium will be built and when.
</P>
<P>
   Jeopardizing the timeframe is the stalled negotiations between
CTG Resources Inc., which owns the steam plant that heats and cools
many of Hartford's buildings, and the quasi-public Connecticut
Resources Recovery Authority plant, which burns garbage from 64
communities and produces electricity.
</P>
<P>
   CTG is considering buying steam from the nearby Connecticut
Resources Recovery Authority plant so that there would be no
service disruption downtown.
</P>
<P>
   If no deal is struck between the two power producers, however,
the state could take the land by eminent domain and reimburse CTG
for its value. But that would be the option of last resort and also
the most time consuming, those involved in the negotiations say.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the sticking point is, Connecticut Resources Recovery
Authority president Robert Wright replied: ``Money. Timing.
Pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, CTG wants more money and more time and does not
want to pay to clean up the hazardous chemicals that contaminate
the site, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rowland, who has garnered headlines nationwide with his
powerplay to lure the Patriots from Foxborough, may not be willing
to give up so easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor of the state of Connecticut is not a guy who has
trouble making a decision,'' Wright added. ``If he sees that date
(for signing the development agreement) is in jeopardy, he will
make the appropriate decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Like what?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can cut a deal. Somebody can come in and throw a whole
bunch of money on the table. Somebody can come in and buy (the
steam plant company) I guess. There's a lot of options,'' Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Wright cautioned, ``the parties' positions will be
crystallized this week. And I don't think there will be a (steam
plant) deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for CTG could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``CTG is committed to this,'' Rowland said after the meeting
Tuesday. ``I don't think they want to be the skunk at the party.''

 &HT;    Deals with Pistons pile up draft picks
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Grant Long came back to the Hawks on Sunday, he
closed the loop on a startlingly one-sided deal that might have the
Detroit Pistons wondering if they should ever again do business
with Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1996, the Hawks sent Long and guard Stacey Augmon to the
Pistons for two first-round picks and two second-rounders. The move
freed up enough salary-cap room to allow the Hawks to sign
free-agent center Dikembe Mutombo, who became the dominant
defensive player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Augmon, meanwhile, did not work out and was shipped to Portland
for a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   Long had an abrasive relationship with Pistons coach Doug
Collins and saw his usefulness questioned. In two seasons, his
total minutes were about half his work load in his 1995-96 campaign
with the Hawks. Long opted out of his contract in June.
</P>
<P>
   The two first-round choices from the deal are lottery-protected,
so the Hawks still have them. One is a pick that originated from
Sacramento and, because both the Kings and the Pistons are
improved, the Hawks hope they can get both of them this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks ago, on Jan. 21, the Hawks dealt Christian
Laettner, who was no longer welcome here and is still recovering
from Achilles' surgery, to the Pistons for backup center Scot
Pollard and another first-round choice, the one the Pistons
received from Portland in the deal that sent Augmon to the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Hawks in effect are getting two first-round picks for
Augmon, plus the Kings' pick. And they got Long to fill the
alternate power forward slot occupied by Laettner at the end of his
career here.
</P>
<P>
   Including the Hawks' own pick, they could have as many as four
in the draft. One possibility would be for them to use the picks in
future trades to improve the team as it starts play in the new
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in Detroit are calling it Koncak's revenge,
referring to the Pistons' push in 1989 to sign Hawks free agent Jon
Koncak, who got a six-year, $13.2 million contract with the Hawks
that was reviled by fans and players alike.
</P>
<P>
   But that was small revenge for the Pistons, who in 1984 made the
horrible blunder of dealing forwards Cliff Levingston and Antoine
Carr, plus two second-round draft picks, for forward Dan
Roundfield, who left the team after one unproductive season.
</P>
<P>
   Daunting stretch
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks open with three games in three nights, and coach Lenny
Wilkens said it is a daunting task to plan for.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to do is go out there and win the first one and
then see how many minutes different players worked and adjust for
the second game the way you would a regular back-to-back,'' Wilkens
said. ``When the third game comes up, you do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA once scheduled back-to-back-to-back sets routinely, but
eliminated the practice because of the potential adverse effects on
players. The Hawks do it only once, but the New York Knicks do it
three times in March.
</P>
<P>
   Flu hampers Pollard
</P>
<P>
   Pollard suspects that it was a flu shot that sent him to bed
with acute flu symptoms that cost him six days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard was able to do some light work Tuesday and said doctors
disagree with his diagnosis, but he has no other answer for his
ache and fever that knocked him out of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Pete Babcock told Pollard that if he is not well
enough to compete for a spot on the roster, the team would place
him on the five-game injured list until he feels strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   The club did make a roster move Tuesday, waiving power forward
Kebu Stewart. It put them within one of the 14-man roster limit set
for 6 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks pass on Master P
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks were given a chance to sign Percy Miller, a.k.a.
Master P, when the Hornets waived him after weekend games. Atlanta
politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is a player agent, rap artist and entrepreneur, had
an associate offer his services, with the thought that the Hawks
need to sell tickets. However, the club indicated that it is more
concerned with winning games.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The almost daily American air strikes on Iraq have
turned into the equivalent of a low-level war, hitting a wide range
of military targets, some of which pose little immediate threat to
American or British pilots patrolling much of Iraq's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Operating under broader rules for attacking Iraq's defenses,
American fighter jets have pounded more than a dozen targets in
northern and southern Iraq in the last four days. On Tuesday, for
the first time, the targets included a newly assembled missile site
that could threat ships in the Persian Gulf, Pentagon officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last month, American warplanes, recently joined by
British jets, have attacked more anti-aircraft batteries and
surface-to-air missile batteries than they did during the four
nights of intensive strikes in December, according to the Pentagon.
Including Tuesday's raids, the Americans and British have struck
more than 40 of these targets.
</P>
<P>
   The raids in December were meant to set back Iraq's ability to
build and use chemical and biological weapons in the wake of
President Saddam Hussein's repeated refusal to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this new war of attrition, officials said, is to keep
pressure on Hussein's increasingly isolated government, chipping
away at Iraq's military might, even as the United States openly
advocates the removal of Hussein from power.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon say the latest strikes have dealt a
blow to Iraq's ability to threaten the American and British patrols
over much of its territory. By one intelligence estimate, Iraq has
lost some 20 percent of its air-defense weapons since December's
raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being effective taking out his air defenses, piece by
piece,'' one official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has remained defiant. On Monday, Hussein's government
offered a bounty equal to about $14,000 to any Iraqi who shoots
down an American or British jet. (Iraq also offered a smaller
bounty for capturing an enemy pilot.) Defense Secretary William
Cohen scoffed at the gesture, saying it was ``just another example
of Saddam Hussein flailing out.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi defenses continue to challenge American and British
warplanes in its skies.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that anti-aircraft batteries in northern
Iraq opened fire on Tuesday on American F-15E fighter jets while
surface-to-air missile sites turned their radar systems onto other
F-15's and an EA-6B electronic jamming jet in three separate
instances. In each case, they said, the American jets responded
with bombs or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Iraq, the officials said, Iraqi forces fired at
least one surface-to-air missile at a patrol of American F-15's and
British Tornados; the Iraqis also fired anti-aircraft artillery.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Pentagon's new more aggressive rules of
engagement, the officials said, American warplanes responded by
attacking a predetermined target considered to be a potential
threat: the anti-ship missile site.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger disclosed that
President Clinton had given American pilots wider authority to
retaliate when threatened by Iraqi forces, allowing them to strike
at any defense system, not just those that actually target the
American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's strike, four jets from the aircraft carrier Carl
Vinson _ two F-14's and two F/A-18's _ attacked the site, on the Al
Fao peninsula south of Basra, even though there were no indications
that Iraqi forces were preparing to open fire.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon said Iraq had readied the missile _ a
Soviet-made CSSC-3 capable of hitting a ship 60 miles out to sea _
in just the last week. The officials said Iraq could use the
missile to threaten commercial or military traffic in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put them on launchers and put the launchers in a position
to fire into the Persian Gulf,'' said one official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, the Carl Vinson's jets attacked the
site with four precision-guided bombs, each with 500 pounds of
explosives. Another Pentagon official said the bombs appeared to
strike their target, because they were followed by secondary
blasts, presumably from exploding munitions.
</P>
<P>
   During the raids in December, American and British forces
attacked 100 targets in all. The commander who led that attack,
Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, reported that the missile strikes had
destroyed the vast majority of the targets. The jets had less luck
with the 34 air-defense targets they attacked, destroying half of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the American strikes had been limited to missile
batteries, radar facilities and other parts of Iraq's air defenses.
The officials said they would not rule out striking other
facilities, but for now they do not plan a broader air campaign, as
some in Congress have advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials said they were content to
continue retaliating as long as Iraq continued to challenge the
American and British patrols. Appearing before the House's Armed
Services Committee, Cohen said that each time Iraqi forces
threatened the pilots, ``they're going to pay a penalty for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Iraq has withdrawn some of its
surface-to-air missiles _ including Soviet-made SA-2's and SA-3's _
from the ``no flight'' zones in what officials described as an
apparent attempt by the Iraqi military to protect its most potent
weaponry from attacks. Even so, Iraq continues to fire on American
and British jets.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the United States has moved additional aircraft
into the region, including more F-16's and EA-6B's armed with
radar-seeking missiles. There are now roughly 200 American aircraft
patrolling the southern ``no flight'' zone from the Carl Vinson and
from bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and another 40 or so
patrolling the northern zone from a base in Incirlik, Turkey.
Britain has roughly two dozen jets patrolling the two zones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither the United States nor Britain has lost any
pilots or aircraft in the skirmishes. Their tactics are designed,
in part, to limit the possibility as much as possible, by attacking
with long-range missiles and steering clear of attempts by Iraqi
forces to lure jets into what American officials call missile
``traps.''

<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Still, there are military and political risks in this newly
aggressive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at least one American missile missed its intended
target and struck a residential area in southern Iraq, the Pentagon
acknowledged. Iraq claimed that 11 civilians died in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to win over the Arab street, but I think
the international community realizes we're not only taking due
care, but extraordinary care, to minimize collateral damage,'' a
Pentagon official said. Nevertheless, repeated misfires could rally
support for Iraq and stoke lingering animosities toward the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Even Turkey, one of the closest American allies in the region,
has signaled an unease with the continued strikes. Turkey's defense
minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, said on Tuesday in an interview with
Reuters that his country wanted to renegotiate the rules of
engagement for jets operating out of its territory, though he did
not specify what changes were in store. Any new restrictions would
curtail the American-led enforcement of the northern zone.
</P>
<P>
   Martin S. Indyk, the assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, completed a diplomatic swing through the Gulf
region to shore up support for the more aggressive stance. In a
news conference in Dubai on Tuesday, he said that the Arab states
had expressed support for the American view that Iraq needed a new
government, though not one imposed from outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also made clear to us that they prefer that we talk less
and do more, and we agreed with that,'' Indyk said.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is barely 8 in the morning, and Rahm Emanuel,
until recently a top adviser to President Clinton, is already in
high gear, barking at waiters and looking over his shoulder to
inspect others having breakfast at the Royalton Hotel in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be chintzy with the berries,'' he warns a waiter walking
toward the kitchen to pick up his bowl of granola. Later, Emanuel
groans when asked what five words best describe him. ``Oh,
please,'' he said, ``I can't handle this much therapy in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Emanuel acts as if he were still in the White
House. (He mentions more than once how often he still talks with
Clinton.) But Emanuel is now in a world outside Washington, one
where egos, energy and politics are certainly as prominent, but
where they are aimed at a different goal: making money.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he joined the boutique investment banking firm
Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co. to seek his fortune as a merchant banker
and corporate financier in his hometown, Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   For many decades, Washington insiders have been trading in their
powerful contacts and considerable back-room negotiating skills for
lucrative jobs on Wall Street. Clinton's team has been no
different.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Emanuel last fall came at roughly the same time
as that of an even bigger White House heavyweight, Erskine Bowles.
And Bowles, a confidant of Clinton who served most recently as
White House chief of staff, has just joined the New York buyout
firm Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. as a general partner.
</P>
<P>
   The two Clinton allies are a study in contrasts, and they bring
to Wall Street different strengths and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles, 53, was already a wealthy and seasoned banker before
going to Washington in 1993 to head the Small Business
Administration. He had founded an investment bank in North Carolina
that specializes in advising midsized companies. The transition to
Forstmann Little, Wall Street executives say, should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Patience has never been his strong suit, Bowles said. But he is
reserved, adept at melding differing viewpoints and, in keeping
with his Southern roots, courteous and polite.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel, 39, is a corporate novice. A creature of politics, he
is tireless yet brusque. Stories about antics during his younger
years abound. He once delivered a rotting fish to a pollster who
displeased him.
</P>
<P>
   And at a restaurant in Little Rock, Ark., soon after Clinton was
first elected president, Emanuel, checking off a list of people he
thought were disloyal Democrats and other political enemies,
stabbed the table with his knife and screamed, ``Dead!'' after each
name. Emanuel does not deny that either incident took place, but he
declines to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers, of course, are hardly shrinking violets. Yet
rarely are they so theatrical _ at least in public. Still, if
anyone understands how to leverage a strong personality it is Bruce
Wasserstein, the takeover strategist and chairman of Wasserstein
Perella, who hired Emanuel after a literary agent suggested that
the two men meet.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel said he called Wasserstein after talking to several
large investment banks that wanted him to pick a specialty _ asset
management or corporate finance _ and move to New York. Emanuel
resisted. ``I didn't have a sense that three months later they'd
care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel is compact and wiry _ he started taking ballet lessons
when he was 15 _ and is a 1981 graduate of Sarah Lawrence College,
where he studied philosophy. He received a master's degree in
speech and communications from Northwestern University in 1985, and
has no formal background in finance.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating, he worked on several election campaigns,
taking time out in 1991 to volunteer at an Israeli army supply base
during the Persian Gulf war. That same year, Emanuel headed to
Little Rock to raise money for Clinton's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, he joined the White House as political
director. He soon made powerful friends _ and enemies _ in the
media as he championed Clinton's agenda on the talk-show circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel shudders at the thought that deal making is any
different in Washington from in the corporate suite. He cited his
involvement in helping to shuttle the North American Free Trade
Agreement, the assault-weapons ban and the balanced-budget
amendment through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever try to get a congressman to do what you want?''
Emanuel asked. ``I don't think the skill set is so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Good negotiating skills alone, however, do not necessarily
guarantee a long and happy business career. Some former Washington
insiders, like David Stockman, the former Reagan administration
budget director who is now a banker at the New York-based
Blackstone Group, a buyout firm, mastered the transition and
prospered.
</P>
<P>
   For others, Wall Street is just a temporary stomping ground.
Richard Holbrooke, who joined Credit Suisse First Boston as vice
chairman in 1996, is now waiting for his nomination to be the chief
U.S. delegate to the United Nations to be sent to the Senate. (His
appointment was held up by allegations that he violated federal
lobbying laws; he reportedly has agreed to settle the civil charges
without admitting wrongdoing.)
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse is the second tour of duty on Wall Street for
Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 peace accord that ended the
war in Bosnia. He was a managing director for Lehman Brothers from
1984 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest blow for former Washington insiders is often a loss
of prestige. ``If you are powerful in government, people come to
you,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International, who was an aide to former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger and was assistant secretary of state for economic and
business affairs during the Reagan administration. ``Government
contacts have a short shelf life. You have to nurture the old
relationships and build the new.''
</P>
<P>
   And just knowing important people is not enough to merit
applause on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing a deal is everything,'' said Samuel Hayes, a finance
professor at the Harvard Business School. ``If you can close a deal
you are great. If not, you are nothing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who know Emanuel say he is a creative thinker and
extremely loyal, with a keen ability to cut through any
bureaucratic tangle. It was those qualities that swayed
Wasserstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, you take someone with a lot of intelligence, energy and
integrity, and that's attractive to us,'' Wasserstein said. ``I'm
confident in my ability to teach people the technical parts of this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he noted, Emanuel learned a lesson in humility when he
was replaced as White House political director in 1993 after his
abrasiveness offended too many people.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to move to the communications department, but
worked his way back into Clinton's graces and an office next to the
president. ``He fought, came back and learned to do it right,''
Wasserstein said. ``I liked that tenacity, to see the iron hardened
into steel.''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel is not worried about his lack of experience in finance.
He has been in his job only a month, but has been shuttling between
New York and Chicago, meeting with chief executives and business
leaders he encountered during his tenure at the White House as well
as through personal contacts.
</P>
<P>
   He will be responsible in part for developing an investment
banking practice in Chicago _ where he and his wife, Amy, and their
two children live _ that will include advising companies on mergers
and strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles, on the other hand, is an old pro at banking, having
begun his career in 1969 at Morgan Stanley. In 1972, he moved to
Charlotte, N.C., where he later started his own investment banking
firm, Bowles Hollowell Conner &AMP; Co. There he specialized in
advising midsize firms on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years ago, his firm arranged the sale of Kincaid
Furniture, the first company acquired by Forstmann Little, which
buys troubled companies, shores them up and then sells them. Since
then, Bowles Hollowell has done 25 transactions with Forstmann.
Bowles sold his share in the partnership when he moved to
Washington in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the marketing of a company and closing the
transaction,'' he said. ``And I like the money I make.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of North Carolina with an MBA from
Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, Bowles will
bring to Forstmann the same kind of organizational skills he used
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his charge is making sure that the buyout firm's
in-house operations and investment evaluation process are more
efficient, said Theodore Forstmann, the firm's chairman. ``Plus, he
will be helpful in our new business effort,'' Forstmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles will also continue to be involved with Carousel Capital,
the Charlotte-based merchant bank he helped start in 1996.
Forstmann Little is investing $50 million in Carousel, Bowles said,
but the two companies are not likely to compete because Carousel
does not do transactions of more than $150 million and Forstmann
rarely does a deal that small.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles acknowledges that he, unlike Emanuel, never envisioned a
life in politics. ``People ask me all the time `Why aren't you more
political?''' Bowles said. ``I saw my career in politics as public
service.'' In fact, he didn't know Clinton until 1992, when they
were introduced by a mutual friend who asked Bowles to hold a
fund-raiser in Charlotte for the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The two became fast friends, taking to golf outings and
late-night telephone chats. In 1993, Clinton asked Bowles to be
director of the Small Business Administration and then, in 1994, to
work as deputy White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   After that stint, he returned to North Carolina to be with his
wife, Crandall Close Bowles, who, as chief executive of the textile
maker Spring Industries, is a powerful executive in her own right.
He returned to Washington in 1996, when Clinton asked him to be
chief of staff _ a job he accepted for $1 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles does not shy away from discussing Clinton's troubles,
although it is clear by the way his relaxed mood turns frosty that
he is tired of talking about it. ``What he had was a relationship
with Monica Lewinsky that was flat wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles would rather talk about something he accomplished years
before he joined the Clinton White House. What best defines him, he
said, was finishing the Marine Corps marathon in 1982. ``I wanted
to prove to myself I could do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about their experience together in the White House,
Bowles and Emanuel positively gush. ``Did you tell him I said he
had a soft side?'' Bowles asked days after a reporter's breakfast
meeting with Emanuel at the Royalton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that man,'' is what Emanuel said at the breakfast
meeting. ``Erskine is going to kill me for telling you this. We
used to have a 7:30 a.m. meeting and Erskine would sit at one end
of the conference table in his office and I would sit at the other.
Every now and then, when things got a little tense, I would walk
over and give him a little kiss on the forehead.'' He pointed to a
space above his right eyebrow and laughed. ``I promised him I'd
never do that at the country club in Charlotte.''

SOME ANTIBIOTICS MAY REDUCE RISK OF HEART ATTACK, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Minn., Wash.) (sw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certain antibiotics may reduce the risk of heart attack,
researchers are reporting Wednesday in a study that adds to a
growing body of evidence suggesting that chronic infections may
play a role in artery disease, heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers said it was premature to recommend that people
take antibiotics to prevent heart attacks because infections had
not been proved to cause heart disease. And the overuse of
antibiotics has already helped to create dangerous strains of
drug-resistant bacteria that are exceedingly hard to kill.
</P>
<P>
   The latest finding comes from researchers at Boston University
Medical Center, who compared the medical records of 3,315 people
who had suffered heart attacks and 13,139 who had not. Those with
healthy hearts were more likely to have taken certain antibiotics:
tetracycline, which lowered the risk of heart attack by 30 percent,
or quinolones (Ciprofloxacin, Enoxacin and other drugs), which
decreased the risk by 55 percent. Other antibiotics did not reduce
risk.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs that did make a difference were especially effective
against the bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae, a common microbe that
infects the respiratory tract and that many other studies have
linked to heart disease. It can cause pneumonia, bronchitis and
sinus infections, but can also linger in the body without producing
any symptoms at all. It is related to other types of Chlamydial
bacteria that infect the eyes and reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers, whose work is being published on Wednesday
in the Journal of the American Medical Association, stressed that
while the study showed that the drugs were associated with
decreased risk of heart disease, it did not prove that the drugs
caused the lowering of risk. Dr. Herschel Jick, an associate
professor of medicine at Boston University Medical Center in
Lexington, Mass., and leader of the study, warned that people
should not start taking antibiotics to ward off heart attacks.
``It's far from proof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, other research has found evidence of Chlamydia
pneumoniae infection in people with heart disease and in tissue
from diseased arteries, but scientists have not determined whether
the organisms actually cause the disease or just live as ``innocent
bystanders'' in the damaged blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Aaron Folsom, a professor of epidemiology at the University
of Minnesota in Minneapolis who wrote an editorial accompanying the
article, cautioned against acting prematurely on Wednesday's
findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point there's no reason for anybody to be given
antibiotics to prevent coronary heart disease,'' Folsom said in a
telephone interview. ``I'm not convinced any of this is going to
pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it did, he said, he would be concerned that expanding
the use of antibiotics to millions of people at risk for heart
disease might contribute to the development of drug-resistant
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Food and Drug Administration have been
especially worried about the overuse of quinolones because those
drugs are a relatively new class of antibiotic, and if widespread
resistance to them develops, alternatives might be limited, said
Dr. Stephen Sundlof, director of the Center for Veterinary Medicine
and organizer of a recent FDA conference on the problem of
drug-resistant bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Wednesday's study, the American Heart Association
issued a statement in which its president, Dr. Valentin Fuster,
said it was ``much too early to consider prescribing antibiotics to
people at risk for heart attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview, Fuster, who is director of the
cardiovascular institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
New York, said some doctors were already prescribing antibiotics
for patients with heart disease. Other researchers also said
colleagues were prescribing the drugs despite the lack of proof.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's finding that drugs that kill bacteria may also
protect the heart supports an idea that has begun to captivate some
scientists: that certain bacterial infections may linger in the
body for months or years, eating away at the artery walls, causing
inflammation and helping to create lesions and blockages. If that
is the case, the theory goes, eliminating the infection may help
the lesions to heal, or at least keep them from progressing to the
point of causing a heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But the theory represents a departure from medical orthodoxy.
Mainstream research on cardiovascular disease has focused on risk
factors like dietary fat, smoking, high blood pressure and lack of
exercise. If infection does turn out to play a role, it will not
supplant those other risk factors, researchers say, but will just
be added to the list.
</P>
<P>
   Jick and his colleagues set out to test the idea in a large
group they had already studied extensively: three million people in
Britain whose medical records are stored in a computerized data
base. To determine whether infection contributes to heart attack,
they identified people who had had heart attacks even though they
lacked the usual risk factors, and compared each patient to four
other control subjects with similar histories but no heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The finding that the healthy people had used more antibiotics
suggested that infection might be involved in heart disease, the
researchers said. They also said the difference between the two
groups was not due to differences in their use of aspirin, which
can help prevent heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But they said more research was needed to verify the findings.
For one thing, only 8 heart attack victims and 62 control subjects
took quinolones, a small number to base conclusions on. In
addition, the records did not show whether the patients or controls
had ever been infected with Chlamydia. Even if infection did play a
role, other organisms could also have been involved.

   &LR; The interest in the role of infection in coronary disease
developed about 10 years ago, said Dr. J. Thomas Grayston, a
professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Grayston said that 25 or 30 studies had found that people with
diseased coronary or carotid arteries were more likely than others
to show signs of exposure to Chlamydia. In addition, he said,
studies have found the bacteria in specimens taken from diseased
arteries in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's striking to me about this data is that we've
never found the organisms in a normal artery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Grayston emphasized that association did not prove cause and
effect. ``There is no doubt that Chlamydia is associated with
arteriosclerosis,'' he said. ``The cutting edge now is to find out
if this association has any causal effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ward Kennedy, a cardiologist at the Department of Veterans
Affairs hospital in Seattle and a professor of medicine at the
University of Washington, said researchers hoped to answer the
question with a study scheduled to begin with signing up subjects
at 28 medical centers around the country next month. Participants
will be 4,000 people with heart disease, who will be assigned at
random to take either placebos or one antibiotic tablet a week, for
one year. Then they will be followed for three to four years, and
the incidence of heart attack and other heart problems will be
tracked.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said he thought the risk that resistant bacteria might
develop from such long-term exposure to the antibiotics was small.
``We think it's worth the risk,'' he said, ``because the question
is so important.''

 Jeff MacGregor worked in the television industry for 20 years as
writer, producer and network correspondent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I have always been suspicious of third-party praise. In my youth
I developed the habit of caution when it came to anything that
arrived in our house too highly thought of by others, especially by
strangers. This, I realize now, was largely the result of my
grandmother's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a little shaver I lived for a few years in a big,
quiet Ohio house with my recently widowed grandmother. Both of us
being red-haired, single and unemployed back then (I was 4), we had
plenty of time to dote on each other.
</P>
<P>
   For me this meant sharing with Grandma whatever I managed to
snare or step on or dig up in the backyard. She accepted every
papery snakeskin or smooth gray stone, every handful of tadpoles,
with the same dignified ``thank you'' and an admirably straight
face.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, my grandmother cooked and cooked. Food and love
were synonymous. Trouble was, Grandma being quite a nut for the
movies, many of her recipes came from the Hollywood fanzines of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was I always sitting down to meals (concocted, no doubt, by
publicists) that had first appeared as pictorial filler in the
star-struck pages of Photoplay, Modern Screen or TV Guide. Sadly,
Dorothy Provine's Can't-Miss Waldorf Salad or Sal Mineo's
Never-Fail Swiss Fondue often did, rarely turning out as promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have left something out,'' Grandma would say as we
grimly spooned our way through a glutinous bowl of Claude Rains'
Five-Alarm Chili or sawed through another panel of Donna Reed's
Onion Pot Roast Francaise. It was like living in hell's test
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Still hungry, scraping another failed casserole into the trash,
Grandma was likely to turn to me with a look of utter, earnest
bewilderment and say: ``I don't understand it. Audrey Meadows
absolutely (italics)swears(end italics) by this dish whenever she
entertains.'' It made her sad to think she was letting me _ or
Audrey Meadows _ down.
</P>
<P>
   Hence my adult skepticism regarding the kind of
undercorroborated endorsements that come streaming out of Hollywood
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most colorful of which surround ABC's new
prime-time comedy ``Sports Night.'' It is this season's critical
darling, a chance to gush and bubble for television reviewers
everywhere. It gets the Golden Local Double-Thumps-Up or the
National Platinum Five-Star A-Plus in everything from The Denver
Post to Elle to The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mild disappointment only in the Nielsen ratings, where
it finished a lukewarm 53rd the last week of January. For all the
laudatory newspaper and magazine copy filed about ``Sports Night''
since last fall, an actual viewing audience doesn't seem to have
caught the fever yet.
</P>
<P>
   The show's premise is simple enough. We're behind the scenes at
a late-night sports-highlight show just like ESPN's
``Sportscenter.'' For 30 minutes minus commercials, we wend our way
from production office to control room and back again, auditing the
snappy badinage of smart, confused, ambitious people who all have
better jobs than we do.
</P>
<P>
   It is a language-driven show, one of the few on the air, and
even though not much happens or seems to be at stake in any given
episode, all the characters involved know their way around the
pointy end of a joke and have the wits to discard a throwaway line
before it goes off in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The offbeat visualization of the show has been widely noted by
television writers as well. With long tracking shots that follow
characters around the set or the accelerated intercutting of
stranger-than-average camera angles, the show's breakneck verbal
pace is matched and then furthered by what we see.
</P>
<P>
   The director Thomas Schlamme (a veteran of the late, lamented
``Larry Sanders Show'') has quite successfully borrowed and applied
techniques first used in film and television drama.
</P>
<P>
   The ensemble cast is as good as the big-city critics and
small-town media mahatmas say it is. The leads _ Josh Charles,
Peter Krause, Felicity Huffman and Robert Guillaume, playing the
show's co-anchors, producer and executive producer, respectively _
are all fine actors and often manage to disguise the fact that
there's less here than meets the eye or ear. Therein lies the
problem with the show and the mountain of praise that my colleagues
have heaped on it since before it had its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been said and made of the program's split personality
(for which the onerous neologism ``dramedy'' has once again been
dusted off and trotted out), but even the most glowing reviews of
``Sports Night'' acknowledge its bad appetite for the clanking,
anti-comic monologues that pop up like noisy clockwork week after
week.
</P>
<P>
   These sermonizing non sequiturs are gussied up to read as moral
complication and seem to be the specialty/Achilles' heel of the
show's creator and head writer, Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin, who made his
bones in the legitimate theater and feature-film business with ``A
Few Good Men'' (a play and movie that could just as easily be
called ``One Good Scene''), has lately been embraced by television
analysts as nothing short of the second coming of Preston Sturges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Sorkin's ear for the syncopated patter of
the workplace wisecrack is excellent. I'm not sure what that
serves, though, in the context of the show. Missing from the
complex rhythms of his wordplay is a discernible point of view. And
a heart.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a show about the post-modern crises of modern character?
Is it a satire meant to subvert our devotion to big sports or big
media? Or is it just another half-hour of reconfigured comedy
television in a more stylish package?
</P>
<P>
   If this show is as ``pulse-quickening'' as Entertainment Weekly
says it is, why does it seem so airless, so contrived? Perhaps the
lack of oxygen creates vascular discomfort. There is something
clinical about this show, as if different theatrical elements were
being combined in a laboratory to judge their interaction.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Guillaume's character, everyone rattles
off quips as if they were being paid by the word. Worse yet, they
all sound the same, have the same mordant sense of humor. And
nothing seems to be at risk in any given episode. Not even the
characters' feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The central conflict of the show, the unfulfilled romantic
attraction between Casey and Dana ( Krause and Ms. Huffman), is
canned heat at best. It is a structural need only, an ancient
architectural chestnut of the sitcom form. It would make perfect
sense for them to be together, except that Sorkin needs to keep
them apart or there would be nothing to write about at all.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have been generous in not mentioning any of this.
Choosing instead to debate the merits of the show's on-again,
off-again laugh track, no one has put much thought into whether or
not the show is even very funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make me laugh out loud, but silently, to myself,
inside my head,'' says one magazine writer in a spectacular display
of cutesy illogic.
</P>
<P>
   Even in a good year, television criticism can be a pretty dismal
business for a writer like me. More preview these days than review,
most print critics watch two episodes and read a show's press kit
before cranking out 500 cranky words the day before it has its
premiere. It is a volume industry in which the product is compared
only with itself.
</P>
<P>
   Like a USDA sausage inspector, one is only rarely called upon to
judge actual excellence; most of the time you're simply trying to
prevent a mass outbreak of gastrointestinal distress. The swift
cancellation of UPN's ``Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' proves,
though, that such hygienic safeguards can and must be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   This also explains much of the hype surrounding ``Sports
Night''; for critics, it is a glass half full in a dry season. But
even television writers are human. Perhaps Sorkin has unwittingly
built a show that is not just critic-proof but is, in fact,
critic-driven and plays on the comic fantasies of the average
editorial drone.
</P>
<P>
   What corporate newsroom employee doesn't want to see himself or
herself as a witty defender of the intellect? As a smooth,
unflappable professional, ever ready with a sly wisecrack and a
seductive smile? A sort of James Bond with a notebook and a No. 2
pencil, graceful as Nijinsky and smart as a wagonload of monkeys,
even under the long, black shadow of another looming deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The many recurring references to the classic newsroom movie
``His Girl Friday'' in the reviews are a dead giveaway; critics
want more than anything to see (italics)themselves(end italics) in
this show.
</P>
<P>
   Overheated and undercooked, missing a few key ingredients,
``Sports Night'' is another entry in the series of small
disappointments and mysterious little failures my grandmother
taught me long ago to expect from Hollywood.

   WASHINGTON _ For their viewing comfort and convenience, senators
could see it on a large screen or a small one, using individual
headphones or communal speakers, in subterranean hideaways in the
bowels of the Capitol or in less remote, more formal meeting rooms
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   They could take in the whole epic, ``Titanic''-like, in a
sitting of roughly four hours, or they could divide it, like a
television mini-series, into less demanding installments. They
could attend at a set show time, along with several colleagues, or
dictate their own.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of those permutations and accommodations, ``Monica:
The Movie'' was a rather disappointing draw. Maybe it was the
overexposure of the star, maybe the exhaustion of the target
audience, maybe the absence of a decent concession stand. But by
midafternoon Tuesday, it seemed that most senators had not yet made
time to watch the videotape of Monica Lewinsky's deposition, by
some accounts more remake than sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Some did not even plan to watch it, at least not right away.
``Today is my 40th wedding anniversary, and I want to have dinner
with my wife,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., explaining why he
would skip the drama for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Others were having the deposition, tape-recorded on Monday,
prescreened for them by staff members who had been asked, much like
film critics, to render a review. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,
said around midday that he would not see the tape until later in
the afternoon, by which time he expected to have a synopsis of the
highlights from an aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to give me counsel whether I should watch it
all,'' Lieberman said, ``or whether there are particular parts I
should fast-forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, on the first day that the videotape of Ms.
Lewinsky's deposition was available to the 100 men and women who
will decide President Clinton's fate, they did not exactly storm
the box offices of Cineplex Senate, where the deposition was being
shown simultaneously at four Capitol locations.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning screening in the Appropriations room on the main
floor, which offered the largest screen, only three senators _
Republicans Richard Shelby of Alabama, Susan Collins of Maine and
Orrin Hatch of Utah _ were spotted entering and leaving the
makeshift theater.
</P>
<P>
   At two afternoon screenings in a divided basement room, where
Part 1 of the deposition was playing on one television set and Part
2 on another, it appeared that the combined audience totaled fewer
than half a dozen aides.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., strode by on his way to what he said
was a more appealing venue: the Senate recording studio, also in
the basement, where there were 10 television sets, videocassette
recorders, sets of controls and headphones. ``You have your own
individual monitor in there,'' Cochran noted appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   Those senators who had seen all or some of the tape, which may
or may not be made public later this week, were generally
tight-lipped or vague about its content and value. Some of their
reactions, however, betrayed the kind of surprise people often
experience when they get an extended, up-close view of a celebrity
whose appearances have been fleeting. ``Monica looked
breathtakingly young,'' Ms. Collins marveled.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who watched the video in the basement
recording studio, acknowledged afterward that he and several
colleagues had not been exactly riveted. ``A couple of us visited
back and forth during the dull moments,'' Craig said, adding that
they had had only conversation _ and not any refreshments _ to
swap.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, also noted this federal snack
deficit. ``Someone did say to me, `Where's the popcorn?,' ''
Grassley said.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the Foreign Relations room, senators had the option
of their own television sets, and those lawmakers with the
requisite dexterity could consult transcripts of the deposition and
speed the tape forward or backward to key moments.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said this activity made for a
memorable and somewhat disorienting tableau. ``It's unusual to see
eight United States senators with headsets on, pushing dials,
rolling it backward and forward,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the whole concept of compulsory _ or, rather, highly
recommended _ viewing seemed to put many senators in a jocular
frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Asked around 2 p.m. whether he had been to the movies yet, Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, replied, ``Is `Private Ryan' coming back?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton Tuesday traveled to Boston in hopes
of sparking a debate in Congress over his education reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   In this ``golden moment for our economy ... nothing is more
important than giving our children a world-class education,''
Clinton said during a visit to the Jackson-Mann Elementary School
in the city's Allston section.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred students, parents, teachers and community
officials packed the school's gymnasium to hear Clinton tout his
proposal to tie federal funding for school districts and states to
the performance of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   He explained his ideas for ending the practice of social
promotions and requiring new teachers to pass competency tests and
have the credentials to teach in their subject area.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wants school districts to issue report cards on
every school as a condition for receiving a share of the roughly
$15 billion in federal funding for public education.
</P>
<P>
   ```Believe me, this will be very controversial,'' Clinton said,
adding, ``$15 billion is not chump change.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate took testimony for his impeachment trial from
his friend and confidant, Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, Clinton
basked in a warm reception from audiences who turned out in chilly,
wet weather to see him as he moved about the city, blending
education policy with Democratic fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   Though the crowds were selectively chosen and appeared smaller
than during some of his past visits, they were no less
enthusiastic. Before his school appearance, about 500 Democratic
Party activists showered Clinton with applause at a fundraising
tribute to outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Steven
Grossman, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first visit to Boston since the House voted to
impeach him, and his first fundraising trip of the year. After
joking at the education event that Boston had stolen its schools
superintendent, Thomas Payzant, from the US Department of
Education, the president added, ``I forgive you for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have given a lot more to me than you have taken,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday Boston seemed to find more to give.
</P>
<P>
   From the time Air Force One touched down at Logan International
Airport, shortly after 11 a.m., until it departed six hours later
for New York _ where he was to attend a million-dollar Democratic
fundraiser Tuesday night _ Clinton was surrounded by a who's who
list of the Commonwealth's Democratic Party. Even the demonstrators
mostly cut his way.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who stood by as the president's motorcade left Logan
were the exception. They held handmade signs that said ``liar'' and
``resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than anti-Clinton protesters, the president arrived at
the Park Plaza Hotel to find three small groups of demonstrators:
one protesting evictions in local buildings owned by Democratic
activist Elaine Schuster, another protesting continuing economic
sanctions on Iraq, and a third holding a banner that said, ``Save
Clinton, impeach Gore'' and warning Republicans that in the 2000
election ``...we will remember.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's motorcade cruised to a stop in front of the hotel,
several demonstrators shouted, ``Save Clinton, Jail Starr,'' in
reference to independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, whose
investigation led to Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, Clinton took time to have a photograph taken
with former Boston University hockey player Travis Roy, who was
paralyzed in 1995 during his first college game.
</P>
<P>
   At the Grossman tribute, Clinton helped raise $700,000 for the
Democratic Party. About 80 people paid $10,000 each for a lunch of
sea bass, mixed green salad and marscapone pastry with
strawberries, while another 500 guests settled for a reception with
chicken caesar salad, petit fours and assorted cookies for $250 per
person.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster, one of the co-chairs for the fundraising tribute,
called Clinton the ``most outstanding president since Franklin
Roosevelt.''
</P>
<P>
   After trumpeting his administration's successes and outlining
its agenda, Clinton said, ``Massachusetts, as much as any place,
Boston as much as any city in America, gave this administration the
chance to bring that hope, that message and that reality to the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at the school, the president said he has been frustrated
for 20 years with the status quo in education. ``Can you imagine
any company spending $15 billion and saying, `Here, take the money;
we don't care what the results are, and come back next year and
I'll write you another check,''' he said, illiciting chuckles.
</P>
<P>
   Tackling head-on the criticism by some Republicans that his
education plan would usurp control of local schools, Clinton said,
``You will not find anybody who is more reluctant to micro-manage
the schools than me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said, ``I don't think any child in America should be
passed from grade to grade without knowing the material. I don't
think we're doing children a favor. I don't think any child should
be trapped in a failing school without a strategy to turn the
school around or give the kid a way out.''
</P>
<P>
   For his education speech, Clinton was joined on stage by
Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry and Representative
Jim McGovern, Democrat of Worcester, rode on Air Force One with
Clinton from Washington. Among those kept waiting some 20 minutes
to greet the president after the plane landed were Mayor Thomas
Menino and three other members of the Massachusetts congressional
delegation, Democratic Representatives Michael Capuano of
Somerville, J. Joseph Moakley of South Boston and Martin Meehan of
Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry and Clinton spoke intensely and at length, though it was
not known whether they were discussing presidential politics, as
Kerry mulls a run for president. That conversation seemed to have
no end. As Clinton was being introduced at the DNC fundraiser, he

JUST WHO IS SIDNEY BLU MENTHAL? PHOENIX WON DERS 
</HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX _ Carol Fairfax lets out a tiny gasp and clutches her
bag to her chest.
</P>
<P>
   She's just stepped off the escalator at Nordstrom in Scottsdale
when I stop her and ask if she's ever heard the name Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God. Don't tell me. Is he a new designer? I love new
lines. Tell me where I can find his stuff,'' she pleads. ``You are
talking about a designer, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Fairfax is disappointed when I inform her that Blumenthal is not
a clothing designer, but rather a White House aide, who will be
deposed today in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   I am on a mission to find Phoenix-arearesidents who have heard
of Sidney Blumenthal and know who he is. Practically everyone is
familiar with Monica Lewinsky and Vernon Jordan _ the other two
witnesses who were summoned by House prosecutors _ and their role
in the impeachment trial. But I am finding it difficult to locate
people who have heard of Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   At a construction site in Mountain Park Ranch in the East
Valley, workers eat their lunch and toss out a few ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sounds like a developer to me,'' guesses Bob Quinn, of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he one of those custom builders?'' offers David Monroe, who
lives in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be such idiots,'' says Morgan Hopper. ``He's that killer
who has been in the news.''
</P>
<P>
   I take my search to the YMCA downtown during the lunch hour.
While on the treadmill, I ask my workout partners if they have
heard of Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   A man who has drenched his U2 T-shirt asks if Blumenthal is an
investor or stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Davis believes she's heard the name before, possibly on
some newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was he one of the Phoenix Open golfers? They were all over the
networks,'' she says, adjusting the treadmill to a steep incline.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rhodes, who watches his 16-month-old son toddle around a
nearby mall while his wife shops for shoes, also is convinced
Blumenthal is a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got back from the Phoenix Open, and I think I saw his
name somewhere,'' says Rhodes, before dashing off to catch his son.
</P>
<P>
   At the movie theater, a car repair shop, various lunch spots,
playgrounds and other places around the Valley, I search for a
correct answer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I get shots in the dark:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Football player. Movie director. Author. Teacher. Movie critic.
Millionaire. A gay Las Vegas performer.
</P>
<P>
   After two days, I finally have found someone who knows Sidney
Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I know who he is. How can you miss him? He's all
over the television stations and newspapers talking about President
Clinton's impeachment trial,'' says Tom Strasser, while sitting
outside the Coffee Plantation in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Then, taking a sip of coffee, he looks at me and asks: ``He's
one of the president's attorneys, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Nope.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For those who don't know, Blumenthal &UR; has worked in a windowless
office inside the White House since summer 1997.
</P>
<P>
   There, he labors on matters as varied as State of the Union
speeches, press freedom in Argentina and Turkey and a presidential
bid to highlight the coming millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has strong ties not only to the president but to
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. News reports claim he speaks
with her a couple of times a day on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Before embarking on a political career, he was a reporter for
the ``Washington Post,'' the ``New Republic''and the ``New
Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But many of you probably already knew this.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano is taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.
Amparano can be reached at 444-8394 or at julie.amparano(at)pni.com

SOME COLLEGES ARE TRIMMING TUITION COSTS

<P>
   Marlboro College, a small liberal arts campus in Vermont, has
just announced an 8 percent cut in tuition and fees and no increase
in room and board for freshmen who arrive next fall. The students
will pay $26,410 instead of $27,810.
</P>
<P>
   Muskingum College, in New Concord, Ohio, got fed up with doling
out more financial aid every time the college raised tuition fees,
so it slashed tuition by $4,000, a 29 percent drop to $9,850, from
$13,850.
</P>
<P>
   And although Dartmouth College didn't exactly eviscerate
tuition, it held the line at an increase of only 3.9 percent for
the current academic year, its smallest increase in 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not necessarily a trend. The great majority of
colleges and universities have been raising their costs even faster
than inflation for at least two decades. But a handful of schools
say they feel the pain of middle-class and working-class parents
and have responded. And some academic officials say it could be a
stirring of significance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the leaders of the movement are the state university
systems in Massachusetts and California. Virginia is likely to join
them. For three consecutive years, the five-campus University of
Massachusetts has scaled back tuition and fees for in-state
students, from $4,969 in fiscal 1996 to $4,727 in fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997 the nine-campus University of California system has
reduced tuition and fees for in-state students to $3,609 from
$3,700. Costs at the less expensive California State University
were cut 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in December, Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia proposed an
across-the-board cut of 20 percent in tuition and fees for all
in-state students at public colleges and universities. Since the
state's economy is booming, the chances of passage by the Virginia
General Assembly in this session are considered excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say whether it's a trend,'' said Terry
Hartle, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, the
Washington lobbying organization. ``But any time you get
Massachusetts and California involved, you've got some very visible
states.''
</P>
<P>
   These colleges and universities are reacting as they see some
financially hard-pressed parents and their children increasingly
shying away from relatively expensive private colleges and instead
choosing less expensive public institutions or, in some cases,
giving up on higher education altogether.
</P>
<P>
   How do these campuses do it? Aren't they just as financially
stressed as the others that keep raising their prices?
</P>
<P>
   Paul LeBlanc, president of Marlboro College, said that two and a
half years ago when he was given his job, the trustees instructed
him to be ``aggressively entrepreneurial,'' which meant finding
things the college could do to generate new sources of revenue in
order to hold down or even reduce what students were being charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the business ventures we spun off, called the Design
Center, which utilized both faculty and students,'' LeBlanc said,
``won the contract to design the state of Vermont's new Web site
for tourism, and that and other similar projects have generated
more than $100,000.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Educational institutions have to learn to do things outside
their usual boundaries,'' LeBlanc continued. ``That's what will
enable them to reduce costs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   James Wright, the president of Dartmouth, said he has been able
to resist runaway tuition with a series of efforts to ``reallocate
existing resources.'' One of the most successful of these efforts,
he said, has been to allow alumni donors to lend their names to
scholarships of as little as $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also using more of our unrestricted endowment for
financial aid,'' he said. ``That was one of my first priorities
when I became president last August.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of these well-intended efforts are successful. Last
fall, Tuition Credit Exchange, a national organization that
attempted to resist the relentless rise of college costs by
``selling'' tuition credits to the parents or friends of even very
young college-bound children, closed its doors for lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Higdon, a former president of Graceland College, in Lamoni,
Iowa, who served as an executive of the credit exchange, said: ``We
stirred up a lot of interest, but ran up against the natural
conservatism of people when faced with a totally new concept. But
the idea of beginning the family effort to marshal resources for
college costs over a period of years instead of in just four years
is a good one and has a future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s there was little growth, if any, in college prices
beyond the rate of inflation. Since 1980, however, college prices
have been soaring at twice and sometimes three times the Consumer
Price Index.
</P>
<P>
   Over the 10-year period ending in 1998-99, after adjusting for
inflation, the average public tuition and fees at public colleges
went up 53 percent, and it went up 35 percent for private four-year
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980-81 school year, tuition at both public and
private four-year institutions increased at more than twice the
rate of inflation, on average. Private college tuition rose most
sharply in the early and mid-1980s, while public tuition increased
the most in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the efforts of places like Marlboro and Muskingum,
the pressure to raise costs is still intense, said Jack Joyce, a
spokesman for the College Board responsible for the organization's
annual survey Trends in College Pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are hard pressed to keep costs down, he said, because
they are faced not only with constant needs such as raising faculty
salaries and maintaining aging buildings, labs and libraries, but
also in recent years have been pressed to meet ``student demands
and expectations for a wired campus that includes the new
technology required for modern communication.''

FORMER MORTICIAN `SNAPPED' WHEN HE KILLED 81-YEAR-OLD FRIEND,
ATTORNEY SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ Death was Bernie Tiede's business.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the best morticians the Northeast Texas town of
Carthage had ever seen. He was a lay preacher, too, and a fine
tenor in the Methodist choir. Above all, he was a friend to little
old ladies.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Tiede went on trial for murder _ charged with
shooting his best friend, an 81-year-old millionaire widow, four
times in the back and stashing her body in the freezer. If
convicted, Tiede, 40, will face up to 99 years in prison and up to
$10,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   The Teddy bearish one-time undertaker's case has Jekyll-and-Hyde
aspects. It's divided his home community, and already ended in one
mistrial after Panola County authorities in Carthage couldn't find
an impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   Panola District Attorney Danny ``Buck'' Davidson on Tuesday cut
through the confusion in his opening statement in San Augustine,
where the trial has been moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a simple case,'' he told jurors. ``The central theme
you'll see is greed and love of money _ the root of all evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Clifton ``Scrappy'' Holmes countered that ``the
evidence will not show, demonstrate, indicate that greed was the
motive for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Longview lawyer insisted, evidence will show that
Marjorie Nugent, who had made Tiede her bookkeeper, business
manager and traveling companion, became a possessive tyrant who
hectored the gentle mortician until he ``snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 19th day of November (1996), Bernie Tiede was like a
kite without a string,'' his lawyer said. ``He was concerned,
wounded, upset, frightened. On the 18th day of August (1997, after
his arrest) it all fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiede confessed to authorities, but Holmes insisted that his
client's mind was ``like a bowl of spaghetti'' the day he admitted
his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the evidence,'' the defense attorney said, ``you're going
to find that Tiede killed Mrs. Nugent. But the evidence doesn't
stop there. You will find all kinds of reasons, explanations for
that conduct. But you're not going to find from the evidence that
the conduct was out of greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses testified Tuesday that Tiede seemed in financial
straits when he arrived in Carthage in 1985 to go to work at the
Hawthorn Funeral Home.
</P>
<P>
   Don Lipsey, who then owned the mortuary, said Internal Revenue
Service agents visited the business in search of the young
mortician, and a woman repeatedly telephoned to harangue Tiede
about an unpaid debt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lipsey said, Tiede rapidly established himself as a
talented funeral director.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1990, he handled services for millionaire oil man Rod
Nugent, and quickly ingratiated himself with Nugent's widow. Within
a relatively short time, Lipsey testified, Tiede was seen squiring
the aged woman around town.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, Tiede had become Nugent's traveling companion, visiting
New York, London, Germany and other destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talk in town,'' Lipsey testified, with some people
gossiping that Tiede and Nugent had shared the same room on their
trips. On one occasion, Lipsey said he found Tiede in Dallas with
Nugent when he should have been on call with the funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   He finally told Tiede to choose between his job or his
association with Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone cannot work for my funeral home and be off with
someone he's not married to doing whatever they are doing,'' Lipsey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede chose Nugent, and soon became her bookkeeper and business
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Steptoe, a Carthage jeweler, testified that shortly after
Rod Nugent's death, his widow brought his $7,000 gold Rolex
wristwatch in for servicing. Steptoe testified she told him it was
to be a gift for Tiede.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the widow's friends and employees were concerned about
about her relationship with Tiede.
</P>
<P>
   Angelo Rowe, who cared for the Nugent farm at Old Center,
complained that Tiede salaciously brushed his body against the
elderly woman's on one occasion. And the old woman ``began to buy
lingerie no 75-year-old woman would wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Holmes contended that Marjorie Nugent was
notoriously irascible. As her association with Tiede progressed, he
told jurors, she became increasingly difficult. ``If he was 10
minutes late in coming to make her coffee in the morning,'' he
said, ``she would call around to his friends, hunting him down.''
</P>
<P>
   In his confession, Tiede contended Nugent had ``become very
hateful. She had become very possessive over my life. She was ...
evil and wicked. But I still cared for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witnesses varied on their assessment of Nugent's
personality. She was ``straight-forward,'' opined Maureen Gray, who
worked as a housekeeper for the family. Another housekeeper, Janice
Fausett, described both the Nugents as ``very loving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she basically was shy,'' said her hair dresser, Billy
Viticalos, who saw her almost weekly. ``She was shy, that's why a
lot of people thought she came across as stuck up.''
</P>
<P>
   Viticalos said he had traded heated words on several occasions
with his client. ``She was strong-willed,'' he said. ``You
definitely knew where you stood with her. You had to stand your
ground. People of means _ they will definitely step on you if you
let them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he liked Marjorie Nugent and the young man who had become
her escort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to plays in New York. They went to London.
They both talked to me about it. She was having the time of her
life. I don't think she had done all that much traveling. Bernie
took real good care of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Interjected Davidson: ``If Bernie had plans to kill her, would
you still say he `took real good care of her?'''
</P>
<P>
   Viticalos hesitated, then said, ``Up to a point.''

 &HT;    Ohio teachers aim to take control of classes
 &HT;    By Joanne Huist Smith and Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ One student likes to throw scissors across the
classroom. Another lies on the classroom floor every morning and
screams. Some repeatedly call teachers names or curse.
</P>
<P>
   Though most children come to class ready to learn, Lebanon
teacher Sara Oeder has heard dozens of horror stories about
unmanageable students.
</P>
<P>
   Oeder and a group of Warren County, educators and business
leaders think it's time teachers reclaim control in their
classrooms. They propose a change in Ohio law that would grant
teachers more power to punish unruly students without fear of legal
action for enforcing discipline.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. George Terwilleger (R-Maineville), drafted a bill
based on the Warren proposal and introduced it in the Ohio House of
Representatives with sponsorship from nine additional legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the bill was assigned to the Civil and Commercial
Committee. Committee hearings on the issue should begin Feb. 10 or
17.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jami Callender (R-Willowick), a member of the House
Education Committee and bill co-sponsor, said he doesn't foresee
any major roadblocks for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Callender anticipates the bill will pass in 1999, providing
legislators don't get bogged down on the higher priority issue of
deregulation of electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed law includes seven forms of acceptable discipline.
Teachers would be permitted to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Verbally discipline a student.
</P>
<P>
   _ Physically isolate a student within the teacher's classroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Withhold one or more privileges from a student.
</P>
<P>
   _ Temporarily or permanently remove a student from the teacher's
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use physically harmless props to discipline a student.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exercise disciplinary measures that do not rise to the level
of corporal punishment and are reasonably calculated to maintain
decorum, discipline, or order in the teacher's classroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Refuse to admit or readmit a student into the classroom if the
teacher determines the student has an unreformed history of
behavior that has disrupted or otherwise distracted from the
learning environment.
</P>
<P>
   Terwilleger emphasized the proposed law wouldn't authorize a
teacher to use corporal punishment while it ``would help protect
teachers from harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, teachers would be free from disciplinary
action or liability in a civil lawsuit if they use the seven
permissible discipline measures.
</P>
<P>
   Northmont Superintendent Gale Mabry said he would need to know
more details about the proposed law, but he noted that classroom
control is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're spending time on discipline and not on instruction,
too much of the class is penalized,'' Mabry said.
</P>
<P>
   He said parents must be firm in their discipline and support the
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators also need to support the teacher, said Joyce
Fulwiler Shawhan, who heads the Dayton Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline is something that's on the mind of everyone, every
day in the schools. Rules have to be enforced, there has to be
consistency,'' Fulwiler Shawhan said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's Kemp Elementary Principal Burton Thompson believes
teachers already have great latitude in disciplining students. He
said removing children from the classroom is problematic unless
there is somewhere for them to go. That is why he supports
in-school suspension rooms, staffed by teachers, counselors and
social workers. He also wants ``time-out'' places. Right now the
only place he can put students for time-out is in his office.

 &HT;    Lack of care, drugs problem for HIV-positive
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (l) Lifestyle and (a) General News categories.)
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Lack of access to quality medical care and expensive
drugs for people with HIV is a significant problem in the United
States, especially among minorities, and up to half of the nation's
HIV-infected people are not under a doctor's care, AIDS experts
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must attack the unacceptable disparities in care,'' said
Dr. Samuel Bozzette of the University of California, San Diego. He
presented the first national study of HIV costs and use of services
Tuesday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections in Chicago, a scientific meeting of top AIDS experts.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 650,000
to 900,000 people in the United States are HIV-positive, with
40,000 new infections per year. The HIV cost study, which was
funded by public and private sources, concludes that about 335,000
people with HIV are under medical supervision. Many of the
remainder, experts speculated, may not know they've been infected
or face barriers to care.
</P>
<P>
   The odds for survival are much worse for those without regular
care, and they include a disproportionate number of
African-Americans and Hispanics _ the groups showing rapid rises in
HIV infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deficient care is not equally distributed across
populations,'' Bozzette said. ``Access to care is unequal in the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, AIDS researchers have been criticized for tending to
emphasize treatments affordable only to wealthy nations such as the
United States. Of the roughly 33 million people worldwide who are
HIV-positive, more than 90 percent live in underdeveloped countries
with little or no access to basic health care, let alone costly
anti-HIV drugs. This points up the need for greater AIDS prevention
efforts and development of an AIDS vaccine, some say.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs do make a difference, as shown by recent decreases in
AIDS deaths. In many cases, they can delay or prevent HIV from
progressing to full-blown AIDS. But many can't afford HIV drugs.
Some have jobs but don't have insurance. Others can't meet the
co-payments _ a year's worth of drugs averages $10,000-$15,000 _ or
don't meet state criteria for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzette urged more government funding for those who fall
between the health care cracks. This year, Georgia's Department of
Medical Assistance requested $2.8 million for an extension of
Medicaid to provide care for 1,000 HIV-positive people ineligible
for aid.
</P>
<P>
   The extended program must first be approved by a federal waiver,
which could take at least a year. Meanwhile, Gov. Roy Barnes
elected instead to add $1.8 million to the state's AIDS Drug
Assistance Program until the waiver is granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we do obtain the waiver, we will be able to offer a
narrow basket of services to HIV-infected persons, from drug
therapy to access to primary care,'' said Margaret Taylor, DMA's
chief deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   But the additional $1.8 million, which will fund HIV drugs for
200 Georgians, still leaves 1,100 more on ADAP's waiting list, said
Jeff Graham, executive director of the AIDS Survival Project.

 &HT;    Lack of care, drugs problem for HIV-positive
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (l) Lifestyle and (a) General News categories.)
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Lack of access to quality medical care and expensive
drugs for people with HIV is a significant problem in the United
States, especially among minorities, and up to half of the nation's
HIV-infected people are not under a doctor's care, AIDS experts
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must attack the unacceptable disparities in care,'' said
Dr. Samuel Bozzette of the University of California, San Diego. He
presented the first national study of HIV costs and use of services
Tuesday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections in Chicago, a scientific meeting of top AIDS experts.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 650,000
to 900,000 people in the United States are HIV-positive, with
40,000 new infections per year. The HIV cost study, which was
funded by public and private sources, concludes that about 335,000
people with HIV are under medical supervision. Many of the
remainder, experts speculated, may not know they've been infected
or face barriers to care.
</P>
<P>
   The odds for survival are much worse for those without regular
care, and they include a disproportionate number of
African-Americans and Hispanics _ the groups showing rapid rises in
HIV infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deficient care is not equally distributed across
populations,'' Bozzette said. ``Access to care is unequal in the
U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, AIDS researchers have been criticized for tending to
emphasize treatments affordable only to wealthy nations such as the
United States. Of the roughly 33 million people worldwide who are
HIV-positive, more than 90 percent live in underdeveloped countries
with little or no access to basic health care, let alone costly
anti-HIV drugs. This points up the need for greater AIDS prevention
efforts and development of an AIDS vaccine, some say.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs do make a difference, as shown by recent decreases in
AIDS deaths. In many cases, they can delay or prevent HIV from
progressing to full-blown AIDS. But many can't afford HIV drugs.
Some have jobs but don't have insurance. Others can't meet the
co-payments _ a year's worth of drugs averages $10,000-$15,000 _ or
don't meet state criteria for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzette urged more government funding for those who fall
between the health care cracks. This year, Georgia's Department of
Medical Assistance requested $2.8 million for an extension of
Medicaid to provide care for 1,000 HIV-positive people ineligible
for aid.
</P>

 &HT;    The success of assisted reproductive techniques on the rise
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (l) Lifestyle and (a) General News
categories.)By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In-vitro fertilization and other techniques helped
produce more than 20,000 babies in 1996 and the good news for
infertile couples is that the success rate is rising, researchers
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of live births due to assisted reproductive
techniques jumped from 4,591 in 1989 to 20,659 in 1996 _ an
increase of 448 percent, according to the Society for Assisted
Reproductive Technology, which co-produced the study with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Twins, triplets and other multiple births accounted for more
than a third of those births reported in 1996, the latest year for
which CDC has complete information.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are significant numbers,'' said Dr. David Adamson,
president of SART. ``The vast majority of couples can be helped by
these technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Since England's ``Baby Louise'' became the world's first ``test
tube baby'' in 1978, Adamson said, at least 100,000 infants have
been born in America thanks to assisted reproductive technologies,
and perhaps 250,000 globally.
</P>
<P>
   Success rates are increasing at about 3 percent a year as word
spreads that procedures are becoming more sophisticated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The SART survey of 300 of the nation's top fertility clinics
found that multiple births accounted for about 38 percent of the
live births resulting from assisted technologies in 1996, compared
to 22.4 percent in 1989, Adamson said. About 3 percent of all
births are multiples occurring naturally.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular techniques include in-virtro fertilization,
where eggs are fertilized with sperm in a laboratory dish and the
embryo is inserted into the uterus, and other methods that combine
sperm and egg inside and outside a woman's body.
</P>
<P>
   About 1 in 10 couples are infertile. For many, the high-tech
birthing operations _ which account for a $1 billion-a-year
industry _ complicate the issue. The standard methods can cost
$12,000 per procedure and are rarely covered by insurance.
``Infertility can be a real life crisis for people,'' Adamson said.
``You don't understand how serious until you have walked in their
shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Leach, 36, of Gwinnett County (Ga.), has mothered two
babies since 1994 as a result of in-vitro fertilization, and calls
them her ``miracle children. They are just our life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Kyle, 5, begins his first season of T-ball next month,
and her husband, Keith, 36, plans to coach. Daughter Rachel just
turned 3 ``and I don't know how I ever did without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynne Wilcox, director of the CDC's division of reproductive
health, said by the CDC's calculations, the success rate for
couples attempting assisted reproductive techniques rose from 20
percent in 1995 to about 23 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main message is that overall you have about a one in four
chance of having a live birth (through assisted reproductive
technology),'' she said.

PROPOSED KOSOVO PLAN WOULD EFFECTIVELY END SERBIAN CONTROL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Ind., Neb., Ky., Ore.) (bl) 
By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The proposed peace plan for Kosovo would
effectively end Serbian control over the province, according to a
draft version that all sides are to begin discussing in talks
outside Paris this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The draft plan would give a new international monitoring mission
wide-ranging powers, including the right to appoint officials in
the Kosovo administration and judiciary. The plan also would reduce
the number of Serbian troops in the province to 4,000 or 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the proposal, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other national security advisers met with key House leaders
Tuesday to ask for ``acquiescence at the least'' that U.S. ground
troops take part in any peacekeeping force in Kosovo, Clinton
administration and congressional officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One administration argument is that the talks this weekend would
have a far better chance of success if Kosovo's ethnic Albanians
were assured that the United States, backed by Congress, would take
part in a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks of negotiations, according to administration
officials, the Kosovo Albanians made it clear that they would not
trust a peacekeeping force that did not include Americans. ``That's
one of the pots of gold they are looking for,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration point is that there will be more violence
in the spring if peace talks fail, and that a U.S. refusal to send
troops could block any agreement. ``What if the United States
abdicates its responsibility,'' one official asked, ``and then
there are additional massacres?''
</P>
<P>
   Senators began lobbying Tuesday on the question of deploying
U.S. troops and the outline of an eventual peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an investment and interest in stability in the
Balkans,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., in support of
sending U.S. troops. ``This is the 50th anniversary of NATO. Its
primary purpose was to create stability in Europe, and what's
happening in Kosovo is as great a threat as Bosnia because of
interests in surrounding countries, stretching out ultimately to
Greece and Turkey.``
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman joined two senators, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and Chuck
Hagel, R-Neb., at a news conference to make a plea for public
support to send troops. But other senators questioned some of the
assumptions in the draft plan.
</P>
<P>
   As described in the document, and first reported Tuesday by The
Financial Times of London, the current Kosovo Verification Mission
would be empowered to oversee establishment of a new civilian
government, with the backing of an armed international peacekeeping
force to insure compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of the draft is to give Kosovo the highest degree of
autonomy possible for the three-year duration of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Within nine months, a new assembly would be elected, which would
then elect a president, who would in turn choose a prime minister.
The assembly would pass new laws, new courts would be formed and
municipal governments would have greater control over their areas.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-page document offers details on the rights of refugees
and displaced persons to return to their homes, on a free press and
on open access of international humanitarian groups to all areas,
among other guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft is vague on the key issue of separating the
warring parties _ Serbian troops and Albanian separatist guerrillas
_ and imposing a cease-fire. The province has been racked by
violence despite the cease-fire signed in October.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia, which has 25,000 troops in the province, is expected to
withdraw all but 2,500 members of its security forces and 1,500 of
its army troops. There are about 2 million residents of Kosovo, of
whom about 90 percent are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is noticeably silent on how the Serbian forces would be
removed. After the October agreement, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic did not adhere to the provision to reduce the troops in
Kosovo, and even sent in more. Serbia is the overwhelmingly
dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and sorting out Yugoslav and
Serbian forces is often impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the paramilitary and rebel forces of the ethnic
Albanians would be expected to disarm within three months, but the
proposal does not specify how this would be be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the nub of the plan,'' said a former State Department
official who read the draft. ``If you can get the Belgrade forces
out of Kosovo to the minimal levels of a few hundred, then the rest
of the tasks are relatively easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Britain and France have said they will deploy troops in a
NATO peacekeeping force in the event a settlement is reached. And
administration officials said they were optimistic that Congress
would give initial approval for deploying U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   But Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., sent
a letter to President Clinton on Tuesday saying they would oppose
sending U.S. troops if any Serbian police, army or paramilitary
forces were allowed to stay in Kosovo.

FOR TV CHEF YAN, SIMPLE IS GOOD

By NATALIE HAUGHTON

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ring in the Chinese Year of the Rabbit with a
feast of creations by Martin Yan, that fun-loving and entertaining
master of public television's cooking show ``Yan Can Cook'' who is
out to demystify Chinese cuisine. The celebration begins Feb. 16
and continues for 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades (and 1,500 shows), Yan has brought
Asian culture and cooking into homes throughout this country. Now
he has compiled his favorite dishes in ``Martin Yan's Feast: The
Best of Yan Can Cook,'' (Bay Books; $34.95). It features 200
creations he has been making for years, along with 75 new recipes.
All have been updated and designed for contemporary cooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today are looking for something fast, quick, healthy
and delicious,'' emphasized Yan during a telephone interview from
his San Mateo home. ``Nobody _ not even the Chinese _ wants to make
Peking Tea-Smoked Duck at home. Very few people want to spend lots
of time (two or three hours) cooking. I've maintained the integrity
and philosophy of the cuisine but made it more accessible to the
general public.''
</P>
<P>
   For a shortcut, Yan recommends using cut-up vegetable
ingredients from a supermarket salad bar and beef, pork or chicken
strips from the meat section. It's also feasible to use
store-bought prepared stir-fry, kung pao or other sauces instead of
making your own.
</P>
<P>
   Yan has also combined cooking steps to streamline his recipes.
For instance, he avoids water blanching vegetables or poaching
meat, each separately, prior to cooking them in a wok. Instead he
cooks the meat in the wok first, removes it and then stir-fries the
veggies, adds the sauce and returns the meat to the pan. Often, he
adds vegetables to pork or chicken in the wok when the meat is 80
percent cooked and then finishes off the dish. Yan also avoids long
ingredient lists, keeping them to a manageable eight to 12 items
when possible.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Yan also pays close attention to presentation,
using modern plates and arranging the food like works of art to
make the dishes look interesting. In the book, as in his television
shows, he tries to encourage and excite _ not intimidate _ his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese home cooking is basically very down to earth,'' he
said. ``We're doing everyday cuisine _ homey, comfort food. The
dish itself is simple _ the way you present the dish is what makes
it appetizing. Cooking isn't just about getting the right answer.
It's also one of life's greatest pleasures.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his memories of the Chinese New Year in China,
Yan, who was born in the Year of the Monkey (the Chinese zodiac,
centered around 12 animals, is believed to determine the
personality and fortune of those born during each animal's
respective year), delved into his truly unfortunate growing up
years in China in the '50s and '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have much food or much to eat,'' he recalled, adding
that before he was 13, the Chinese New Year was almost nonexistent
for him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The first Chinese New Year he actually celebrated _ with
firecrackers, carnivals and different foods _ was in Hong Kong, he
noted, where he went to apprentice in an uncle's restaurant shortly
after his 13th birthday. ``It was just like Christmastime in the
U.S.,'' he recalled, but added, ``The Chinese New Year is more into
celebration and food symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go to Chinatown during the celebration, he noted, you'll
find tangerines, pomelos and red envelopes (which are filled with
money and given to children and single people to wish them good
luck and good fortune) in the stores. Restaurants feature special
menus with foods such as black moss (a hairlike seaweed which is
tasteless but quite expensive and is used in dishes to bring good
fortune) and dried oysters (to wish people good business and good
fortune).
</P>
<P>
   Lettuce wraps are also served. Lettuce symbolizes giving birth
and wealth and riches. The filling is usually dried oysters. Fish
is traditionally served for Chinese New Year, as is something
stuffed with mushrooms. During this time, the Chinese eat round
cookies, which are a symbol of coins and money.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of his new book includes Yan's reflections on
the road his life has taken in China, Hong Kong, Canada and
California (including the University of California, Davis, where he
earned both bachelor's and master's degrees in food science and met
his wife, Susan). In addition to recipes, the book also includes
technique information and a guide to ingredients. It makes for some
interesting reading.
</P>
<P>
   Yan, who resides in San Mateo with his wife and 6{-year-old twin
sons, believes in cooking healthy food _ lots of fish, vegetables
and tofu _ for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also eat a lot of pasta and noodles. My sons love to eat
raw tofu with soy sauce,'' said Yan, adding that they also like
chili garlic sauce and hot and spicy food.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cook what you enjoy _ experiment, be passionate and
adventurous,'' advised Yan. ``And always try a dish before you say,
`No.' Food is a reflection of one's life. You have to eat every day
to survive.''

   &UR;  &QL; 
MINCED POULT &LR; R &UR; Y WITH WALNUTS IN LETTUCE CUPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my version of a favorite banquet dish that's often
served on festive occasions as a symbol of longevity. The crisp,
chilled lettuce makes a wonderful contrast to the warm filling, and
the sweetness of the hoisin sauce marries all the flavors.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
6 dried black mushrooms &QL; 
Water &QL; 
3/4 cup walnuts &QL; 
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken, turkey OR duck &QL;

minutes; drain, reserving 1/4 cup of soaking liquid. Discard stems
and chop caps.

   Cut chicken into 1/4-inch pieces. Place in a bowl with
oyster-flavored sauce; stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes.

 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
WATERCRESS SOUP WITH CRAB &LR;  &QL; 
``This is a popular Cantonese treat, yet ironically watercress is
not of Chinese origin. It was brought to China by Western traders,
and over the centuries it has found a perfect home in Chinese
cuisine, as in this savory seafood broth.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
2 teaspoons cornstarch &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL;

1/4 teaspoon white pepper!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Marinade ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add crab meat and stir to coat. Let stand 10 minutes. &QL; 
Place a 2-quart pan over high heat until hot. Add vegetable oil,

fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add crab meat and stir-fry 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add broth and water; bring to a boil. Add watercress and
carrots. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are
tender-crisp, about 5 minutes. &QL; 
Stir in sesame oil and pepper. Makes 4 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
MANGO BEEF &LR;  &QL; 
``Like many Hong Kong-trained chefs, I love to combine the flavors
of meat and fresh fruit. Here, it's a case of meat meets mango in a
sizzling sweet-and-savory stir-fry. If you can't find mangoes, you
can substitute pears or peaches.'' &QL; 
MARINADE: &QL; 
1 tablespoon oyster-flavored sauce &QL; 
1 teaspoon cornstarch &QL; 
BEEF MIXTURE: &QL; 
3/4 pound beef sirloin, cut into 1/2-inch cubes &QL;

1 grapefruit &QL; 
1/4 cup thinly sliced sweet pickled ginger &QL; 
1 medium carrot, shredded &QL; 
1/4 pound (3-inch wedge) jicama, shredded &QL; 
1 tablespoon sesame seeds &QL; 
6 ounces salmon fillet &QL; 
6 ounces firm white fish fillet, such as sea bass &QL; 
1 tablespoon lime juice &QL; 
1 tablespoon vegetable oil &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon white pepper &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped roasted peanuts &QL; 
1 green onion, slivered!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Dressing ingredients in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   For Salad, peel melon and cut into crescents. Segment grapefruit
by cutting away peel and white pith; cut and lift out segments. In
a bowl, combine melon, grapefruit, pickled ginger, carrot and
jicama.
</P>
<P>
   Place sesame seeds in a small skillet over medium heat; cook,
shaking skillet frequently, until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
Immediately remove from skillet to cool. &QL; 
Remove skin and any bones from fish. Thinly slice fish across grain
to make pieces about 1 by 2 inches. Fan slices on a serving

sesame seeds and green onion. Makes 4 to 6 servings. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOMATO BEEF FRIED RICE &QL; 
``Fried rice provides an easy way to convert bits of leftovers into
a quick snack or one-dish meal. There are no strict guidelines for
the embellishments, but you must start with cold cooked rice so the
grains remain separate when stir-fried. A wok is traditional for
cooking fried rice, but I find a nonstick frying pan works even
better and is so much easier to clean.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
SAUCE: &QL; 
3 tablespoons ketchup &QL; 
2 tablespoons soy sauce &QL; 
2 teaspoons sesame oil &QL; 
1/4 teaspoon salt &QL; 
BEEF MIXTURE: &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1/2 pound ground beef &QL; 
1 small onion, chopped &QL; 
2 green onions, thinly sliced &QL; 
4 cups cold cooked long-grain rice &QL; 
1 medium tomato, peeled, seeded and chopped &QL; 
1/2 cup frozen peas, thawed &QL; 
2 eggs, lightly beaten!off!
</P>
<P>
   Combine all Sauce ingredients in a small bowl; set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For Beef Mixture, place a wide nonstick skillet over high heat
until hot. Add oil, swirling to coat sides. Add beef and stir-fry 1
minute. Add onion and green onions; stir-fry 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to medium; stir in rice, separating grains with back
of a spoon. Add tomato, peas and eggs. Cook, stirring constantly, 1
minute. Add sauce and cook, stirring, until heated through. Makes 4
to 6 servings. &UR;

PUT LOVE OF DESSERT IN THE AIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With Valentine's Day just around the corner, here
is a trio of sweet sensations designed to win the hearts of those
you love. They are bound to earn rave reviews from all who indulge.
</P>
<P>
   The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cup Pie and Raspberry Streusel
Bars are copycat versions of creations sampled at the Corner
Bakery, which recently opened in the new Commons shopping center in
Calabasas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The original Corner Bakery opened its doors alongside Maggiano's
Littly Italy restaurant in Chicago in 1991. Today there are 38
Corner Bakery locations in various cities around the country. The
first California Corner Bakery adjoining a Maggiano's restaurant
opened in the South Coast Plaza complex in Costa Mesa, outside the
mall near Sears, in 1997, and a free-standing Corner Bakery is now
open inside the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Peanut Butter and Chocolate Cup with its three layers _
chocolate crust, peanut butter filling and brownie on top _ sold at
Corner Bakery is an individual-serving size. Although it was
delicious, I found the crust very hard and difficult to cut through
and eat. At first I thought it was overbaked, but the manager
assured me that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   For ease and convenience, I took the liberty of creating a pie
instead of mini cups _ but with the same layers and basic
ingredients. The pie, which took a couple of tries to perfect, came
out great _ and the taste is close to the original. Also, the crust
in the recipe included here is easier to cut through than the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a colleague was in ecstasy about the Corner Bakery
Raspberry Streusel Bars and tipped me off that they would be great
to duplicate. I couldn't wait to try them. The bars are rich,
sinful and fabulous _ and among the best I've sampled. With their
tender and flaky crust and streusel topping, they are layered with
plenty of raspberry preserves in between.
</P>
<P>
   The replica version is a close facsimile and goes together in a
jiffy with butter, sugar, flour and vanilla. To streamline the
recipe, I used the same mixture for the crust and streusel topping.
After reserving some of the mixture for the topping, I added a
little whipping cream to the remainder to bind it together for the
crust. Use red raspberry preserves with seeds, like the Corner
Bakery does (I prefer Knott's Berry Farm brand). The trick to
keeping the jam from overflowing underneath the crust is to build
the crust at least an inch up the sides of the pan prior to
spreading on the preserves. Make a batch of these for your
sweetheart for Valentine's Day _ you won't be sorry!
</P>
<P>
   The Congo Tart at Tahiti restaurant in Los Angeles is a decadent
ending to any meal. Jackie Ravel Knezevich of BakeAway bakery makes
it for the restaurant and was kind enough to share the recipe,
which I tweaked a bit _ with wonderful results. Again, I opted to
make a single tart rather than individual ones like the restaurant
serves. Present the slices embellished with a scoop of coffee ice
cream and a drizzle of hot fudge sauce _ or simply top with
unsweetened whipped cream spiked with bourbon or rum. Any way you
serve it, it's a winner. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PEANUT BUTTER AND CHOCOLATE CUP PIE &QL; 
CRUST: &QL; 
1 1/2 cups crushed Oreo cookie crumbs (put Oreo cookies in a food
processor and process until finely crushed) &QL;

1 egg &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
1/4 cup flour &QL; 
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips &QL; 
1/4 cup chopped nuts

mixing well. Press into bottom and up sides of ungreased 9-inch
deep-dish pie plate.
</P>

   For Peanut Butter Layer, combine all ingredients, mixing until
well-blended.
</P>
<P>
   Turn into cookie crust and carefully spread evenly.
</P>

microwave 30 to 45 seconds longer until chocolate is melted.
</P>

   Stir in granulated sugar, egg and vanilla and with a fork, mix
well. Stir in flour until well-mixed. Mix in chocolate chips and
nuts. Carefully spread evenly over peanut butter layer.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes or until
brownie is set. Cool to room temperature before cutting into
slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve slices topped with a dollop of whipped cream. Refrigerate

2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons whipping cream &QL; 
1 cup red raspberry preserves with seeds!off!
</P>
<P>
   In a bowl of food processor fitted with a metal blade, combine
flour and sugar and process briefly to mix. Add butter pieces and
vanilla and process a few seconds, until mixture is crumbly and
there are many pieces the size of large peas. Do not overprocess.
Remove 1 2/3 cups of mixture and set aside to use for streusel
topping.
</P>
<P>
   To mixture remaining in food processor bowl, add whipping cream
and process until mixture holds together. Press into bottom and
1-inch up sides of a buttered 8-inch square baking pan. Carefully
spread preserves evenly over bottom of crust (NOT up sides).
Sprinkle top with reserved streusel mixture, pressing lightly into
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 30 to 35 minutes or until top
and edges are golden. Cool thoroughly before cutting into 9 large
squares. Store in refrigerator if not eating within a day. Makes 9
large raspberry bars. &QL;

JORDAN MAKES FEW CHANGES IN HIS PREVIOUS TESTIMONY, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-TAPES, IMPEACH-BLUMENTHAL,
IMPEACH-POLL) 
(lb) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, who has
functioned as a one-man kitchen cabinet throughout President
Clinton's years in the White House, testified for about three hours
Tuesday in Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Following directly on the heels of Monica Lewinsky, who
testified on Monday, Jordan made some slight changes in his
previous testimony, officials familiar with it said. A Republican
aide on Capitol Hill said, ``New ground was broken.'' But a lawyer
allied with the White House said, ``We saw nothing in serious need
of repair after Vernon finished his testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suggested that anything Jordan said had the capacity to
change the course of the trial, which has seemed headed for an
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's deposition was taken in the most secure room of the
Capitol _ S407, in the attic. It is most often used for classified
briefings involving national security. Urbane, poised and the
picture of finesse, Jordan made no public statement as he arrived
Tuesday morning and left Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chief prosecutor, said at a brief
news conference that the depositions of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan had
provided ``some amplification'' and ``strengthened some points.''
He added: ``I'm generally pleased with them. We never felt we
needed any bombshells to have a compelling case. What we needed was
to validate the record that already existed under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan answered questions from one of the ablest of the House
prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. He also answered ``a
question or two,'' as one White House official described it, posed
by the president's lawyers. That official described them as
``open-ended'' queries that gave him a chance to describe himself
and to restate his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic lawyer said the White House counsel ``just got him
to repeat a couple of things, so there's absolutely no ambiguity in
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing Clinton at the session, which was interrupted for
20 minutes by a blown fuse, were David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and
Cheryl Mills. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., presided over most of
the questioning, which a witness described as ``pointed and
vigorous.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan stuck to the story that he had already told five
times to the Lewinsky grand jury, the lawyer said, he made two
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   One dealt with a breakfast Ms. Lewinsky said she had attended
with Jordan at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Washington on Dec. 31, 1997.
On that occasion, Ms. Lewinsky has testified, she told Jordan that
Linda Tripp, in whom she had confided about her illicit affair with
the president, had visited her apartment and might have seen drafts
or copies of notes she had written to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go home and make sure they're not there,'' Ms. Lewinsky quoted
Jordan as having told her. She said that she went home and threw
them away.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Jordan had testified that he could not recall the
breakfast meeting, but the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
turned up a receipt from the hotel for an egg-white omelet like the
one Ms. Lewinsky said she ate. On Tuesday, Jordan reportedly
conceded that he had attended the breakfast but denied that he had
suggested Ms. Lewinsky destroy the notes.
</P>
<P>
   The notes are one element in obstruction-of-justice charges
against Clinton contained in the second article of impeachment
voted by the House.
</P>
<P>
   A second concession, the Democratic lawyer said, came when
Jordan conceded that his attempt to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky was
something out of the ordinary for him. The Republicans have
suggested that he undertook it in an effort to buy Ms. Lewinsky's
silence, but he still denies that, the lawyer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jordan stands not only at the nexus of the Lewinsky case, but at
the center of the power networks linking Washington and corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   He plays golf with Clinton. They schmooze on the telephone and
tell stories. ``Nothing wrong with a little locker-room talk,'' he
once said. He counsels the president in tough times. And he praises
him unstintingly, referring to him on one recent occasion as ``a
great friend, a great leader and truly a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known African-Americans _ perhaps the
best-known, along with Jesse Jackson and Colin Powell, if athletes
and entertainers are left to one side _ he currently sits on the
boards of 10 major U.S. corporations, and his wife, Ann, sits on
the boards of five others.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 10 companies give some of their legal business to
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, where Jordan is a senior
partner. He seldom appears in court and never lobbies as such, but
his Rolodex and his White House connections are invaluable to
businessmen in keeping an eye on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He used those connections to help Ms. Lewinsky at American
Express Co. and at Revlon Group, Inc. He is a director of both.
After he intervened twice with senior executives, she was offered a
job by Revlon, but the offer was later rescinded.

NEW HOUSING AGENCY LEADER FACES TOUGH QUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The newly installed leader at the state's
troubled housing agency faced sharp questioning Tuesday from
legislators who accused the agency of ignoring basic needs of
Texas' most impoverished citizens.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, the Texas Department of Housing and
Community Affairs has been reeling as federal and state
investigators probed public corruption allegations against one of
its board members and questionable practices of its former
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, though, the agency's performance in meeting its
fundamental mission to serve the poor drew rebukes from Democrats
serving on the state Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos, D-Austin, said the agency seems to have
been ``snake bit'' since its inception, whether the overseeing
governor was ``man or woman, Democrat, Republican.'' It's too bad,
he said, because the agency that preceded it was ``an embarrassment
to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Daisy Stiner, appointed executive director earlier this month by
Gov. George W. Bush after her predecessor resigned under a cloud of
questions last summer, said the agency serves only 1.5 percent of
the estimated 1.5 million low-income Texans who need housing help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very poor, extremely poor, they're still poor as hell aren't
they?'' Barrientos snapped. ``In other words, we in Texas don't
treat poor people very well, do we?''
</P>
<P>
   Stiner, representing the housing agency as it seeks $393.6
million in state funds for the next biennium, conceded that it had
fallen far short of a goal to direct at least 15 percent of its
housing funds to those Texans earning the smallest incomes in their
areas. Income cutoffs vary with conditions in local economies.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, that means those earning less than $16,250 annually.
In the Rio Grande Valley, it would include those earning less than
$10,150.
</P>
<P>
   Instead the agency's housing programs served less than 6 percent
of the most needy families, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you reach only one-third of the poorest of the poor
who need housing?'' asked Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi.
Truan expressed concern about funding for the ``colonias'' along
the Mexican border. ``Colonias'' often do not have running water,
sewer service or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Stiner explained that some of the agency's housing programs
include requirements that make it impossible to serve the lowest
income groups. She was backed up by other agency officials saying
bankers participating in their low-income mortgage program, for
instance, simply refuse to lend to anyone earning $12,000 a year or
less.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the agency has funneled 51 percent of housing funds
to Texans earning between 30 percent up to 60 percent of the
state's median income. In Houston, that means $16,250 to $32,460 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor don't have the same kind of lobbying as the people
appearing before you?'' Truan asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mike Moncrief, D-Fort Worth, welcomed Stiner to her new
post and said he realized it was a ``baptism by fire.'' Barrientos
had joked that she simply consider it training for her upcoming
confirmation hearings. Stiner's appointment must meet Senate
approval this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Stiner promised that the agency will look into ways to better
serve the state's lowest income families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your department has gotten a reputation of not looking after
the needs of people who need housing in our state,'' Truan said.
``It would be a shame for this to continue. Business as usual is
not going to be the norm.''

UNION PACIFIC RESOURCES TELLS WORKERS IT WILL CUT MORE JOBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Union Pacific Resources Group, which laid
off 140 workers at its headquarters in December because of losses
caused by declining crude oil prices, told employees this week to
expect a second round of job cuts this month.
</P>
<P>
   A memo to employees Monday said the number of layoffs will be
determined by the response to an early retirement offer to UPR
employees who are at least 50 years old and have at least five
years of service. The voluntary retirement offer will end March 18.
</P>
<P>
   The memo from UPR Chairman Jack Messman said, ``An employee
eligible for the early retirement, but declines to take it, will be
considered, along with all other employees of the company, for such
additional staffing reductions under the second phase of the
reduction in force as the company deems necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   UPR spokesman Dan Sullivan said, ``We can't say how many
employees will be affected by the reduction in force.''
</P>
<P>
   UPR employs about 1,200 workers in its U.S. exploration and
production unit, 900 of them at its Fort Worth headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize the human impact associated with these actions and
I take them with great reluctance. However, these difficult actions
are necessary to maintain the continuing viability of UPR,''
Messman said in the memo.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Resources has been an independent company for
almost three years after being spun off from Union Pacific Corp.,
owner of the railroad of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   The energy exploration and drilling company announced a first
round of 140 layoffs at its headquarters Dec. 3. Those workers
given notices at that time were kept on the payroll until the end
of last month. No early retirements were offered in the December
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   As he did when he made the December announcement, Messman cited
``the extended period of depressed commodity prices.'' Those
depressed prices caused UPR to absorb a loss of $898.7 million for
1998, compared with a profit of $333 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 1998 loss was attributed to a write-down of energy
assets caused by a 40 percent drop in crude prices last year. In
response, UPR has cut its capital spending budget this year to $500
million from $1.2 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific Resources Group has also been under pressure
because of the debt loads associated with its $3.5 billion purchase
of Norcen Energy of Canada in a deal that closed during the first
quarter of 1998. Although the Norcen purchase increased UPR's
assets by more than 50 percent and made the Fort Worth company a
player in Canada, offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and in South
America, it pushed the company's debt-to-equity ratio above 75
percent.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the debt problem, Messman has announced a $2 billion
asset sale program that is to be completed this year. The major
sale was the company's natural gas pipeline operations to Duke
Energy, announced in November, for $1.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   About 145 employees at UPR headquarters in downtown Fort Worth
work for the fuels operation. Sullivan said that Duke Energy ``has
been interviewing those workers and will determine how many it will
invite to come along with them.''

   BC-SCI-MILK-HORMONES-NYT (moved on Monday, Jan. 18)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Jan. 18,
about the debate over a genetically engineered bovine growth
hormone to increase milk production in cows referred incompletely
to Canada's reason for barring it. The Canadian Government health
authorities cited fears that the hormone, made by Monsanto, was
unsafe for dairy animals, not that milk from cows given the hormone
might be unsafe for people.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the name of a department of Consumers
Union and misstated its involvement with a petition to the Food and
Drug Adminstration on the hormone. The department is the Consumer
Policy Institute, not the Consumer Policy Research Institute. It
did not sign the petition, but has written the F.D.A. endorsing it.
</P>
<P>
   The article also misstated the increase between 1996 and 1997
for United States sales of organic milk _ that is, milk marketed as
being from cows free of the hormone, among other substances. The
sales rose from about $16 million to about $31 million, not $31
billion.
</P>
<P>
   BC-PATTERNS-FASHION-NYT (moved on Monday, Feb. 1)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Feb. 1,
about an athletic line of clothing to be introduced in the fall by
Ermenegildo Zegna misspelled the surname of a quarterback who will
be featured in advertisements. He is Troy Aikman, not Aiken.
</P>
<P>
   BC-MANHATTAN-RENT-NYT (moved on Wednesday, Jan. 27)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Jan.
27, about rent bidding wars included a broker's erroneous account
of a rebate for new tenants at the Gershwin and the Paramount, new
towers in Manhattan. The incentive, one month's rent, is offered to
brokers and often passed along to tenants, not offered to tenants
directly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Whether it's a new hat, a sterling silver
necklace, a set of Ginsu knives or a foam-rubber spider suspended
from a stick, souvenirs from the Southwestern Exposition and
Livestock Show that are on display in the Exhibits Hall usually
don't require financing.
</P>
<P>
   A few, though, definitely do.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a 1997 demo model Featherlite trailer, with stalls
for three horses, a tack room and living quarters with a slide-out
sofa, awning and full bath is touted as a bargain for $49,550,
marked down from the list price, $61,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new ones are fancier,'' said Lee Jayroe of Cleburne,
Texas' Circle D Trailer Sales. ``They have a really upgraded
stereo.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of big-ticket sales can pay an exhibitors' expenses
for the show, but most dealers of trailers, tractors and other farm
and ranch equipment say the real payoff comes in buyers after the
show.
</P>
<P>
   Jayroe's company is new, but already he has sold a horse trailer
similar to the '97 model at the Stock Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make a profit, although it's not like we normally
would,'' he said. Circle D has one trailer in an exhibit inside one
of the halls, and four trailers outside on the sidewalk between two
buildings, the Richardson-Bass and the Burnett buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors' expenses only begin with the cost of the booth. The
smallest 10-by-10 space rents for $1,100. The cost of lodging, food
and transportation for people and inventory can drive up the price
an extra $2,000 per person for the length of the 17-day show.
</P>
<P>
   Do people actually buy humongous equipment while attending the
Stock Show?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable, but they do,'' said Robert Skidmore of
Tipton International, based in Hillsboro, south of Fort Worth.
``It's a different kind of customer than we get in our store.''
</P>
<P>
   The average customer in Hillsboro is a farmer with a 5,000- to
6,000-acre operation. ``At our shop, the row-crop guys will buy a
215-horsepower tractor that'll run $106,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore said the Stock Show customer is a ``city farmer'' with
25 to 30 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold several tractors off the floor here,'' said Kyle
Braswell of Saginaw Implement Co. in Rhome, a John Deere dealer.
The dealer's most expensive model at the Stock Show this year costs
$71,000, although if a customer ordered a four-wheel-drive tractor
or a combine from the showroom, ``it could run $150,000 easy,''
Braswell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tractor is not quite an impulse item, but we've sold five or
six here,'' said Sam Zimmerer, owner of Zimmerer Kubota &AMP;
Equipment, with five North Texas locations. ``I sold that tractor
there for $32,000, including the loader bucket and bale spear.''
</P>
<P>
   The buyer fits a common pattern: He is employed with a large
company in Fort Worth but has 200 acres near Decatur or some other
rural community nearby, Zimmerer said.
</P>
<P>
   The wide range of visitors to the Stock Show exhibits gives
merchants a more general feel than their veteran farm and ranch
customers back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get some strange requests here,'' said Zimmerer. People
with 10 acres look at 50-horsepower tractors, when 20 horsepower
would do. ``We tell 'em, `Well, maybe you don't really need that
much,' '' Zimmerer said.
</P>
<P>
   A tough new tractor will always turn heads, he said as three
giggling little girls climbed aboard the bright orange machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy came by here the other day and said, `You'd be a
millionaire if they had money,''' Zimmerer observed.
</P>
<P>
   But even junior consumers can afford one new tractor: John
Deere's die-cast one-sixteenth scale 1934 Model A tractor for
$16.95.

BABIES' DEATHS RAISE FEAR OVER AIDS THERAPY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill. , Ga.)   (jw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A day after U.N. scientists reported that
mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS virus could be
significantly cut by a new, simple drug treatment regimen, serious
questions about its safety arose from a report of the deaths of two
babies in a similar, separate French study.
</P>
<P>
   Both babies died from a rare neurological disease, French
scientists reported Tuesday at a meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers involved said the meeting's organizers did not allow
them to release news of the two cases until Tuesday, even though
the U.N. scientists reported the findings of their study on Monday
and also spoke at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Richman, the chairmen of the scientific program
committee for the meeting, said that there was no purposeful
withholding of the information and that meeting organizers did not
know of the deaths until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs involved in the French and U.N. studies were AZT, or
zidovudine, and 3TC, or lamivudine, which are made by Glaxo
Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and U.N. officials said they would immediately begin a
scientific investigation to determine whether there was a link
between the drugs and the neurological disease and to assess the
degree of risk.
</P>
<P>
   The health officials quickly added that the disease had not been
noted among babies who received the drugs in studies in the United
States and elsewhere. But they acknowledged the possibility that
cases might have gone undetected.
</P>
<P>
   The current recommendations for preventing mother-to-infant
transmission of HIV, the AIDS virus, will remain in place, U.S. and
U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a link between the drugs and the disease is found, the
overall benefit from the treatment regimen may still outweigh the
risks, Dr. Joseph Saba, the U.N. official who reported the simpler
treatment regimen, said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome, which was not involved in the French study,
learned the medical details of the cases at the meeting Tuesday.
Mary Faye Dark, a spokeswoman for the company, said it would have
no comment until it studied the cases further.
</P>
<P>
   Both the U.N. and French studies involved the use of AZT and
3TC, but for different lengths of time. In the U.N. treatment
program, mothers took a combination of the two drugs each day
starting at the time of labor or during the last three weeks of
pregnancy. Mothers and babies then took the drug for one week after
birth.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one babies born to 359 infected women were infected, for
a transmission rate of 8.6 percent. That represented a 50 percent
reduction, according to a statistical measure known as relative
risk.
</P>
<P>
   In the nationwide French study, infected mothers started taking
AZT at about the 24th week of pregnancy and received it
intravenously during labor. The babies took AZT for six weeks.
Those same mothers also took 3TC starting in the last eight weeks
of pregnancy, and the babies took it for the first five weeks of
life.
</P>
<P>
   In the French study, five babies born to 194 infected mothers
became HIV-infected, a rate of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of the two babies came as a surprise to participants
here, at the Sixth Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic
Infections, a meeting on AIDS-like diseases that has drawn 3,500
people.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting his team's findings, Dr. Stephane Blanche of the
Necker Hospital in Paris said he had changed the focus of the
report because a recent analysis ``revealed a worrying problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies became sick at about four months of age and died
several months later from mitochondrial dysfunction, which affects
the protein-making machinery of cells and occurs in about 1 in
10,000 babies. The disease has been known for about a century, a
pediatric neurologist in the audience said in commenting on
Blanche's report.
</P>
<P>
   One baby developed epileptic seizures that could not be
controlled by drugs and the other had neurological problems. The
first died early in 1998. The second baby had no seizures but had
other symptoms from brain disease as well as heart and lung
problems. The second baby died in recent weeks, alerting the team
to a potential link between the disease and the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche said in an interview that the team did not believe the
disease was inherited from a parent, and the babies' mothers were
unrelated. Also, they lived in separate areas of France. Blanche
said that French researchers had begun extensive laboratory and
epidemiological studies to look at the problem. He said it could be
related to either or both of the drugs. A scientist in the
audience, however, rose to say that neither case might turn out to
be related to AZT or 3TC.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another public comment, Dr. Kevin Decock of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said there was an
``urgent'' need for scientists to look at information from other
clinical trials and experience in everyday medical practice to help
assess the risk.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned participants that ``the investigation of a
small cluster of rare events is extremely challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The public health message for the time being in the United
States,'' Decock said, is that the federal recommendations should
stand for infected women who take AZT to prevent transmission to
their baby.
</P>
<P>
   Women who take anti-HIV drugs for their own health should follow
current recommendations to discuss the regimen with their doctors,
Decock said.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche said the French study was continuing and that his team
had recently informed French pediatricians about the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   The capacity of a short course of AZT to cut transmission of HIV
transmission from mother to infant was underscored by a third study
conducted in the Ivory Coast in West Africa by another group of
French researchers. In a report whose release was barred until
Tuesday, the French researchers said that AZT given to a mother
beginning at 36 weeks of pregnancy had cut the rate of transmission
from mother to infant by 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. F. Dabis said his team's figure was comparable to the
findings of the U.N. study reported on Monday, although the mothers
in Ivory Coast received only AZT. .

CIA SEES A NORTH KOREAN MISSILE THREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea is on the verge of developing ballistic
missiles capable of hitting the continental United States, the
director of central intelligence, George Tenet, told Congress on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's communist government appears to be working to
produce nuclear weapons covertly and to extend the range of its
ballistic missiles in ways that have surprised U.S. intelligence
agencies, American officials have said.
</P>
<P>
   In a review of threats to U.S. national security, Tenet told
lawmakers that North Korea was working on a new generation of
missiles that could soon ``be able to deliver large payloads'' to
the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's accelerated weapons programs comes against a
backdrop of famine and increasing instability in the country,
making its government's actions dangerously difficult to predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hardly overstate my concern about North Korea,'' Tenet
told the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``In nearly all respects,
the situation there has become more volatile and unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's comments concerning the threat from North Korea caps a
remarkable reversal by U.S. intelligence agencies in the last few
months.
</P>
<P>
   In July a bipartisan commission headed by former Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld concluded that countries it described as
rogue states could hit the United States with ballistic missiles
with little or no warning.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA publicly disputed that finding and stood by its earlier
analysis that the threat was probably several years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, soon after the debate over the Rumsfeld report,
North Korea caught the CIA off guard by testing a three-stage
missile, putting that country much closer to having an
intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM in military lingo, than
agency analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Robert Walpole, the national intelligence officer
for strategic and nuclear programs, conceded in a Washington speech
that the CIA had not anticipated North Korea's flight testing of a
three-stage missile.
</P>
<P>
   The third stage of the missile was not successful in the flight
test. Yet the test forced the CIA's analysts to embrace the
assessments of the Rumsfeld panel that they had just dismissed as
alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   That change in the intelligence outlook has encouraged the
Clinton administration to set aside its longstanding doubts about
anti-ballistic missile systems. Last month, the administration
announced plans to spend $6.6 billion over five years for such a
system.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet's testimony was one of the few detailed accounts of the
threat posed by North Korean ballistic missiles given to Congress
in public session by a high-ranking Clinton administration
official.
</P>
<P>
   He said the August test of a three-stage Taepo Dong 1 ballistic
missile had ``demonstrated technology that with the resolution of
some important technical issues would give North Korea the ability
to deliver a very small payload to intercontinental ranges _
including parts of the United States _ although not very
accurately.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said North Korea was also working on a more advanced
two-stage missile, the Taepo Dong 2, which could deliver larger
payloads as far as Alaska and Hawaii, and smaller payloads to the
continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   While the Taepo Dong 2 has not yet been flight-tested, it could
deliver large payloads to the continental United States if North
Korea is able to convert it into a three-stage rocket like the
Taepo Dong-1 tested last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proliferation implications of these missiles are obviously
significant,'' Tenet observed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Over the past year, the United States and North Korea have been
negotiating over whether North Korea will allow inspections of a
suspected underground nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is hoping to salvage a 1994 agreement
with North Korea that guaranteed international aid in return for a
promise that North Korea would freeze its nuclear-weapons
development efforts. Tenet's warning was in effect an admission
that North Korea has failed to abide by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He also warned Congress that Russia has been backsliding on its
earlier commitments to the United States to curb the transfer of
advanced missile technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   For several years CIA officials have viewed the Russia-Iran
connection as one of the most worrisome proliferation channels in
the world. The Clinton administration has imposed sanctions on a
range of Russian companies and other institutions since last year
in order to curb the trade, but Tenet's testimony made clear that
the sanctions policy is not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some positive signs in Russia's performance early
last year but, unfortunately, there has not been a sustained
improvement,'' Tenet said. ``Especially during the last six months,
expertise and materiel from Russia has continued to assist the
Iranian missile effort in areas ranging from training to testing to
components.
</P>
<P>
   ``This assistance is continuing as we speak, and there is no
doubt that it will play a crucial role in Iran's ability to develop
more sophisticated and longer-range missiles.''

HYDE WANTS PUBLIC TESTIMONY BY LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heading toward an intraparty showdown, the chief
House Republican manager said Tuesday he will push for Monica S.
Lewinsky to testify publicly in President Clinton's impeachment
trial, even as several influential GOP senators who viewed her
videotaped deposition cautioned against calling Lewinsky to the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The rift developed as House managers spent nearly three hours
questioning Clinton's friend, Vernon E. Jordan Jr., in their
last-ditch quest for new evidence to break open their case against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Jordan's deposition unfolded much like Lewinsky's
the day before, as both witnesses hewed closely to their previous
sworn testimony and yielded no substantial disclosure that could
further damage Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The top House manager, Representative Henry J. Hyde,
acknowledged that Lewinsky's deposition failed to unearth any
``bombshells.'' But he vowed to press for her to appear on the
Senate floor, as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have helped if there was new information,'' Hyde
said. ``But confirming the accuracy and the reaffirmation of her
previous statements under oath is something worthwhile, because she
is already on record in many areas that are helpful to the
prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he also will seek in-person testimony from Jordan, a
prominent Washington lawyer, and Sidney Blumenthal, a White House
adviser who is scheduled to give a deposition Wednesday. But Hyde
said he will not seek additional witnesses, which could allow the
Senate to complete the trial by its target date of Feb. 12 ``or
even sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   After viewing Lewinsky's deposition, several GOP senators
portrayed her as an intelligent, credible witness whose testimony
broke no significant new ground and, as a result, would not need to
be summoned to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what my staff told me, there is nothing new,'' said
Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Utah Republican. ``If there in fact is
nothing new, I would not expect her to be called.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican, shared
Bennett's view, saying many of his constituents are angry the trial
has not already ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very nervous about it,'' Jeffords said. ``There is an
overwhelming feeling of sadness that we've gotten ourselves in this
mess, and they think we should get it over with as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, chairman of the
Senate Republican Policy Committee, said there was ``probably not''
anything to be gained from compelling Lewinsky to testify before
the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The competing interests of House Republicans, who want to
prolong the trial so they can more fully present their case against
Clinton, and reluctant GOP senators may need to be resolved before
Thursday, when the managers are expected to ask the Senate for
permission to call Lewinsky to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate's 45 Democrats apparently united against calling
witnesses, they would need only six Republicans to join them to
block the House request.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican senators floated a possible compromise, which
would permit the House team to show portions of the videotaped
depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, for example, expressed support for the House managers
showing ``snippets to dramatize their points.''
</P>
<P>
   In another signal of the Senate's resolve to complete the trial
quickly, a spokesman for the majority leader, Trent Lott, Tuesday
outlined a tentative schedule for the remainder of the trial that
calls for closing arguments to begin as early as Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, it was another strange day in the Capitol, as
Cabinet members briefed Congress on matters ranging from the
national economy to the Kosovo crisis, and the loudest buzz in the
hallways related to the continuous, private screenings of
Lewinsky's videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Each senator, sworn to secrecy and equipped with a VCR, remote
control and headphones, watched the 4-hour tape in a closely
guarded room. Although they refused to discuss specifics of
Lewinsky's testimony, several senators said they were struck by her
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found her heartbreakingly young,'' said Senator Susan M.
Collins, a Maine Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Lewinsky, 25, responded calmly and deliberately
throughout the deposition and expressed irriation only when the
House manager, Representative Ed Bryant of Tennessee, repeatedly
alluded to her ``salacious relationship'' with Clinton. Lewinsky
took offense at the relationship being characterized as
``salacious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I found her to be young, vulnerable and
credible,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican who is
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``I think she'd make a
very effective witness.''
</P>
<P>
   While senators were viewing the Lewinsky deposition, Jordan gave
his testimony in a remote, high-security room in the Capitol that
is used for confidential briefings on national security matters.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Representative Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas
Republican, Jordan addressed discrepancies between his and
Lewinsky's prior testimony over several key elements of the
impeachment charges. A major dispute related to Jordan's help
finding Lewinsky a job while she was preparing to file a false
affidavit denying her sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the calm tone of Lewinsky's deposition, Jordan's session
reportedly became testy at times as he forcefully denied
allegations that he helped Clinton cover up the affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan restated his position that Lewinsky was wrong about, or
that he did not recall, several conversations between them that
have produced damaging assertions about Jordan's and Clinton's role
in the scandal, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lewinsky testified to a grand jury last year that
Jordan urged her to destroy her correspondence with Clinton.
Jordan, who has been questioned under oath six times in the case,
has denied giving Lewinsky such encouragment.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also has said under oath that Lewinsky never showed him
gifts she had received from Clinton, as Lewinsky has testified she
did.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers, who asked no questions in Lewinsky's
deposition, reportedly posed only two questions to Jordan. The
deposition lasted just less than three hours, not including a
one-hour lunch break and a 20-minute interruption when a fuse blew,
cutting off power to the videorecorder.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan and Clinton's lawyers left the Capitol without
commenting, Hutchinson told reporters he was ``satisfied that we
covered the areas we needed to cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with Clinton expected to be acquitted of the
impeachment charges, Senate Republicans continued searching for a
way to find bipartisan support to sanction the president with a
``finding of facts'' vote that he committed wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats generally opposed to the initiative, several GOP
senators, including Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins of Maine,
were developing language they hoped would appeal to most
Republicans and some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said they want to prevent a reenactment of
Clinton's response to the House impeachment vote, when the
president staged a White House event that appeared to downplay the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are deeply concerned that his confidence will lead
him to be so foolish as to resurrect the cheering squad,'' Jeffords
said.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial is scheduled to resume Thursday, when the
Senate takes up the House request for witnesses and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   In the final deposition, Blumenthal will be questioned about his
grand jury testimony that Clinton described Lewinsky as a
``stalker'' after the president's relationship with her became
public.
</P>
<P>
   House managers want to know whether Clinton tried to influence
Blumenthal's grand-jury testimony and whether Blumenthal used the
``stalker'' comment to try to smear Lewinsky in the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied any wrongdoing. And Blumenthal's lawyer,
William McDaniel, said Blumenthal did not raise the ``stalker''
scenario with the news media.

 &HT;    Florida city wants QVC to take the bait
 &HT;    By Jim Reeder and Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ A $1.3 million package of tax breaks and
cash incentives to lure QVC Inc. and 1,200 new jobs to St. Lucie
County was approved unanimously by county commissioners Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the easiest votes I've had to make,'' County
Commissioner John Bruhn said. ``I hope we make many more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The incentive package includes $1 million from the county's Job
Growth Investment Fund and an estimated $300,000 property tax
waiver over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   While the financial incentive was important, the area's labor
force was the most important factor in bringing QVC here, Senior
Vice President John A. Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the labor force, the availability of labor made
us look here,'' Hunter said. ``People were friendly in restaurants
and gas stations.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners were all smiles while approving the deal with QVC,
but Commissioner Cliff Barnes said local agencies need to do more
for the area's under-employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to develop a plan to help the under-employed prepare
for the interview process,'' Barnes said. ``QVC's training program
will help people after they've been interviewed and brought into
the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Doug Coward said the community also needs to insure
transportation is available for people who get the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Port St. Lucie City Council members agreed to
use $500,000 in road impact fees to help QVC buy 8 1/2 acres at St.
Lucie West.
</P>
<P>
   The city will use $500,000 in impact fees collected over the
next 2 1/2 years to help the St. Lucie West Development Corp. meet
its obligation to build a wider bridge over Florida's Turnpike at
St. Lucie West Boulevard. In exchange, the development company will
reduce its land price to QVC by an equal amount.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the last-minute land discount was one of the factors
that pushed Port St. Lucie to the head of a three-city list of
finalists for the $10 million call center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed some creativity and desire on the part of the
city,'' Hunter said. ``I've personally combed the country for a
fourth call center, and we're very, very excited to be in Port St.
Lucie.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a qualified workforce _ defined by Hunter as high
school grads with preferably a year's experience in a
service-related field _ was Port St. Lucie's main drawing card,
Hunter said company officials were equally impressed with how well
city, county and chamber officials handled negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said the company will bring about five corporate officers
to St. Lucie County in the next few weeks to begin hiring personnel
employees for the call center, expected to employ the equivalent of
1,200 workers by the year 2002. The personnel employees will in
turn hire the order entry clerks and customer service
representatives who take incoming calls from QVC customers 24 hours
a day, 364 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Most employees will earn $7 to $8 an hour plus benefits.

 &HT;    A five-year look back at the Fab 55 Class of 1994
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are signatures, some promises, grand
expectations and a round of smiles all around.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Signing day is a time when even the winners don't know if
they've truly won, sometimes for half a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the 1994 Fabulous 55 was filled with hopes and
dreams, but reality proved to be harsh for some of the players. Ten
of them never played a down for the school that signed them. One
player, Damion Witherspoon of Red Oak (No. 49), never qualified
academically and was shot and killed during a fight in Dallas in
January, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some chose different paths. One player, Mark Farris of Angleton
(No. 40), opted to play pro baseball. Another player, Joseph McCray
of Houston Forest Brook (No. 48), failed out of Texas Tech and is
now performing with a rap group in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top names never panned out. Of the top five, only
Baylor tailback Jerod Douglas (Converse Judson, No. 3) earned any
all-conference honors.
</P>
<P>
   There were stars, but they were just as apt to come from near
the bottom of the list (No. 37 Dat Nguyen of Rockport-Fulton; No.
52 Wane McGarity of San Antonio Clark) as the top (No. 8 Byron
Hanspard of DeSoto).
</P>
<P>
   Only three players _ Hanspard; offensive guard Alan Faneca of
Rosenberg Lamar (No. 31), who went to Louisiana State; and Nguyen _
earned All-America honors. Only five others earned at least one
first-team all-conference berth.
</P>
<P>
   Two will still be playing this fall. Offensive lineman Jay Smith
of Oklahoma, who has survived two Achilles' heel injuries, was
granted a sixth year in 1999 to complete his eligibility. According
to OU sports information director Mike Prusinski, Smith will have
the dubious distinction of being the first Division I-A player to
have toiled for four head coaches (Gary Gibbs in '94, Howard
Schnellenberger in '95, John Blake from '96-98 and Bob Stoops in
'99).
</P>
<P>
   Fresh out of high school in '94, Angleton's Farris chose a pro
baseball contract from the Pittsburgh Pirates _ they offered him a
reported $820,000 bonus _ over a chance to quarterback the Aggies.
After five years in the minor leagues, Farris _ who said he was
inspired by the success of another baseball bonus baby turned
quarterback, Florida State's Chris Weinke _ enrolled at A&AMP;M last
month and will have four years of eligibility left with the Aggies.

<P>
   Don't believe any talking heads who say they can't wait until
it's over. Now that the end is nigh, it's clear that only two
constituencies are really rooting for the final curtain: Barbara
Walters, whose TV chat with Monica Lewinsky has been held hostage
by Kenneth Starr, and the American public, which has been held
hostage by both Starr and Bill Clinton. But the public doesn't get
a vote in this matter for another 20 months, and Ms. Walters,
powerful though she is, cannot buck her entire industry, for which
a prompt end to All Monica would bring financial devastation. The
looming presidential campaign between Al Gore's ``practical
idealism'' and George Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' is,
like a Philadelphia-Toronto World Series, a Nielsen non-starter.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the media are the only ones with a vested interest in
the scandal. For Republicans, Clinton-hating fills the ideological
vacuum left by the collapse of the Evil Empire. For Clinton,
impeachment is a magical elixir, papering over the considerable
distaste for him in his own party; when it ends, his poll numbers
are likely to fall as fast as cable-news ratings and the number of
hits on Clinton-bashing Web sites. Nor should we underrate the
tenacity of Monica's Mouseketeers _ those new celebrities spawned
by her travails. They do not want to leave the stage just because
their 15 minutes are up. As T.J. Walker, a columnist, puts it:
``Does anyone seriously believe that Lindsey Graham is going to
voluntarily give up his television network limousines and go back
to hosting town-hall meetings in Chickenbone, S.C.?''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Graham is that he may not have to. Though the
Senate trial has been on a respirator for days, Monicagate is no
sunset industry. ``It will end, but it won't be over,'' vowed
William Bennett to Larry King Monday, promising more dirt. Jeff
Greenfield, that rare TV pundit who wisely disdains predictions,
joked to King a week earlier that Clinton may be ``the first
president in history to be impeached twice, and we will be right
back where we started from.'' This mock prediction may turn out to
be the only one in a year that proves right.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Matt Drudge may not have found a Clinton love child, but
he is ably stoking the fires for Jane Doe No. 5, threatening to
leak an unaired network interview with the lovely lady much as he
previously revealed Monica before Newsweek did. Richard Mellon
Scaife, the philanthropist who underwrote press investigations into
the president's sex life, has told George magazine that Clinton
could be responsible for 60 people who ``died mysteriously'';
perhaps the corpses are being disinterred right now. Lucianne
Goldberg has lately taken to idle speculation in the right-wing
press about Chelsea Clinton's private life.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who say they want this ``nightmare'' to be over are
only kidding. Desperate to find a substitute demon for Newt in
campaign attack ads, their best hope remains Starr, and he's more
than glad to play the part. Clearly intent on keeping his face
imprinted on the public mind until Election Day 2000, he continues
to pop up as if in a ``Where's Waldo?'' cartoon, indicting anyone
he can as often as he can (though shackling only female prey). And
never underestimate Clinton's reckless insistence on providing
grounds for investigation: Let's see proof that it was coincidence
that he and Paula Jones (who now lives in California) both
converged on Beebe, Ark., to examine tornado damage on the same day
last month.
</P>
<P>
   For the post-Monica media _ to whom ``the news has become like a
drug habit that demands a stronger and stronger fix,'' in the words
of Newsweek's Jonathan Alter _ real creativity may be required to
keep all of this from playing like a rerun. They can't keep killing
off still-living celebrities like Bob Hope and Joe DiMaggio
whenever the story gets boring. The most ingenious solution I've
seen so far is on MSNBC, which has dotted its All Monica coverage
with quiz questions for the audience, such as ``What are the three
companies where Vernon Jordan got Monica Lewinsky a job
interview?''
</P>
<P>
   Time's up! Add some modest cash prizes, install Goldberg and
Flynt and Barr and an assortment of former prosecutors into a boxy
set, and voila, ``Monica Squares.'' Surely it is not too much to
hope that Bill Ginsburg can be coaxed out of retirement to emcee.

GOV. BUSH FAVORS TAX BREAK FOR STATE'S SMALL OIL PRODUCERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush and key legislative leaders
called Tuesday for swift passage of a temporary tax break for
Texas' beleaguered small oil and gas producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an emergency situation affecting people in the oil
and gas business,'' Bush said at an afternoon news conference.
``It's tough times for people in the oil patch of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor granted emergency status to a bill that would
exempt small oil and gas producers from the state's 4.6 percent
severance tax when the price of oil has been less than $15 a barrel
for three months. It would be effective only until Aug. 31 and
would take effect as soon as it passes if it is approved by a
two-thirds majority in both houses and signed by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The exemption would apply to oil produced from so-called
marginal wells that produce 15 or fewer barrels of crude per day.
It would also apply to natural gas production if that price falls
to less than $1.80 per thousand cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was flanked by about a dozen lawmakers and members of
the Texas Railroad Commission, said the tax break will enable small
producers to remain in business until oil prices stabilize.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices have tumbled in recent months and were as low
as $11 per barrel Tuesday. Prices have been under $15 per barrel at
least since November.
</P>
<P>
   Crude prices in Texas have declined steadily from two years ago
when producers were getting about $18 a barrel. The lower prices,
though, have been a boon for motorists, who have seen gasoline
prices plummet from more than a dollar per gallon to as low as 79
cents for regular-grade gasoline in some parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Buster Brown, a sponsor of the tax break legislation,
called the effort ``a temporary fix'' to stave off a collapse of
the small-production industry, which accounts for about 30 percent
of Texas crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep it pumping, keep them producing and provide
this incentive, we can get them (small producers) to hang in
there,'' said Brown, R-Lake Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored in the House by Reps. Tom Craddick,
R-Midland, and Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, will board the legislative
fast track Wednesday when the Senate Finance Committee is scheduled
to consider it. Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who presides over the Senate,
said he expects that body to pass the measure next week and send it
to the House.
</P>
<P>
   Unless opposition emerges, it likely will reach Bush's desk
within two weeks and become the first substantive legislation to
emerge during this session, which began Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and legislative leaders said the state could absorb the
estimated $45 million in lost revenue from the tax break.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Blank, government affairs vice president for Fort Worth's
Union Pacific Resources, said the legislation could be a lifesaver
for independent energy producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that a state of emergency exists in the
oil and gas industry across the nation, and particularly in this
state,'' said Blank, whose company, which operates 4,000 wells in
Texas, recently laid off about 140 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil severance taxes in the 1998 fiscal year brought $303 million
into state coffers, the lowest since 1973, according to the state
comptroller's office. The tax rate has not been changed since the
1950s.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate proceeded through a critical stage in
the impeachment trial of President Clinton on Tuesday in privately
screening the videotaped testimony of Monica Lewinsky while House
prosecutors took a deposition from Vernon Jordan, Clinton's
confidant, in an effort to bolster their obstruction-of-justice
charges against the president.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate not formally sitting again as the trial court
until Thursday, individual senators sampled the Lewinsky tape under
tight security and signed oaths, with Republicans pointedly
emphasizing that the possibility of playing some of it on the
Senate floor had not yet been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way she would offend the sensibilities of the
American people or damage the U.S. Senate,'' Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
insisted after viewing most of the videotape even as he emphasized
that it was too early to decide whether to open the Senate floor to
deposition testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appeared to be holding out that hope to the House
impeachment managers while shying away from their expected motion
to call Ms. Lewinsky in person along with Jordan and a third
witness, Sidney Blumenthal, a White House political strategist who
will be deposed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Putting some videotape on the public record might be approved
not primarily for the benefit of the Senate court, which already
would have sampled it, but mainly to help the prosecutors in their
closing arguments, Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what my staff told me, there is nothing new,'' Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said of his staff's viewing of the Lewinsky
tape. ``If there in fact is nothing new, I would not expect her to
be called.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan testified for less than three of the allotted eight
hours, with the president's defense team asking only a question or
two to allow him to elucidate favorable points, according to
officials familiar with his appearance. The deposition took place
in a Capitol attic room, S-407, used for ultra-secret intelligence
briefings. It was interrupted for 20 minutes by a power failure in
the recording equipment, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., for contradictions with
the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan offered no major new avenues
of investigation and ``no damage was done,'' according to the
contention of a Democratic aide familiar with the deposition.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Capitol official close to House prosecutors
said they were contending some new ground might have been broken in
questioning on such areas of dispute as a breakfast meeting Ms.
Lewinsky said Jordan had with her in December 1997 with the subject
of destroying notes was raised, according to her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan previously had said he could not recall having breakfast
with her. But on Tuesday, he reportedly confirmed the breakfast.
The significance of this was underlined by Republicans, but
dismissed by Democrats. There was no official elaboration on such
details as the notes, about which Jordan reportedly denied offering
guidance to Ms. Lewinsky, according to his associates.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate court's tape watching task was under way in four
rooms from 8 a.m. until 11 p.m., with senators dropping by as they
pleased and others sending staff. No log of those who attended was
released, but it was clear in conversations that not all senators
intended to personally view the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Looking beyond the depositions, Republicans gathered in
conference at midday and later emphasized there was considerable
interest _ and some doubts, too _ in creating a finding-of-fact
proposal as a way to severely condemn the president if, as
expected, the 67 votes do not materialize to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   A finding-of-fact proposal would only require a simple majority
of 51 or more votes to put Senate's reproach of the president on
record. As the proposal appeared to gain ground with Republicans,
Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, denounced it as ``a
dangerous precedent'' and ``an attempt to go around the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republican senators insisted it was a promising option in
the face of the expected acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are very interested in it but there is no
conclusion,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were not so sure. ``I'm struggling with the
Constitution and this approach of inventing a new remedy against
the executive branch,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, a key
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that various versions of a fact-finding strategem were
being more widely discussed suggested that Senate Republicans were
tacitly conceding they expected nothing substantively new from the
current deposition phase of the trial and were pressing for a
scenario to close the trial out by Feb. 12, their targeted
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, several conservative Republican officials said there
was a growing urgency among Senate Republicans to finish with the
controversial proceeding as quickly as possible as the public's
patience wears ever thin and the president's popularity rides ever
higher.
</P>
<P>
   With the finding-of-fact proposal a main focus, Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, who is co-chair of a task force on the issue, said
senators were still divided over whether to include such findings
in the official trial record.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, there's concern about setting a precedent,''
said Senator Snowe. ``But there's also concern there'd be
jubilation at the White House over an acquittal vote. I call it the
Rose Garden Jubilee.''
</P>
<P>
   Two approaches to findings of fact were reported under
discussion, with one less severely worded in a Republican attempt
to elicit Democratic support and thus show the nation a note of
bipartisanship in finally ending the impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   This version, reportedly favored by Senator Snowe, would avoid
the word ``perjury'' in finding the president violated his grand
jury oath last August and ``willfully provided false and misleading
testimony.'' On the obstruction of justice accusations, it would
find he engaged in conduct ``to alter, delay, impede, cover up and
conceal'' evidence in the Paula Jones civil suit and in the grand
jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same language would be in an alternative proposal
considered more harsh for including specific citations of alleged
presidential misdeeds, according to Senate officials. The
Republicans plan to meet once more in conference Wednesday to work
further on the findings-of-fact proposal with the aim of having it
ready by Monday.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the depositions thus far, the chief prosecutor, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said, ``We never felt we needed any bombshells
to have a compelling case. What we needed was to validate the
record that already existed under oath.'' He added, ``We have got
some amplification and we have strengthened some points. I'm
generally pleased with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson led the questioning of Jordan about such issues as
his job search for Ms. Lewinsky, the false affidavit she filed in
defense of the president, and the presidential gifts sought by
criminal investigators. Hutchinson commented only briefly on the
questioning: ``The deposition was conducted with professionalism
from all sides, and I am satisfied that we covered the areas that
we needed to cover today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Democrats were encouraged that the major topic of the
day among Republicans was not the depositions but the search for an
exit strategy exemplified by the finding-of-fact discussions. In
general, Democrats prefer a censure motion after the trial as a
better way to condemn the president's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said that inside the Republican caucus
there were ``a couple of concerns'' about the constitutionality of
the fact-finding approach, but that ``most people think that it is
constitutional.'' One concern, he said, was, ``Would it encourage
future impeachments?'' Those Republicans thus worried, he said,
``could see people start using the impeachment process for a
political tool, realizing you could go down that road without
having to go to the point of removing the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mack stressed that ``it's fair to say'' the idea gained
``momentum over the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig evaluated Ms. Lewinsky's performance on the deposition
tape he viewed as ``calm, friendly _ handles herself very well.''
Asked if she had advanced the House prosecutors' case at all, he
said, ``I can't draw that conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown, Ms. Lewinsky also sought to view her videotape
performance and caused a mob scene in walking across the street to
her lawyer's office from her hotel.

 &HT;    QVC rally to lure job applicants, hungry folks, bargain hunters
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Just in case the free hot dogs, Super
Bowl footballs and arrival of Gov. Jeb Bush don't attract a crowd,
the city's newest employer came up with a backup plan to ensure a
big crowd at today's QVC Inc. rally.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, they're banking on loyal customers to help.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest home-shopping channel called 500 of its
regular Treasure Coast customers this week and invited them to a
two-hour customer appreciation rally beginning at 11:30 a.m. today
at the community center.
</P>
<P>
   Customers and other residents can munch on free hot dogs, pop
corn and soda and pick up free QVC souvenir T-shirts and Super Bowl
footballs beneath a large tent on the front lawn of the community
center.
</P>
<P>
   People interested in applying for one of the 1,641 full- and
part-time jobs expected to be created by QVC's fourth call center
in the next three years can also pick up a job application.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't attend, resumes may be turned in at one of
the One-Stop Career centers on the Treasure Coast or mailed
directly to the human resources department of QVC's Studio Park at
1200 Wilson Drive in West Chester, Pa., 19380.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's helicopter is expected to land about 12:15 p.m. on Deacon
Avenue just north of the community center. He will enter the
community center's auditorium and join QVC president Doug Briggs
and city and county officials for speeches before the group cuts a
large cake shaped like the state of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The public is invited to the indoor press conference, where 800
folding chairs have been arranged. QVC's 45-foot remote production
bus, called QVC Local, will also be on hand bearing the world's
largest roadmap of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   QVC will tape the event with host Paul Kelley, but don't look
for the broadcast on the QVC channel. Its only audience will be QVC
employees in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Jensen Beach, Fla. resident Ruth Cummings, one of the 500
frequent shoppers who got personal invitations _ by phone of course
_ this week, said she and a friend from her mobile home park
wouldn't miss the affair for anything.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cummings prefers longtime host Kathy Levine, she's
excited that Kelley and host Dave King will be on hand to sign
autographs today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I haven't got anything better to do I'll watch the
QVC channel and usually I end up buying something,'' Cummings said.
``I can sit here and see things I'd never see in the stores. The
jewelry is terrific.''

 &HT;    Lawmaker unmoved by Lottery's plight
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Unless lawmakers pump up prizes, Texas will lose
out on more than $5 billion in lottery ticket sales in the next
five years, state lottery officials told lawmakers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK, said the Senate's top budget writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sell less tickets, there are fewer people who have
made a bad investment,'' Senate Finance Chairman Bill Ratliff said
after Texas Lottery officials failed to win his support for undoing
a prize payout cut approved in 1997 and blamed for a sales slump.
The officials had appeared at a meeting of the Senate Finance
Committee, which took no action.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Lottery Commission Chairman Harriet Miers
said Ratliff's message came through loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep hoping we can persuade him,'' she said. ``We
think that evidence really shows that is our best chance to stop
the decrease and hopefully increase the sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, R-Mt. Pleasant and a longtime lottery foe, said he
favors leaving the prize payout at its current level. In 1997,
intending to put more money into state coffers, the Legislature
voted to cut prizes and increase the state's take.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ticket sales plummeted and the state got a bigger slice
of a smaller pie, winding up with about $300 million less in 1998
than it got in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Any reversal of that action would most likely have to come
through the committee headed by Ratliff, who favors the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery commissioners may find a more sympathetic ear in the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some feeling that some of the decisions made
during the last (legislative) session may have caused sales to
drop,'' said Gov. George W. Bush. ``I do believe as long as we have
the lottery we ought to try to maximize sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to do it, according to the lottery commissioners,
is to reduce the state's take and put the money back into prizes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers offered Tuesday by the lottery commission are
meaningless to Ratliff, who led the unsuccessful Senate fight
against establishment of the lottery. In 1997, lawmakers ordered
the lottery to reduce the prize payout from 57 percent to 52.5
percent, a drop that lottery officials blame for a sales slump that
took hold shortly after the cut was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket sales fell from $3.7 billion in 1997 to $3.1 billion in
1998. Sales in the first five months of the current fiscal year
were down an additional 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is cause for considerable concern on the part of our
commission,'' Lottery Director Linda Cloud told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Miers said publicity about the prize cut caused a perception
problem among players, some of whom might not otherwise have not
noticed the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is they are not getting what they used to
get,'' she said. ``And it is true, but it is still as good as most
other states.''
</P>
<P>
   The 52.5 percent payout is an average, meaning some scratch-off
games pay more and some pay less.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery Commission projections released Tuesday show ticket
sales will continue to slide if lawmakers don't pump prizes back
up. The numbers indicate sales would increase by a total of more
than $5 billion through 2004 if the payout is restored. That
translates to $860 million in state revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff said he doesn't care about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly depending on that money to balance the
budget, so it's not a great concern to me,'' he said after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff believes ``a natural maturing of the lottery,'' and not
the prize payout cut, is responsible for the sales slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after five years a lot of Texans just decided it
wasn't a good gamble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff insists his efforts are not intended to bleed the
lottery to death, which, he said, would be his druthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought I could kill the lottery, I would,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may be one of the clumsiest openers in the history
of mating.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you doing, Jessica?'' says Warren, a nervous young
man. ``You're looking very automated tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is (italics)that(end italics) supposed to mean?'' Jessica
responds sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he says, with a shrug. ``It's just a fashion
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins the cringe-inducing courtship of Warren Straub and
Jessica Goldman, the stunted lovers of ``This Is Our Youth,'' the
dark comedy by Kenneth Lonergan.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which reopens Sunday night at the Douglas Fairbanks
Theater on Theater Row, follows three post-adolescents on the Upper
West Side through a bungled cocaine deal. As bleak as that synopsis
sounds, the play's warm heart lies in the awkward romance of Warren
and Jessica: he, a pot-smoking toy collector with an abusive
father, and she, a teen-age philosopher with a jaded view of love.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tryst that progresses through a dippy existential
argument (``I am so completely the opposite of nihilistic'') to a
sudden sexual detente and finally onto yet another argument.
</P>
<P>
   Their mating ritual, said Vincent Canby in The New York Times,
is the play's center, an ``extended, hilariously written,
beautifully acted scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The two actors responsible for this combative chemistry are Mark
Ruffalo and Missy Yager, who originated the roles of Warren and
Jessica during the play's initial run in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the play has been optioned as a movie, rumored to be
heading for Broadway and ultimately remounted Off Broadway last
fall. Despite the on-again, off-again signals, Ruffalo and Ms.
Yager have stayed with the show. Now just past 30, they have
managed to maintain _ and refine, they say _ their teen-age
characters and the odd, volatile nature of their wooing.
</P>
<P>
   So how do they do it? Like their characters, the actors can't
agree. ``The more I do it,'' Ms. Yager said, ``the more I realize
the character is me. It's a matter of stripping down my defense
mechanisms to being that vunerable again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo countered: ``I think for me it's more building on top of
me. I think.''
</P>
<P>
   This interaction ended, as many interactions between Ms. Yager
and Ruffalo do, with puzzled laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the actors' offstage relationship mirrors their
banter onstage, with goofy observations by Ruffalo and sassy
corrections by Ms. Yager. (They are not involved romantically. Ms.
Yager is dating an actor, Will Arnett; Ruffalo's girlfriend is
Sunrise Coigney.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met him, I thought he was kind of a scallywag,''
Ms. Yager said of Ruffalo. ``He's the first person I ever met who
spent 10 years in L.A. doing theater. Theater in L.A.? For 10
years? There's got to be something wrong with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo interjects: ``I thought she was kind of tart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yager interrupts: ``That's not true. He's fabricating
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo: ``No. I thought she was a sophisticated (pause) New
York (pause) actress.'' Ruffalo laughs. Ms. Yager laughs and rolls
her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Brokaw, the play's director, seems equally boggled by the
chemistry between his actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's an exact explanation,'' he said.
``What's wonderful about the scene is that every time it seems as
though they're almost on the same page, one makes a tiny faux pas
that the other sees as shattering. It's all so fragile. But they
seem to be able to create that fragility night after night.'' He
paused and added: ``I don't know how it happens, but I'm glad it
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Ruffalo and Ms. Yager, as well as Mark Rosenthal, the third
member of the cast, say they manage to keep the action fresh by
working ``moment to moment.'' That is, they allow themselves to let
their personalities and moods onstage influence their performance
but not alter the words or circumstances of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you work, the more you see actors really have
different ways of working,'' Ms. Yager said. ``And Mark and I work
very similarly. We're able to pass the ball back and forth really
easily; we're able to play with each other. It becomes fun, and the
audience gets that spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   If their friendship is part of their success, it was
hard-earned, part and parcel of their long, sometimes grueling,
association with ``This Is Our Youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo and Ms. Yager met in early 1996, when they portrayed a
brother and sister in ``The Gift,'' a play by Pippin Parker, in a
reading held by Naked Angels, a theater company.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yager, a Nebraska native, had joined the company after
studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York and
had just finished her biggest role to date, as Laura Dennis, in the
Horton Foote play of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffalo, meanwhile, was on an extended visit to New York from
his home in Los Angeles, where he had studied at the Stella Adler
conservatory. While in Los Angeles, he participated in a reading of
a one-act version of ``This Is Our Youth,'' then called ``Betrayed
by Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Its author, Lonergan, also a member of Naked Angels,
subsequently cast Ruffalo and Ms. Yager in his newly expanded play.
It wasn't an easy choice; Lonergan initially believed that both
actors were too old. ``We don't say too old in the theater; we say
too mature,'' Lonergan said. ``It turned out they were not.''
</P>
<P>
   The play opened in October 1996 at the Intar Theater on Theater
Row in a production by the New Group, directed by Brokaw. Ecstatic
reviews and talk of a commercial run followed, but in the end, no
commercial producer took the necessary steps and the play closed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yager went on to play the role of Anne Frank's older sister
on Broadway, while Ruffalo returned to Los Angeles and film and
television work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they acted together again, this time on ``Fish in the
Bathtub,'' a film directed by Joan Micklin Silver, set for release
this year. They play a husband and wife with a new child and
marital problems. ``We've basically run the gamut of male, female
relationships,'' Ruffalo said.
</P>
<P>
   But neither they nor Brokaw had forgotten ``This Is Our Youth.''
Brokaw, an associate director at the nonprofit Second Stage
theater, recommended the play to Carole Rothman, its artistic
director. She decided to present the play at her 108-seat theater.
But because of another commitment, the third original cast member,
Josh Hamilton, who had played a bullying ex-jock, was replaced by
Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was truly weird to walk into rehearsal the first day and
have them know all their lines,'' Rosenthal said. ``It was my turn
to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Second Stage run, which began in October, prompted excellent
reviews again. But, as before, a deal for a larger theater proved
elusive. A month ago, Fran and Barry Weissler, the Broadway
producers who own the option on ``This Is Our Youth,'' struck a
deal with Eric Krebs, the owner of the Douglas Fairbanks, for the
play to begin an open-ended run at Krebs' 199-seat theater.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``This Is Our Youth'' has landed back on Theater
Row two-and-a-half years after starting there has not been lost on
the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to the cafe the other night and the busboy recognized
us,'' Ruffalo said. ``Asked where we'd been.''

ARRIVAL OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IN THE EAST MEANS DISCOUNTED FARES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: New England, Md., Fla., Va., Ill., Calif., Tenn., Texas, (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Since discount airlines like People Express collapsed more
than a decade ago, air fares on the East Coast have remained
stubbornly high even as prices have fallen elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But new fare-cutting competition has begun to arrive in the
East, led by Southwest Airlines, the biggest and most successful
discount airline. Next month, Southwest will take on the most
lucrative market in the nation when it comes to travel dollars: New
York. Beginning with flights to four cities from MacArthur Airport
in Long Island, Southwest will offer fares that are as little as
half of the lowest comparable fares.
</P>
<P>
   While some question whether Southwest can draw passengers to an
airport 40 miles outside Manhattan, the airline's track record so
far on the East Coast suggests that New York air travelers _ no
matter which airport they use _ can expect some fares to fall
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, Southwest has expanded to Baltimore;
Providence, R.I.; Manchester, N.H., and several cities in Florida.
At each airport, air fares have sharply _ even on routes not served
by Southwest. Fares have also fallen at nearby airports.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, the largest airline in the region, and Delta Air
Lines have responded to the challenge by expanding their new
discount subsidiaries that match Southwest's fares. The airlines
have also sought to ward off Southwest by offering discounts in
several markets it has yet to enter. Even the nation's biggest
airline, United, is considering expanding its own low-cost
subsidiary to the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at past history, when Southwest goes into
secondary airports near a major metropolitan area the fares in the
primary airports almost always go down,'' said Rono Dutta, the
senior vice president for planning at United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are eager to battle in the East because the region
accounts for about 40 percent of the $52 billion spent on airline
tickets annually in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Coast is a very dense, very deep market,'' said Gary
C. Kelly, Southwest's chief financial office. ``There is just a
huge pool of customers to access.''
</P>
<P>
   And Eastern markets are among the few that are still not
dominated by a major carrier. In the last five years, most of the
major airlines have solidified their holds on so-called fortress
hubs in cities like Denver and Detroit, where they face little or
no major competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much left to fight for,'' Dutta said.
 &UR;  &LR;  Even after recent across-the-board fare increases by the major
airlines, the increased competition along the East Coast is
expected to push down prices. That, in turn, will make the region
more attractive to businesses and help economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, where Southwest began its Eastern push at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport in 1993, the average air
fares paid on all airlines were 34 percent less at the end of June
than they were before Southwest started flying, according to BACK
Associates, an aviation research firm in New Haven, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Before Southwest arrived, the average fare paid on US Airways
for a one-way flight between Providence and Baltimore was $184. By
June that number had fallen to $55.70 as US Airways matched
Southwest's prices.
</P>
<P>
   New York in particular is ripe for low-fare competition. With
the exception of People Express, air fares on short routes have
always been higher than the national average at the city's three
airports since the airline industry was deregulated in 1978. But in
recent years, as Southwest and other low-fare carriers have
expanded in many parts of the country, the gap has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices in cities with low-fare airlines have fallen, when
adjusted for inflation, 41 percent for flights less than 750 miles
between 1980 and 1997, according to Roberts, Roach &AMP; Associates,
another aviation consultant. But in New York they have risen
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its arrival in New York, Southwest has been a direct
threat to both Delta, which has a strong presence in Florida, and
US Airways, which is the largest airline in the East. Both
responded by persuading their pilots to accept wage concessions so
they could introduce low-cost subsidiaries to match Southwest's low
fares and still make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   The US Airways unit, Metrojet, started flying in June and has
already carried more than one million passengers. By May, it will
serve 22 cities from Florida to Boston with 202 daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, for the airline to exist over the next 20
years, we would become a shadow of what we are today if we didn't
do something like Metrojet,'' Rakesh Gangwal, US Airways' chief
executive has said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's answer to Southwest, Delta Express, grew 50 percent last
year and now serves 22 cities, flying mostly back and forth from
the Northeast to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest's entry into the East Coast has ruffled the
competition, leading to some unexpected moves. Though Metrojet is
meeting Southwest head on in Baltimore, US Airways more recently
decided to expand its flights from Dulles, in Virginia, near
Washington, including hourly service to LaGuardia, in a move many
industry analysts see as a way to sidestep Southwest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The expansion threatened United, which uses Dulles as its only
East Coast hub. Rather than cede control of Dulles to US Airways,
United now plans to add 40 daily departures from Dulles to 13
cities, including 7 on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   United is also considering introducing its low-fare service,
Shuttle by United, which it created in 1994 to compete with
Southwest in California and neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   And American Airlines is beginning jet service between MacArthur
and O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest alone cannot be credited with increasing
competition in the region. Flush with cash after four years of
robust profits, airlines have been buying new planes and seeking
new routes to fly them.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines plans to spend $1 billion building a terminal
at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Continental Airlines is
on the verge of announcing a $1 billion expansion at Newark
International Airport in New Jersey, where it is expanding its
international service.
</P>
<P>
   Even entrepreneurs are showing more interest in the industry
after a dearth of new airlines following the 1996 Valujet crash in
Florida. For example, plans for a new, as yet unnamed, discount
airline based at Kennedy are moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   At MacArthur, Southwest will begin with 12 flights a day to four
cities. While those are modest numbers, Southwest's strategy has
been to start small and grow methodically. MacArthur, now largely
home to commuter airlines, is in Islip, on the South Shore of Long
Island. It is a long drive from Manhattan even when there is no
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But Southwest says that it does not need to draw passengers from
the three big New York airports to succeed at Islip. In the
beginning, at least, it will focus on wooing Long Island's more
than 2.6 million residents. It has begun running ads in newspapers
and has billboards at Long Island Rail Road stations.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers will have to become accustomed to Southwest's
unusual style. The airline flies only narrow-body Boeing 737's, and
there are no assigned seats. Passengers are given numbers at the
gate and then are boarded in groups of 30.
</P>
<P>
   In the air, Southwest is famous for its lack of amenities _
``this is what our meals look like,'' one of its ads declares,
showing a bag of peanuts _ as well as its wisecracking pilots and
flight attendants. But the airline has one of the best safety
records and is highly regarded by business travelers for its strong
on-time record.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, which is based in Dallas, likes secondary airports
like MacArthur, because flying there avoids the high fees and
delays that are endemic to major gateways like Kennedy, LaGuardia
and Newark. Many believe that Southwest ultimately plans to fly
from a second airport, north of New York City, perhaps Stewart
International Airport, near Newburgh, N.Y., much as it has
bracketed Boston by flying from Rhode Island to the south and
Manchester, N.H., to the north. The airline says it has no such
plans but does not rule the idea out.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from large metropolitan areas, Southwest has been able
to expand the air travel market by attracting people who would
never have considered flying.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened in the two years since Southwest began
flying from T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, R.I., just south of
Providence. Drawn by fares as low as $39 for a one-way ticket to
Baltimore, travelers soon began driving to Warwick from
Massachusetts and Connecticut _ even as far away as New York and
Vermont _ to fly Southwest. Competing airlines increased service
and lowered their fares _ and not only to the cities where
Southwest was flying. In the last two years, the annual passenger
traffic at the airport has nearly doubled to 4.6 million people.
And the same thing has happened in other cities Southwest serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who fly down to Baltimore and see a Red Sox
game for cheaper than if they drove down to Boston,'' said Alfred
Testa Jr., the director of Manchester Airport, which Southwest
began serving last year. ``It is no longer strange to see people
downstairs in the terminal going to Florida for three days.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   That kind of attitude is also found among business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joke we have at the office is that we have the Southwest
route map, and that is our marketing plan,'' said Kelly Stewart,
the director of sales at Healthstream, a small company based in
Nashville that sells computer services to the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   While in the past low-fare competition has been short lived as
low-cost rivals were driven out of business, this time some airline
industry analysts believe that there is enough room in the East for
all the low-cost competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fare wars happen when high-fare carriers try to cut each
other's throats,'' said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline industry
analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. ``What you
have here is low-cost service that is good for everybody because it
changes consumer behavior.''

COUNTRY TWANG WITH AN EDGE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga.)   (af)  
 James Hunter writes frequently about music and books. 
By JAMES HUNTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, country music has happily honored tradition,
making do with only slight stylistic adjustments. With hummable
barroom melodies, in fairly simple arrangements, country songs
usually concerned themselves with cheating, drinking or loyalty.
But these days, all bets are off.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Garth Brooks arrived on the scene, bristling
with the energy of the 70s rock on which he grew up, while at the
same time acknowledging his indebtedness to the country stalwarts
George Jones and George Strait.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever mistook him for anything but a country boy. Then
along came Shania Twain. She guessed correctly that the country
audience was more than ready for pop sophistication. Her music
resonated with the rhythms of contemporary dance pop, and she made
videos that were as slick as anyone else's on MTV. As a result,
listeners could hear one of her pop ballads or dance tunes with
twangs and reasonably wonder, ``(italics)This(end italics) is
country?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a concern that has been heard since the 1960s, when the
producer and arranger Owen Bradley recorded Patsy Cline singing in
front of orchestras. Purists were no less dumbfounded by Cline's
music than they are by that of many of today's country artists.
</P>
<P>
   But the country boom of the early 90s has leveled off, and now,
to regain the momentum, country has to figure out _ again _ what it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Recent albums by Trisha Yearwood and Alan Jackson point in a
promising direction. The two singers grew up within 100 miles of
each other in Georgia, and their careers have spanned the ups and
downs of country this decade. Perhaps that's why Ms. Yearwood's
``Where Your Road Leads'' (MCA 70023) and Jackson's ``High
Mileage'' (Arista 07822-18864-Z) sidestep the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   They rely on an almost classical sense of country form that
still leaves room for innovation. And the tack has proved
successful: Ms. Yearwood's album has sold nearly a million copies
and Jackson's twice that since they were released late last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yearwood, named the Country Music Association's female
vocalist of the year for the last two years, has always craved
adventurousness in her music as much as Ms. Twain has in hers. On
``Never Let You Go Again'' and ``Love Wouldn't Lie to Me,'' Ms.
Yearwood sings these ballads in her lush yet minimally ornamented
style.
</P>
<P>
   They might be taken for pop, given arrangements that mix two
staples of country _ mandolins and steel guitars _ with dreamy
synthesizer lines and piano accents that could have come from
London pop sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby, I'm just heart and soul and flesh and bone,'' Ms.
Yearwood confesses on ``Wouldn't Any Woman,'' an uptempo
country-rocker. Throughout her career, Ms. Yearwood, 34, has
demonstrated a marked contrast in her music: straight-out gutsiness
on one hand and a sophisticated technique on the other.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Where Your Road Leads,'' she balances immediacy and
refinement. She has eliminated much of the regionalism that
characterized earlier country, paving the way for the fast-paced
styles of today's pop-conscious female country artists like Ms.
Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one would confuse Ms. Yearwood's singing with Celine
Dion's. Ms. Yearwood's unswerving concentration on words and
melodies communicates an intensity that might only be called
country. Invariably, she builds intricate moods of romantic regret
and disappointment that reflect country singers' tradition of a
nearly religious communion with their material. While she manages
to pay respects to the past, her singing is never a slave to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There Goes My Baby,'' which opens the album, may have a 60s
pop drift to its melody, but Ms. Yearwood delivers the song with a
clean, up-to-the-minute terseness. Nowhere in Ms. Yearwood's album
is this balance better showcased than on a song called ``Bring Me
All Your Loving,'' a finely wrought ballad that keeps turning into
a rock-blues belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing at the five and dime that I really need,'' Ms.
Yearwood sings, finally advising the man in the song to ``throw
your present in the creek.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``High Mileage,'' Jackson, 40, hews more closely to country
convention than Ms. Yearwood does. For him, a large part of
country's appeal involves its canny accumulation of catchy melodies
and rhythms to convey plain emotions. Like most male country
singers, he yearns for another country verity, stability, although
for Jackson the present is equally hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   On the album's first track, a swinging stroll entitled ``Right
on the Money,'' he strikes an entertaining balance between old and
new, likening a woman to ``my favorite song on a new set of
speakers.''
</P>
<P>
   A country minimalist, Jackson prefers spare acoustic guitar to
the studio bluster of much of contemporary country and pop. His
stripped-down approach allows him to arrive at the emotional core
of his romantic strivings. In an outstanding ballad like ``Gone
Crazy'' or the chipper-sounding mid-tempo ``A Woman's Love,'' he
goes full tilt, in his cool way, at subjects like loneliness and
contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll never understand,'' Jackson observes in the
latter, ``all the little things that make it grand.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, as much of a country classicist as anyone in the field,
has an amazing ability to connect with the concerns of a
contemporary audience that expects something new. His riskiest
effort on the album is ``I'll Go on Loving You,'' a celebration of
the redemptive qualities of sex in the aftermath of a romantic
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he resurrects a recitative style often used during
the 60s by singers like Conway Twitty and George Jones. In
addition, the producer Keith Stegall orchestrates the song with
sensuous strings and acoustic guitar work that sounds vaguely South
American.
</P>
<P>
   This preoccupation with the past and present is made clear in
his song entitled ``Little Man,'' in which the singer laments the
usurpation of mom-and-pop businesses by corporate culture. ``Now
the court square's just a set of streets that people go round, but
they seldom think,'' Jackson sings in his straightforward tenor.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when too much country music is either pop coinage or
tried-and-true formula, Jackson and Ms. Yearwood may be just what
Nashville needs right right now: thoughtful classicists with fresh
ideas.

   LONDON _ Despite the downpours of a British summer, it was a
``beautiful mornin' '' for choreographer Susan Stroman when she
woke to the enthusiastic reviews of the revival of ``Oklahoma!'' at
the Royal National Theater in London last July. Almost everyone
declared that the show really deserved its exclamation mark and
that Ms. Stroman, a two-time Tony Award winner, was a prime
participant in making this new version a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most striking innovation is Susan Stroman's
choreography,'' wrote John Gross in The Sunday Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   Jann Parry wrote in The Observer, ``Stroman's timing is
impeccable, building a routine from a simple gesture into a full
ensemble number, adding in props, kids, reprises, climaxes.''
</P>
<P>
   With her rope-twirling cowboys, down-home hoofing farm folk and
bawdy bordello girls, she had, they said, topped the pioneering
work achieved by Agnes de Mille, who choreographed the Rodgers and
Hammerstein Pulitzer Prize-winning musical when it burst upon
Broadway in 1943. As a sort of fringe on this super-surrey, Ms.
Stroman has been nominated for the Olivier award for best
choreographer of a musical, one of nine categories for which the
show was cited. The awards will be announced in London on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman, 39, grew up near Wilmington, Del., where she
studied ballet and tap and ``did the half-time shows at my local
high school,'' she recalled with a smile. From the first, she
wanted to be a choreographer, but knew she'd have to gain
experience as a dancer. She toured with shows like the original
productions of ``Chicago'' and ``Sugar Babies.'' Her first break
came with a Greenwich Village revival of ``Flora, the Red Menace.''
Liza Minnelli, Harold Prince, John Kander and Fred Ebb all caught
the show and liked her work.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ms. Stroman was invited to choreograph a Radio City
Music Hall show for Ms. Minnelli; later she was asked to work on
Prince's revival of ``Show Boat,'' which won her a Tony, and the
Kander and Ebb musical ``Steel Pier.'' While busy on ``Big,'' she
married its director, Mike Ockrent, who had also directed ``Crazy
for You,'' for which Ms. Stroman won her first Tony.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Stroman, the success of ``Oklahoma!'' was welcome news
after disappointments with ``Big'' and ``Steel Pier,'' which had
failed to click, despite praise for her choreography. ``For an
American to work at the Royal National Theater and with Trevor Nunn
is a very big deal,'' she said. ``However, I wouldn't have taken it
on simply to restage Ms. de Mille's choreography. If we hadn't got
permission from the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization to change
the dance music, much as I wanted to work with Trevor, I would have
refused. He mentioned one important phrase from the script he felt
summed up the piece: Aunt Eller says, `I don't say that I'm no
better than anyone else, but I'll be damned if I ain't just as
good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sold-out six-month run, ``Oklahoma!'' had to vacate
the National auditorium to make way for the next scheduled
production. Sir Cameron Mackintosh took on the show for a
commercial run, and it has just opened at the Lyceum Theater, where
healthy advance bookings topped 2.5 million pounds (about $4.22
million). It's expected to open on Broadway next season, and Nunn,
the director of the National as well as of this production, has
documented it on film for movie-house distribution in Australia and
eventual showing on television in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Just how did ``Oklahoma!,'' a musical that has become something
of a cliche of summer stock, suddenly turn into a hit hailed as
up-to-date as anything in Kansas City? One reason is that Nunn,
like Rodgers and Hammerstein, conceived it as a musicalized play.
He returned to the roots of the original, Lynn Riggs' darker drama,
``Green Grow the Lilacs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about folks staking out their territory and trying to
exist together,'' Ms. Stroman said this winter in New York. At the
turn of the century, Oklahoma was poised on the brink of statehood;
largely undeveloped territory, it was up for grabs by natural
adversaries, cowboys and farmers. The musical's slight plot
concerns Curly, a cowboy, and Laurey, a farm girl, and the surly
loner, Jud Fry. But its heart-stopping songs, like ``People Will
Say We're in Love'' and ``The Surrey With the Fringe on Top,'' have
become woven into America's musical fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, it has been part of theater lore that Agnes de Mille
all but revolutionized dance in musicals with her 15-minute dream
ballet and movement more fully integrated into the plot than ever
before. Held sacrosanct, those dances have largely been the ones
re-created in revivals. Yet, Ms. Stroman said wryly: ``If I asked a
musical theater team today, could I put a ballet at the end of Act
I, they would think I was crazy and say no. Here was my chance to
create my own ballet because Agnes had blazed the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In de Mille's original, Laurey and Curly were danced not by
Alfred Drake and Joan Roberts, who acted the roles, but by Marc
Platt and Katharine Sergava, classical ballet dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn also had no intention of making a clone of the original.
``I knew it would be important for me to have a choreographer who
was entirely familiar with the great de Mille tradition,'' he said.
``Someone who would have authority and understanding both of the
musical and choreographic styles that were suggested by the work. I
also wanted someone who was very individual and irreverent, who
wouldn't seem in awe and therefore in the shadow of what was done
previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Though on the face of it their alliance might appear as unlikely
as the cowman and the farmer's, ``it became clear to me,'' Nunn
said, ``that she's a natural-born collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Musical theater's an extremely collaborative business,'' he
added, ``which is not the same thing as saying that all people who
work in it are born to it. Many individualists kick and fight to
protect their own patch and become very sensitive _ and indeed
secretive _ about what they want to do because they believe that's
the only way to protect their interests. Susan is the absolute
opposite. She throws up ideas and accedes to others who have better
ones. There was great interchange, our judgments coincided. It was
one of those rare occasions where everything about the production
is happy and untrammeled from beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rodgers' daughter, Mary Rodgers, composer of ``Once Upon
a Mattress,'' was so delighted with the revival that she called it
``better than the original'' _ a remark she qualified only slightly
later. Initially, however, some with a say in the production had
doubts about engaging Ms. Stroman. James Hammerstein, the youngest
son of Oscar Hammerstein II, recalled shortly before his death in
January that the National had had various choreographers in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a few fleeting moments, I believe, they considered Matthew
Bourne,'' he said. ``I felt Trevor had picked the wrong lady, that
she was more clever than deep.'' But by the time the show opened he
was completely won over. ``She knew what she had to accomplish
dramatically and she chose well.'' Last December, he was happy to
fly to London to present Nunn with The Evening Standard Award for
best musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what made Ms. Stroman an interesting risk to take was
that Agnes de Mille's own feelings about `Oklahoma!' were primarily
about the ballet,'' said Theodore Chapin, president and executive
director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein organization. ``We're a
house that tends to acknowledge the artistic freedom people need.
The trick is to give them the freedom without giving them the
store. I think we won big time with Trevor and Stroman. Agnes
didn't have much regard for the other songs, dismissing `Kansas
City' with, `Oh, get someone in California; they do a good
two-step.' She didn't like `People Will Say We're in Love,' which,
interestingly, in the original appeared nowhere in the dance music
or the ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman said the team ``hoped to make the production more
authentic-looking for present-day audiences.'' ``As Trevor made
obvious, Americans romanticize the West, the Brits do not. So
good-bye pink gingham and geraniums on the front porch, and hello
dead rabbits and people in costumes that look like they've been on
a horse for six days.''
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Ms. Stroman went into the studio with the
dance-music arranger, David Krane, and the dance assistant, Stephen
Mear, and created the story in terms of dance. ``Each number should
fall out of the scenes and back in again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trevor and I talked through the different chorus characters,''
she continued, ``to insure they were the same in the scene work and
the choreography, and to weave all the songs and dance action
together seamlessly. I wanted our Laurey, Curly and Jud'' _
Josefina Gabrielle, Hugh Jackman and Shuler Hensley _ ``to dance
the dream ballet themselves. Josefina Gabrielle impressed me as a
singer and actor and beautiful ballerina too.'' (Her credits
include being a soloist with the National Ballet of Portugal, where
she danced in such classics as ``Apollo'' and ``Giselle.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the dream ballet, which pinpoints Laurey's confusion about
her feelings for Curly, Ms. Stroman ratcheted up the nightmare rape
and murder sequence. For Jackman, Ms. Stroman put the emphasis on
social dancing. ``Curly constantly says, `Come to the dance with
me,' meaning social dancing. So I incorporated a little country
clog step into `People Will Say We're in Love,' which we see again
in Laurey's dream about him and in `The Farmer and the Cowman' as a
sort of theme step of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her most inventive numbers is ``Kansas City,'' where,
according to the cowboy Will Parker (Jimmy Johnston),
``everything's up to date.'' He tells the assembled country folk
that he's excited about the ragtime music he heard on the streets.
``So we took that idea and melody and ragged it, which has never
been done before, and everyone breaks out into tap steps,'' Ms.
Stroman said. ``The Farmer and the Cowman'' becomes a boisterous
free-for-all barn dance that nearly gets out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   As the second opening night for ``Oklahoma!'' neared, Ms.
Stroman's many commitments prevented her from attending. ``I'm
doing a workshop, `Contact,' based on an idea I had with John
Weidman, which we're developing for Andre Bishop's Lincoln Center
Theater. It's about a man who's successful yet has something
missing in his life. When he sees this woman in a swing club he
becomes obsessed with her. It's a theme I rather like, something I
addressed in the Gershwin piece I choreographed for the Martha
Graham Company, about people unable to connect in a crowded city.''
(``But Not for Me'' is included in the current Graham season at the
Joyce Theater, and can be seen Sunday at 7:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   She's also working on a commission from Peter Martins to
choreograph a ballet to Duke Ellington's music for New York City
Ballet's spring season. ``In fact, because of doing a 30-minute
ballet for Graham and being asked to do a 15-minute ballet for a
musical, I feel stronger,'' Ms. Stroman said. ``Now I feel I can go
into New York City Ballet with a bit more confidence.''

CLINTON HIGHLIGHTS EDUCATION AGENDA IN ISSUING CHALLENGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton challenged the nation's educators
Tuesday to improve poor-performing schools or shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he cited Houston schools as a good example of what
strong intervention can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   His visit also displayed his still potent prowess for
fund-raising despite the on-going Senate impeachment trial. He
raised nearly $2 million Tuesday night at events in Boston and in
New York City for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to Brighton, an ethnically diverse, working-class
Boston neighborhood, to highlight his education agenda, especially
a $200 million item in his budget that would help school districts
bolster underachieving schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also issued a challenge to Republicans,
calling on them to make education a priority and disputing many
lawmakers' contentions that the federal government has no role to
play in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Congress this year will engage in the five-year review of the
federal education programs, and the White House intends to shape
the political debate in favor of more spending and more
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the nation's capital a day after unveiling a $1.77
trillion budget that puts the White House and the Republican-led
Congress on a collision course over how to spend future budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The president proposes using 11 percent of future budget
surpluses to beef-up funding for defense, public schools, the
environment and other domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, I think we should say to states and to school
districts, identify your worst-performing, least-improving schools,
turn them around or shut them down,'' Clinton told educators and
parents at Jackson Mann Elementary here.
</P>
<P>
   Boston next year will enact such a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I've listened to this debate for two decades
now, and half the time, when I hear people say we can't do
something, what they're really saying is, those kids are different
from my kids and I don't really believe they can learn. Well,
that's not true. All of our children can learn, and I intend to see
that they do,'' Clinton told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited Houston Independent School District as an
example of a school system doing the right thing. He said HISD once
listed 68 schools as low performers. ``Today, after much aggressive
intervention and hard work, the vast majority of those are off the
list,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, the number of HISD
schools considered among the poorest performers after statewide
assessments dropped from 10 to eight in 1998. In 1986-87 testing,
of HISD's 232 schools, 159 were on the state's list of low-
performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Boston also allowed the president to visit a state
where his popularity remains high despite the on-going impeachment
trial in the Senate and to champion an issue that people rank as a
high priority for government action.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for an end to social promotion of
students, and champions testing for new teachers, more money for
his goal of 100,000 new teachers, and more accountability from
educators. It seeks report cards on schools for parents and money
to repair and replace 5,000 school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the parents and teachers that his education agenda
``will be very controversial'' with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people argue that even though we spend $15 billion a year
on public education, the national government has no business
whatever holding the system accountable for results. They say that
we're trying to micromanage schools. Nothing could be further from
the truth,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser, said
Clinton's speech was intended to set out ``in the clearest way he
has so far'' terms of the education debate with Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reed dismissed Republican complaints that the federal government
should not interfere with local control of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to have that debate. If anyone in Congress wants
to step over and say continuing social promotions ought to be a
local options, that having unqualified teachers ought to be a local
option, or that ignoring failing schools ought to be a local
option, we challenge them to do so,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said 19 states currently are putting low-performing schools
on notice.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his education address, Clinton appeared at a
fund-raising luncheon where 80 Democratic supporters paid $10,000
each to dine with the president. Clinton attended a reception
afterward where 500 party supporters were asked to pay $250 each.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first on-the-road fund-raising trip of the
year. Both of Massachusetts' Democratic senators, Edward Kennedy
and John Kerry, traveled aboard Air Force One with the president to
Boston. Both support the president against charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice being debated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no reference to the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president flew to New York City where he was joined
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for a dinner at Le Cirque
2000. More than 100 people paid $10,000 apiece to attend.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Last June, Takaharu Akimoto's boss politely and
apologetically asked him to quit his job as a production manager at
Shoshiba Manufacturing Co., a midsized engine parts maker
affiliated with the beleaguered Nissan Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `Impossible!' &UR;  &LR; '' Akimoto recalled. ``I told
him I didn't want to quit, please let me stay longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But in today's Japan, the impossible has become possible, and in
December, seven years shy of his retirement, Akimoto ``quit'' and
joined the 2.91 million other Japanese who are officially looking
for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst period of my life,'' he said. ``I've had
some serious setbacks before, but this is totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is suffering its highest rate of unemployment, 4.1
percent, since the government started keeping statistics in 1949.
Almost twice as many people are looking for jobs as there are job
openings, and many of the available positions are in low-paying,
unskilled areas.
</P>
<P>
   That strikes a blow to the heart of Japan's self-image, and the
whole country is reeling. Although Japan's unemployment is low
compared with the rate in many other countries, full employment, or
close to it, is a key clause in the social contract that has kept
the public complacent and one political party in power almost
consistently since World War II. Now, for the first time since the
lean years after Japan's defeat in the war, most people here know
someone who is out of a job _ and fear that they could be next.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the challenge of finding work, the jobless are
battling shame and despair. Akimoto, for instance, kept his job
loss a secret from his wife for a week. ``I was at a loss as to how
we would survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliation sometimes flares into anger, an emotion rarely
on public display in Japan. An irate job seeker waved his fist in
the face of a television reporter filming at one branch of the
government employment agency known as Hello! Work, accusing the
reporter of invading his privacy and seeking to capitalize on his
woes. Job seekers at another branch merely turned their faces away
the instant they saw a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese people are ashamed to be unemployed,'' said Masahide
Naito, who is in charge of job seekers over 45 at the Iidabashi
branch of Hello! Work. ``It's an embarrassment, something that you
hide.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese employment system, heavy on lifetime loyalty
guaranteed by seniority-based pay, has been crumbling since 1993,
when a slew of corporate titans started campaigns to trim their
work forces.
</P>
<P>
   But that erosion moved at the pace of molasses compared with
what happened last year, when the unemployment rate jumped an
alarming seven-tenths of a percentage point, to the current rate of
4.1 percent. Compounding the problem, companies struggling to avoid
layoffs cut wages, which fell 6.8 percent in December, the worst
decline on record.
</P>
<P>
   These statistics have rocked the psyche of a nation that has
previously regarded itself as blessedly immune from the economic
afflictions suffered by other developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been hearing about such things on television, but now
I'm hearing these stories directly from my classmates, and I'm
hearing not just from one but from many,'' said Hisako Aoyama, one
of three women in a class of 28 studying janitorial services at the
Tokyo Metropolitan Shinagawa Technical College, a vocational school
financed by the city government.
</P>
<P>
   It is a deeply unsettling experience for most Japanese,
particularly the men over 45 who are being forced en masse out of
companies they joined as college graduates. Their high salaries and
looming lump-sum retirement payments provide an obvious target for
corporate cost-cutters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 51, I'm at a time of change in my life,'' said Shigeru
Kikuya, a classmate of Mrs. Aoyama, who lost his job as a
procurement officer in a factory last March. ``The only thing I can
do is persevere and hope I can turn my life around.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects of landing a job for most men his age are slim
at best, according to officials at Hello! Work.
</P>
<P>
   After Akimoto, the former Shoshiba manager, finally told his
wife of his plight, she urged him to seek help from the Tokyo
Managers' Union, a group set up four years ago to represent middle
managers who are not union members.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime employee of Shoshiba whose salary had increased in
lock step with his seniority, Akimoto had expected to work at the
company until he retired at age 60. But with Nissan fighting for
its life, Akimoto's company could no longer afford to keep him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry,'' he said. ``But I don't know where to direct my
anger. The company did try to help me find another job at least.''
</P>
<P>
   The only jobs he has found so far are as a driver or as the man
who waves a light baton at construction sites to direct traffic. He
would earn less than 200,000 yen a month after tax, or about $1,770
at current exchange rates. That is less than the unemployment
benefits he receives, but those will run out in late March unless
he enrolls in a job training course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, rather than immediately taking a job as a driver, I
would like to continue to look for a while,'' Akimoto said. ``But
there is no question that my income will be less than half what I
was earning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of the social costs that may accompany frustration of
the sort Akimoto is experiencing, the government goes to great
lengths to try to keep unemployment figures from rising, providing
generous public subsidies to companies to keep workers on their
payrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so-called invisible unemployment in corporations
today that may become visible in the future, in which case the rate
will become much higher than it is now,'' warned Akira Amari, the
Labor Minister, at a recent press gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Amari refused to make any estimates about what the real level
would be. ``These kinds of figures can drive up the insecurity of
the Japanese consumer, so, excuse me, I cannot say what the figures
are,'' he said. ``It's my corporate secret.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret, though, that the need to create jobs provides
much of the impetus behind the vast sums of money the government
has spent on public works in the last several years. But although
the government has spent upward of $800 billion to stimulate
economic activity, the unemployment rate has climbed steadily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just after the measures are implemented, the number of jobs
that comes open increases a little,'' said Kazuaki Mishima, an
official at the Iidabashi Hello! Work office. ``But the effect
doesn't last long, the measures don't really have that much
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the record unemployment rate, what is remarkable is that
so many workers have retained their jobs. Automobile production
dropped more than 8 percent last year, for instance, and yet it is
rare to hear of an unemployed auto worker.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the head count is often the last resort for struggling
companies. The obligation binding employer to employee is still
strong here _ so strong that in some cases, business owners have
committed suicide so that their life insurance proceeds can be used
to pay workers and creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Honda Motor Co. halted production at its plant in Thailand last
year but has kept workers on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And Mitsubishi Corp. encourages marginal workers to take a year
off for retraining at its expense, after which they can either find
work elsewhere or come back to the company. ``We cannot restructure
in the U.S. way,'' said Minoru Makihara, the chairman of Mitsubishi
and an outspoken proponent of greater labor mobility in Japan.
``The Japanese way of insuring the way of life and living is a very
respectable thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there are shortages of labor in important areas of
the economy, like computer technology. ``We're very good at making
computers but not so good at using them,'' he said. ``This is a
highly educated population. In six months, we could produce a whole
new corps of people who would be in great demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Masue Otani is someone who lost out to a computer. After working
seven years in the mail room at the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications, she had to leave her job because she was being
replaced by a computer. ``Because I cannot use a computer, I'm
afraid I cannot find a job,'' she said as she scanned the job
offerings at the Iidabashi Hello! Work. ``Every available job asks
for someone who can use a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Otani, whose husband cannot work because of a chronic
stomach problem that periodically puts him in the hospital, is
making ends meet with her unemployment insurance, and her sons, who
live at home, give her a portion of their incomes. ``It's very
difficult and frightening,'' she said. ``I don't know what will
happen to us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many people are turning to vocational schools for retraining,
generating an explosion in demand for courses in gardening, home
health care and hotel and restaurant services, among others.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tokyo Metropolitan Shinagawa Technical College, 113
people applied for a class in business accounting that had room for
15 students. A class on home health care, a burgeoning business in
Japan, where the population is aging, was had 10 times as many
applicants as students.
</P>
<P>
   The college is unlikely to expand to meet the demand, however.
The bulk of its budget comes from the Tokyo metropolitan
government, which is effectively bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The mix of students has changed markedly in the last year, said
Naomitsu Kondo, the school's director. ``We've always had some new
college graduates seeking training, but recently there has been a
big influx of people coming in because of restructuring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Takeshi Kono is one of the new breed of students. Now 58, Kono
has lost two jobs to restructuring in the last three years. For
much of his working life, he was an employee of a major supermarket
chain, most recently the director of building security and safety.
He lost that job a couple of years ago and began driving a delivery
truck for a smaller supermarket company.
</P>
<P>
   That job, too, evaporated, and now Kono is learning how to use a
mop to put a high-gloss shine on linoleum floors and how to dispose
of garbage that has to be separated for recycling most efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out that my experience is totally useless in getting a
job,'' he said. ``There seem to be a lot of positions available
cleaning office buildings after hours, so I'm taking this class.''
</P>
<P>
   Kono expects to earn about one-third of his previous income. He
no longer goes fishing and hiking with his friends, although he has
scraped together enough money to send his daughter to college.
</P>
<P>
   For all his hard work and effort, Kono may never find work
again. As of last December, only 25 percent of the school's March
graduates had found jobs _ and men over 45, whose former salaries
were high, have extremely limited opportunities. At the Hello! Work
office in Iidabashi recently, there were only four new listings of
jobs for men over 45, while the bulletin board featuring new
listings for women under 35, a group that is also marked by high
unemployment, is covered with job descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Kikuya, Kono's classmate, has been out of work since March, but
he still finds his situation incomprehensible. He looked for months
for another clerical job where he could make use of his experience
administering a midsized machine tools manufacturer but found
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people will say I was too optimistic,'' Kikuya said. ``I
expected it to be difficult, but I never expected it to be
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the traditional Japanese employment system to
sitting in a tub of lukewarm water, a favorite metaphor here for
describing a life that is not overly comfortable but not unpleasant
either. But he was thrown out of the tub and feels colder leaving a
tub of lukewarm water than one filled with scalding water. ``If you
are in lukewarm water,'' he said, ``you are lulled into
ignorance.''

CLINTON HIGHLIGHTS EDUCATION AGENDA IN ISSUING CHALLENGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton challenged the nation's educators
Tuesday to improve poor-performing schools or shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he cited Houston schools as a good example of what
strong intervention can accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   His visit also displayed his still potent prowess for
fund-raising despite the on-going Senate impeachment trial. He
raised nearly $2 million Tuesday night at events in Boston and in
New York City for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to Brighton, an ethnically diverse, working-class
Boston neighborhood, to highlight his education agenda, especially
a $200 million item in his budget that would help school districts
bolster underachieving schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also issued a challenge to Republicans,
calling on them to make education a priority and disputing many
lawmakers' contentions that the federal government has no role to
play in public education.
</P>
<P>
   Congress this year will engage in the five-year review of the
federal education programs, and the White House intends to shape
the political debate in favor of more spending and more
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the nation's capital a day after unveiling a $1.77
trillion budget that puts the White House and the Republican-led
Congress on a collision course over how to spend future budget
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The president proposes using 11 percent of future budget
surpluses to beef-up funding for defense, public schools, the
environment and other domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``From now on, I think we should say to states and to school
districts, identify your worst-performing, least-improving schools,
turn them around or shut them down,'' Clinton told educators and
parents at Jackson Mann Elementary here.
</P>
<P>
   Boston next year will enact such a program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, I've listened to this debate for two decades
now, and half the time, when I hear people say we can't do
something, what they're really saying is, those kids are different
from my kids and I don't really believe they can learn. Well,
that's not true. All of our children can learn, and I intend to see
that they do,'' Clinton told the cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited Houston Independent School District as an
example of a school system doing the right thing. He said HISD once
listed 68 schools as low performers. ``Today, after much aggressive
intervention and hard work, the vast majority of those are off the
list,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Texas Education Agency, the number of HISD
schools considered among the poorest performers after statewide
assessments dropped from 10 to eight in 1998. In 1986-87 testing,
of HISD's 232 schools, 159 were on the state's list of low-
performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Boston also allowed the president to visit a state
where his popularity remains high despite the on-going impeachment
trial in the Senate and to champion an issue that people rank as a
high priority for government action.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for an end to social promotion of
students, and champions testing for new teachers, more money for
his goal of 100,000 new teachers, and more accountability from
educators. It seeks report cards on schools for parents and money
to repair and replace 5,000 school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the parents and teachers that his education agenda
``will be very controversial'' with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people argue that even though we spend $15 billion a year
on public education, the national government has no business
whatever holding the system accountable for results. They say that
we're trying to micromanage schools. Nothing could be further from
the truth,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's domestic policy adviser, said
Clinton's speech was intended to set out ``in the clearest way he
has so far'' terms of the education debate with Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Reed dismissed Republican complaints that the federal government
should not interfere with local control of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to have that debate. If anyone in Congress wants
to step over and say continuing social promotions ought to be a
local options, that having unqualified teachers ought to be a local
option, or that ignoring failing schools ought to be a local
option, we challenge them to do so,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said 19 states currently are putting low-performing schools
on notice.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his education address, Clinton appeared at a
fund-raising luncheon where 80 Democratic supporters paid $10,000
each to dine with the president. Clinton attended a reception
afterward where 500 party supporters were asked to pay $250 each.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first on-the-road fund-raising trip of the
year. Both of Massachusetts' Democratic senators, Edward Kennedy
and John Kerry, traveled aboard Air Force One with the president to
Boston. Both support the president against charges of perjury and
obstruction of justice being debated in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made no reference to the Senate impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president flew to New York City where he was joined
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for a dinner at Le Cirque
2000. More than 100 people paid $10,000 apiece to attend.

U.S. ATTACKS A MICROSOFT VIDEOTAPE AS MISLEADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In one of the most sensational moments since the
Microsoft antitrust trial began, the government accused a senior
Microsoft executive in federal court on Tuesday of offering a
misleading videotape into evidence and using it to try to discredit
an important government witness.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, James Allchin, the Microsoft executive, was
embarrassed and said that his staff had made an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Allchin,'' said the government lawyer, David Boies, ``you
do understand that you came in here and you swore this was
accurate?''
</P>
<P>
   Allchin replied, ``What I'm seeing here is that they filmed the
wrong system.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Microsoft said it had actually shown the
correct videotape; it said an unexplained problem with the computer
used in the taped demonstration had created a mistaken impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's demonstration was completely accurate,'' a company
spokesman, Mark Murray, asserted on the courthouse steps at the end
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Boies, the Justice Department lawyer, said the
episode raised questions about Microsoft's credibility. ``The court
has to evaluate the credibility of the witness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the conflict on Tuesday were videotaped
demonstrations that Microsoft presented on Monday. One tape was an
effort to debunk the testimony of Edward Felten, a Princeton
University professor who devised a program that he said extricated
Microsoft's Web browser, Internet Explorer, from the Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is crucial because the government contends that
Microsoft's decision to combine Windows with a Web browser was an
abuse of monopoly power to thwart competition. Microsoft maintains
that it was merely providing an integrated product offering a
benefit to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said that Felten's program had merely hidden the
browser, that all of the browser's programming code remained.
Microsoft also maintained in the demonstration tape played on
Monday that Felten's program had seriously degraded the performance
of Windows in other important ways.
</P>
<P>
   One part of the demonstration tape showed a slow response when a
computer tried to connect to a Microsoft Web page. In the
background, a Microsoft narrator intoned, ``This shows the
performance degradation that has occurred because of running Dr.
Felten's program.''
</P>
<P>
   But on cross-examination, Boies challenged the accuracy of this
demonstration by showing that the label, or ``title bar,''
identifying the program running on the computer had not changed as
it should have if Felten's program had been run.
</P>
<P>
   The title bar indicated that the computer was still running
Internet Explorer, suggesting that Felten's program had not been
run on this computer at all and that the poor performance was a
function of Windows and Internet Explorer, not Felten's program.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the world could your people run this program when they
knew it wasn't accurate?'' Boies demanded. Allchin insisted that no
deceit was intended and that ``they probably just filmed the wrong
screen shot.'' He also said he knew from his own tests that the
decline in performance from Felten's program was real in any case.
</P>
<P>
   During the lunch break, Allchin and other executives made calls
to the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., to find out what
had happened. When they returned to court, Allchin said he had
learned that the computer shown in the tape had in fact been
altered by Felten's program. But for some reason, he said, the
title bar did not change as it should have.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case without a
jury in U.S. District Court, did not react visibly to any of the
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In Felten's own testimony in December, he accused Microsoft of
sabotaging his program by redesigning a company Web page so it
would not work with computers using the program. The accusation
infuriated the judge, who glared angrily at the Microsoft lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a written filing with the court, Microsoft did not
explain how the problem with the Web page had occurred, but denied
doing anything that would have caused it.
</P>
<P>
   When the testimony had ended Tuesday, William Neukom, the
Microsoft senior vice president for law and corporate affairs,
said: ``This is a tiny, tiny part of a very long tape. And it
doesn't stand for anything more than the fact that things can
happen with software.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Boies said: ``Microsoft says this is some kind of
mistake. But we don't know how the mistake occurred. We don't
really have an explanation. All we do know is that the tape they
put into evidence is not reliable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, the government's questioning of Allchin elicited an
acknowledgment that nearly all the benefits of Microsoft's decision
to integrate the Web browser into Windows would be available to
users who bought a version of Windows with no browser and then
installed Microsoft's browser separately.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Boies spent less than one full day cross-examining
Allchin, who is in charge of the Microsoft division that manages
the Windows operating system. And he barely referred to Allchin's
exhaustive, direct testimony.
</P>
<P>
   That led Murray of Microsoft to declare that Allchin's
``150-page testimony has now gone into the record virtually
untouched.'' He added, ``The government is working very hard to
create a mood in the courtroom while we are trying to create a
legal record.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boies said he was not concerned about that. ``One of the
reasons we go into issues of credibility of witnesses is so the
judge has a chance to decide who to believe,'' he added. ``All of
this is a question of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   With so much of the record in this trial the subject of polar
interpretations by the opposing sides, government officials say,
the judge's perception of each side's credibility could prove
critical.

SECOND FIDDLES, FRONT AND CENTER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Michele Willens' most recent article for Arts and Leisure was about
the film company Intermedia and its movie ``Playing by Heart.''  
 By MICHELE WILLENS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when the Academy Award nominations are announced,
the people behind ``Stepmom'' will learn if their Oscar strategy
paid off: to have Susan Sarandon nominated for best actress and
Julia Roberts nominated for best supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   If they succeed, it will be quite a coup. Although there's no
reason to question Columbia Pictures when it maintains that Ms.
Sarandon has a few more lines, it is, nevertheless, Ms. Roberts who
has top billing, the title role and, of course, that smile.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Billy Bob Thornton may nab a supporting nomination
for ``A Simple Plan,'' in which his role as the dimwitted brother
is only slightly less pivotal than Bill Paxton's more levelheaded
sibling. In fact, Thornton is pretty much a part of the brothers'
simple plan from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Civil Action,'' there is no arguing that Robert Duvall
plays second fiddle to John Travolta. But in less competitive
years, Duvall's high-powered lawyer might have been a best-actor
contender. (Let's not forget that Anthony Hopkins won best actor
for 17 minutes of screen time in ``Silence of the Lambs.'') What is
going on?
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing has become so political,'' says Stan
Rosenfield, a publicist for Robert De Niro, Danny Devito and other
actors. ``If you have two leads in a movie, the feeling is they may
cancel each other out, so you choose to put one up for supporting.
It also comes down to things like how many sure bets there are in
one category, so you push your person for the other.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were with
us today, Sundance would be relegated to supporting actor. ``The
supporting categories are very arbitrary,'' says Robert Rehme,
president of the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences. ``There is a book of rules, but they don't really mean
anything. The nominations are based largely on where the studios
and the actors' representatives choose to place them.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-driving publicity machines also use supporting
nominations to telegraph various messages about an actor, and the
academy voters are easy marks. The comeback twist, for example, may
help Bill Murray, whose performance as a sardonic school benefactor
in ``Rushmore'' has already earned him various honors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the new profundity spin, which could this year
benefit Lisa Kudrow, whose work as a sarcastic young spinster in
``The Opposite of Sex'' revealed depths not seen each week on
``Friends.'' ``I'm already reading better scripts and hearing about
interest from directors I've always admired,'' says Ms. Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   For a quintessential supporting player like Joan Allen, who has
become the Meryl Streep of that category, she seems primed for her
third supporting nomination as the '50s sitcom wife in
``Pleasantville.''(She has had previous nominations for ``The
Crucible'' and ``Nixon.'')
</P>
<P>
   Others appear to win nominations as much for their body of work
as for the film at hand. Robin Williams, who won a supporting-actor
Oscar last year for ``Good Will Hunting,'' might fall into that
category. Another is Lynn Redgrave, almost unrecognizable as the
drab, protective housekeeper in ``Gods and Monsters,'' who may well
get a nod this year.
</P>
<P>
   So too may Duvall, who says ``it would be OK to win'' a
supporting Oscar for ``A Civil Action.'' ``But if I should have won
for anything,'' he says, ``it was `Apostle,' '' the 1997 film he
starred in and also wrote and directed.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a film company's strategies, if any, were
far less complex _ when supporting meant supporting. Character
actors were kept under contract to the studios and strategically
cast to bring color and texture to even the smallest roles.
</P>
<P>
   Chazz Palminteri, a supporting nominee for ``Bullets Over
Broadway'' in 1994 and a co-star in the film version of ``Hurly
Burly'' now in theaters, revels in those roles. ``Jack Nicholson
once said, `All I need are three great scenes,' and I believe that.
In fact, I just took a role for three great scenes playing the
rival head of a mob family to Bob De Niro. I got to come in for a
short time and score big.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, actors take on supporting roles because they
allow them to show new colors, be it Sinatra going songless, Ann
Margret going topless or Bill Murray going humorless.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Blethyn accepted the secondary female part, as the
blowsy, brassy mother in the recent film ``Little Voice,'' even
though she was a best-actress nominee two years ago for her role as
the birth mother whose daughter returns in ``Secrets and Lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been used to sympathetic parts, so I liked the challenge
of this,'' she says of ``Little Voice.'' ``It's a smaller role, but
because she talks so much, she seems dominant. I only wish they
gave an Oscar for loudest performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Rush, who won as best actor two years ago for
``Shine,'' is now a likely supporting contender for his performance
as a theater owner sweating out young Will's writer's block in
``Shakespeare In Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was three pages into the script when I knew I wanted to do
it,'' says Rush. ``And it was pretty obvious I wasn't going to be
Will or Viola. I come from the theater and repertory where you are
the lead one week and the lead's friend the next, so the number of
lines doesn't enter into it.''
</P>
<P>
   (One of his co-stars in the film, Judi Dench, who was nominated
last year for best actress for ``Mrs. Brown,'' is also a contender
for a supporting nomination this year.)
</P>
<P>
   One who always manages deep impact is Kathy Bates, whose
performance as a tormented political operative came like a blast of
oxygen midway through ``Primary Colors.'' Although a 1990
best-actress winner for playing an author's demented fan in
``Misery,'' she is realistic about the paucity of interesting
leading roles, especially for those who are not typical beauties or
ingenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like playing a variety of sizes,'' says Ms. Bates,
who had one scene as a judge at the end of ``A Civil Action.'' ``I
made it known I would do anything, including bring coffee to Steve
Zaillian,'' she says of the writer-director. ``For me it's more
about: `Is it a place I haven't been before? Who's directing? Who
else is playing?' I'm essentially a character actor, and it's very
rare to be given leads and even rarer for a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading men are finding a niche in the supporting life, too.
Paul Newman takes on a bite-size part in ``Message In a Bottle,''
opening this week, and last year memorable supporting performances
were turned in by Sean Connery, as the classy patriarch in
``Playing By Heart,'' Jon Voight, as an Irish law-enforcement
officer in ``The General,'' and James Coburn, as an abusive,
alcoholic father in ``Affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There really is a kind of freedom in supporting roles,'' says
Coburn, whose performance has already been nominated for a Screen
Actors Guild award. ``I mean, what have you got to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall puts it pretty succinctly: ``The most enviable
profession is a supporting actor. You go off to a location, you
have a chance with the women, you get good money and you don't feel
all the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is likely to begrudge Duvall _ or Ms. Roberts _ should
they earn supporting Oscar nominations. The pity is those who may
be left behind, those who truly performed a supporting role:
melding into the story, helping to propel the main character along,
maybe even breaking out of a large and talented cast.
</P>
<P>
   Someone like Jeremy Davies, who played the cowardly young
corporal in ``Saving Private Ryan.'' ``I sort of became the eye of
the audience,'' says Davies. ``Much of what I did wasn't in the
original script, but Steven Spielberg started telling the story
more from my point of view, and he really allowed my character to
have an arc. The whole thing changed my skinny little career.''

By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A half century after its premiere, ``Death of a
Salesman'' has become an American classic _ a perennial produced
around the world, from Baltimore to Beijing, and routinely taught
in high-school English classes and mounted in community theaters.
The play has become an institution, part of the accepted theater
canon, and today even boasts its own website
(www.deathofasalesman.com), where, in an ironic twist on its
central theme, you will be able to purchase souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening Wednesday of the Goodman Theater's new
production of ``Salesman'' at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on
Broadway _ 50 years to the day from the play's 1949 world premiere
_ it is clear that many of the debates that attended the original
opening have long since become obsolete. We no longer question
whether a play about a little man (a ``low-man,'' as opposed to a
king or powerful ruler) can be called a tragedy, just as we no
longer question the ethnicity of the play's hero, the Jewishness or
non-Jewishness of his locution.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, other debates persist. While
``Salesman'' opened to _ and has continued to enjoy _ enormous
popular success, both the play and its author have maintained a
less than stellar reputation among many highbrow critics.
``Salesman'' has been debunked as a didactic commentary on the
bankruptcy of the American dream of success, while Miller has been
dismissed as an epigone of Ibsenism, a preachy, pompous and, yes,
portentous writer who belongs, like Clifford Odets and Lillian
Hellman, to a middlebrow, pre-modernist past.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, it is an overly simplistic judgment _ especially
when it comes to ``Salesman,'' Miller's most famous, most enduring
and in many ways most anomalous play.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically enough, Miller's own ponderous pronouncements have
tended to reinforce the perception of his work as an outmoded form
of social realism. In one 1950 essay, he argued that ``Death of a
Salesman'' _ which chronicles the last day in the life of a
salesman named Willy Loman, who has lost his job, and, he fears,
the love of his son Biff _ is ``the tragedy of a man who did
believe that he alone was not meeting the qualifications laid down
for mankind by those clean-shaven frontiersmen who inhabit the
peaks of broadcasting and advertising offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy the failed salesman and willful suicide, Miller suggested
in his own autobiography, represents the fate of a true believer in
America's false dream of success: ``This pseudo life that thought
to touch the clouds by standing on top of a refrigerator, waving a
paid-up mortgage at the moon, victorious at last.'' His
singleminded pursuit of success has blinded him to the love of his
own family, robbed him of his sense of self, and left him to
subsist on a diet of illusions.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Eugene O'Neill, who declared that he was
``interested only in the relation of man and God,'' Miller has
implied that the tragedy in his own work springs from the relation
between man and his environment, between man and the conditions
that suppress him and pervert ``the flowing out of his love and
creative instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright's own unhappy experiences during the Depression
and the 1950s, when he was convicted of contempt of Congress for
refusing to name names before the House Un-American Activities
Committee, persuaded him, he has said, that politics ``determines
the exteriors of your personality,'' and he remained convinced, he
once stated, that all serious plays ultimately address a single
question: ``How may a man make of the outside world a home?''
</P>
<P>
   Truly great work, he declared in a 1958 interview, is ``that
work which will show at one and the same time the power and force
of the human will working with and against the force of society
upon it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Robert Falls' darkly hued new staging from Chicago,
``Death of a Salesman'' seems less a social drama about what Harold
Clurman called ``the breakdown of the whole concept of salesmanship
inherent in our society'' than a fierce portrait of a father and
son, caught in a fatal embrace of love and resentment and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   And Brian Dennehy's Willy Loman seems less a man, in Miller's
words, who ``embodies in himself some of the most terrible
conflicts running through the streets of America today'' than a
perpetual adolescent caught in the dizzying gap between reality and
his own expectations. This Willy Loman, like Dustin Hoffman's in
1984 on Broadway, may not be a tragic figure _ to the last moment,
self-awareness continues to elude him _ but like Kierkegaard's
``unhappiest man,'' he is a touching one, subsisting on past memory
and future hope. His dilemmas are more psychological than
sociological, more existential than environmental.
</P>
<P>
   The play's structure, too, seems a far cry from the rough-hewn
carpentry often associated with Miller's work. There is a dreamlike
quality to ``Salesman,'' an expressionistic invocation of shifting
moods and time frames that helps conceal the creaky stage machinery
apparent in so many other Miller plays from ``All My Sons'' (1947)
to ``Broken Glass'' (1994).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``Salesman,'' too, has its problems: a
paint-by-numbers Freudianism, a conveniently withheld secret that
overshadows the second act, and supporting characters who are
little more than cardboard cutouts. As written, Willy's
long-suffering wife, Linda, is basically a doormat _ a passive
accomplice in her husband's denial, what we would today call an
enabler. And Willy's successful brother, Ben _ who walked into the
jungle at 17, and walked out at 21, a rich man with diamonds in his
pockets _ remains a transparent symbol of rough and ready
capitalism, a Horatio Alger joke.
</P>
<P>
   These flaws, however, are subsumed by the play's visceral and
deeply affecting portrait of father and son: Willy, intent for
years on passing on to his son his own tarnished dreams; and Biff,
finally shorn of those illusions, intent on making his father face
the hard facts of his existence.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The play limns Willy's fears of losing Biff's love and his own
longings for immortality _ his desire not just to be liked, but to
be well liked _ and it immerses the audience in Willy's conflicted,
contradictory state of mind. In fact, Miller once noted that his
original title for ``Salesman'' was ``The Inside of His Head.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was constructed on the premise that Willy, in his
growing panic and confusion, sees time not as a continuum but as a
simultaneity of moments past and present. In the play's
confessional structure, current anxieties fade into remembered
guilts, and dreams and regrets blur and overlap _ a structure not
dissimilar to the narrative strategy adopted by Miller in his own
1987 autobiography, ``Timebends.'' The play, Miller wrote in that
book, was meant to ``cut through time like a knife through a layer
cake or a road through a mountain revealing its geologic layers.''
</P>
<P>
   In later works like ``After the Fall'' (1964) and ``The Price''
(1968), Miller would again try to focus on his characters' inner
lives, but never again with such urgency and skill as in
``Salesman.'' His other better-known plays would remain rooted in
more topical concerns and feature characters who are more clearly
symbols than flesh-and-blood human beings. ``All My Sons'' (1947)
depicts a businessman _ read greedy capitalist _ covering up his
role in the manufacture of defective parts that doomed 21 Air Force
planes during World War II. ``The Crucible'' (1953) uses the Salem
witch hunts of the late 1600s as a metaphor for the communist witch
hunts of the 1950s. ``A View From the Bridge'' (1955) examines the
costs of McCarthy-era betrayal through its portrait of a
longshoreman who rats on two illegal immigrants. ``The American
Clock'' (1980), inspired by Studs Terkel's ``Hard Times,'' attempts
to provide a panoramic portrait of the Depression. And ``The Ride
Down Mount Morgan'' (1991) casts a cold eye on the rampant
selfishness of the Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   All too often in these works, Miller's efforts to ``prove the
theme'' result in sanctimonious speechifying, message-driven
melodramatics and two-dimensional characters who come across as
illustrations of one or more social ills.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the most successful productions of these plays
have played down the political, polemic aspects of the texts, to
reveal their psychological subtext, the bedrock emotions of sexual
passion and familial love, betrayal and guilt that lurk beneath the
sociology. Last year, the Roundabout Theater Company's highly
acclaimed production of ``A View From the Bridge'' shrugged off the
play's McCarthy-era echoes to focus on the hero's secret obsession
with his wife's teen-age niece and the psychosexual drives that
lead him to commit a shocking act of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Hytner's dazzling 1996 movie version of ``The
Crucible'' similarly stripped away that play's McCarthy-era
moorings: by firmly grounding the story in the particulars of
17th-century Salem, the film uncovered the story's primal drama,
its fascination with the consequences of lying and deception and
sexual repression.
</P>
<P>
   The success of such productions underscores the current
renaissance that Miller has been enjoying _ not just in England,
where his work has found a ready audience among theatergoers
reared, since the heyday of anti-Thatcherism, on politically
committed playwriting, but also in the United States, where the
Signature Theater Company recently completed a yearlong
retrospective of his plays in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What accounts for Miller's continuing appeal? Perhaps some of
the very aspects of his work that seem so old-fashioned _ his moral
seriousness and fondness for mythic intonations (inspired by his
favorite works, the Bible and Greek tragedies) _ are refreshing
anomalies in this age of relentless irony and cynicism.
</P>
<P>
   In a day when the avant-garde has insistently purveyed a vision
of a fractured, fragmented world, Miller's assumption that ``life
has meaning'' appeals to our vestigial belief (or hope) that the
dots  &UR; can &LR;  be connected, that a pattern  &UR; can &LR;  be found in the
carpet. And in a day when the arts are increasingly becoming a form
of entertainment, when the commercial theater has increasingly
given us slice-of-life dramas, brittle satires and glitzy
theme-park musicals, his efforts, however ham-handed, to address
the large questions of right and wrong suggest that the theater
still matters, that it can still provide a venue for intellectual
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his plays attest to his own belief that works of art can
``change the consciousness of people and their estimate of who they
are and what they stand for.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Americans now condemn the Senate for its handling of the
impeachment trial as much as they did the House, and Republicans
are taking most of the blame. The party's image has taken such a
battering that half of conservative Republicans even say their
party's prospects for the 2000 elections have been damaged, the
latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   While senators had pledged that they would not engage in the
brutal partisanship that marked the House deliberations, the public
views the entire matter in both chambers as more a Republican drive
to undermine President Clinton than an honest investigation of
possibly serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans now have grown so exasperated with their lawmakers
that most people do not expect the Senate trial to end in two weeks
as Senate leaders have promised.
</P>
<P>
   And in a collective judgment that might be summed up as ``Enough
already!'' Americans said impeachment by the House was adequate
punishment for Clinton. While there is still public support for
censure, the public would be just as happy if the whole matter were
dropped without any final vote.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of those polled said the Senate does not
need to call witnesses to help them decide how to vote on the
articles of impeachment. Nearly-three quarters said the videotaped
testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and Sidney Blumenthal
should not be made public. More than three-quarters said they have
learned nothing new about the whole situation from the Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Americans also think that voters' exasperation with impeachment
will come at the expense of Republicans in the elections next year.
Forty-eight percent of all Republicans and 50 percent of
conservatives Republicans said the way House and Senate Republicans
have handled the matter would make it harder for Republican
candidates to win elections in 2000; 28 percent said it would be
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have definitely cooked their goose on this
one,'' said Charlotte, a Republican poll respondent and retired
grocery clerk from Bedford, Pa., who, in a follow-up interview,
declined to give her last name. ``A lot of these politicians have
been in Congress too long, and I think they have been trying to
hang the president from Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican poll respondent, Marcia Campbell, 50, a
teacher in Ballston Lake, N.Y., said: ``I don't think the
investigation is going to end any time soon. They'll find something
else to draw it out a little longer. I've lost all faith in the
process. It's like a circus at this point in time for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that while the current situation may not lead her to
voting against a Republican in 2000, it ``would certainly make me
think about it more.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most striking findings, the Senate's efforts to
contain the trial by calling only three witnesses has done little
to reassure Americans, who seem to view the matter as a painful
ordeal they want to be over. Fifty-six percent disapprove of the
way the Senate is handling the trial, while 37 percent approve.
Only three weeks ago, in a poll by CBS News, 41 percent disapproved
of how the Senate was handling the trial while 46 percent
registered their approval. Even among self-identified conservative
Republicans in the new poll, nearly a third said they did not
approve of how the Senate was conducting the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide telephone poll of 1,058 adults, conducted
Saturday through Monday, was replete with signs that the Republican
Party has not recovered from its dispiriting performance in the
November election _ and continues to suffer from how impeachment
has been handled on Capitol Hill. The senators, who are serving as
jurors, are viewed by the public as unable to work together in a
bipartisan matter _ and Republicans draw the most blame for that.
</P>
<P>
   Even on issues long considered the province of Republicans like
reducing taxes and curbing crime, Democrats are viewed at least as
qualified as Republicans. While Republicans are still viewed as the
party best capable of upholding traditional moral values, Democrats
are still considered most able to tackle issues like Social
Security, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, while supporting efforts to preserve Social
Security, have recently pressed the party's longstanding mantra of
cutting taxes. But the poll found that majorities of people who
call themselves Democrats or Republicans said they want any budget
surplus to shore up the Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice among cutting taxes, playing down the national
debt, preserving Social Security and anything else, 64 percent of
respondents said they wanted any surplus money to be used for
Social Security. Only 12 percent said they would prefer to have
taxes cut instead. The survey has a margin of sampling error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After months of often acrimonious debates and hearings and a
stop-and-go-trial in the Senate, Clinton is still as popular as
ever. He is seen as doing a good job as president by 65 percent of
the public, including 36 percent of Republicans. And despite his
predicament as a president who is on trial in the Senate, a
majority of Americans said he can govern effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the interminable news coverage, only 19 percent of
Americans said they had been following recent news about the trial
very closely. Forty-four percent said they had been following it
somewhat and 29 percent said not too closely.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that most people were unfamiliar with the
central congressional players in the impeachment matter.
Seventy-one percent of Americans said they were undecided or did
not know enough to have an opinion about Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi. And 61 percent said they were undecided
or did not know enough to have an opinion about Rep. Henry J. Hyde
of Illinois, the chief prosecutor for the Republicans. Seventeen
percent said they had a favorable opinion of Hyde; 20 percent
unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know Mr. Hyde the best _ his constituents _ do not
seem pleased with his role. A survey published on Sunday by The
Chicago Tribune found that in the staunchly conservative DuPage
County, which encompasses a large section of Mr. Hyde's district,
more than a third of voters said they had a lower opinion of him
because of how he has handled impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   While the public wants to move on, in the Times/CBS News Poll 62
percent said they cared a lot about the way the trial turns out.
Two-thirds of Americans want their senators to vote against
convicting the president so he can remain in office. Sixty-one
percent of the public said Clinton's conduct was not serious enough
to warrant his ouster from office _ and an overwhelming majority
said they were not likely to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Americans fully expect that the Senate will not remove Clinton
from office, and they said the Senate should be paying attention to
the public's desire.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans said each party's public image has flagged
because of the impeachment matter, Democrats have endured far
better than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans said House and Senate Republicans have
hurt their party's image in how they have handled impeachment. Of
those people, 40 percent said House Republicans were more
responsible; 24 percent said Senate Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of Americans have a positive impression of the
Democratic Party; 37 percent hold a negative view. But only 41
percent have a favorable view of the Republican Party; 52 percent
view the party unfavorably.
</P>

   ``This thing should have been concluded a long time ago _ God
knows they've spent enough money on it,'' said Ruth Amick, 72, a
poll respondent from Indianapolis who is a Democrat and a retired
automobile plant worker. ``It's about two parties fighting each
other to see who's going to win, either getting Clinton or keeping
him in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Hirsch, 29, a homemaker from Orlando, Fla., who is a
Republican, defended her party. ``I don't like the fact that people
just want to get this over with without coming to a conclusion,''
she said. ``The Republicans are in uncharted territory, and they
are trying to follow the Constitution. The Democrats seem to want
to take shortcuts and doctor up the process somewhat. Both parties
are going to have to compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the discouraging polls, many prominent
Republicans persist in asserting that the Senate is on the right
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy the argument that it's going to hurt
Republicans,'' Dick Cheney, a former Republican leader in the House
and Secretary of Defense, said in an interview from his office in
Dallas. ``The guys are doing a very difficult assignment that all
of them would prefer not to have to deal with. But when I watch
Henry Hyde, who's a close friend, and several other people there,
it's a bear to be called upon to deal with issues like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that if people are not interested in the matter now,
they surely will not punish Republicans over it in 2000, Cheney
added, ``I don't think people outside Washington are spending as
much time thinking about what's going on in Washington as people in
Washington think they do.''

HOUSE MANAGERS PURSUE AIDE'S TALKS WITH CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH-BLUMENTHAL-TEXT, IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-JORDAN,
IMPEACH-TAPES, IMPEACH-POLL)

By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is the kind of conspiracy theory that might
ordinarily delight Sidney Blumenthal _ except that House
impeachment managers accuse him of being at the heart of it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, House managers plan to question Blumenthal, an
enigmatic White House adviser, in hopes of proving that President
Clinton tried to use him and other aides to smear Monica Lewinsky
as a stalker after accusations surfaced last year of their
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the Senate to subpoena Blumenthal as its third and
possibly final witness, the prosecutors wrote that his testimony
would show the president ``attacking her character in an effort to
exculpate himself.'' They believe that that evidence is critical to
their case that Clinton obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal, a former journalist, is a top communications adviser
to Clinton. Republicans, as well as prosecutors in the office of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, believe that Blumenthal, at
Clinton's direction, has used his contacts in news organizations
and his skill with words to undermine Clinton's critics and
potential witnesses against him.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal has denied doing anything more sinister than
answering reporters' questions and discussing public information.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps characteristic of Blumenthal _ and of the
murkiness of truth in this scandal, in which words and memory have
often seemed clouded by politics _ that even his testimony has
become a source of controversy. After he testified under oath to
the grand jury, Blumenthal gave accounts of his appearances to
reporters that varied from a transcript made public later.
</P>
<P>
   That has fueled his critics' suspicions that Blumenthal _ so
fond of conspiracies that his colleagues refer to him as ``Grassy
Knoll,'' or G.K., a reference from Kennedy assassination lore _ has
manipulated the news media to damage Starr and others. Through his
lawyer, Blumenthal maintained that his descriptions were accurate
if not verbatim, because he did not take notes.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers are likely to be particularly interested in
conversations that Blumenthal had with Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton after the Lewinsky accusations surfaced in January 1998.
Blumenthal met Clinton in the late '80s, and wrote about him
favorably off and on before joining the White House as an assistant
to the president in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified that the president asked him to the Oval
Office on the evening of Jan. 21, 1998. Earlier that day,
Blumenthal had had a talk with Mrs. Clinton, of whom he is a
confidant. Mrs. Clinton told him that ``she was distressed that the
president was being attacked, in her view, for political motives,
for his ministry of a troubled person,'' Blumenthal testified,
referring to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified that on reaching the Oval Office he advised
Clinton that ``you're president and these troubled people can just
get you in incredible messes'' and that he should ``cut yourself
off from them.''
</P>
<P>
   The president responded, according to Blumenthal: ``It's very
difficult for me to do that, given how I am. I want to help
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified that Clinton told him he had done nothing
wrong, and then, in a rush of words, said: ``Monica Lewinsky came
at me and made a sexual demand on me.'' Clinton told Blumenthal he
rebuffed her, Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal testified that Clinton also told him that Ms.
Lewinsky said, ``They call me The Stalker,'' adding that ``if I can
say we had an affair, then they won't call me that.''
</P>
<P>
   After reading part of that testimony to the House Judiciary
Committee, Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who is now one of the
managers, pointed to news reports describing Ms. Lewinsky as a
stalker and accused the White House of an organized smear campaign.
The White House has repeatedly denied such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's critics continue to accuse Blumenthal of leading a
stealthy campaign to discredit Ms. Lewinsky and critics of the
president. They say that he took that campaign into the open and
tried to damage Starr's office by describing his grand jury
testimony in conversations with reporters, before it was released
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The New York Times in June, Blumenthal said
he was asked specific questions by the prosecutors that do not
appear verbatim in the transcript. In Blumenthal's versions, the
questions sound harsher than they actually were.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday if he was actually asked the questions he
described, Blumenthal said, ``as I recall, yeah.'' He referred
other questions to his lawyer, William McDaniel. McDaniel said
Blumenthal's version ``certainly captured the spirit of what he was
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal said in June that he was asked, ``Does the
president's religion include sexual intercourse?''
</P>
<P>
   To support that, McDaniel pointed to a question asked by one
prosecutor: ``Did he tell you that part of his ministry with Ms.
Lewinsky in any way, shape or form was in engaging in any kind of
sexual activity with her?''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal also said in June that he was asked, ``Does the
president believe that oral sex is sex?'' McDaniel pointed to
follow-up questions asked after Blumenthal testified that he
understood Clinton to have denied having had sex with Ms. Lewinsky.
``Did you specifically ask the president whether he had received
oral sex from Monica Lewinsky?'' one prosecutor asked.
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal also said in June that he was asked if he had ``ever
discussed with Mrs. Clinton whether the president has a sex
addiction?'' In fact, the prosecutors asked him whether he had ever
prepared the president or Mrs. Clinton to answer reporters'
questions ``that might arise, because of the nature of the Lewinsky
case, about sexual addiction?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Blumenthal had previously been accused of misrepresenting his
testimony. The forewoman of the grand jury admonished him after his
last appearance, on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the fact that during your last
visit that an inaccurate representation of the events that happened
were retold on the steps of the courthouse,'' she said, asking that
``you would really represent us the way that events happened in
this room.''
</P>
<P>
   McDaniel said that Blumenthal had made no statements after his
previous appearance, on June 4. McDaniel noted that he himself,
however, had criticized the questioning that day.
</P>
<P>
   But after his first grand jury appearance, on Feb. 26,
Blumenthal blasted the questioning himself. ``I never imagined that
in America I would be hauled before a federal grand jury to answer
questions about my conversations with members of the media,'' he
said. ``But today, I was forced to answer questions about
conversations, as part of my job, with The New York Times, CNN,
CBS, Time magazine, U.S. News, the New York Daily News, The Chicago
Tribune, The New York Observer, and there may have been a few
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal was not asked directly about all those specific news
organizations before the grand jury. But prosecutors did repeatedly
ask him who he had given information to, an open-ended question
that seemed to invite the names of news organizations.

   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted Saturday through Monday with 1,058 adults
throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller sub-groups the margin of sampling error is larger.
For example, for self-identified Republicans it is plus or minus
six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

HOW THE WEST WAS WON, PAC-10 STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On March 25, 1983, Villanova center John Pinone
made two free throws with 12 seconds remaining to preserve a 55-54
victory over Iowa in a second-round NCAA Tournament game in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona athletic director Cedric Dempsey, on the lookout for a
new coach, was sitting behind the Villanova bench. He had fired Ben
Lindsey after a 4-24 season and his short list of candidates
included Iowa's Lute Olson and Villanova's Rollie Massimino.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to salvage recruiting and wash away the Lindsey
aftertaste, Dempsey wanted to move quickly. As Pinone's free throws
extended Villanova's season, they ended Iowa's _ freeing Olson to
interview for the Arizona vacancy. (If Iowa had won, Massimino
would have interviewed first.) Olson was hired three days later and
Arizona would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Neither would the Pac-10. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Olson isn't the only reason Pac-10 basketball is better
than ever, his hiring was the benchmark for the conference's
revival. Just as the gap between UCLA, Arizona and everyone else
has narrowed in recent years, so too has the chasm between the
Pac-10 and the ACC, Big Ten and Big East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 has improved, the coaches are better, it's had a
big showing in the NCAA Tournament,'' Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim
said. ``It's tougher to recruit out there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ From 1980-94, the Pac-10 won 37 NCAA Tournament games and no
national titles.
</P>
<P>
   __ In the last four years, it has won 36 tournament games and
two championships (UCLA in 1995 and Arizona in 1997). In that same
span, the ACC has won 32 tournament games, the Big Ten 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 has more going for it than it ever has,'' said
former Washington State and USC coach George Raveling, who has been
involved in the Pac-10 since the mid-1970s. He now works as an
analyst with Fox Sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two national champs in a three-year period and
four teams in the Sweet 16 for two straight years (1997-98), those
are the greatest signals the league has arrived. Now there are
three teams in the top 15. For anyone to say the league doesn't
deserve respect, it's foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has had more influence than Olson, who turned the
Wildcats into the league's model program. In 1986, they began a run
of seven league titles in nine years. They reached the Final Four
in 1988 and '94, and they consistently produced NBA talent.
</P>
<P>
   They became the first Pac-10 team _ UCLA excepted _ to schedule
elite nonconference competition. Olson played Duke, Michigan and
Oklahoma, expanding Arizona's reputation while gaining valuable and
profitable national television exposure. Olson pulled Arizona to
UCLA's level and beyond, and in so doing he raised the standard for
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did all that,'' Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hansen said. ``Lute
threw the gauntlet down to everyone and he challenged UCLA. He was
way ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson knew he couldn't consistently beat UCLA for the top
Southern California talent, so he picked his targets selectively.
He gorged on second-tier players like Steve Kerr, Jud Buechler and
Anthony Cook, tweaking his system to suit changing personnel. He
beat UCLA with lesser talent, thus establishing an example for
Stanford, Cal and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed people in the league that you could have a quality
program and not be located in Southern California,'' Raveling
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Olson's impact was significant but not total. Athletic directors
took Arizona's cue and committed to improving their programs. They
hired better coaches who recruited better players, who then won
more games. Call it Roundball Reaganomics _ changes at the top
trickling down to success on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting budgets are bigger, television viewership is greater,
schedules are tougher. And significantly, the best players on the
West Coast are staying on the West Coast. The talent raids by
Syracuse, Connecticut, Kansas and Duke that devastated the Pac-10
for a decade now occur infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are realizing you don't have to go to the East to get
the exposure you want,'' said UCLA sophomore Baron Davis, who chose
UCLA over Kansas and Duke. ``West Coast basketball is becoming more
powerful. It's cool to stay home.''
</P>
<P>
   __ From 1985-93, an average of 7.5 first-team members of the
Long Beach Press-Telegram's  &UR; !ital! &LR; Best in the West poll attended
Pac-10 schools.
</P>
<P>
   __ In the last five years, an average of 10 first-teamers have
matriculated to the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days Syracuse scoops up both Earl Duncan (St.
Monica High School) and Stevie Thompson (Crenshaw), as it did in
1986. No longer does Kansas snatch both Scot Pollard (San Diego)
and Jacque Vaughn (Muir High), as it did in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time in the late '80s, we had five kids from
California,'' Syracuse's Boeheim said. ``That was a real down
period for the Pac-10. But this is a different era and we have to
be more selective out there. Now we've only got two L.A. kids (Tony
Bland and Jason Hart).''
</P>
<P>
   Changes at the administrative level began in the early '90s. At
a series of meetings with coaches and athletic directors, Hansen
emphasized the necessity _ and potential _ of successful men's
basketball programs. He brought in marketing specialists, directed
dollars at promotion campaigns and urged member schools to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Proof of the pot came from two directions. In Tucson, Olson's
program netted between $150,000 to $200,000 per home game, thanks
to television contracts, constant sellouts and a priority-seating
system. In Kansas City, the NCAA signed a $1 billion deal with CBS,
giving the network the rights to televise every round of the
tournament. The resulting distribution formula was based on number
of intercollegiate sports, scholarships and tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't lessen the resources we poured into football,''
Hansen said. ``But we stepped them up for basketball. There was
more emphasis and more effort.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Pac-10 earned $1.5 million from basketball
television contracts. In 1998, the league earned $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic directors slowly adjusted their mentality, but the
old-guard coaches _ Don Monson (Oregon), Lynn Nance (Washington),
Lou Campanelli (Cal) and Jimmy Anderson (Oregon State) _ did not.
They played plodding, unattractive styles. They didn't recruit
nationally and they failed to identify with '90s players.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the old guard either resigned or retired, unwilling
or unable to change with the times. They were replaced by young,
energetic coaches _ Bob Bender (Washington), Jerry Green and Ernie
Kent (Oregon), Eddie Payne (Oregon State) and Ben Braun (Cal). The
improvement of those programs has narrowed the gap between the
conference's elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably need to pat ourselves on the back a little and
say, `Good job in hiring,' '' Washington athletic director Barbara
Hedges said. ``The coaches all fit very nicely at their
institutions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as the mentality changed and the coaches arrived, the
Pac-10 received an unintended boost from its old nemesis,
Nevada-Las Vegas coach Jerry Tarkanian.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, after a lengthy pursuit, the NCAA placed his Runnin'
Rebels on probation for rules violations. The probation freed a
heralded recruit from Artesia High from his conditional commitment
to UNLV. A few weeks later, Ed O'Bannon enrolled at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The repercussions were massive _ for UCLA and the Pac-10. Ed
O'Bannon meant Charles O'Bannon, Charles meant Toby Bailey and J.R.
Henderson, and together, in 1995, they won UCLA's 11th national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   No probation, no O'Bannons, no title. And nothing meant more to
the Pac-10 than UCLA's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that has never changed is that UCLA has always
been the benchmark by which the league is judged nationally,''
Raveling said. ``If seven teams have their best seasons ever and
UCLA is down, people across the country will think the league's
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' Hansen said, ``We arrived as a league when UCLA won
the title.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's ascension coincided with the most surprising recruiting
twist of the decade. In 1991, a year after Ed O'Bannon arrived in
Westwood, Jason Kidd shunned Kansas and Kentucky and committed to
his hometown school, California. For the Bears and the Pac-10, it
was instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 10th-grade year, I tried to commit to Cal, but their
coaches told me they had too many guards,'' UCLA's Davis said. ``I
wanted to go there because of Jason Kidd. He set the tone for the
Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of being the outsider in its own region, after years
of watching Syracuse and Kansas and Connecticut lure the top talent
with promises of Final Fours and ESPN time slots and sold out
arenas, the Pac-10 was fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   As the mid-'90s approached, UCLA and Arizona were rolling.
Bender and Green had injected life into sagging programs at
Washington and Oregon, respectively. Thanks to Kidd, Cal was back.
At Stanford, Mike Montgomery was slowly overcoming his admissions
obstacle. Top recruits were signing left and right _ Todd
MacCulloch (Washington) and Brevin Knight (Stanford) and Shareef
Abdur-Rahim (Cal).
</P>
<P>
   The proof is not at UCLA or Arizona but everywhere else. Sixteen
years after two Villanova free throws changed the Pac-10 forever,
the middle class has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Washington comes within a basket of beating Connecticut in last
year's Sweet 16. Cal beats North Carolina. Oregon State stuns UCLA
and Arizona, and Stanford rules the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are good players on every team,'' Olson said. ``A
combination of coaching staffs and distribution of talent caused
this to happen.''

POLL SHOWS STRONG SENTIMENT FOR A UNITED NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A high-speed rail network connecting the cities of New
England? A regional plan to attract business and investment from
abroad? A six-state lottery to support public education? A New
England bid for the Olympic games?
</P>
<P>
   The public is hungry for all of this, and more besides,
according to a new poll set to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New England's residents see cooperation among the states as key
to solving the region's most pressing problems, reports the Future
of New England survey, conducted by the New England Board of Higher
Education and the John W. McCormack Institute of Public Affairs at
the University of Massachusetts-Boston. Ninety percent of
households surveyed said regional solutions are important to the
economic well-being of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the board is holding a mock election at the Federal
Reserve Bank featuring a number of regional leaders. The prize:
``Governor of New England.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question of the day, say local observers, is whether the
public's yearning for togetherness can overcome a long history of
division _ witness the long battle over which city will be home to
the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some participants at Wednesday's second annual New
England Agenda conference say creating a unified New England is as
ambitious as integrating Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly creating a European Union would be easeier than
trying to make a region of New England,'' said Chellie Pingree,
Maine's Senate majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters surveyed 1,000 political, business, community, and
education leaders, and 1,000 members of the general public, about
their perceptions of the region and its problems.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight percent of leaders surveyed think New England's six
states should work more collaboratively to achieve regional goals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the general public, the survey found strong support for a
wide range of efforts, including joint missions to bring trade to
New England, a regional pact to support economic development
efforts by neighboring states, a regional state university system
to cut administrative costs, and the development of a high-speed
railway to connect the region's cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much higher support for regionalization than I would
have thought,'' said Louis DiNatale, senior fellow at the McCormack
Institute, who conducted the public opinion survey. ``The public
has expectations that the states should be able to work things out
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less surprised. ``It's sort of like family,'' said
former state senator and former gubernatorial candidate Patricia
McGovern, who has been a regionalism advocate for years, and is a
candidate in Wednesday's mock election. ``We share a common history
and a common tradition. A lot of us have second houses in other
states.''
</P>
<P>
   And the members of the family are facing the same problems, said
Pingree, who is also a candidate in Wednesday's mock election.
``We've been losing our political clout as the tenor of Congress
has changed to be more conservative and less reflective of New
England values,'' she said. ``We share the loss of our
manufacturing base, and we've been losing clout as population has
shifted south.''
</P>
<P>
   Education also united New Englanders. Improving public education
topped leaders' lists of pressing issues in each of the states,
with 66 percent of leaders overall ranking it as the most urgent
problem facing the region. Ninety-six percent of leaders and 90
percent of households said education helped to define New England
as a region, behind the region's history, traditions, and
geography.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the greatest problems may be New Englanders
themselves. Indeed, 65 percent of the public surveyed saw the
inability of New England's politicians to work together as an
obstacle to economic growth. And only 36 percent of opinion
leaders, who showed such strong support for regional cooperation,
have actually worked on projects with governments or organizations
from other states or countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northeast is considered a real place of individuals,''
said Katharine Whittemore, a former staffer at New England Monthly,
a highly acclaimed regional magazine that failed financially in
1990. ``There isn't that group identity so much, whereas in Texas,
people are Texans first and Americans second.''

CARMAKERS GET STRONG START TO 1999 SALES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and other
automakers sold new family vehicles at a blistering pace in
January, a sign that the U.S. economy's torrid growth in the fourth
quarter is carrying over into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   With gasoline prices continuing to fall, sales of gas-guzzling
sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans soared in
January, rising 19 percent at DaimlerChrysler AG from a year
earlier, 20 percent at Ford Motor Co. and 32 percent at Toyota
Motor Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But car sales were also brisk after months of weakness, with
DaimlerChrysler and Toyota reporting large increases while Ford's
car sales dropped only because of a reduction in unprofitable car
sales to rental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives were pleased with the year's strong start. ``The
sales momentum that closed out 1998 carried over into January,''
said Robert Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales
and service, who attributed the robust sales to ``innovative
products and features, low interest rates and fuel prices, and
growth in jobs and wages.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford could face some temporary difficulties in making enough
cars and trucks to keep up with demand, following one of the worst
industrial accidents in the auto industry's history. A fatal fire
and explosion on Monday shut down production at the company's
largest factory complex, which supplies parts to most of Ford's
assembly plants in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that the
continued rise in sport utility vehicle sales would help the
industry's profits, while Ford's ability to reduce sales to
rental-car agencies was also good news. ``You had a huge
improvement in mix'' of vehicles sold, Lobaccaro said.
</P>
<P>
   George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford, said that car sales to
rental agencies fell more than 30 percent last month while retail
car sales rose 1 percent. That produced an overall drop in car
sales of 9 percent last month; January is traditionally a big month
for rental-car sales, as the rental agencies start preparing for
the summer season while family buyers stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Rental agency sales are seldom profitable, because the agencies
mainly buy vehicles that are in excess supply and available at deep
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler's 18 percent jump in sales of Dodge, Plymouth
and Chrysler cars reflected brisk sales of its new large cars,
notably the Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler 300M, which were not yet
widely available last year. But sales fell for smaller cars like
the Dodge Neon, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus.
</P>
<P>
   Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp. merged in November but
continue to report their sales separately in the United States.
Mercedes-Benz announced Tuesday that its car sales rose 6 percent
while its sport utility vehicle sales were flat because its factory
in Tuscaloosa, Ala., has been operating at full capacity for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen AG reported a 45 percent increase in sales last month
from a year earlier, the best January performance for the company
since 1986. The New Beetle, a nostalgic tribute to the 1960s,
remains popular while customers have also been snapping up Passat
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. is not scheduled to report its January
sales until Wednesday. But auto analysts predicted that when the
final figures are tallied, the industry's sales were running at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of close to 16 million new
vehicles. Sales rates over 15 million vehicles are considered
strong and usually profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's overall sales of cars and light trucks were up 8 percent.
Toyota's car sales climbed 25 percent and overall sales rose 27
percent. Even struggling Nissan managed an overall sales gain of 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   John Casesa, an auto analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co., said that the
vigorous sales reflected consumers' affluence and optimism about
the future. ``They feel rich and they have the confidence to spend
money,'' he said. ``It's remarkable at this stage in the economic
cycle.''

GEPHARDT EXPECTED TO PASS ON PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt has
apparently decided not to seek the presidential nomination,
becoming the third high-profile Democrat in recent weeks to bow out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's decision, confirmed Tuesday by three sources, is to
be announced Wednesday at a 5 p.m. meeting of the House Democratic
caucus. The Missourian, facing the prospect of a difficult race
against the two announced candidates, Vice President Al Gore and
former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, has told associates he
would prefer to focus on regaining a Democratic majority in the
House and becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said Gephardt's decision has
a split impact: It underscores Gore's political strength by
diminishing the Democratic field, but could make it easier for
someone such as US Sen. John Kerry to make a more a credible bid
against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anti-Gore vote won't be as fractured, and the Democratic
race will be a referendum on the vice president,'' Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Carpman, a former Kerry press secretary who now works at
Boston's Rasky/Baerlein Group, suggested Gephardt's decision could
make the race more attractive to Kerry, who is still mulling
whether to run. ``Any time in an election that you can get as close
as possible to a one-on-one, versus four or five people on a stage,
you are just better off,'' Carpman said, while stressing that Kerry
had not made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt plans to meet with Gore Wednesday morning to inform him
of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, 58, concluded in recent weeks that he had little
chance of beating the vice president but a good chance of becoming
House speaker. The drive for Democrats to win control of the House
is being headed by Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island,
Gephardt's hand-picked choice to run the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   If Gephardt does become speaker after the 2000 elections,
Kennedy could gain a top leadership position and solidify his
standing as a leader in the Kennedy clan.
</P>
<P>
   A Gephardt associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the minority leader went ``back and forth'' about whether to run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some degree of feeling that he had gotten Democrats
to the doorstep'' of controlling Congress ``and he didn't want to
leave them in the lurch,'' the associate said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt ran unsuccessfully for president in 1988. He also
considered running in 1992, but rejected the idea partly because
President Bush looked likely to win reelection, providing an
opening for the little-known governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton, to
emerge from the field and eventually be elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, to the delight of the White House, emerged as one of
Clinton's strongest defenders during the House impeachment vote,
delivering an impassioned speech on behalf of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's decision, while expected, sharpens the focus on the
race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In recent weeks,
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota have dropped out of the running, partly because of the
anticipated difficulty of competing against Gore, who is busily
lining up financial and political support. Bradley, the only other
announced candidate, so far is running a shoestring operation.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves Kerry as the only Democratic member of Congress who
has said he is seriously considering a bid. The Rev. Jesse Jackson
also has said he might run again.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry has said he would decide whether to run by early February.
But in an interview Monday, Kerry said the Senate impeachment trial
has pushed back his schedule by several weeks, suggesting that his
announcement may not come until the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously pushed back,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry associates said the decision by Kerrey, Wellstone and
Gephardt against running is bound to affect the Massachusetts
senator's thinking about the race. Even though Kerry would enter as
a longshot, a small Democratic field inevitably would lead to
intense media focus on the candidates who compete against Gore.
Moreover, if Gore's candidacy faltered, Kerry could profit from the
small number of other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   John Martilla, a Kerry adviser, said Tuesday he doubted the
senator would make up his mind based on Gephardt's decision. ``It
is a personal decision,'' Martilla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Kerry's decision will rest on a fairly complex
equation of personal, political and logistical factors, into which
today's news may play some part,'' said spokesman Jim Jordan.
``However, no single external factor or development will, in and of
itself, determine his ultimate decision.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The almost daily American air strikes on Iraq have
turned into the equivalent of a low-level war, hitting a wide range
of military targets While the Pentagon justifies the attacks as
defensive, some of the targets pose little immediate threat to
American or British pilots patrolling much of Iraq's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Operating under broader rules that allow pilots, if attacked, to
strike an any targets, American fighter jets have pounded more than
a dozen targets in northern and southern Iraq in the last four
days. On Tuesday, for the first time, the targets included a newly
assembled missile site that could threaten ships in the Persian
Gulf, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last month, American warplanes, recently joined by
British jets, have attacked more anti-aircraft batteries and
surface-to-air missile batteries than they did during the four
nights of intensive strikes in December, according to the Pentagon.
Including Tuesday's raids, the Americans and British have struck
more than 40 of these targets.
</P>
<P>
   The raids in December were meant to set back Iraq's ability to
build chemical and biological weapons in the wake of President
Saddam Hussein's repeated refusal to cooperate with United Nations
weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of this new war of attrition, officials said, is to put
more pressure on Saddam's increasingly isolated government and
armed forces to keep him on the defensive, even as the United
States openly advocates the removal of Saddam from power.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon say the latest strikes have dealt a
blow to Iraq's ability to threaten the American and British patrols
over much of its territory. By one intelligence estimate, Iraq has
lost some 20 percent of its air-defense weapons since December's
raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being effective taking out his air defenses, piece by
piece,'' one official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has remained defiant. On Monday, Saddam's government
offered a bounty equal to about $14,000 to any Iraqi who shoots
down an American or British jet. (Iraq also offered a smaller
bounty for capturing an enemy pilot.) Defense Secretary William
Cohen scoffed at the gesture, saying it was ``just another example
of Saddam Hussein flailing out.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that anti-aircraft batteries in northern
Iraq opened fire on Tuesday on American F-15E fighter jets while
surface-to-air missile sites turned their radar systems onto other
F-15's and an EA-6B electronic jamming jet in three separate
instances. In each case, they said, the American jets responded
with bombs or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Iraq, the officials said, Iraqi forces fired at
least one surface-to-air missile at a patrol of American F-15's and
British Tornados; the Iraqis also fired anti-aircraft artillery.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the Pentagon's new more aggressive rules of
engagement, the officials said, American warplanes responded by
attacking a predetermined target considered to be a potential
threat: the anti-ship missile site.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger disclosed that
President Clinton had given American pilots wider authority to
retaliate when threatened, allowing them to strike at any defense
system, not just those that actually take aim at American aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's strike, four jets from the aircraft carrier Carl
Vinson _ two F-14's and two F/A-18's _ attacked the site, on the
Fao peninsula south of Basra, even though there were no indications
that Iraqi forces were preparing to open fire.

   Officials at the Pentagon said Iraq had readied the missile _ a
Soviet-made CSSC-3 capable of hitting a ship 60 miles out to sea _
in just the last week. The officials said Iraq could use the
missile to threaten commercial or military traffic in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put them on launchers and put the launchers in a position
to fire into the Persian Gulf,'' said one official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, the Carl Vinson's jets attacked the
site with four precision-guided bombs, each with 500 pounds of
explosives. Another Pentagon official said the bombs appeared to
strike their target, because they were followed by secondary
blasts, presumably from exploding munitions.
</P>
<P>
   During the raids in December, American and British forces
attacked 100 targets in all. The commander who led that attack,
Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, reported that the missile strikes had
destroyed the vast majority of the targets. The jets had less luck
with the 34 air-defense targets they attacked, destroying half of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the American strikes had been limited to missile
batteries, radar facilities and other parts of Iraq's air defenses.
The officials said they would not rule out striking other
facilities, but for now they do not plan a broader air campaign, as
some in Congress have advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and Pentagon officials said they were content to
continue retaliating as long as Iraq continued to challenge the
American and British patrols. Appearing before the House's Armed
Services Committee, Cohen said that each time Iraqi forces
threatened the pilots, ``they're going to pay a penalty for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, Iraq has withdrawn some of its
surface-to-air missiles _ including Soviet-made SA-2's and SA-3's _
from the ``no flight'' zones in what officials described as an
apparent attempt by the Iraqi military to protect its most potent
weaponry from attacks. Even so, Iraq continues to fire on American
and British jets.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the United States has moved additional aircraft
into the region, including more F-16's and EA-6B's armed with
radar-seeking missiles. There are now roughly 200 American aircraft
patrolling the southern ``no flight'' zone from the Carl Vinson and
from bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and another 40 or so
patrolling the northern zone from a base in Incirlik, Turkey.
Britain has roughly two dozen jets patrolling the two zones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, neither the United States nor Britain has lost any
pilots or aircraft in the skirmishes. Their tactics are designed,
in part, to limit that possibility, by attacking with long-range
missiles and steering clear of attempts by Iraqi forces to lure
jets into what American officials call missile ``traps.''

</P>
<P>
   &LR; Still, there are military and political risks in this newly
aggressive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at least one American missile missed its intended
target and struck a residential area in southern Iraq, the Pentagon
acknowledged. Iraq claimed that 11 civilians died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never going to win over the Arab street, but I think
the international community realizes we're not only taking due
care, but extraordinary care, to minimize collateral damage,'' a
Pentagon official said. Nevertheless, repeated misfires could rally
support for Iraq and stoke lingering animosities toward the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Even Turkey, one of the closest American allies in the region,
has signaled an unease with the continued strikes. Turkey's defense
minister, Hikmet Sami Turk, said on Tuesday in an interview with
Reuters that his country wanted to renegotiate the rules of
engagement for jets operating out of its territory, though he did
not specify what changes were in store. Any new restrictions would
curtail the American-led enforcement of the northern zone.
</P>
<P>
   Martin S. Indyk, the assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, completed a diplomatic swing through the Gulf
region to shore up support for the more aggressive stance. In a
news conference in Dubai on Tuesday, he said that the Arab states
had expressed support for the American view that Iraq needed a new
government, though not one imposed from outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also made clear to us that they prefer that we talk less
and do more, and we agreed with that,'' Indyk said.

COMMENTARY: THE SECRET LETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At first, the president wanted to wear one of
Monica's ties on Monday as a secret love signal, and have Nicole
Seligman read his apology before the House managers began quizzing
the former intern.
</P>
<P>
   But those ideas were dropped after David Kendall patiently
explained to the first client that they might be construed as
witness-tampering.
</P>
<P>
   So then the president went to Plan B _ a plan so closely held
that even Geraldo's Source Very Close To The President didn't know
about it.
</P>
<P>
   If Monica was a good little soldier and gave only rank and
serial number to the enemy, Ms. Seligman would read a short apology
at the end of the deposition. That would be for public consumption.
</P>
<P>
   But privately there was an even sweeter inducement for Monica, a
bold attempt by Bill Clinton to worm his way back into the former
intern's good graces before she does the big interview with Barbara
Walters, goes on her book tour or gives any more testimony in the
criminal trial of the president that Ken Starr is craving.
</P>
<P>
   After the satellite dishes in front of the Mayflower Hotel were
dismantled, after the House managers returned to the Capitol and
the press behemoth slouched off, the president dispatched his
stealth lawyer, Bruce Lindsey, to deliver a top-secret, handwritten
letter of apology to the guest in the presidential suite:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Monica,
</P>
<P>
   I am so proud of you. You stood by your man today. You are no
stalker. You are one classy lady!
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to write this letter a long time ago, but my lawyers
wouldn't let me. So many apologies, so little time.
</P>
<P>
   My heart went out to you when that evil Starr dragged you back
here two Saturdays ago. But I must confess I was a little jealous
when Asa Hutchinson and Ed Bryant came to see you, dressed as if
they were going on a date, all spruced up in their pep-rally
sweaters and Oxford shirts. You didn't have pizza together, did
you?
</P>
<P>
   Life is weird. Things really couldn't have turned out much
better. The new New York Times poll shows Americans hate the Senate
as much as they hate the House. Darn, I love this country. My
approval rating is sitting pretty at 65. I know yours is stuck in
the 20s, hon. But look on the bright side _ together, we almost add
up to 100!
</P>
<P>
   I thought you looked really hot in that TSG baseball cap. It was
even sexier than the beret. Then I read that TSG stands for The
Shooting Gallery, the film company where your new boyfriend works.
I was crushed by that ol' green-eyed monster, babe.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you paid no mind to all the trash talk about how if you
hadn't saved that dress, Sidney and I would have smeared you as a
delusional, Starbucks-fetchin', Domino's-temptin' vixen. We were
just foolin'. Sidney is such a barrel of laughs.
</P>
<P>
   And I heard you were mad when I told the grand jury that our sex
was one-way and that you were just servicing me. My lawyers made me
say that, too. You know I never thought of you as a sex toy,
sweetie. You were always my Juliet. What light by yonder pantry
breaks!
</P>
<P>
   You were cute as a wood tick in those Vanity Fair pictures. I
keep the one with you and the pink poodle in my desk drawer.
Whenever Gore gets too stupefying, I steal a look.
</P>
<P>
   Pay no mind to all those shots of me and Hillary holding hands.
She is still frosted at me. If you think you've had a hard time,
just imagine what it's like to have Hillary, Dianne Feinstein,
Donna Shalala and Patricia Ireland yapping at you for 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for those carefree days when we did not engage in sexual
relations while Betty stood guard!
</P>
<P>
   Remember when I used to tell you, when you complained that I was
pulling away from you, that every day can't be sunshine? But every
day can be sunshine, if you control your tongue with Andrew Morton
and Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   All the poise you've displayed this year proves you were much
too good for that cheesy job at Revlon.
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Starr indicts me, you'll need to keep those gorgeous lips
zipped a little longer. Of course, I'm not asking you to lie.
</P>
<P>
   We were never alone, right? We'll always have Whitman, right?
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Hillary's going to The Hague this weekend to speak
on population control. I'll give you an early Valentine's Day ring.
It's been way too long since we engaged in some of that good ol'
inappropriate sexual banter. XXXOOO,
</P>
<P>
   Handsome

BUSINESSES' TAX SHELTERS IN WASHINGTON'S CROSS HAIRS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 BY RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They may not rise to the level of saving Social
Security, but buried in the budget proposal President Clinton sent
to Congress are dozens of provisions that could have a substantial
effect on Wall Street, big industries like insurance and even
particular companies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's budget calls for a sweeping crackdown on the use of
tax shelters and would impose new taxes on some exporters. It would
limit the benefits of a technique that some companies use in
spinning off subsidiaries, would bar companies from deducting
punitive damages paid in civil lawsuits from their taxes and would
alter arcane rules on life insurance companies that would amount to
a big tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   And in a tweak at some of the business-sponsored lobbying groups
that will be fighting these same proposals, the president's budget,
unveiled Monday, would impose taxes on investment income earned by
otherwise tax-exempt trade associations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are motivated as much by the White House's need to
find additional revenue to pay for tax cuts and spending increases
as they are by a decision that existing tax rules are unfair or out
of date. Many of them have been criticized by Republicans, who are
likely to block most tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little stomach in general for raising taxes, and
in particular for raising business taxes,'' said Stan Collender, a
budget analyst for Fleischman Hillard in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a sense among corporations that both the
Clinton administration and the Republican Congress see business as
an easy mark and that some of the proposals will make it into law
in the scramble to offset the costs of politically popular tax cuts
for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a laundry list of loophole closers coming after five
or six tax bills that also had loophole closers, so they're
dredging at the bottom,'' said Clint Stretch, a tax policy analyst
at Deloitte &AMP; Touche in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The last four years, Stretch said, the Republican Congress has
passed tax bills that will cost businesses $25 billion in
additional taxes over the next five years, while resulting in tax
reductions of $200 billion over the same period for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the companies and industries that could be affected
by the administration's latest proposals are not taking any chances
and are mobilizing to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we are very disappointed and frustrated by these
administration proposals,'' said Doug Bates, the director of
federal relations for the American Council of Life Insurance, who
said the proposals would hurt every company in the industry. ``The
proposals all serve to raise the taxes life insurance companies pay
and policyholders pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most sweeping proposals are those involving tax
shelters. The White House sent Congress 16 changes to tax law that
it estimates would raise $7.2 billion in new revenue by making it
more difficult or more expensive for companies to take advantage of
the shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals include such steps as increasing the penalty for
substantially understating tax liabilities based on the use of tax
shelters, giving the Treasury Department greater leeway to deny tax
benefits that derive from transactions intended to avoid taxes and
to deny companies the right to deduct fees paid for advice on tax
shelters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This represents a full frontal assault by the administration
on corporate tax shelters,'' said Lawrence Hill, a tax lawyer at
White &AMP; Case, a New York law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Tax shelters include a myriad of complex transactions that have
no purpose other than avoiding taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last couple of years, Treasury officials have become
concerned about how tax professionals at accounting firms, law
firms and investment banks have been aggressively marketing these
tax shelters to companies.
</P>
<P>
   While tax lawyers and accountants have long offered their
corporate clients advice on how to lower their taxes, they are now
designing arcane financial transactions that they then market to
companies much like insurance agents sell policies. Often, the tax
experts ask for fees that are contingent on the amount of taxes
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of tax shelters violate the intent of Congress,
they violate the code, they clearly erode the corporate tax base
and they breed disrespect for the tax law,'' Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal being watched closely by the mergers and
acquisitions departments of Wall Street firms is a change in the
rules governing ``tracking stock,'' or shares that track the
performance of a corporate subsidiary. In the view of the Treasury
Department, issuing tracking stock can be a way of allowing
companies to effectively divest subsidiaries without recognizing
any gain.
</P>
<P>
   A number of companies have used tracking stock recently,
including Sprint Corp. in the spinoff of its wireless unit. Others,
including AT&AMP;T, have considered using it in recent deals. The
administration's proposal would not affect any pending deals
because it would apply only to transactions that take place after
the measure is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal to change the tax treatment of
punitive damage payments in civil cases touched a raw nerve for
businesses. Under current law, no deduction is allowed for fines or
penalties paid by corporations for criminal violations, but
punitive damages in civil cases are treated as ordinary, deductible
business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that allowing deductibility of civil punitive damages
``undermines the role of such damages in discouraging and
penalizing'' wrongdoing or undesirable actions, the administration
proposed to deny the deductibility for damages paid after the law
is enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, Stretch of Deloitte &AMP; Touche said, every
dollar of damages costs 65 cents after taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punitive damages are pretty annoying to the business community
to begin with,'' Stretch said. ``To say they're going to increase
the cost of them by 50 percent is pretty harsh.''
</P>
<P>
   No industry feels more singled out than life insurers. Two
separate provisions in the budget would hit the industry hard.
Under one, the administration would change the rules governing
policyholder surplus accounts, which are extra reserves that can be
called on to pay policy claims. The accounts were set up under a
tax break in effect from 1959 through 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing to repeal the deferral of the tax on profits from
1959 through 1983 that were used to finance the accounts, the
administration said the policies backed by the accounts had long
since been paid off, surrendered of canceled. Recapturing the tax
on the profits would gain $1 billion in revenue over the next five
years, the Treasury Department estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also proposing a highly technical change
in the way insurers capitalize the costs of adding new policies,
such as commissions and expense reimbursements to agents. The
change would create $4.1 billion in revenue for the government over
five years _ money that would ultimately come out of the pockets of
consumers, industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly complex calculation,'' Bates said, ``but the
essence of it is to raise taxes on the premiums policyholders pay
for life insurance and annuity protection.'' &QL;

STARR VERSUS THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the United States, presidents are not above the law. The
emphatic underlining of this important democratic principle is one
of the few benefits that still might emerge from the nation's
impeachment nightmare, now in its second year.
</P>
<P>
   But even this positive lesson has been jeopardized this week by
the report in The New York Times that independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has decided he has the constitutional authority to seek an
indictment of President Clinton while he is in office and might yet
do it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr thus fails the tests of timing and reasonableness. Much
has been made of possible motives here. Did the story spring from
Starr's associates trying to push the Senate toward removal? Or
from Clinton aides hoping it would make removal less likely, since
the senators would be reminded that criminal prosecution would
still be possible? Or, just possibly, from solid reporting?
</P>
<P>
   What matters more than the source of the story is its revelation
that Starr is still thinking about what he might do to destroy not
only this president but this presidency.
</P>
<P>
   This is dangerous stuff. Whether or not the Supreme Court was
right legally in allowing Paula Jones to sue Clinton while he was
in office, the justices made a historic blunder in assuming that
the suit would have little practical impact on the presidency. Now
Starr seems fascinated with his capacity to compound that mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton is removed or not, he should be subject to
normal court prosecution, as the Constitution provides _ but not
until his term ends. Congress should take no action that
compromises this vulnerability. At the same time, Starr should
avoid a one-man crusade to prevent the president from finishing the
term to which he was elected by 47,401,185 Americans.

THE MAN WHO BROUGHT THE ORGAN INTO MODERNITY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Western music has generally moved far from its origins in
plainsong and other kinds of religious chant, but one instrument,
the organ, has never been able to heave itself out of the church.
Taking place in church, organ music has to behave with a certain
respect, and few composers have been able to maintain that posture
for long.
</P>
<P>
   Bach, of course, was one. The only other outstanding example is
the French composer Olivier Messiaen, whose complete organ works
are to be played in six concerts at Riverside Church on the Upper
West Side of Manhattan by the American organist Jon Gillock,
starting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen was, like Bach, a faithful son of his church. His
parents were not especially religious, but by his own account he
was totally convinced by everything he heard and experienced in
church as a small child, and he never lost that small child's
faith. It glows in his organ works, which, on one level, are
children's storybooks in sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nativity of the Savior'' _ one of his first big organ
cycles, written in 1935, when he was 26 _ opens with a picture of
the Virgin and Child, followed by an impression of the shepherds
fluting their way to the crib. Even in his last organ work, ``The
Book of the Blessed Sacrament,'' which was composed half a century
later, there are passages with the same directness.
</P>
<P>
   Besides composing, he also had the opportunity to express his
faith by loyally fulfilling his duties as organist at La Trinite, a
church in the north of Paris, which housed one of the great
instruments made by the master French organ builder of the second
half of the 19th century, Aristide Cavaille-Coll. Messiaen took up
his post there soon after graduating from the Paris Conservatory,
in 1931, and except during summer vacations and periods when the
organ was under repair, he played every Sunday and on major feast
days.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not design his organ music exclusively for a
churchgoing audience. Indeed, in his early years at La Trinite, he
had trouble with parishioners who found his music too strange _ as
strange it is, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   A movement closely based on a plainsong melody might be followed
by a stretch of thoroughly abstract and atonal musical speculation.
A galloping toccata, played with the full resources of the
instrument, could pause for the song of a bird, heard on some weird
combination of pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen's subject was vast _ the created universe, not
excluding Paradise _ and his musical means therefore had to be
vast, too.
</P>
<P>
   As an organist playing for Roman Catholic services and as a man
with total belief in the Catholic faith, Messiaen based his music
on the doctrine he had learned as a child and was re-experiencing
every week from his seat in the organ loft.
</P>
<P>
   He created most of his organ works as illustrations of that
doctrine, the only exception being the ``Organ Book'' of 1951,
composed at what was musically and spiritually a challenging time:
his young composition pupils at the conservatory, notably Pierre
Boulez, were setting out in a completely new direction _ a
direction that fascinated him _ and his wife, Yvonne Loriod, was
suffering a long-term decline.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Organ Book'' is weird. In one movement the organ seems to
be counting out numbers _ numbers made audible as durations, from
very short to very long _ while at the same time the instrument
imitates songs of birds: the music is an imaginary architecture
filled with flying creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen loved birds. He traveled the world listening to them
and notating their shrieks and melodies, which he then reproduced
in his music. Birds for him were earthly angels, winged and singing
the music of God: music that long predated the arrival of the first
humans on the planet. As far as human music was concerned, the
style he thought proper to the ritual of the church was plainsong,
and his organ music is as deeply imbued with the melodic shapes of
plainsong as Bach's is with those of Lutheran chorales.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly devoted to stories from scripture and the tenets of the
Catholic Church, and rooted in the liturgical music of that church,
Messiaen's organ works also belong within a particular tradition of
music for the church: a specifically French tradition that went
back through such composers of the previous two or three
generations as Marcel Dupre, Charles-Marie Widor, Louis Vierne,
Charles Tournemire and Cesar Franck to musicians of the Baroque
era.
</P>
<P>
   But Messiaen was not so much a Catholic composer as a catholic
one, eager to embrace all kinds of musical material. In his works,
a plainsong theme, representing the church's tune, may be combined
with a rhythmic pattern taken from a medieval Indian treatise.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources, besides bird song and purely abstract
formulations, included opera, Asian music heard on record, and the
poetic meters and forms of Greek drama.
</P>
<P>
   These things do not conflict with the sacred enterprise but
rather expand its scope. For Messiaen _ as for the stained-glass
window artists who put camels, stars and curling leaves alongside
depictions of saints _ almost anything from the known and imagined
world could be brought into church. The organ might have its home
there, but it could learn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would positively have to learn if its music was to
reach a modern audience. This was one respect in which Messiaen's
position was quite different from Bach's. Whereas Bach was writing
for a congregation of fellow believers _ or at least fellow
attenders _ Messiaen created his organ music for people who might
never go into a church except to hear a concert. His references had
to be broader.
</P>
<P>
   From his own point of view, though, the breadth was imposed by
the subject matter. His audible visions of the New Testament may
retain a childlike innocence, but they also speak of spiritual
experiences that are not confined to any church: experiences of
terror and ecstasy, of being in the presence of glory and of
feeling time stop, or hurtle onward, carrying the listener with it.
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen's simplicity kept him away from doubt and cynicism, but
not by any means from grandeur and complexity. Whether he was
creating images of Bible stories, articles of faith or natural
phenomena, he was particularly attracted to the marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   The religious subjects to which he returned again and again, in
his organ works as in his other compositions, were the presence of
God on earth (in Christ and, according to Catholic doctrine, in the
bread and wine consecrated during the Mass), the splendors of
heaven and the enigma of the Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the natural wonders he especially loved to evoke were high
mountains as well as the songs and colors of birds: birds heard and
seen from up close, as if by the ear and eye of the Creator.
</P>
<P>
   Rendering these things, Messiaen's music is loud, harsh,
exuberant and intricate as often as it has the more obviously
meditative characteristics of quietness and stasis. It can be
disconcerting. Part of its point is to disconcert, to open the mind
to eternal changelessness and to the unexpected instant.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gillock, one of the foremost exponents of Messiaen's music
in the world, did not come to it easily, as he explained recently,
in a conversation at the organ console in Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gillock heard in 1972 that Messiaen had recently given the first
performance of a big new organ work, ``Meditations on the Mystery
of the Holy Trinity,'' in Washington. ``I was 28, and I didn't have
anything else to do, so I got hold of the music and started to
learn it,'' he said. ``Well, the first of the nine pieces is very
difficult. I couldn't understand it, and I couldn't count the
rhythm. So I went on to the second, which is easier, and gradually
it all started to make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Through learning a new piece, he was changing his life. In 1974
he gave the first New York performance of the work, at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and the next year, in the same
place, he played all the organ works Messiaen had then written.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after that, determined to get to the source, he moved
to Paris. Messiaen did not take organ students, so Gillock went to
the conservatory to attend his composition classes, which were
devoted largely to playing, discussing and analyzing the great
works of the musical literature.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, every Sunday, Messiaen could be heard playing at La
Trinite, and Gillock followed him around Europe to hear
performances of his orchestral scores, which, he says, give the
organist important keys to the kinds of sound and color the
composer had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Other clues he has used come from recordings. Messiaen's
performances of his organ works were put on disk in the '60s, and
though the sound is rather poor, for Gillock these are the
recordings of choice. In addition, there are private recordings
Gillock has been able to consult, including those of Messiaen's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yvonne Loriod taped his improvisations, and the organ keeper
at La Trinite made some videotapes,'' Gillock said. ``These show
how, for example, the `Puer Natus Est Nobis' from the last organ
cycle, `The Book of the Blessed Sacrament,' was developed from
improvisations made at the Christmas Mass over many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen was unusual among organists in that he rarely gave
concerts and almost never played anywhere but at La Trinite, at
least in his later years. During the period up to his early '40s,
as Gillock pointed out, he was an organist-composer in the French
tradition. This was when organ works loomed largest in his output,
and he did play a certain number of concerts in Paris and abroad.
But then he settled into the life of a church musician, motivated
partly, no doubt, by his love for his own instrument and partly by
his attitude of service.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, when he was invited to give a concert in London, he
declined, and his grounds were interesting. ``My only organ teacher
was Marcel Dupre, for whom I had the deepest admiration and a very
great and respectful affection,'' Messiaen wrote. ``But I went
occasionally to hear the improvisations of Charles Tournemire (a
composer of genius and a marvelous improviser). When Tournemire
improvised in a concert, it was good. But the improvisations were
much more beautiful during Masses at Ste. Clotilde, when he had the
Blessed Sacrament in front of him. I think I resemble him somewhat
in this respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Messiaen's reference in this letter to two French
organist-composers of an earlier generation lends support to
Gillock's view of the composer's music as unthinkable without the
French Romantic tradition. This is how he plays it.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment while talking, he turned to demonstrate a passage
from the ``Meditations'': a passage including the songs of the
blackbird and the garden warbler, of which the blackbird's phrases
were much smoother, more flexible and, indeed, lovelier than
Messiaen might have made them.
</P>
<P>
   His inclination is perhaps to intensify character, contrast and
drama, to push against the boundaries in his mind, set up by his
deep acquaintance with the composer's music, performances and
background. The score is at once a limitation and a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   With organ music, especially, it has to be. Messiaen's scores
are fully annotated with indications of which stops to use for each
segment. (Gillock's copies of those scores are further marked with
details he got directly from the composer concerning nuances of
tempo and rhythm.) But these registrations cannot be directly
duplicated on any instrument except Messiaen's own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sound he particularly liked, a duet playing
against a stringlike accompaniment, but I have never found another
instrument on which it worked as he wrote it,'' Gillock said. ``So
you have to try something else to get the same effect.''
</P>
<P>
   An organist playing away from home has to spend a long time
exploring the possibilities of the instrument, which is why
Gillock, who still lives in France, was there at Riverside Church
two and a half weeks before his first concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come every day for a few hours,'' he said. ``And then if
I'm uncertain about how something will sound for the audience, I'll
have a friend play while I go out into the room.'' So, by trial and
error, the re-registration of the music gets put together.
</P>
<P>
   The virtues of the Riverside Church organ, though, were already
clear at this early stage. ``I think Messiaen would have loved this
organ,'' Gillock said. ``He wrote his last two organ works for
American organs, which are quite different from the French type,
and this is a wonderful example. Also, there are two organs which
you can control, one at the back of the church and one at the
front, so I'll be able to play one against the other in dialogue,
or play them together and have the audience surrounded by sound, or
have something close at the front and distant behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The ambiance is surely right, too. Messiaen delighted in the
colors of the stained-glass windows in French medieval cathedrals
and churches, and Gillock gestured toward the panels of gleaming
blue light set in the walls of Riverside Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The windows are copies from Chartres,'' he said. ``The only
reason you can tell you're not in Chartres is because the glass is
cleaner.'' The music, too, may be getting a new brilliance.

AN AGENDA FOR NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is New England a powerful region-state or just a state of mind?
It is difficult to imagine a common agenda or identity linking
communities as diverse as Greenwich, Conn., and Greenville, Maine.
But some forward-looking New Englanders are giving it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the New England Board of Higher Education surveyed
1,000 opinion leaders from the six states _ elected officials,
college presidents, CEOs of companies large and small, think tanks,
foundation directors, and media moguls. For a needed reality check,
it commissioned a poll of 1,000 ``ordinary'' New Englanders. The
results show remarkable uniformity across the states.
</P>
<P>
   Education continues to be the number one issue for average
citizens and opinion leaders alike, both as a way New Englanders
identify with their region and as the road map for continued
prosperity. Improving public education in the lower grades was the
most urgent item in every state. Respondents wanted better teacher
training, merit pay for teachers, and partnerships with the
region's premier colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the skilled labor force was the next important issue.
Respondents wanted more on-the-job skills development as well as
retraining for laid-off workers. Welfare-to-work initiatives were
highlighted as an opportunity to develop a more qualified labor
force.
</P>
<P>
   The big obstacle to continued growth in New England? The cost of
living. From housing to energy to health insurance, living in New
England simply costs too much. ``Ordinary'' respondents were
slightly more likely than the opinion leaders to add two other
high-cost items: taxes and college.
</P>
<P>
   If these themes sound familar, they are. Today's discussion,
sponsored by the New England Board of Higher Education with the New
England Council and the New England Governors Conference, will
surely pluck chords that have been sounded before.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually good news. As Washington continues to do less
to affect the economy or social stability, the role for regional
cooperation becomes more apparent. Fortunately, these survey
results suggest that rather than a babble of competing voices, New
England is increasingly speaking with a single tongue.

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES DRAG DOWN INDEXES ON PROFIT TAKING
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas) (bl) 
By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks, whose valuations have been pushed
into the stratosphere in recent weeks, led equity markets lower
Tuesday, as investors and traders decided to take some profits.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff in technology shares was most pronounced among the
marquee names: Microsoft fell for a second day. Intel and Cisco
Systems also lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an ugly day right from the beginning,'' said Andrew
Brooks, a vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe
Price Associates. ``If you don't own technology stocks, you haven't
been in this rally. Some cooling off of the euphoria is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered the biggest
setback Tuesday. The index slumped 46.67 points, or 1.86 percent,
to 2,463.42. Losers on the Nasdaq outnumbered gainers by a margin
of 3 to 2. Volume on the Nasdaq was 955 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Tuesday's decline, the Nasdaq composite is up 12.35
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also slid, dropping 71.58
points, to 9,274.12. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost
11.01 points, to 1,261.99. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller
company stocks declined 4.35 points, or 1.02 percent, to 421.73.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cited the start of a two-day meeting of the Open Market
Committee, the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making arm, as well
as a further rise in interest rates as reasons why investors might
have chosen to lock in some profits. But some said the recent rise
in interest rates is not likely to last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can have a pattern where you can get stronger
economic growth without damaging the bond market,'' said Jeffrey
Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is unit labor costs, and they are declining,''
he added. ``Also, we don't think Congress and the Clinton
administration will reach any agreement on big tax cuts or big
increases in spending. That means the budget surplus will be used
to pay down debt, which would be the market-friendly thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was among the biggest losers of the session. It fell 5
5/16, to 167|. But over the last year the stock has posted a gain
of 116 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is up 62 percent over the last year, fell 3\, to
134|. Cisco Systems, which has seen its price rise 166 percent over
the last 12 months, lost 2 39/64, to 112 25/64.
</P>
<P>
   After the market closed Cisco reported net income of 36 cents a
share in its second quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations.
However, Cisco chose not to announce a split in its stock, a
development many on Wall Street had been anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals in technology are still good,'' said Robert
Froelich, the chief investment strategist at Scudder Kemper
Investments. ``But investors are going to take profits where they
have made them.''
</P>
<P>
   Froelich said that uncertainties surrounding Brazil and
President Clinton's impeachment trial have prevented stock prices
from moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get some closure on those issues, and then the
market can get moving again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of the session was the performance of
Perot Systems, the world's sixth-largest provider of outsourced
information technology services that was founded by Texas
billionaire Ross Perot. The company sold 6.5 million shares, or 7.7
percent of its outstanding stock, in an initial public offering.

AFTER THE FRENZY OF SUPER SUNDAY, ACCOUNT ACTIVITY TAKES CENTER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that Super Bowl XXXIII has gone the way of its
XXXII predecessors, Madison Avenue is making its annual turn from
funny animals, glitzy special effects and bosomy models to the nuts
and bolts of the business: account activity.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Super Sunday, there have been developments
affecting accounts with billings estimated at more than $375
million involving advertisers from the Internet and the breakfast
table to Wall Street and the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   E(star)Trade Group Inc., an Internet brokerage firm, is
conducting a so-called creative shootout for its traditional
advertising account, with billings estimated at $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at E(star)Trade, which operates a stock-trading Web
site at www.etrade.com, have asked the incumbent agency, Gotham in
New York, to offer campaign ideas along with Goodby, Silverstein &AMP;
Partners in San Francisco, a unit of Omnicom Group that was
represented on the Super Bowl with the ``really big bag'' spot for
Cracker Jack and the commercials for Anheuser-Busch about a swamp
shootout between the Budweiser frogs and Louie the lizard.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sievert, vice president for marketing at E(star)Trade in
Palo Alto, Calif., confirmed reports of the review this week in the
trade publications Advertising Age and Adweek. He said that
E(star)Trade wanted to explore what new perspectives Goodby,
Silverstein might bring to the business. The online portion of the
account remains at Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in Westport, Conn., a
unit of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   F. Stone Roberts, co-chairman and chief executive at Gotham, a
unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, said that he had not
yet decided whether his agency would take part in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may end up standing behind the work we have produced,'' he
added. ``I have a high degree of confidence what we've done has
been incredibly effective.'' The current campaign for E(star)Trade
carries the theme ``Someday, we'll all invest this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotham has handled the traditional, or off-line, part of the
ETrade account for two years. The online brokerage industry has
become increasingly competitive; at least two ETrade rivals have
recently changed agencies.
</P>
<P>
   A more familiar investment name, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;
Co., completed a review for its consolidated media account, with
billings estimated at $200 million, by naming Starcom Media
Services in Chicago for media buying.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Pierce, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
described the consolidation as ``a cost-saving measure.'' She
declined to identify the other participants in the review;
Advertising Age reported that Starcom, a unit of the Leo Burnett
Co., was selected in a shootout with Optimum Media in New York,
part of the DDB Needham Worldwide unit of Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan Stanley media duties had been divided among agencies
including Starcom, DDB Needham and Black Rocket in San Francisco,
for Discover Brokerage Direct. The Starcom gain was the most recent
in a series that has brought in accounts with billings estimated at
more than $500 million from advertisers like the Budget Rent-a-Car
Corp., the Ralston Purina Co. and the Sara Lee Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Burnett, the agency landed additional assignments
from a longtime client, the Kellogg Co., which shifted two products
there from another roster agency, J. Walter Thompson USA in New
York, owned by WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony T. Hebron, a spokesman for Kellogg in Battle Creek,
Mich., confirmed a report in Advertising Age that the company had
reassigned some brands but declined to discuss them. However,
advertising executives close to Kellogg's agency relations
identified them as Honey Crunch Corn Flakes and an undisclosed new
product, which join brands at Burnett like Corn Flakes and Special
K.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson continues handling brands like Raisin Bran and the new
Country Inn Specialties line. Though Bob Jeffrey, president at
Thompson New York, declined to discuss the changes, referring
inquiries to Kellogg, he did acknowledge that the agency had named
``a new core team'' for the Kellogg account in North America as
part of plans to ``make sure we have the right resources for every
client.''
</P>
<P>
   John Clinton, chairman at Thompson Canada in Toronto, was named
to the additional duties of running the Kellogg North American
business, Jeffrey said, along with Kay Allison, as head strategic
planner, and Alan Platt, as creative director. Norman A. MacMaster
will continue as executive vice president and global business
director for the Kellogg account, Jeffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   As Thompson lost business from one client, the agency gained
assignments from another, the Coty unit of Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH,
which named the Thompson London office to introduce its Rimmel
brand of cosmetics in 27 countries this year. The worldwide
advertising and marketing budget for the year was estimated at more
than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rimmel, described as Britain's top-selling cosmetics line, has
been handled by Thompson offices in that country and five other
markets: Eastern Europe, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and
Scandinavia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Clorox Co. in Oakland, Calif., named roster
agencies to handle products added to its lineup with the
acquisition of the First Brands Corp., completed last week. Under
its previous ownership, First Brands in June awarded those
assignments, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million,
to McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York, part of the
McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham San Francisco, which handles bleaches, household
cleaning products and Armor All automotive products for Clorox,
adds the STP automotive products line and the Glad line of plastic
bags, wraps and containers.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco office of Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising, which
handles Clorox brands in categories like charcoal, cat litter and
water filtration, adds the Jonny Cat and Scoop Away cat litter
brands and Hearthlogg fire logs and starters.
</P>
<P>
   There were also assignments covering all the former First Brands
brands. The duties for campaigns aimed at Spanish-speaking
consumers were awarded to Bravo Group in San Francisco, a unit of
Y&AMP;R Media planning duties were assigned to Diamond Communications
in San Francisco, a joint venture of DDB Needham and Clorox. And
media buying was dispatched to the Media Edge in New York, a unit
of Y&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   All the Clorox changes are effective on May 1 _ only 274 days to
Super Bowl XXXIV on Jan. 30, 2000.

EDITORIAL: THE NEW SURPLUS ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 3: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the initiatives in President Clinton's proposed budget
this week, the most politically significant may turn out to be a
simple forecast. The United States, the administration says, is on
the threshold of an era of budget surpluses, nearly $4.5 trillion
in the next 15 years. Far from calling for a major redirection of
government, Clinton wants to set aside a mere 11 percent of the
surpluses for new spending. Three-quarters would be used to shore
up Medicare and Social Security. Embattled by impeachment but
enjoying the highest approval ratings of his presidency, Clinton
has sketched a vision striking for its essential conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   The approach is also sensible and farsighted. Social Security
and Medicare face future deficits unless significant changes are
made. Instead of proposing bold new programs to serve as his
legacy, Clinton is calling for a major investment in the two
programs that are the greatest legacies of the New Deal and the
Great Society. Republicans have seized on the dozens of smaller
spending and tax-break initiatives to paint Clinton as an old-style
apostle of big government. But under the president's budget plan,
overall spending is projected to shrink to 19.4 percent of the
nation's economy, the smallest proportion in 25 years. The dreaded
label of liberal does not fit.
</P>
<P>
   The budget has clearly thrown Republicans onto the defensive.
Every poll shows that Americans would rather preserve Social
Security and Medicare than enjoy a big new tax cut, as Republican
leaders want. It is also questionable how much political support
there will be for a tax cut that disproportionately benefits the
wealthiest Americans. On the other hand, Republicans are right to
note that both Social Security and Medicare will need additional
fixes beyond the proposed infusion of surplus money.
</P>
<P>
   The extra attraction of Clinton's approach is that most of the
surpluses would actually go to paying down the publicly held
federal debt, a step widely supported by many Americans and
endorsed last month by Alan Greenspan. As the Federal Reserve
chairman also warned, the surpluses are only a projection. They may
diminish if the economy turns sour or plans for spending cuts do
not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Policy makers in Washington are finding it hard to cope with the
new political reality of surpluses. Only two years ago, every new
proposal for spending increases or tax cuts was challenged as a
threat to fiscal balance. Now the familiar budget debates can take
place in a context of at least some extra money becoming available.
The surpluses make it possible, at least theoretically, for
Congress and the president to agree eventually to some kind of
combination of tax cuts, money for Social Security and Medicare,
spending increases and paying down of the debt. These issues are
taking on greater immediacy as the Senate seems to be moving toward
winding up the impeachment trial by the end of next week.

UMASS PRESIDENT'S PAY HIKED; TUITION NEXT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ University of Massachusetts President William M.
Bulger's salary will rise to nearly $300,000 within 17 months under
a three-step plan approved by the university's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the board is expected to raise tuition and fees at
its meeting Wednesday, in a sharp departure from a four-year policy
of cuts that has helped define, and lure students, to a ``new
UMass.''
</P>
<P>
   The second and third steps of Bulger's pay raise will secure his
place among the highest-paid public university presidents in the
nation, hiking his salary to $256,000 this July 1, and $282,000 on
July 1, 2000. The former state Senate president earned $189,000
before the trustees approved the three-step raise in October, when
it was not widely reported, making the total raise 49.2 percent in
less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   While the salary increases may open the board up to public
criticism, the move on tuitions put it in immediate confrontation
with Board of Higher Education chairman James F. Carlin, who said
Tuesday night that his board would reject the tuition raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to approve it if they send us anything other
than a 5 percent cut in tuition,'' said Carlin, whose board has
final approval over UMass tuition. ``It's still one of the highest
costs for public universities in the nation, and we absolutely
think they are doing the wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the trustees vote, I hope they would think a little
about the parents and the students who are borrowing money to pay
these fees, who are remortgaging their homes to pay these fees, who
are working two and three jobs to pay these fees. Public higher
education should be as inexpensive as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With Carlin's board on a a mission to cut tuition since he took
the helm in 1995, the UMass board, too, has promised to keep
increases below inflation. And indeed, under the plan that has
already been approved by a key subcommittee, tuition will actually
decrease by an average of .1 percent on the four campuses next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But combining tuition with mandatory fees, the true measure of
price, students will pay an average of 1.4 percent more _ with
those at the Boston campus paying 3 percent more. For students who
live on campus, the cost of attending UMass will rise an average of
3 percent. At Amherst, students who live on campus would have to
pay 3.6 percent more for the year that begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Bulger defended the increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``UMass is still affordable excellence,'' said Robert Connolly,
a UMass executive vice president. ``At the beginning of these cuts,
this was the second most expensive public university in New
England, and now we're fifth; only Maine is cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Board of trustees chairman Robert Karam was unavailable for
comment Tuesday, but in an interview Friday, he said that Bulger
deserved this year's raise to $238,000, and then some. On that
occasion, he did not mention the other increases in Bulger's pay
the board had agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Karam pointed out that the UMass president's salary had not been
raised since 1991, when a fiscal crisis forced cuts across the
entire state budget.
</P>
<P>
   Karam and others point to Bulger's success in elevating the
esteem of a public university that had long fallen far short of the
state's better-known private colleges and universities. Bulger has
increased fundraising by 77 percent since taking over in 1995, and
brought 145 high school valedictorians to the university under his
University Scholars program. Applications and enrollment are up, as
are SAT scores. The flagship campus at Amherst has risen 59 rungs
on the widely watched US News and World Report rankings last year.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin, too, defended Bulger's raise, saying it was in keeping
with the elevated status of the university. ``I'm personally very
supportive of the raise,'' Carlin said. ``Compared to presidents of
other institutions compared to UMass, he's still on the lower
end.'' Many private college presidents are within the $282,000
range. About 50 nationwide, according to the Chronicle of Higher
Education, made more than $300,000 last year, 10 make more than
$400,000, and three earned $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on public university presidents are harder to come
by; the Chronicle surveys only private school presidents. But this
year, the president of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill earned the same salary as Bulger, $238,000. The president of
the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor earned $261,000 in 1994-95.
This year, the president of Pennsylvania State earned $250,000 and
the president of the University of Connecticut $255,000.
</P>
<P>
   But about the tuition and fees plan, Carlin remained adamant.
Not only did he disapprove of the fee increase, he also demanded a
steeper cut in tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Board of Higher Ed believes the fees ought to be cut,'' he
said, ``not left level and certainly not increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said operating costs, and plans for technology and
laboratories forced the university to raise fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just too difficult to keep it flat for a second year in
a row, given that there is slight inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlin pointed to increased state money and the record
fundraising levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they can perform very effectively without a fee
increase,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Carlin took over, the Board of Higher Education told
UMass it wanted it to cut tuition by 5 percent a year. The first
year, 1996-97, Carlin said, the UMass trustees did not set tuition,
so the Board of Higher Education simply set it for them, with the
five percent cut. Since then, with Bulger's lead, the board of
trustees has continued to cut tuition.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s and early 90s, many students were squeezed out
of the state university, as state funding declined 22 percent, and
tuition more than doubled. By 1994, the tail end of the state
fiscal crisis, UMass was the fourth most expensive public
university in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly emphasized that even with the tuition and fees increase
planned for next September, the total price is down 3.5 percent
from the rate in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   State residents who attend UMass next year would pay an average
of $4,794 in tuition and fees, an increase of $67. That increase is
$125 at Boston, and $78 at Amherst. The trustees also noted that
the increase would be slightly less than inflation, which is at 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly also emphasized that UMass increased financial aid 156
percent from 1990 to 1998, to $143.2 million from $56 million. The
number of students receiving aid has gone from 5,971 to 20,337, a
241 percent increase. And the average per-student aid has risen to
$3,608 from $2,427, or 49 percent.

   The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered the biggest
setback, slumping 46.67 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,463.42. The
Dow Jones industrial average dropped 71.58 points, to 9,274.12, and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.01 points, to
1,261.99. In the bond market, Treasury prices fell sharply as the

REDS GET VAUGHN FROM PADRES FOR SANDERS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres, their general manager said firmly Tuesday,
are not this winter's version of the 1997 Florida Marlins, even
though surface appearances could make it seem otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres on Tuesday traded Greg Vaughn, one of four players
who hit 50 or more home runs last season, to the Reds, adding to
the disappearance of the San Diego team that won the 1998 National
League pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months ago, Vaughn, Kevin Brown, Ken Caminiti and
Steve Finley were instrumental members of the team that was playing
the Yankees in the World Series. Now they have dispersed or have
been dispersed to other National League teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres sent Vaughn and Mark Sweeney, primarily a
pinch-hitter, to Cincinnati for Reggie Sanders, who will replace
Vaughn in left field; Damian Jackson, a young infielder, and Josh
Harris, a minor league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trading for kids we hope will be good three, four
years down the road,'' Kevin Towers, the Padres' general manager,
said by telephone. ``Most of these players are proven major league
players. These are not salary dumps. This was a baseball decision,
not a financial decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers, who was also thinking of his swap of starting pitchers
with Toronto, Joey Hamilton for Woody Williams, was rejecting the
idea that the Padres were imitating the 1997 Marlins, who instantly
dismantled themselves in a payroll purge after they won the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Marlins, who shed their high-priced players as
quickly as they could in return for a plethora of minor leaguers,
the Padres aggressively tried to re-sign the free agents Brown and
Finley while making less of an attempt to retain Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made contract offers to all of them,'' Towers said,
including a six-year, $60 million offer to Brown. But the Padres'
No. 1 pitcher went north to Los Angeles for seven years and $105
million, Finley went east to Phoenix and Caminiti went farther east
to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Towers also noted that the team's payroll was about $50 million
last year _ it was actually $53 million _ and would be about $50
million this year. No purge there.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key things we've been trying to do,'' Towers said,
``is get younger, a little bit quicker and try to get as many
two-dimensional type of players on this ball club. More than
anything it was having control over Sanders for another year. With
Vaughn's pending free agency, we didn't know if we'd be able to
retain him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs and led the team with 119 runs
batted in, has one year left on his three-year, $15 million
contract at a $5.75 million salary, with $850,000 of that deferred.
Sanders has a $3.7 million salary this year with an option for
another year at the same salary.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, who have payroll problems of their own, initially
wanted cash in the deal to help offset the difference in salaries
but settled for the straight player deal.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, with seven years in the majors, has not played up to
the potential he was once thought to have. Injuries especially
undermined him in 1996 and 1997 after he had a good 1995 season,
hitting .306 with 28 home runs and 99 RBI. Last season, he batted
.268, hit 14 home runs and drove in 59 runs.
</P>
<P>
   In another move, Towers said that he was still trying to trade
Randy Myers, the relief pitcher the Padres obtained from Toronto
last August.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one I will work on until I go to my grave,'' the general
manager said, thinking of the $12.25 million the 36-year-old Myers
is owed for the next two years.

MAIER AND KJUS TIE FOR WORLD TITLE IN SUPER-G 
 (JW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVER CREEK, Colo. _ It takes more than a speedy run down a
mountain to draw attention from John Elway in Denver Broncos
country. But even the Super Bowl's winning quarterback found his
match here Tuesday in the person of Hermann Maier, the Austrian ski
racer.
</P>
<P>
   True to his reputation as the Herminator, a nickname Maier
acquired after a spectacular fall and subsequent comeback in the
1998 Olympics, the Austrian daredevil let his skis run at lightning
speed Tuesday. But stealing some of the thunder in the super-G was
Lasse Kjus of Norway, who finished in the same blistering time, 1
minute 14.53 seconds, for a gold medal tie on the first day of
racing in the world Alpine ski championships. It was the first time
in a world ski championship that the gold medal was awarded
jointly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' Maier said. ``Now maybe I can go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, of course, because he is scheduled to race in the
downhill here Saturday. If it bothered the 26-year-old Maier to
share the super-G title with Kjus, his closest rival this season
for skiing's overall World Cup title, he wasn't letting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same,'' Maier said. ``World champion is world
champion. Alone or together.''
</P>
<P>
   If two's a tight finish, three's a crowd, but Hans Knauss almost
crashed the gold-medal party. Knauss, 27, a teammate of Maier's,
came within one-hundredth of a second of the two gold medalists. It
was barely a wisp of a difference, even for ski racing's
split-second finishes. But it was enough to leave Knauss, who skied
the 1.2-mile Birds of Prey slope in 1:14.54, with the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   In another quirk on an unusual day, Chad Fleischer, 27, a U.S.
Ski Team racer from nearby Vail, finished a surprising sixth, with
a time of 1:14.81. The result was 0.28 seconds behind the winners,
and the best finish of the American's career. Three years ago in a
World Cup super-G in Garmisch, Germany, Fleischer finished 11th.
</P>
<P>
   It was left for the Austrian team to reassert some semblance of
order on a capricious day on the slopes. Powerful and confident,
the Austrians showed again that they were going to be almost
impossible to topple in their second straight season of
superiority. In the current World Cup overall standing, seven of
the top 10 competitors are Austrian. Maier stands out as the team's
pillar of stone.
</P>
<P>
   Maier's strength allows him to recover from mishaps that may
physically and emotionally scar less adept skiers. At the Winter
Games last February in Nagano, Japan, for instance, still shaken
and sore from his harrowing crash in the downhill _ which sent him
catapulting through two safety nets and piles of snow _ Maier went
on to capture Olympic gold medals in both the super-G and the giant
slalom.
</P>
<P>
   But Maier's strength as a competitor owes something to his
lighter side as well. He is a jokester of some repute and possesses
a wild streak. He has displayed both qualities here in the Rockies
to the guarded amusement of the local police.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors this week had Maier being sought by Colorado law
enforcement officials after some after-hours shenanigans last
November at a World Cup event in Aspen. It served to fuel Maier's
spawning legend as Austria's answer to the Sundance Kid.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Maier and his teammate, Andreas Schifferer,
had stolen a bicycle last Nov. 29 after hours of partying. Scott
Thompson, patrol director for the Pitkin County Sheriff's
Department in Aspen, said the skiers had also ``borrowed'' a car _
it was initially labeled as stolen _ and then took off on a bicycle
after damaging the vehicle in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both riding the same bicycle,'' Thompson said. ``We
detained them long enough to ask questions, but let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the owner of the car nor the owner of the bicycle
pressed charges, Thompson said, and restitution was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a full load of nonsense,'' Klaus Leistner, general
manager of the Austrian Ski Federation, said Tuesday. ``You must
give a team like this a chance to be silly now and then.''

NFL STAR WALTER PAYTON NEEDS LIVER TRANSPLANT 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Miss., Minn.)  (bl) 
By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Hall of Fame running back and Chicago Bears legend
Walter Payton revealed Tuesday that he is has a rare liver disease
and will need a transplant within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an emotional news conference where he at times broke
into tears, Payton urged his friends and fans to pray for him and
told the public he was optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearing tired and thin, the 44-year-old Payton said he
feels fine and is ``as healthy as I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I survived a lot of hits playing football, and this is just
something else that I'm going to have to overcome,'' Payton said in
an interview after the news conference. ``It's out of my hands now,
though, so we'll just have to stay positive and pray things go
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's physician, Dr. Joseph Lagattuta, a liver specialist,
said that Payton has primary sclerosing cholangitis. The disease,
which affects only three of every 100,000 people, blocks the flow
of bile out of the liver and damages liver cells. The cause is
unknown, but Lagattuta said the disease is not related to
hepatitis, alcohol use or steroid use.
</P>
<P>
   Lagattuta estimated that without a transplant, Payton would live
approximately two years, but said that the survival rate after a
transplant is very high.
</P>
<P>
   ''A one-year survival rate is approximately 88 percent, with
long-term survival very promising,'' Lagattuta said. ``We have
every hope that Walter will receive a transplant and after the
operation return to a normal, active life.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton said he first began to feel ill in July, and consulted
Lagattuta on Oct. 1. He is also receiving treatment at the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where he said he will return in the
next few weeks to be evaluated for a donor and be placed on the
transplant list.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Connie, estimated that Payton has lost about 25 pounds
since the symptoms began in early July. In addition to the weight
loss, the disease's symptoms include fatigue, fever and jaundice, a
yellowing of the eyes and skin pigment.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, a private person, said he probably would not have come
public with his disease had it not been for a public appearance
last week, during which members of the local news media noticed his
physical appearance, fueling rumors about his declining health.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been some speculation in the media recently about
what was going on with me and I just wanted to get the truth out
and end any of that speculation,'' Payton said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, who played 13 years for the Bears, led them to the 1985
Super Bowl championship and was selected to the Pro Bowl nine
times.
</P>
<P>
   Payton is probably best known for breaking Jim Brown's record
for rushing yardage, gaining 16,726 yards, a mark that still
stands.
</P>
<P>
   He also holds the single-game record, running for 275 yards
against Minnesota in 1977. Payton was the Bears' first-round draft
pick in 1975 after setting dozens of National Collegiate Athletic
Association and school records at Jackson State in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Since retiring from football in 1987, Payton has created a
substantial business enterprise called Walter Payton Inc.,
including Walter Payton Power Equipment, which markets the sales of
cranes and aerial lifts. He also owns the Walter Payton Roundhouse
Complex, a banquet complex outside Chicago, and is co-owner of an
Indy-car racing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty scary,'' said Payton's son, Jarrett, a nationally
recruited high-school football player. ``You've seen your dad go
through the NFL without many injuries and then something like this
happens and it makes you realize he's not invincible.''

IOC'S CREDIBILITY QUESTIONED AS DRUG MEETING STARTS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By PAUL MONTGOMERY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ The international meeting that began
here Tuesday was originally meant to reassert the International
Olympic Committee's supremacy in fighting the use of illegal drugs
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's 78-year-old
president, presided over a session in which government officials
from around the world sharply criticized his organization. He sat
expressionless as the bribery scandal engulfing the IOC took center
stage during the first day of the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me sadly but respectfully note that recent examples of
alleged corruption, lack of accountability, and the failure of
leadership have challenged the legitimacy of this institution,''
said Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the director of White House drug policy.
``These events have tarnished the credibility of the movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Banks, Britain's sports minister, said, ``The British
government expects the IOC to clean up its act.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsebeth Gerner Nielsen, Denmark's minister of culture and
sport, said, ``The IOC must stress the importance of values, not
the importance of its leaders.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Samaranch did not answer the critics, other IOC members
did. Jacques Rogge, an IOC executive board member from Belgium,
attacked American professional sports for allowing Mark McGwire to
set a home run record while taking an over-the-counter nutritional
supplement that works as a steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Rogge called the United States the place ``where you see that
one of the biggest sports heroes, McGwire, is admitting taking
androstenedione, which is forbidden in all other sports around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you go on the moralizing and lecturing tone, you
must be sure you're own house is in order.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince Alexandre de Merode, the Belgian IOC member whom
Samaranch wants to lead an independent anti-doping agency, said he
could not understand the ``lack of confidence'' in the IOC and
questioned the moral authority of politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take offense that politicians don't trust me to chair this
agency,'' he said. ``Why should I trust politicians?''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to government corruption scandals throughout Europe, de
Merode said: ``Ask people in the streets if there is a great
confidence in politicians. I have some doubts.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was created, the aim of the anti-doping conference was
to establish an international agency to try to control the problem
of drugs in sports, to standardize the description of prohibited
substances and to impose penalties for use of drugs in various
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, came revelations of bribery and other
questionable conduct in allocating the Olympics to bidding cities.
So far, four of the then 115 members have resigned and five others
have been suspended pending expulsion by the full IOC, which meets
here next month. In addition, an undisclosed number of members are
still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the rare times in the 105-year history of the
modern Olympics movement that governments have had a say in the
internal workings of the IOC. The first presentation of the
session, by German Interior Minister Otto Schily set the tone for
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Schily, who presides over sports matters during the current
six-month German presidency of the 15-nation European Union, urged
immediate change within the IOC, with the introduction of nonsecret
voting, open financial accounts and democratic election of members.
The European Union's sports ministers are scheduled to meet in Bonn
in May, and change in the IOC will be on the agenda. Earlier, in an
interview on German television, Schily called the IOC ``a kind of
constitutional monarchy of sports'' and said of Samaranch,
``Everyone must know when it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said that an independent drug agency would have to
work ``365 days of the year,'' and not just at competitions, and
must be free to choose which athletes to test and where. He also
reiterated a proposal to preserve urine and blood samples from
competing athletes so that even years later, when new tests for
currently undetectable drugs were found, the samples could be
retested and athletes potentially stripped of their medals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Samaranch, who delivered the welcoming address, called doping
``this odious and unhealthy form of cheating.''
</P>
<P>
   He also referred to the bribery scandal. ``As you know, over the
last few weeks the International Olympic Committee has been
confronted with a serious situation with regard to allegations of
wrongdoing leveled against some of its members,'' he said. ``We
have swiftly taken all the necessary measures, and are continuing
our investigations to insure that Olympic ethics are respected.`
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Rogge, the IOC liaison for the 2000 Summer
Games in Sydney, Australia, cleared organizers there of any
wrongdoing in securing the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was in order, according to IOC rules,'' Rogge said.
``There is no need to look further into this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   John Coates, the Australian Olympics chief, said two weeks ago
that he had promised two African IOC members $70,000 in incentive
payments to their national federations if Sydney won the 2000
Games. The promise was made on the eve of the IOC vote and Sydney
defeated Beijing as host city by two votes in the secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Rogge said Tuesday that he had met with Coates, here for the
anti-doping meeting, and other Australian Olympic officials. He
said they showed him documents from the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Shorter, a member of the American delegation and a former
Olympic marathoner, said he had been encouraged by the
determination shown at the conference to root out drug use. He said
athletes who did not use drugs had the common perception that the
Olympic movement regarded drug-testing as a public relations
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hoped creation of a truly independent international
anti-doping agency, with wide testing and punishment powers, would
remove temptation from young athletes. He talked about his
19-year-old son, considering a career in distance running. ``I
don't want him to have to decide between drugs and not,'' he said.
``As an athlete, I was waiting 22 years for something like this
meeting to happen, and today it finally did.`  &QL;

ISRAELIS DEBATE BURYING BRONFMAN AMONG HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)  (lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Edgar Bronfman Sr. is alive and well and traveling
in India, but in Israel they are planning his burial.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks the World Zionist Organization, which runs the
exclusive Mount Herzl cemetery, will decide whether Bronfman, 69,
the Canadian billionaire, should be granted the distinction of
becoming the first non-Israeli to be buried in Israel's tiny
equivalent of Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear who initiated this deliberation. Bronfman, the
president of the World Jewish Congress since 1981, did not make the
request himself, although he had previously expressed a wish to
spend eternity in the company of Israel's great leaders. Avraham
Burg, chairman of the Jewish Agency, said it was passed through
back channels to him.
</P>
<P>
   But it is clear that the request touches a nerve here, raising
quite pointedly the critical question of whom the Jewish homeland
belongs to at a time when Israeli relations with the Jewish
diaspora are strained.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Herzl is a potent symbol to Israelis, the hallowed ground
for great Zionists ranging from the father of them all, Theodor
Herzl, through Golda Meir and Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now world Jewry wants its share of the symbolic soil,'' the
newspaper Haaretz declared recently under the headline ``Unease in
Zion as Bronfman Picks a Plot on Mount Herzl.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, chairman of Seagram Co., could not be reached in
India. Elan Steinberg, the executive director of the World Jewish
Congress in New York, said that as far as he knew, Bronfman had not
been consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone forgot to ask him,'' Steinberg said. ``Still, despite
the macabre element, I think it's essentially very flattering. And
I think it raises very important questions about whether the Jewish
state honors Jewish people as a whole or only deems Israeli
contributions to be of the highest order.''
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli writer, Michael Shashar, spent a month interviewing
Bronfman last year for a book, ``Who Are You, Edgar Bronfman?''
which will be published here in Hebrew in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Shashar said Bronfman had expressed his great desire to be
buried in Mount Herzl. Nothing would make him happier, the author
said Bronfman had told him, than to be acknowledged in that way as
``a Jewish leader who worked for his people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am buried there, that will be a kind of proof that I was
a real mensch, in the full meaning of the word,'' Bronfman is
quoted in Shashar's book as saying. He also told Shashar that years
ago he made a personal request to Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg, an
American Reform Jewish leader, to put out some feelers on the
subject for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, who was a leader of the movement to free Soviet Jews,
more recently led the campaign to force Swiss banks to compensate
Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   There is a military cemetery at Mount Herzl, too, but the
special section for ``great leaders'' contains fewer than 100
tombs. Only former presidents, prime ministers, speakers of
Parliament and presidents of the World Zionist Organization are
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like David Ben-Gurion, the first prime minister of Israel,
and Chaim Weizmann, the first president, chose to be buried
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But to date, everyone buried at Mount Herzl has been Israeli,
and some would like to keep it that way. They feel that if there
are Jews who did not choose Israel in life, they should not be able
to slip in after death and claim a place in its pantheon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The section for the nation's great leaders on Mount Herzl is
reserved exclusively for leaders of the nation who lived in Israel
and for leaders of the state who have passed away,'' said Tourism
Minister Moshe Katsav, the chairman of a ministerial committee that
together with the World Zionist Organization allots plots there.
</P>
<P>
   Burg said Bronfman had never mentioned Mount Herzl to him _
``and I've clocked hundreds of Edgar hours,'' he said. But he said
he nonetheless hoped to use this request to establish a ``point of
principle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a category of righteous Jewish people who,
though they never in their lifetime decided to live in Israel,
should be respected in the highest way by this nation,'' Burg said.
``It's very important that Israelis understand we are not standing
here on our own, that we couldn't have made it without the
unequivocal support of world Jewry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who think we shouldn't mix the sacred with the
secular, so to speak. But the mountain is big enough for
everyone.''

 &HT;    Professor accused of making Honduran teen a sex slave
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A diminutive Honduran teen told a federal jury Tuesday
how Florida Atlantic University professor Marvin Hersh gave him
toys, clothes and money over three years in exchange for sex in
Honduras and in the suburban Boca Raton home he shared with Hersh.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking softly through an interpreter, the young man, now 18,
said he never wanted to have sex with the computer science
professor _ whom he called Mario _ but did so out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of poverty,'' he said. ``I wanted Mario to help my
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh, 58, is on trial in federal court on charges of passport
fraud, alien smuggling and transporting a minor with the intent of
engaging in sexual activity. Prosecutors allege he seduced the teen
and two of his brothers with presents and money, then illegally
brought the boy to the United States in 1995 to use him as a sex
slave.
</P>
<P>
   Hersh's attorneys said outside of court that they believed
federal authorities coerced the young man into testifying against
Hersh by telling him that was the only way he would be allowed to
return to his native country. They will continue to cross-examine
the teen today.
</P>
<P>
   He testified Tuesday that in 1994 and 1995, Hersh came to
Honduras every three or four months and had sex with him. After
each encounter, he said, Hersh gave him presents, including a
plastic toy helicopter, clothes, and on one occasion, the Honduran
equivalent of $10.
</P>
<P>
   The teen, who has eight brothers and sisters, said he gave the
money to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Hersh gave him a fake passport and birth certificate
and brought him to the United States, the teen testified.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-3-inch teen, who looks younger than his age, was
enrolled in the fourth grade at Whispering Pines Elementary School.
Hersh told him to tell anyone who asked that he was Hersh's son,
the teen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the pair shared Hersh's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you have your own bedroom?'' Assistant United States
Attorney John C. McMillan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but I never used it,'' the boy answered.
</P>
<P>
   The boy initially denied that he had a sexual relationship with
Hersh when he was asked by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ashamed,'' he said during the cross-examination. ``But I
am tired of lying. Everything Mario told me to say was a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Hersh was suspended from his teaching post after his 1997
arrest. Since then, he has been in jail in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The teen's mother testified Monday and several of his older
brothers are expected to take the stand later in the trial. Also
expected to testify is businessman Nelson ``Jay'' Buhler, who
accompanied Hersh to Honduras between 1994 and 1996 to have sex
with young boys, authorities say.
</P>

RIVALRY BETWEEN DUVAL AND WOODS TOWERS OVER PGA TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A young boy poked through the crowd as David Duval was signing
autographs last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for the autograph, Mr. Duval,'' said the boy. ``And
beat Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval looked at the boy, then started laughing. It was another
indication that no matter how Duval and Woods view things, the
public has begun to view them as rivals, two golfers in their 20s
who should spend the bulk of their careers competing for golf's
biggest prizes.
</P>
<P>
   As Duval and Woods prepare for Thursday's first round of the
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California, they have become
the most dominant figures on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Woods remains the tour's biggest star, with a power game and a
glamorous appeal that attract the largest galleries by far,
including fans who normally would never venture to a golf course.
This week, Woods will play Pebble Beach with actor Kevin Costner, a
pairing certain to attract groupies and paparazzi, not to mention a
few golf fans.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, meanwhile, has grabbed the spotlight soley via
performance, winning nine times in his past 29 starts, and becoming
only the third tour player in history to shoot a 59. In the past
year, Duval, 27, has won the way that many expected Woods to win.
So if people want to measure him against the 23-year-old Woods,
Duval can think of worse things.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, it's flattering to be anointed the one
who is going to challenge Tiger in the future years,'' said Duval.
``But I've played out here long enough to realize that there are
many players who are just as able as Tiger or I am to win
tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For that reason, I don't put much focus on one-on-one
rivalries, although I know people want to create one. I think the
talk is good for the game. But I also think some people wish for
stuff, not necessarily bad blood, but maybe a little jawing back
and forth. That's just not me. And I like Tiger. I enjoy being
around him and he's a really good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Woods have enjoyed a friendly relationship, sharing
laughs, lunches, and compliments. But they don't share trophies,
which should make the next decade compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Both Woods and Duval are determined to win multiple major
championships, and because of their ages and their abilities, they
are likely to clash in numerous future final-round battles. There
are times when the success of one may come at the expense of the
other, and Duval did not deny he would relish a final-round
confrontation with Woods, particularly at a major.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things about golf is that you don't have to
have any ill-will in this game,'' said Duval. ``If I come
head-to-head against him at say, the U.S. Open, I want him to be
playing as good as he can play, because I want to beat him when
he's playing his best. It would feel a heck of a lot better, if you
know he gave you all he's got, and you beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far during their young professional careers, Duval and
Woods have not been at the top of their games at the same time.
Woods' best stretch came a few months after he turned pro. Starting
with the 1996 Las Vegas Invitational, Woods won six times in nine
months, including the 1997 Masters, which he won by a
record-setting 12 strokes. Duval picked up the baton in October
1997, winning his first title at the Michelob Championship at
Kingsmill, which started a victory binge that has lasted 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over where Woods and Duval are in the world ranking
has only increased talk about the two players. Woods is ranked No.
1 and Duval No. 2. Yet, the majority of players believe that Duval
should be No. 1 on the strength of his last 15 months, a span in
which he has won nine times compared to once for Woods. The ranking
is a system that tabulates points based on performance and strength
of tournament field over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense for anybody else other than David to be
on top,'' said Phil Mickelson. ``I would have to rank David No. 1
over anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods insists that winning tournaments, particularly majors, is
far more important to him than being ranked No. 1. Woods has been
frustrated at times by his recent string of close calls, the latest
being Sunday at the Phoenix Open, when he finished third. Nobody
has more Top 10 finishes since the beginning of 1998 than Woods
(15), and he believes that if he remains consistent, the victories
will come.
</P>
<P>
   As for the attention from the new media that Duval has received
lately, Woods is hardly envious. It means less time to track down
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had lunch the other day, just talking about all the things
he has to do now, some of the obligations,'' said Woods, speaking
of Duval. ``Such as the pretournament press conference, something I
never really cared to do. Now he has to do it. It's kind of
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important challenge left for Duval is to win a major,
something Woods accomplished at age 21. Duval realizes people will
begin to judge him more harshly if two or three years from now, he
has still not won one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm a dog if I don't win a major this year,'' said
Duval, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully anticipated when I started my career that I would have
the ability to win majors. And I want to maximize my abilities. For
one guy, that might mean having a great year. But for another guy,
that might mean winning 10 money titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval definitely has the ability to win money. He has already
surpassed the $1 million mark this season with two victories in
January, and with the 32 percent increase in tour purses this year,
many people expect the tour's top money-winner this year will
surpass $4 million, and perhaps even approach $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Duval won the title last year with $2,591,000; Woods won it in
1997 with $2,067,000. But both find motivation beyond money. And
they pursue their goals with different agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Duval takes a workingman's approach to his season. Tournaments
are there to be played, he reasons, and this year he will play in
27 or 28.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' schedule is more selective. He builds it around the major
tournaments, and he likes to play overseas more than Duval. He also
says the constant, sometimes suffocating attention takes its toll
on him and makes it tough to play week after week after week. So he
trims his PGA Tour schedule to 20 or 21 tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect Duval's exploits, or anything else, to change
that. While Woods expects to play in all three of the new World
Golf Championship events, that simply means he will drop two or
three other events from his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to save yourself, because we have three majors in the
summer,'' said Woods. ``Then after that, we have the Ryder Cup,
another World Golf Championship, then the Tour Championship, then
another World Golf Championship. Counting overseas, I think I've
played 26 or so a year. That's pretty good for me. I also have a
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But a big part of life for both Duval and Woods is golf. And
like it or not, their accomplishments will be compared. Call it a
rivalry if you must, said Duval. But call it a friendly one, and
one that should be fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have somebody like Tiger come into the game and do what
he's done has meant nothing but good,'' said Duval. ``He has
brought more people to the game. All of us owe him. I'll always be
a Tiger Woods fan. But based on what's happened, there are probably
a few more David Duval fans out there, too. And that's good.'' &QL;

FATHER AWARDED $375,000 IN PARENTAL LEAVE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ In the first sex discrimination case under the
federal Family and Medical Leave Act, a jury awarded $375,000 to a
Maryland state trooper who said he was refused extended leave to
care for his newborn daughter, because he was male.
</P>
<P>
   The trooper, Kevin Knussman, who is a helicopter paramedic, said
that his supervisors refused to give him extended leave under
either the federal law, which gives workers up to 12 weeks of
parental leave, or a Maryland law that allows ``primary care
providers'' up to 30 days of paid leave following the birth or
adoption of a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Knussman testified that a personnel manager told him that ``God
made women to have babies and unless I could have babies, I could
not be a primary care giver,'' and that ``unless your wife is in a
coma or dead, you can't be the primary care provider.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Mandelbaum, who represented Knussman and is a lawyer with
the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project, said
the verdict sent ``a strong message to employers that it is illegal
sex discrimination to deny the rights of fathers who want to be
with their children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many fathers find that the culture hasn't caught up with the
law,'' Ms. Mandelbaum said. ``In many workplaces, even law firms
where they know the law, men are still discouraged from taking time
off to take care of babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Sconion, a lawyer representing the state police in the
case before Judge Walter Black Jr. of U.S. District Court here,
said she would file a motion to overturn the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law requires all employers with 50 or more workers
to allow them up to 12 weeks of unpaid family leave to care for a
new baby or seriously ill family member. The law allows workers
with accrued vacation, personal or sick leave to use it to receive
paid time.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lenhoff, a lawyer at the National Partnership for Women
and Families in Washington, a group that has supported the family
leave law, said that some 20 million Americans a year have used the
law since it was enacted in 1993, about six in 10 of them women.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1996 report by the U.S. Department of Labor, only
about six in 10 of the affected employers were aware of the law,
and 40 percent of both men and women were unaware of their leave
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Knussman, who did not feel he could afford extended unpaid time,
sought paid leave under the federal law, submitting his request for
four to eight weeks of family leave in October 1994, two months
before his first baby was due.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had accumulated more than 1,200 hours of sick leave
and 250 hours of annual and personal leave in his 20 years on the
force, Knussman said his supervisors said that there was ``no way''
he could have four to eight weeks of paid parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   In late November, Knussman's wife, Kimberly, was hospitalized
with complications of pregnancy, and on Dec. 2, he got a message
from a personnel manager, informing him of a new Maryland law under
which state employees with primary responsibility for newborns
could use up to 30 days of their sick leave to care for a baby.
</P>
<P>
   But when Knussman asked if he could use that law, he said, the
personnel manager told him that only women could be primary
providers because only women can breast-feed. Under the state law,
secondary providers were allowed to use up to 10 days, which is
what Knussman ultimately took when his daughter, Riley Paige, was
born, prematurely, on Dec. 9, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland law has since been changed to eliminate distinctions
between primary and secondary providers, allowing all to take 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up before the jury of four men and five women, Ms.
Sconion said Knussman's sex-discrimination claim should be
dismissed because there had been no intent to discriminate against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each person acted reasonably based on the information
available to them,'' she told the jury. ``What they knew was that
they had a statute in front of them that nobody knew how to
apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Knussman made repeated requests to have his leave extended
because of his wife's medical difficulties. His supervisors
repeatedly told him that under the state law, mothers are primary
providers and fathers are secondary, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 29, 1994, after being told that he would be considered
AWOL if he did not return, he went back to work. Knussman filed
suit in April 1995, charging violation of the Family and Medical
Leave Act, and of his constitutional right to equal protection
under the law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His case was cited by President Clinton in a 1995 radio address
on the second anniversary of the leave act, and by Hillary Rodham
Clinton in her book, ``It Takes a Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Knussman and his wife had a second daughter two years ago, and
he took the full 12 weeks paternity leave after her birth. Ms.
Sconion argued in court that the family had suffered no damages,
since he had lost no pay, and had bonded equally well with both
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides damages, Knussman's lawsuit asked for 12 weeks of
compensatory parental leave and the issuance of a formal state
police policy regarding parental leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely been worth it to fight this through,''
Knussman said after the verdict. ``It would have been worth it even
if we hadn't won. This was illegal discrimination against
fathers.''

MRS. CLINTON CAMPAIGNS, BUT FOR PROGRAMS, NOT SENATE

 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To an exuberant reaction and in an atmosphere charged
with speculation about her political future, Hillary Rodham Clinton
campaigned in Brooklyn on Tuesday _ not for any office, but for the
social spending programs in the budget her husband sent to Congress
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to help people who are trying to help themselves,''
Mrs. Clinton said at a YMCA in Bedford-Stuyvesant. ``It's hard for
me to accept that we're not going to help working moms like you.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting came right out of President Clinton's own campaign
repertory. Mrs. Clinton participated in what was presented as a
spontaneous discussion about day-care programs with an invited
panel of guests _ in this case working parents _ in front of an
audience that included a platform filled with television cameras.
And it was typical of what the administration has done in the days
since the president unveiled a budget, in an effort to promote
parts of it across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the context was different this time, as was evident from the
heavy concentration of news media that turned out for what was
otherwise an unremarkable conversation between Mrs. Clinton and the
panelists. It was a testimony to the interest generated by the mere
suggestion that Mrs. Clinton may run for the seat being vacated
after next year's election by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The audience in Bedford-Stuyvesant sat at stilled attention as
Mrs. Clinton endorsed federal spending on day care for children and
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   It was clearly a politically sympathetic crowd. ``I would like
to see her run for Senate,'' said Letisha Wadsworth, a day-care
services administrator. ``I think she has a good sense of the needs
of people in working communities like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Fleming, a regional administrator at the New York Public
Library, said: ``I think she should run for president. I think
she's past the point of running for Senate, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's staff said the first lady had not given any
consideration to her political future, and she made no reference to
it herself during her hourlong remarks.
</P>
<P>
   There have been murmurs in recent days that some Democrats have
become concerned that continued speculation about Mrs. Clinton as a
possible candidate for Senate is discouraging other serious
contenders. (At this point, Rep. Nita Lowey of Westchester County
is viewed as the strongest potential Democratic candidate.)
Moynihan's wife, Liz, is quoted in Newsweek this week as saying
that if Mrs. Clinton is going to run, ``she should say so,'' or
risk scaring away other potentially strong candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But Moynihan, in an interview Tuesday, said he did not
necessarily share that assessment. ``We always have had a pretty
vigorous primary, and why ought that not happen now?'' he said.
``So I'm just welcoming everybody. I just want to make that clear.
I will do all that I can to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan announced in November that he would not seek
re-election. He said he wanted to give a Democratic candidate
enough time to raise money and build a political base. However,
Moynihan declined to say how soon he thought Mrs. Clinton should
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will leave that to you,'' he said.

SEATTLE NEWSPAPERS CHANGE JOA, SET STAGE TO COMPETE HEAD-TO-HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (New information, editing changes throughout)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setting the stage for an old-fashioned newspaper war, the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The Seattle Times disclosed Tuesday
that they will compete head-to-head in the morning under dramatic
changes in their joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the P-I and the Times said the move was designed
to assure the long-term survival of two independent editorial
voices.
</P>
<P>
   But the competitive landscape clearly has been altered, and will
change even more as the Times converts to morning distribution
within next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The amended joint operating agreement (JOA) extends the papers'
working arrangement through the year 2083. It gives the
Post-Intelligencer, owned by the Hearst Corp., a 40 percent share
of the profits generated by the two companies, up from 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Times share will be cut and Times officials warned Tuesday
there may be layoffs at the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I will remain a morning paper and, under a separate
agreement, will post news stories around the clock on its web site
(www.seattle-pi.com).
</P>
<P>
   The P-I immediately upgraded its Internet web site yesterday
with the newspaper's daily content, ending a contentious issue
between the two papers.
</P>
<P>
   George Irish, president of Hearst Newspapers, said the improved
web site will create opportunities to use the Internet to link
readers not only to the P-I, but to other Hearst newspapers and
magazines, such as Smart Money.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. also obtained first rights to buy the Times
should the Blethen family ever put it up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no immediate prospect of such a sale,
family-owned newspapers around the country have been sold in recent
years after family spats divided descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, the Knight-Ridder Corp. owns 49.5 percent of the
Seattle Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   P-I publisher J.D. Alexander said the deal represents a boost
for both newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is not to put anybody out of business,''
Alexander said, pledging to improve what he called his already
well-positioned newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think we are a pretty damn good news operation,''
Alexander said. ``I think we will be energized and thrive on the
competition. It's going to be different and it's going to be
sharper. I think we're well prepared to meet that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new equation left open the question of whether both
newspapers will remain in business when most major media markets
have shrunk to one newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   At the Times, where the staff was jubilant, Publisher Frank
Blethen appeared in a T-shirt with the newspaper's symbol, an
eagle, holding the P-I's symbol, a globe, in its clutches.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander struck back at a meeting with P-I staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when they discover news, they will be confused,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Times has put a major emphasis on lengthy
features and investigative reporting, while the P-I has sought to
be an edgier paper emphasizing hard news.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing terms of the joint operating agreement, if one
paper becomes unprofitable for three consecutive years or economic
conditions turn downward, Hearst and the Times could ask the U.S.
Justice Department, which oversees joint operating agreements, for
permission to close one of the papers.
</P>
<P>
   Although that provision has not been invoked in the 15 years of
the JOA, it has never been tested in morning competition.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new provision, Hearst could continue to collect a share
of profits from the JOA if the P-I were closed.
</P>
<P>
   In the P-I newsroom, reaction was mixed. Alexander and Irish
pledged in staff meetings to stay in the market and improve the
quality of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said the new revenues the P-I anticipates under the
revised agreement will allow it to spend an additional $1 million
this year on new staff members, additional space and content
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that it was the quality of the
journalism in the P-I, not our publishing cycle, that enabled us to
compete vigorously and successfully in the Seattle market,''
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times, which publishes most of the Sunday newspaper, has a
larger staff of editors, reporters, photographers and artists than
the P-I.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the P-I beat the Times last year in the annual
Blethen awards contest for enterprise and investigative reporting
and swept the enterprise reporting competition against other Hearst
papers, including the Houston Chronicle and San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the numbers that count,'' said P-I Managing Editor
Ken Bunting. ``It's the quality of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is one of only a handful of major U.S. cities with at
least two daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Brenner, publisher of the morning News-Tribune in Tacoma,
welcomed the changes, saying, ``I think it's exciting. It will
bring new vigor to the morning newspaper arena. And that's good for
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not completely unexpected,'' said Peter Horvitz,
president of King County Journal Newspaper, which publishes the
morning Eastside and South County Journals. ``I don't think it
changes the market in terms of the way I compete with the Times and
the P-I in the short term to any great extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this reinforces the fact that the Times and P-I are a
print monopoly,'' he said, referring to the government-approved
joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The P-I and Times directly competed in the morning during a
brief period in the early 1980s, when the Times published a morning
edition that was delivered to homes outside the Seattle area and
sold on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Times gave up that slot when the joint operating agreement
became effective in 1983, combining the advertising, circulation,
promotion and production facilities of the newspapers but keeping
their editorial deparments separate.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Sizemore, president and chief operating officer of the
Times, said his newspaper isn't prepared to immediately switch to
morning publication because it couldn't begin making moves until
changes in the JOA were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Sizemore said the Times sought the morning slot because that is
what readers prefer, particularly new arrivals from cities with
morning papers, and because of the increasing difficulty of
delivering papers in the afternoon through heavy traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Times, which has about 32,000 more subscribers
than the P-I, is the last dominant afternoon paper in a major
market, it has struggled to attract new readers as circulation at
both papers has remained flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been swimming against the tide for a long, long time,''
Sizemore said.
</P>
<P>
   John Morton, president of Morton Research Inc., a newspaper
consulting firm in Silver Springs, Md., said the deal ``insures
that the Times franchise will remain reasonably strong,'' but that
he doesn't expect the paper to become so dominant that it puts the
P-I out of business.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department would only allow that if the P-I's
profits became so small that they become a serious drag on
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless that happens, I don't see Hearst trying to pull the
plug,'' he said, noting the Seattle will have the first joint
operating agreement with two morning newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   It would take years for such a drastic change to occur,
particularly since the P-I is ``so far from being in that weak
position,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton said he doesn't believe that any of the Blethens will
decide to sell their share of the paper, which could open the door
to a Hearst purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Frank Blethen pretty well and knowing his sentiments
and that of the family, I can't imagine them ever deciding to
sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last audit in September, the Times' circulation was
227,715, up 0.2 percent from the previous September. The P-I's
total dropped 0.8 percent, to 196,271, during the period.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lemke, vice president of advertising for the Times and the
P-I, said several advertisers sought information, asking when the
Times would switch to mornings and whether the same number of
readers would be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke said there is little duplication in subscribers between
the two papers.
</P>
<P>
   The revisions to the 1983 JOA were filed Tuesday with the
Justice Department, which oversees them.
</P>
<P>
   JOAs are permitted under the federal Newspaper Preservation Act.
They are designed to preserve independent editorial voices in
communities by allowing competing newspapers to share some of their
business operations so they can each remain economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' Sizemore called the new agreement a ``win-win for the
two parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two news departments are going to do everything
possible to kick each other's butts,'' he said.

SENATE BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN AIR PASSENGERS' RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ore., Ariz.) (Eds., this story was filed and held on Monday, Feb. 1. It is now
released; please use this version.)  
 (bl) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airlines would have to tell passengers when a
flight had been oversold, why a plane was late or a flight had been
canceled, and how many seats were available for passengers to buy
with frequent-flier miles, under a bill that two senators said they
planned to introduce this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also let consumers return tickets within 48 hours
of purchase, even ``nonrefundable'' ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airline profits are soaring, but often respect for basic
rights for the passengers is sinking,'' Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one
of the bill's sponsors, said Monday in a telephone interview.
``These are the kind of rules that the corner grocery store has to
comply with. The corner grocery store can't lure people in with
promise of a particular thing at a particular price, and then not
offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other sponsor is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman
of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department has the authority to stop
anticompetitive behavior among airlines, and the bill would define
a variety of common airline practices as anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the department could find airlines to be
anticompetitive, and then fine them, if they failed to ``disclose
to consumers information that would enable them to make informed
decisions about the comparative value of frequent-flier programs
among airlines, including the number of seats redeemable on each
flight.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the
trade group of the major airlines, said he could not comment
because he had not seen the proposed bill.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines would also have to disclose all fares on request. If a
flight did not take off as planned, airlines would have to ``inform
passengers of the factual reason for the delay, cancellation or
diversion of the flight to an airport other than the scheduled
stopover or destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also make legal a practice that the airlines call
``back-to-back ticketing,'' and have tried to block, in which a
passenger buys two round-trip tickets and discards half of each,
because that is sometimes cheaper than buying a round-trip ticket
for the days the traveler wants to fly. It would also legalize
``hidden cities,'' in which a traveler buys a ticket to a distant
city, leaving the plane at an intermediate one, because it is
cheaper than buying a ticket to the real destination.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines contend that consumers have benefited from
deregulation and that intervention by the government would mean
reregulating them. They also argue that under ``yield management''
practices, they change ticket prices dozens of times in the months
before the date of each flight. As a result, the airlines say,
answers about fares, or the number of frequent-flier seats
available, are accurate only temporarily.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Once again, Texas A&AMP;M baseball coach Mark
Johnson thinks his team may be ranked a little too high coming into
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Iowa State coach Lyle Smith is evaluating his
players based on their performance in snowball fights.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, the Big 12 baseball season will be highlighted
by ranked teams, top players and changes in both the conference and
NCAA postseason tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's Aggies, who missed the College World Series by one
game last season, season,]are ranked as high as 11th in preseason
polls. Texas Tech is close to the top 10, and Oklahoma State is
also ranked. A&AMP;M pitcher Casey Fossum and Tech catcher Josh Bard
rate preseason All-America notice.
</P>
<P>
   The conference sent five teams to the NCAA regionals last
season, and Missouri barely missed. With a couple of format changes
this season, league minions are hoping to send six or more.
</P>
<P>
   The first change is with the Big 12 tournament, which drew a
record 113,108 fans for 11 games last season at the brand-new
Bricktown Ballpark in Oklahoma City, home of the Triple-A Oklahoma
Red Hawks. This season, the tournament will expand from six to
eight teams.
</P>
<P>
   The second change is national _ expanding the NCAA regional
field from 48 to 64 teams, which will play an opening round of 16
four-team regionals. The 16 winners will be paired off into eight
``super regionals'' in a best two-of-three faceoff, with the
champions advancing to the CWS in Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   There are also new bats _ still metallic but toned down to
reduce the ``trampoline'' effect that has created endless slugfests
and several serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma launched the season with two wins in three tries in the
ACC Invitational last weekend in Orlando, Fla. Texas will play
UT-Arlington twice this week and play host to the nation's
top-ranked team, defending national champion Southern Cal, in a
three-game set this weekend. By Saturday, nine of the league's 11
teams will have begun play.
</P>
<P>
   A brief preseason look at each team:
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M (46-20, 21-9, regular-season champion, NCAA regional):
``We've had some impressive preseason notice, but I'm not sure we
deserve it,'' said Johnson, pointing to the loss of stars Jason
Tyner, Craig Kuzmic and Scott Sandusky, plus pitching ace Ryan
Rupe. But Fossum (12-2, 3.74 earned-run average) and Chance Caple
(7-1, 3.79) form the nucleus of a strong staff, and outfielder
Daylan Holt heads a crowd of heavy hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (44-20, 18-11, tournament champion, NCAA regional):
Larry Hays said the Raiders are searching for pitching depth, but
up front they have two of the best _ starter Shane Wright (14-1,
2.71) and reliever Brad Ralston (3-4, five saves, 54 strikeouts in
43 innings). Bard (.383, 17 home runs, 71 runs batted in) is a
potential All-American behind the plate, and center fielder Ryan
Ruiz (.388) leads a solid supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (40-21, 15-12, NCAA regional): Coach Tom Holliday
returns his staff ace, Matt Smith (6-3, 3.61), but is looking for
closers after losing one to arm problems and one to academic
difficulties. As usual, he has a strong attack, led by son Josh
Holliday (.309, 18 HR, 60 RBI) and second-baseman Billy Gasparino
(.336, 13 HR, 59 RBI).
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (42-20, 17-11, NCAA regional): Larry Cochell has
returned from successful off-season cancer surgery and noted that,
``Basically, we have two starters back.'' Those two are impressive,
however: first baseman Casey Bookout (.405, 26 HR, 76 RBI) and
Richard Park, who hit .325 with 16 home runs and 52 RBI while going
2-2 with five saves.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (41-20, 18-10, NCAA regional): The Bears must replace
stars Kip Wells, Charley Carter and Jeremy Dodson, but the cupboard
is hardly bare. Team USA standout Jason Jennings _ who hit .327
with 18 home runs and 58 RBI while going 11-4 on the mound _ is
back, along with CF Jon Topolski (19 HR, 11 triples, 54 RBI) and 2B
Eric Nelson (.317, 13 HR, 50 RBI). There is also a new ballpark,
but coach Steve Smith is waiting for lights to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (36-18, 17-12): The Tigers lost league home-run champ
Ryan Fry (27) but didn't figure to average two home runs per game
again with the new bats. First baseman Jake Epstein, son of former
major-leaguer Mike Epstein, had 15 home runs in 39 games and will
provide the power. Coach Tim Jamieson said the strength is
pitching, especially after Justin Stine (6-5, 3.57) turned down the
Angels and opted for another year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (23-32, 11-18): The '98 Longhorns set a school record for
losses and became the first squad in 20 years to miss the playoffs
in consecutive seasons. There are fresh recruits aplenty, and
virtually every position is being contested. ``This is the closest
we've been to the kind of team I want,'' says Augie Garrido, who
has the second-highest win total (1,204) in Division I. ``But it
isn't ready to go to the regionals.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (24-20, 10-13): Although Dave Van Horn coached the
Cornhuskers to a 12-game improvement in his first season, he isn't
making reservations for Omaha. ``We didn't have any first- or
second-team all-conference players, we didn't have a lot of
big-time skills such as speed and arms, and we didn't have a lot of
pop offensively,'' he said, ``and weather canceled several of our
games. This year, we basically have 20 new players, 10 freshmen and
10 JUCOs, so we'll see what happens.'' He also has junior
outfielder Ken Harvey, who hit .388 and .373 in his first two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (20-32, 9-19): The Wildcats have renamed themselves
the ``Road Warriors,'' because they face the possibility of playing
zero home games this season. ``The administration informed me in
December that we were tearing down the park to build a new one,''
coach Mike Clark said. ``We're hoping we can play at home sometime
in March, but that's not definite. We're thinking of Salinas
\RKan.\S as a new home. Actually, we have some experienced pitching
with some returnees and a couple of transfers, and if it holds up
in the second half of the season, we could be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (22-29, 7-20): Last season, a promising team was
decimated by injuries to 14 starters and pitchers, including seven
requiring surgery. ``For us, a lot of '99 has to do with putting
'98 totally behind us,'' coach Bobby Randall said. ``We had a
shortstop playing with a broken nose, another guy trying to play
with a broken collarbone, and we lost an outfielder before the
season because he broke his leg playing football. Beyond that, we
just couldn't close games, so our main concerns this year are
pitching and health.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (20-27, 10-18): ``I guess we're the only team in the
conference that hasn't been outdoors yet,'' Smith said, ``except to
roll up snowballs and throw them at each other. We lost Shawn
Leimbek, the league's leading hitter (.413), along with five
pitchers _ including four who went to the pros. Our ace is Nate
Hilton, who was 1-6 but would have won a lot more if we'd played
some defense. He developed tendinitis in the Cape Cod League, so
we're not sure about him. But we'll be at Air Force to open the
season Saturday.''

SOME ASSISTANT MAKE COACHING A FAMILY OUTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Parents whose children ignore sage advice,
take heart. College basketball coaches can't get their kids to
listen, either.
</P>
<P>
   A new coaching generation is turning students of the game into
sons of the game. In NCAA Division I, there are 14 father-son
coaching combinations where the son is an assistant coach. And that
doesn't count two son-father combinations _ head coach Steve and
father Sam Alford at Southwest Missouri State and top man Jeff and
father Dave Lebo at Tennessee Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, some of us haven't done a very good job of getting our
kids to listen to us,'' said Saint Louis University coach Charlie
Spoonhour, whose son Jay is an assistant on the Billikens' staff.
``I don't think what daddies think has a whole lot of impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Scott Drew. He was at Butler University with a 3.5
grade-point average and had plans to attend law school. But one
Christmas break, Scott came home and broke the bad news: He wanted
to go into coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wonderful, after you get your law degree,'' Dad Homer
Drew, coach at Valparaiso, remembers. ``He said, `No, I want to go
into it right after I graduate from Butler.' I guess I listened to
him instead of him listening to me. I really wanted him to go to
law school.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Scott Drew became a graduate assistant on his father's
staff and earned his master's degree. Now, he's Valparaiso's top
assistant, in charge of recruiting ``and he's going to make a
superb head coach'' according to dad.
</P>
<P>
   The championships, the media attention, the big-money contracts
might be the lure to coaching for some. But the profession also
involves must-win, 24-hour pressure, with success dictated by
athletes who are generally 18 to 22 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more uptight this season than I've ever been,'' said
Tommy Penders, an assistant coach at George Washington for his
father Tom. ``The biggest negative is that it's personal.
Emotionally, it's very difficult on me. Being the son of the coach,
you want him to win so bad. After the game, you feel like you've
played 40 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tom Penders got the George Washington job in June, he
wanted an assistant who knew the Atlantic-10 Conference. He wound
up hiring someone who also knew the Colonials' new coach. Tommy
Penders had spent a year as an assistant at Rhode Island after a
playing career and two years as a graduate assistant at Texas with
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't want him to be a coach,'' Tom Penders said
of his son. ``There are certainly easier ways to make money. I did
everything to discourage him from this profession.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Penders, Sean Sutton, Danny Tarkanian and Jim
Harrick Jr. all have watched their fathers have great success at
dream jobs and then agonized as their dads suffered through
dismissals from those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate to see both sides to the coaching
profession,'' said Sean Sutton, who is an assistant for his father,
Eddie, at Oklahoma State. ``For most of my life, I saw all the
great times and the success. But it's beneficial to me to see how
tough it can be on coaches. It opened my eyes to how tough and hard
this profession can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracking the coaching profession and moving up the ladder is
often as much about whom you know as much as how much or what you
know. Sons who work for and with their fathers face different
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe name recognition will help me when I go after a job as a
head coach,'' Sean Sutton said. ``But when you go in for the
interview, you've got to prove yourself and convince them you're
the right guy for the job. Regardless of what your last name is. If
I get a head coaching job it will because of my abilities, not my
last name.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer Drew says that coaching heritage should give the son of a
head coach an edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around the game, understanding the pressure, can be an
advantage,'' he said. ``The other side could be that people say
he's living off his dad's record or name. It depends on the people
who are doing the hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Spoonhour knows that some people believe fathers hire
their sons as assistants because they have the power to make the
decision. But for coaches, charity doesn't begin at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the day, he's got a job to do,'' the elder Spoonhour
said. ``Our offices are about 60 feet from each other, but he's not
in my office hanging on my every word. This is the wrong business
to be doing charity work where you give your son a job just to give
him a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to treat Jay just like any other assistant. We talk a
lot of basketball. He probably asks more than a normal assistant
would. Jay asks me why I do things. We're like most fathers and
sons, we're very close. We have the added luxury of working
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Sean Sutton played for his father at Kentucky and Oklahoma
State. His dream was to be the point guard for a Final Four team
coached by his father. That never happened. But in 1995, Sean's
second year as an assistant in Stillwater, the Cowboys reached the
Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   ``When good things happen during a season, you learn to
appreciate it,'' said Sean. ``You can't take anything for granted.
And being able to share those good times with your dad makes it
even more special.''
</P>
<P>
   For coaching fathers and sons, it's a different type of quality
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends, when they were growing up, didn't get to
spend a lot of time with their dads,'' Tommy Penders said. ``My dad
included me in his profession. I was blessed with the opportunity
to be around him nearly every day. That's why I wanted to get into
coaching.''

TEXAS DRIVING TOWARD NCAA TOURNAMENT BID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A month ago when conference play began, it
would have been ludicrous to think of such.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago even, it would have been a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But now? The idea of Texas as an NCAA Tournament team _ even if
the Longhorns do not win the automatic berth that goes with the Big
12 tournament title _ is far from farcical thinking.
</P>
<P>
   At least it must be if Roy Williams thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect Texas to be in the tournament,'' the Kansas
coach said a couple of days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns stand 12-9 after an impressive intersectional
victory against Massachusetts on Sunday. More important, they're
atop the Big 12 at 7-1 going into a matchup with Texas A&AMP;M (9-9,
2-6) tonight at the Erwin Center. The victory against UMass helps
from a national perspective despite the fact that that program
isn't as good as it was a few years ago. But from now on, because
of the 2-7 start, no one game is more important than another for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we've just got to be worried about winning
basketball games,'' UT coach Rick Barnes said. ``That takes care of
everything else. There's a lot of teams that if they win games in
February will be in the tournament. And if they don't, they
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. But if Texas can win the regular-season Big 12
title, it might be able to take the worry out of being close going
into the conference tournament March 4-7 in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wins the regular-season title in a conference like
ours should automatically be given a berth in the tournament,''
Oklahoma State coach Eddie Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed. Although the Big 12 doesn't rank among the country's top
six major conferences, the tournament selection committee in recent
years has attached significance to regular-season championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``And right now, when you look at the schedule, the Longhorns
have a great shot at winning the conference,'' Sutton said. ``Texas
is playing as well as anyone in the league. And it seems to me they
should be given strong consideration even if they lose two or three
more games.''
</P>
<P>
   After meeting the Aggies, Texas plays at Texas Tech, Oklahoma,
at Oklahoma State, Tech, at A&AMP;M, at Baylor and what should be a
very interesting regular-season finale with Missouri in the Erwin
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Winning six of the eight will put Texas at 18-11. The Longhorns
got into the field of 64 two years ago at 16-11 and won their way
to the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if Texas loses 14 or 15, I don't think they'll get in,''
OU coach Kelvin Sampson said. ``But I don't see them losing 14 or
15.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do I. The most impressive thing evident when watching
the Longhorns the past couple of weeks has not been that they're
playing one game at a time, though they are. It has been their
minute-to-minute focus. Collectively, their expressions do not
change from tipoff to final horn.
</P>
<P>
   They're playing one possession at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' said center Chris Mihm, whose string of six
double-doubles has thrust him into strong contention as conference
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has some bad early-season losses (Houston, South Florida,
San Diego). But the Horns have also defeated then-No. 25 and
hot-again Utah, and had a good shot at No. 12 Wisconsin (62-65).
One rating service had UT at No. 53 without taking the UMass
victory into account. Another, which did, ranked the Horns No. 55.
</P>
<P>
   OU or OSU could get hot. But Sutton is right about which team in
the league is playing best right now. And Texas' best might be good
enough.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ With next month's NASCAR Winston Cup race
approaching a sellout, 10,000 temporary bleacher seats were added
at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The seats, ranging in prices from $55 to $80, bring seating
capacity for the Primestar 500 on March 28 to 164,481. Factor in
the campers in the infield, and a crowd in excess of 215,000 is
expected.
</P>
<P>
   TMS vice president and general manager Eddie Gossage said
yesterday the bleachers were added because fewer than 10,000
tickets remain for the race.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are in two sets of bleachers, with 2,500 priced from
$75-80 in turn four and 7,500 priced from $55-60 at the end of the
backstretch grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   The additional tickets go on sale at 9 a.m. Saturday at TMS, by
phone at (817) 215-8500, through the track's web site at
www.texasmotorspeedway.com, or at TicketMaster outlets. Patrons
purchasing tickets on site receive a 10 percent discount on
Primestar 500 merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Between the temporary seats and the 4,800 permanent seats in the
Speedway Club under construction in Turn 1, capacity will increase
by almost 15,000 since last year's Winston Cup race. SCHRADER LIKES
TRACK Ken Schrader, driver of the No. 33 Skoal Bandit Chevrolet on
the Winston Cup circuit, was at TMS yesterday for NASCAR Craftsman
Truck series testing. Schrader is the owner of the No. 52 Oakwood
Homes Chevrolet truck team.
</P>
<P>
   He took the opportunity use his truck, which is similar in
weight and horsepower to a Winston Cup car, to try out the ``new''
track. TMS underwent a $2 million renovation since the Cup drivers
complained about its tight, narrow layout during their first two
visits to Fort Worth. Schrader joined other drivers who have driven
on the revamped track and proclaimed it fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a pleasant surprise,'' Schrader said. ``When we came here
the first two years, we complained about the track because it was
narrow and hard to pass on. This year, it's going to be a lot
better race. There's still one fastest part of the racetrack, one
fastest groove, but we can race here now just like we can in
Charlotte, Atlanta, Michigan.'' There's plenty of room now, so we
can put on the same kind of show we do at the other places.''

STARS AMONG NHL TEAMS LOSING MONEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The Dallas Stars are having outstanding
success on the ice and at the box office, yet owner Tom Hicks said
the team might lose as much as $12 million this year. ``As an
entity, we will lose money,'' he said. ``The low end is $3 million,
the high end is $10 to $12 million.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars leading the NHL and setting a franchise record
with 19 consecutive sellouts, losing money seems impossible. But
Hicks said the Stars' payroll of $39 million and the lack of luxury
suites at Reunion Arena will keep the team from making money even
if it wins the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are not alone. As many as 20 of the 27 NHL teams could
lose money, according to Pierre Gauthier, president and general
manager of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a suicidal business right now,'' he told the ``Orange
County Register''.
</P>
<P>
   This could put the collective bargaining agreement that is
scheduled to last until 2004 in jeopardy. Although league officials
have not said they will ask the players association to reopen
negotiations, they have said that the agreement could be outdated
in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is the first two years of the CBA \Rcollective
bargaining agreement\S, revenues were moving faster than
salaries,'' NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. ``Last year and
this year, it's been the other way. We're going to have to see over
time how it works. If our \RCBA\S is working, great. If not, we'll
have to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the agreement was signed, salaries have risen from an
average of $733,000 to an expected average of $1.3 million this
season. But how could the league reopen the agreement? When? And
how would players react?
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would hope is that we have a stronger league and we can
wait until 2004 to address this issue,'' Stars president Jim Lites
said. ``But if teams keep losing money, then something will have to
happen. I don't know what it would be. Another lockout? Maybe. I
think what would be best would be a compromise with the players'
participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor strife just suffered by the NBA didn't steel the NHL
against another lockout. It might, instead, have boosted the
league's confidence in making such a drastic move. After all, NBA
owners received a better deal, with an individual player salary cap
and likely will see little long-lasting ill effect on fan support.
Baseball has won back its fans; so has football.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they wanted to, they could lock us out again,'' said Stars
center Guy Carbonneau, a vice president with the NHL Players
Association. ``I mean, it's their league, they can do whatever they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL fully recognizes that, and already is beginning to make
public its finances _ or at least the finances it wants to make
public. Brian Burke, the general manager of the Vancouver Canucks,
said his team has lost $24 million over the past two seasons. The
Washington Capitals have been quoted as estimating losses last
season of $16 million. The Kings report an estimated loss of $15
million last season and the Mighty Ducks say they could lose as
much as $8 million, Gauthier said.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said owners need to open their books to show the yearly
struggles of the league. But Lites said the struggles already are
visible. The Pittsburgh Penguins are in bankruptcy court and audits
have revealed they have debt of more than $100 million. Last
season, the Edmonton Oilers were close to moving until a cartel of
more than 30 local businesspeople offered enough cash to keep the
five-time Stanley Cup champions in Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just me saying it or anyone else saying it,'' Lites
said. ``Teams are in bankruptcy, teams are threatening to move. We
have some serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hicks said he doesn't want anyone feeling sorry for him or
thinking he made a bad investment. The Dallas-based leverage buyout
specialist who also is owner of the Texas Rangers, said he expects
to fully recoup his investment if he sells the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's nearly worth twice what I bought it for,'' Hicks
said of the $84 million price tag in 1995. ``When we move into the
new arena \Rin 2000\S, it'll be worth somewhere between $150 and
$200 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks obviously has a plan, one he feels will be successful. He
bought the Stars, petitioned successfully for a new arena and
invested money to make the team championship caliber. That will
make it easier to sell out the new arena, and Hicks says he
believes there will be plenty of money waiting for him when he's
done. What's more, he owns the Rangers, just purchased the Mesquite
rodeo and also has a strong interest in purchasing the Mavericks.
Those sports entities could be combined with his television
holdings to create a regional sports network with built-in
programming. OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``Other teams are doing the same thing,'' Hicks said.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Ducks are losing money as a team but selling movies,
cartoons and action figures. The synergy means the Ducks, even
though in the red, are still a sound investment.
</P>
<P>
   Molson uses the Montreal Canadiens to sell beer. The New York
Rangers are a part of the huge, television-driven Cablevision
Network, The Avalanche are owned by Ascent Entertainment, the
Canucks by Orca Bay and the Panthers by Wayne Huizenga's
ever-expanding South Florida empire.
</P>
<P>
   Because those corporate owners can absorb losses while seeing
their franchise values increase, the purchase of an NHL team is a
good buy. The league in the past three seasons has sold four
expansion franchises for $75 million apiece. Every sale of an
existing franchise has been for a hefty profit. END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe they're losing money, so we don't have any
problem with the increase in salaries,'' Carbonneau said. ``If they
couldn't spend the money, they wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Lites said, is that operating as the NHL currently
does, isn't healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paying too large a percentage of our revenues to the
players and sooner or later, that's going to catch up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lites wouldn't speculate on the exact percentage of revenue the
NHL pays its players, but Canucks GM Burke said it was 72 percent
and Boston Bruins GM Harry Sinden agreed with that figure. Bettman
said he could ``neither confirm nor deny the accuracy of that
number.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, in comparison, is paying out about 57 percent of its
revenues to players the next three seasons and 55 percent the next
three.That's the kind of arrangement Hicks said the NHL needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally think the NBA is the role model for us right
now,'' he said. ``There first has to be some recognition on how to
evenly divide the pie and then there has to be a combined effort in
trying to grow the size of the pie.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that owners and players can't forget that they benefit
by keeping the fans happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the place where all sports have to get to is where
owners, players and fans agree that it's a three-way partnership,''
Hicks said. ``Then, we can start building the leagues to where they
need to be.''

CREATORS OF ANTIABORTION WEB SITE TOLD TO PAY MILLIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ore., Texas, Ill., Tenn.)   (af)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ In by far the largest judgment ever imposed on
militant abortion opponents, a federal jury Tuesday ordered
creators of Old West-style ``wanted'' posters and a World Wide Web
site that lists the names of abortion providers to pay more than
$107 million to Planned Parenthood and a group of doctors who
contended that the material amounted to deadly threats.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs hailed their victory as a major step in their
fight to stop the ``domestic terrorism'' of some abortion foes,
whose lists of ``baby butchers'' on the Web site, called ``The
Nuremberg Files,'' include the names, home addresses and
license-plate numbers of many abortion doctors and the names of
their spouses and children. When a doctor on the list is slain, as
three have been, the Web site shows a line drawn through his name.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven people working at abortion clinics around the
country have been killed in recent years, and there have been more
than 250 clinic bombings and incidents of arson. In that climate,
abortion rights groups say, ``The Nuremberg Files'' is intended to
stir up more violence.
</P>
<P>
   But the defendants, who noted that nothing in their materials
specifically advocated violence against abortion providers, said
the decision trampled on the Constitution's free-speech
protections. They vowed to appeal, and legal experts believe the
case may well wind up in the Supreme Court as a major test of the
line between protected speech and unlawful intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   In pressing its case, each side invoked civil rights history.
The plaintiffs said they were using the legal tactics of civil
rights groups that had won judgments allowing them to seize the
assets and so shut down the operations of Klan organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But several of the 14 defendants _ 12 individuals and
organizations called the American Coalition of Life Activists and
Advocates for Life Ministries _ said they would never pay the
judgment awarded Tuesday, and they likened themselves to fighters
for racial justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not in good conscience give money to an industry that
thrives on killing children,'' one defendant, Catherine Ramey, said
outside the federal courthouse. ``That would be like asking Martin
Luther King to pay money to the Ku Klux Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought here in Portland, where some of the
defendants' operations are based, under federal racketeering
statutes and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1994,
which makes it illegal to use ``force or threat of force'' against
anyone seeking or providing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said the judgment, rendered by a jury of four men
and four women, was an obvious message that their opponents'
tactics were illegal, and they urged prosecutors around the country
to consider bringing criminal charges against the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the money awarded Tuesday will ever find its way
to Planned Parenthood or its co-plaintiffs is uncertain at best. In
three other major cases against militant abortion opponents, here
and in Houston and Chicago, juries have ordered smaller damage
amounts, but many of the defendants have either refused to pay or
asserted that they have transferred all their assets to others and
thus have no way to pay. Further, the verdict returned Tuesday most
likely has years of appeals ahead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There have, however, been some seizure of assets from abortion
foes. Planned Parenthood, for instance, has been able to seize
computers from the national headquarters of Operation Rescue as
well as frequent-flier miles accumulated by the group's leader.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the defendants here were even in the courtroom when,
after three weeks of testimony and five days of deliberations, the
verdict was reached Tuesday, and several have said they have taken
steps, like transferring assets, to make themselves
``judgment-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wysong, a defendant who is the head of the American
Rights Coalition, a group based in Tennessee that says it helps
women dealing with physical or emotional pain after they have had
abortions, said the judgment would have no effect on his
anti-abortion activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to do whatever we've been doing,'' said
Wysong, who said he had little money to pay anyone after the
demands of providing for his 15 children, ages 10 months to 24
years. ``I've fought this battle for a long time without much
money. God will raise up someone to carry it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, abortion rights advocates said they had achieved a
landmark decision in their quest to stifle the activities of
militant anti-abortion groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury saw anti-choice `wanted' posters for what they are _
a hit list for terrorists,'' Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement issued from
New York. ``Whether these threats are posted on trees or on the
Internet, their intent and impact is the same: to threaten the
lives of doctors who courageously serve women seeking to exercise
their right to choose abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldt said the jury's decision had helped to protect ``our
constitutional right to provide important health services and
information, free from fear.''
</P>
<P>
   But defense lawyers said it had abridged a more fundamental
right. Unlike previous cases brought under the clinic-access law,
this one did not involve physical altercations. ``Any document that
criticizes an abortionist could now be construed as threatening,''
said Christopher Ferrara of the American Catholic Lawyers
Association, who represented one of the defendants. ``And that has
to alarm anyone who's concerned about the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some free-speech advocates agreed that the case could
open the door to disturbing limitations on public debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is aggressive speech, to some offensive
speech,'' said David Hudson, a research attorney with the Freedom
Forum First Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University. ``But it is
speech.''
</P>
<P>
   To some of the plaintiff doctors, though, who testified to
wearing disguises or bulletproof vests in public, and instructing
their children to head for the bathtub if they ever heard gunfire
in the house, the case was about clear threats to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Free speech is not in jeopardy here,'' said one plaintiff, Dr.
Elizabeth Newhall of Portland. ``Women and their doctors are.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments last week, the plaintiffs' lawyers said the
intimidation was obvious. They pointed, among other things, to the
Web site's drawing a line across the names of doctors who have been
killed, including Barnett A. Slepian of Amherst, N.Y., near
Buffalo, who was fatally shot by a sniper last fall. The names of
those wounded are listed in gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about using tactics to intimidate so these doctors will
stop performing abortion because they are afraid that just like
other doctors who have been murdered, it will happen to them,''
Maria T. Vullo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told the jurors.
``Remember the pattern: Poster, murder. Poster, murder. Poster,
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer for the plaintiffs, Martin London, said: ``Our
clients want freedom. They want the freedom to hug their child in
front of a window.''

TCU'S RECRUITING CLASS HEADS FOR TOP 20
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Recruiting analysts have heaped TCU's
recruiting class with so many superlatives _ ``biggest surprise ...
best in 15 years'' _ that it's hard to gauge what it all means.
</P>
<P>
   Allow Dunbar High football coach Bob Jones to offer a bit of
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar had two of Fort Worth's most sought-after recruits last
season, Willie Miles and Michael Demps, and Jones said both
shrugged off suggestions of going to TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``TCU was in the middle of a coaching change,'' Jones said,
``and they just weren't very good, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar had two of Fort Worth's most sought-after recruits this
season, too. Jerome and Jerrod Braziel were getting offers from
programs like Texas A&AMP;M and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   If national signing day passes today as expected, both Braziels
will sign with TCU, blending into a recruiting class that is being
ranked in the top 20 nationally by some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know once we get all of the rankings done, TCU should be in
the top 20 nationally,'' said David Garvin, editor of ``Heartland
Recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Horned Frogs coach Dennis Franchione turned the 1-10 debacle in
1997 into a 6-5 Cinderella story in his first season. He turned an
unexpected Sun Bowl berth into a storybook ending with an upset of
Southern Cal as a national-television audience looked in. He turned
speculation that he would surely bolt for greener pastures into
mere talk by signing a long-term deal a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In his last and maybe best trick, Franchione turned TCU, an
also-ran in recruiting recently, into a program being mentioned in
the same breath as Texas (No. 1 nationally by some recruiting
services) and Texas A&AMP;M (No. 7) in terms of recruiting success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, they are already third in the state,'' Garvin
said. ``You are talking about two top 10 classes ahead of them.
It's not like it's a third to nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Horned Frogs have 20 commitments expected to sign today,
including seven members of the Star-Telegram State Top 100, but
it's not as much how many they may sign as it is who they may sign
that has analysts gushing.
</P>
<P>
   A good portion of TCU's recruits hail from within a 50-mile
radius of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the kids this year locally looked at it and said:
`I want to stay close.' I think we gave them a good option,''
Franchione said. ``We feel like the best kids in the city we're
going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU appears likely to sign four of Fort Worth's most
sought-after recruits _ both Braziels, Boswell's Chad Pugh and
Wyatt's Donald Burrell _ and also land big-time area players like
Lamar's Tommicus Walker and DeSoto's Casey Printers.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione first had to get visions of Nebraska and Michigan
from Pugh's head; Texas A&AMP;M and Purdue from Burrell's; and USC,
Colorado and A&AMP;M from the Braziels'.
</P>
<P>
   ``About a year ago, I was interested in all of those
high-profile schools,'' Jerome Braziel said. ``I wasn't even
thinking TCU, and then little by little I started to want to come
to TCU.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jerrod Braziel: ``I thought I wanted to go to Colorado. I
wasn't looking at the big picture. Coach Fran did a good job of
making us see the big picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione paints that picture vividly.
</P>
<P>
   He almost always begins his visit by asking a recruit to imagine
his first collegiate game.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine walking down the tunnel, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine getting ready to jog onto the field Saturday afternoon,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione then asks them what would make the day perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that I'd want my family to be there,'' Burrell
said. ``Deciding to come to TCU wasn't too hard after that.''
</P>
<P>
   A season ago, Franchione had a harder sell.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to persuade a kid to come to a team that finished 1-10
and had a new coach, even if the school is in your back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically had to talk about blue skies,'' Franchione said.
``It's just one of those things where you go as hard as you can, as
long as you can, and do the best you can with what you got.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU signed 20 players last season, including four Star-Telegram
State Top 100 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people thought I was making a mistake,'' said Josh
Harbuck, a 1998 signee from Arlington Heights. ``I kept telling
them that I got here at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Franchione: ``I think winning made it easier for some kids
to say: `I'm going to TCU,' and to turn down some of the schools
they turned down.''
</P>
<P>
   Player after player mentioned Franchione as a reason for turning
down big-name programs, for signing with TCU, for taking a risk.
</P>
<P>
   He's honest. He's funny. He's down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Matt Orlovsky from Dallas Bishop Lynch, who committed
in October. He had jaw surgery Dec. 9, and Franchione called simply
to wish him good luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys pretend to be real,'' Orlovsky said. ``He's
real.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Franchione, diligence by his assistant coaches and a
breakthrough season, TCU has become a real player in recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say TCU's last recruiting class with this type of
impact came in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made recruiting in Fort Worth a priority, and that paid
dividends, obviously,'' said Bobby Burton, editor of the National
Recruiting Advisor.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The aim is to ride up alongside a comet as it streams through
space at six times the speed of a rifle bullet, capture some cosmic
dust and return it to Earth so scientists can study the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple enough _ in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's launch of the Stardust space probe, a NASA mission
led by the University of Washington astronomer Donald Brownlee that
is aimed at intercepting a comet in 2004, will be the first direct
sampling of one of the solar system's oldest residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever done anything like this before,'' Brownlee said.
</P>
<P>
   Comets, often described as ``dirty snowballs,'' are believed to
be composed of the original ice, organic chemicals, frozen gas and
minerals that coalesced to form the planets and perhaps life
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists don't know the exact composition of comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locked within comet molecules and atoms could be the record of
the formation of the planets and the materials from which they were
made,'' said Edward Weiler, associate administrator for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Direct study of
interplanetary dust should lead to new understanding of the birth
of the solar system and our own origin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After launch by a Boeing Delta II rocket Saturday, the Stardust
spacecraft will enter a gravity-assisted orbit that will send it on
a trajectory for five years until it comes within 100 miles of a
comet known as Wild-2. (Wild is pronounced ``Vilt.'')
</P>
<P>
   The craft seeks to capture both comet dust and interstellar dust
and return with its space booty to Earth on Jan. 15, 2006, landing
on the snow-covered salt flats of the Utah desert.
</P>
<P>
   The capture device is a tennis-racket shaped container holding a
silica-glass substance known as aerogel. Developed by scientists at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., it is an
extraordinary type of porous glass that is 99 percent air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing stuff,'' Brownlee said. The aerogel _ sometimes
called ``frozen smoke'' _ is ideal for capturing these tiny dust
particles. Because of its light density, it can capture the
particles and encase them in glass with little impact on the
particles.
</P>
<P>
   Why go to all this trouble for a handful of dust?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are star dust,'' Brownlee said, echoing the line from Joni
Mitchell's song ``Woodstock.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an appropriate name for this ambitious mission that, in a
sense, was launched in concept during the mid-1960s. It began as a
balloon let loose from Berkeley. Brownlee was an undergraduate
electrical engineering student at the University of California,
Berkeley at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He took an astronomy course and got hooked on stars, switching
career paths and launching his new avenue of inquiry by trying
something that had been frustrating expert astronomers for years.
Brownlee wanted to capture this star dust, these interplanetary
particles, the basic materials of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always known this is the most primitive material out
there,'' Brownlee said.
</P>
<P>
   But back when he started on the quest, nobody had ever captured
the elusive space dirt. Theories about the composition of
interplanetary dust particles varied wildly.
</P>
<P>
   It was important to know more about the dust because of the
nation's fledgling space program. Officials wanted to know what
kind of dust was up there, how much of it was there and if it would
hurt their spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists could only offer their best guesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him about the highly unsuccessful search for
interplanetary dust,'' said Paul Hodge, who was Brownlee's
professor at Berkeley and is now a colleague with him in the UW
Astronomy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge said Brownlee, with the engineer's mind-set, simply set
out to solve the problem and capture some interplanetary dust. He
built his trap and launched the contraption via a high-altitude
balloon that he and Hodge tracked by telescope. If Brownlee's first
balloon ever captured anything up there in the stratosphere, he
never found out. The balloon flew away and he never saw it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unsuccessful, but it was a spectacular experiment and
it gave him a thirst for that sort of thing,'' Hodge said. ``He was
just ingenious with equipment. ... His efforts paid off because he
eventually became the first to collect interplanetary dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The particles he collected, fluffy and fragile microscopic
pieces of cosmic detritus, are now called Brownlee particles. He
captured them in 1970 using a more sophisticated contraption that
he and his team dubbed the ``vacuum monster.'' It was carried into
the stratosphere by a balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he has tried other methods to capture purer
forms of this dust _ particles whose chemistry and structure had
not been adulterated by contact with Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Brownlee and his colleagues got Apollo 12 astronauts to
take a book-like dust collector he built and hold it open outside
the space capsule during their space walk.
</P>
<P>
   They also used U-2 converted spy planes that had been loaned to
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   These methods captured a few dust particles here and there, but
what Brownlee wanted was to get the material from its source _ a
comet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of material flying around in space, but
comets contain the most primitive extraterrestrial material,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Brownlee's persistent thirst for this sort of thing
culminates in the launch of Stardust. Though he is the principal
investigator and is credited with originating the Stardust mission,
he almost wasn't a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Stardust was proposed, I didn't want any part of it,'' he
said. ``I'd spent a lifetime proposing missions that never
happened. ... I got really discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   When colleagues at NASA'a Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena
approached him to help make the Stardust proposal, Brownlee
refused. ``I was just sick of the whole thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his colleagues convinced him to sign on, but he was
sure it would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in fall 1995, the unexpected happen. As part of NASA's
Discovery program (which promotes relatively inexpensive and
innovative space exploration projects), the Stardust project was
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee saw his 35 years of effort in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had seemed like a waste of time but, in fact, it wasn't,''
he said. ``I realize now that it was all adding up and served as
preparation for Stardust. ... It paid off.''

MATADORS GET COMMITMENTS FROM THREE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Cal State Northridge football staff expected
to get an oral commitment from one running back. Instead the
Matadors got three.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors also got a commitment from a receiver _ Westlake
High's Travis Campbell, who took recruiting trips to Michigan and
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder head coach Ron Ponciano said this could be CSUN's
best recruiting class. Today is the first day high school and
junior college football players can sign national letters of
intent, and the fax machine in the CSUN athletic department will
start buzzing shortly after 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Among local high school players, CSUN is expected to receive
letters from L.A. Baptist offensive lineman Ashcon Majdid, tight
end Nic Longshore of Canyon, Lancaster offensive lineman Nick
Koufos, St. Francis fullback Creighton Milton, Antelope Valley
running back Bruce Molock, Highland running back Brandon McElvaine
and Alemany wide receivers Devin Montgomery and Bryson Atkins.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, Molock and Campbell are key recruits. Molock, who
rushed for 1,282 yards and 12 touchdowns in only nine games, turned
down an offer from Idaho to sign with the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery is also one of the area's top basketball players. He
led Alemany with 45 catches for 796 yards and eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano was also enthusiastic about a commitment from Torrance
High defensive lineman Alatani Malu.

CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUPS SUE BERKELEY OVER ADMISSIONS POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five civil-rights organizations have sued the
University of California at Berkeley on behalf of more than 750
black, Hispanic and Filipino-American students for what they say
are discriminatory policies that deny admissions to disadvantaged
members of minorities with excellent academic records.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, argues that
Berkeley has an admissions policy that gives more consideration to
applicants who take advanced-placement classes that are not
available to all California high-school students.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say that more than half the schools in the state
have no advanced-placement classes, and that most of those schools
have high concentrations of black, Hispanic and Filipino-American
students. That means the admissions policy rewards students who
have access to these courses, in essence rewarding privilege, not
merit, the plaintiffs contend.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current admissions policy, which was first applied in
choosing the current freshman class, each applicant is assigned an
academic and a comprehensive score. At issue is the academic score,
at least 75 percent of which is based on three criteria: grade
point average, standardized academic tests and college preparatory
courses _ namely advanced-placement courses. Students who take the
advanced courses are awarded an extra point; if, for example, they
receive an A in the course, five points instead of the standard
four are figured into their grade point average.
</P>
<P>
   The suit underscores the problem that California's public
institutions face now that racial preferences in admissions have
been banned under Proposition 209. At the heart of the suit is the
question that led colleges to implement affirmative action
policies: how should an admissions committee take into account the
fact that students in poor, minority districts lack the educational
opportunities of the well-off?
</P>
<P>
   Given the Berkeley campus' emphasis on advanced-placement
courses and college entrance exams, which students in middle-class
districts are more likely to prepare for with expensive coaching
courses, the lawsuit argues, even high-achieving minority students
with excellent records are effectively shut out. And since
Proposition 209 took effect for this year's freshman class, there
is no way to soften the policy, lawyers for the plaintiffs said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Education Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the
Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California, the
Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and the American Civil
Liberties Union of Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found that white students have a 30 percent greater
opportunity of having AP classes,'' said Kimberly West-Faulcon, a
lawyer for the NAACP legal fund. And, she said, ``over 50 percent
of Berkeley's students come from 5 percent of the state's
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Tuesday afternoon, Berkeley chancellor
Robert Berdahl said that since 1997, when bans on affirmative
action imposed by both the University of California regents and the
state took effect, ``we have worked hard to make sure that each
applicant continues to receive fair and thorough consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Berdahl did not address the issue of advanced-placement courses,
but he said that the admissions staff recognized ``the
disadvantages some have faced,'' by relying, for example, ``less on
test scores than at any time since standardized tests were
introduced into the admissions process.'' Further, he said, ``we
have intensified our recruitment efforts to more actively encourage
underrepresented minority students to enroll at Berkeley.''
</P>
<P>
   The current freshman class is the first admitted since
affirmative action and gender preferences were banned under
Proposition 209, and the effects are obvious. The numbers of black
students plummeted by more than half, to the lowest figures since
the university began keeping figures in 1981, and Hispanic
enrollment decreased by 43 percent. Of 3,735 freshmen, 126, or 3
percent, are black, and 269, or 7 percent, are Hispanic. There are
1,468 Asian-American freshmen, an increase of 6 percent, and 1,018
whites, an increase of 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The average freshman admitted last fall had a score of 1390 out
of 1600 on the Scholastic Assessment Test and a grade point average
of 4.27. The Berkeley campus denied admissions to 26,000 students,
7,000 of whom had a 4.0 grade point average or better, including
750 minority students represented in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Tuesday, the lead plaintiff, Jesus Rios,
the son of immigrant farmworkers from rural Hollister, in Northern
California, said he was stunned when he was denied admission
despite a perfect academic record. ``I thought if you do the right
things, you get what you want,'' said Rios, now a freshman at the
university's Davis campus.

PHILIPS TO PAY $180 MILLION TO NAME ARENA IN ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to elevate its brand awareness and forge a
strategic bond, Royal Philips Electronics NV of the Netherlands
will pay an estimated $180 million to emblazon its name on the
20,000-seat arena being built by Time Warner Inc. to house its
Atlanta Hawks basketball team and new Thrashers hockey club.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips Arena agreement is the richest arena or
stadium-naming rights deal, exceeding the $116.5 million that
Staples Inc., the office supplies retailer, will pay for 20 years
at a new Los Angeles arena to house the Lakers and Clippers
basketball teams and Kings hockey team starting next season.
</P>
<P>
   For Philips, the deal not only places its name on the $213
million arena but will also let the consumer electronics giant and
Time Warner explore how to develop online, video, merchandising,
digital and new media products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't looking for someone just to be a billboard on a
box,'' said Stan Kasten, the chairman of the arena and president of
the Hawks and Braves baseball team, all parts of Turner
Broadcasting System, a unit of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Philips will also advertise heavily with Time Warner and Turner
properties, provide 1,000 video monitors in the arena and create a
retail showroom inside the facility, which will open in September,
replacing the Omni.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a unique branding opportunity, but also as a
relationship that goes far beyond the name,'' John Losier, the
president and chief executive of Philips Electronics North America,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of naming rights to corporations has become an
increasingly popular revenue source for teams trying to defray the
cost of construction or pay for soaring player salaries. While some
older, existing facilities have been renamed, naming-rights deals
have grown apace with newer arenas and stadiums, such as the MCI
Center in Washington, Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix and the National
Car Rental Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Psinet Inc., a computer services company in Herndon,
Va., agreed to pay $105.5 million over 20 years for a broad-based
deal to put its name on the new football stadium of the Baltimore
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Although the trend is toward corporate deals, Turner Field, the
Braves' home, was named the old-fashioned way: for a person, Ted
Turner, the vice chairman of Time Warner. ``It wasn't my idea, it
was Gerald Levin's,'' Turner said, referring to Time Warner's
chairman. ``If it were up to me, I'd have put it up for bids.''

EDITORIAL: DEATH OF A BENEFACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Feb. 3: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mellon, who died Tuesday at 91, was, as John Russell wrote
in The New York Times several years ago, ``the largest and most
discerning donor that the American museum world has known in the
second half of this century.'' The important words are ``most
discerning.'' Mellon's total benefactions have been valued at
perhaps $1 billion. Their quality is even more impressive. His
gifts of art enriched beyond measure the National Gallery of Art,
in Washington, which was founded by his father, Andrew Mellon. Yale
University is deeply indebted to him for a gift of $50 million and
for the Yale Center for British Art.
</P>
<P>
   As a new generation of philanthropists tries to understand the
subtleties of giving well, it could do no better than to emulate
Mellon, who used his money to serve his own cultural passions and
at the same time to benefit the public. He was instrumental in
preserving the shoreline of Cape Hatteras and the journals of James
Boswell. He helped restore Monticello and made possible the
distinguished literary and philosophical publications that emanated
from the Bollingen Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   There was always a quality of self-effacement about Mellon, a
basic modesty that, in the end, makes his cultural contributions to
our world that much more luminous. He loved horses, he loved art
and he loved books. He would have been the first to say that life
does not offer greater riches than affection for such things.

FORD TRIES TO AVOID CLOSINGS IN WAKE OF FACTORY EXPLOSION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (jw) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Ford Motor Co. struggled Tuesday to keep a
serious industrial accident that paralyzed its River Rouge
manufacturing complex from causing shutdowns at other factories
across North America.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster on Monday killed one Ford worker, badly burned 13,
left an undetermined number hurt and idled 10,000 at the complex in
this southwest Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said that many of the burned workers would require
surgery every other day for several weeks to heal the injuries
caused when a coal-fired power plant exploded and then caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said Tuesday that their main concern was for the
victims and were reluctant to talk about the effects on the company
from the accident.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has insurance against business interruptions,
officials declined to estimate the company's losses or the extent
to which they would be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Ford engineers were still struggling to find a way to restart
the five big auto-parts factories and an assembly plant closed here
by the power plant fire. They faced a huge task.
</P>
<P>
   Dearborn fire officials said that the explosion had started many
fires on various levels of the power plant, and these fires burned
for hours. The roof caved in and some walls collapsed, filling
large areas of the 20-story power plant with rubble. Identifying
the cause of the explosion will be difficult, fire and police
officials warned.
</P>
<P>
   The power plant normally produces enough electricity to supply
the residential needs of a city the size of Boston. It also
produces steam to heat the factories and compressed air to run many
of the power tools.
</P>
<P>
   All but four of Ford's 20 assembly plants in North America
depend on parts from the 1,100-acre factory complex, said Art
Janes, Ford's site manager for the complex. The parts factories
here make steel underbodies, fenders, engines, windshields and
other parts.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly plant at River Rouge makes Ford Mustangs. While
these sporty cars have been selling well and are in short supply,
Ford's first priority is to restart the parts factories here so as
to avoid closing assembly plants elsewhere, Janes said.
</P>
<P>
   To conserve auto parts and reduce overtime, Ford slowed
production Tuesday at nine assembly plants: five pickup truck
factories, three car factories and a full-size van factory.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers now keep very small inventories of auto parts at
their assembly plants, a practice that allows them to free costly
floor space to be used instead by robots and other equipment. But
the meager inventories make auto makers vulnerable to supply
disruptions, most notably when a 54-day strike last summer at two
General Motors parts factories in Flint, Mich., forced the world's
largest company to close all but two of its 29 assembly plants in
North America for much of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   No one here is suggesting that Ford may face a similar
disruption. Parts-making equipment can be loaded on trucks and
moved to other factories in a few days. But with some Ford
factories already operating at maximum capacity with maximum
overtime, it may be difficult to recover lost production, said
Michael Robinet, an auto manufacturing expert at the CSM Corp., a
consulting firm in Farmington Hills, Mich.

TIME WARNER STAYS STURDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wall Street trackers expect Time Warner Inc. to
retain its status as the shining light among entertainment
conglomerates when it releases its fourth-quarter earnings before
the markets open Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the world's largest media-entertainment concern have
tripled in value over the past two years as Time Warner became one
of the engines driving the bull market. The gains reflect a
turnaround in investors' attitude after years in which Time Warner
was slammed over heavy investment in cable television.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market run-up became a frenzy late last year as the
cable sector surged. Time Warner stock was in the low $40s before
releasing better-than-expected third quarter results Oct. 14 with
strong performance in cable, publishing and entertainment. Time
Warner fell $1.0625 to $61.25 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is doing extremely well,'' said Barry Hyman, an
analyst with Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum, who expects year-to-year
cash flow growth of at least 15 percent to $1.28 billion. Cash flow
is the key performance measure since Time Warner's massive debt
load limits profitability.
</P>
<P>
   S.G. Cowen analyst Edward Hatch issued a ``buy'' rating Tuesday
with a year-end price target of $70 and predicted fourth-quarter
cash flow will rise 18 percent. That performance will accelerate in
2001, he said, driven by new cable and phone services and strong
syndication revenues from Warner-produced shows such as
``Friends,'' ``E.R.'' and ``Drew Carey.''
</P>
<P>
   CIBC Oppenheimer analyst Sharon Williams repeated her ``buy''
rating Tuesday and boosted her target to $78 from $62.50. Richard
Bilotti of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has predicted that WB
Network, the only network to gain ratings during the current
season, will be profitable by 2001. He expects the stock to hit $80
to $82 a share in 2001 and annual cash flow to rise 14 percent to
16 percent through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts polled by Zacks Investment expect a fourth-quarter loss
of 4 cents a share compared with a loss of 3 cents a share in the
same quarter in 1997. Of 21 brokerages surveyed, the stock is rated
a strong buy by five, a moderate buy by 13 and a hold by three.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Time Warner announced its long-expected joint venture
with AT&AMP;T Corp. to offer local phone service exclusively on Time
Warner cable systems in 33 states. AT&AMP;T will own 77.5 percent and
estimated the venture will have $4 billion in sales and a positive
cash flow in three years. Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin said
the agreement will immediately add to earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AT&AMP;T deal will be a great combination down the road,''
Hyman said. ``Time Warner has got to do something because cable,
phone and Internet service are all going to be one industry
eventually, so it's a smart move.''

PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH PANEL BACKS A PASTOR WHO BLESSED GAY COUPLES

   DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. _ Supporting a minister here who had been
quietly performing church ceremonies uniting homosexual couples, a
regional board of the Presbyterian Church has voted overwhelmingly
to allow ministers in 95 churches from Westchester to the Catskills
to bless such couples. They just can't call the ceremonies
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River Presbytery, a body of clergy members and church
elders that oversees 95 churches with about 11,000 parishioners in
the lower Hudson Valley, voted 105-35 Saturday to endorse same-sex
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which is expected to be appealed through the church
courts, could reignite the debate over such unions, a subject of
contention in the Presbyterian Church and other mainline Protestant
churches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues were really very brave in taking a first step to
break a violent silence,'' said the pastor at the center of the
dispute, the Rev. Joseph Gilmore of South Presbyterian Church in
Dobbs Ferry.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, 55, became the subject of an investigation by the
regional church leaders in September after a minister from an
evangelical Presbyterian church in Orange County saw an article in
a local newspaper that said he performed same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The article, in Gannett Suburban Newspapers in August, was
accompanied by a front-page photograph of a homosexual couple, Jeff
Halvorsen and George Cisneros, and included a description of their
wedding plans. The article's use of the word ``marriage'' concerned
some Presbyterians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea that was going on until I saw the newspaper,''
said the Rev. Marc Benton, pastor of the Bethlehem Presbyterian
Church in New Windsor, who asked the Presbytery to investigate
whether Gilmore violated church law. Benton said he would appeal
the vote to the Synod of the Northeast, which oversees presbyteries
in New York, New Jersey and New England.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who does not call the ceremonies marriages, but ``holy
unions,'' could have lost his pastorate if the regional body had
ruled against him.
</P>
<P>
   While church law does not endorse same-sex unions, the church
code, the Book of Order, gives ministers some leeway on the issue,
simply prohibiting them from uniting homosexual couples if they
determine the blessing ``to be the same as a marriage.''

JEWISH GROUP SPLITS OVER NAMING NEW LEADER
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The largest umbrella organization of American Jewish
groups is expected to vote here Wednesday on a new chairman, but
there is unusual dissension over the political ties of the nominee,
Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about the nomination concern the close ties that
Lauder enjoys with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
whether he answered truthfully when asked during the organization's
vetting process whether he had provided financial support for the
prime minister's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans who are active in the Jewish community and who
give a great deal to Jewish causes do not contribute to campaigns
in Israel,'' said Howard Squadron, a former chairman of the
umbrella group, the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations. ``Most of us have made it a matter of
principle that we don't interfere in Israeli elections and
certainly not in such an obvious and crass way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Presidents Conference presents a nonpartisan front on issues
regarding Israel, and historically its chairman is not identified
with any particular camp during the usual two-year tenure in
office.
</P>
<P>
   During his screening by the nominating committee, Lauder was
asked if he had contributed to Netanyahu's 1996 campaign and he
said no. He also denied a recent published report that Netanyahu
political operatives were on his payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Direct foreign contributions to elections have been illegal
under Israeli law since 1994, but rich donors overseas often find
ways around the rules. They either use nonprofit organizations that
find a way to channel the money into Israel, or pay for advertising
and other services directly, said Professor Menachem Hofnung of
Hebrew University, who helped draft the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all do it, they simply disregard the law,'' Hofnung said.
``Voters accept it as part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   An article published last week by The Jewish Week in New York
and Haaretz, a daily in Israel, citing tax records and anonymous
sources, reported that Lauder had helped Netanyahu in numerous
ways, from helping him retain an American campaign strategist,
Arthur Finkelstein, to contributing to a raft of organizations that
underwrite right-wing causes in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the groups within the Presidents Conference contend that
the allegations are serious enough that Wednesday's vote ought to
be postponed. In an attempt to quell the murmuring, the
seven-member nominating committee held another session with Lauder
on Tuesday to question him about the reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely said to us that he never gave money to
Netanyahu's campaign,'' said Leon Levy, a former chairman of the
Presidents Conference who headed the search committee. Levy said
before the session that he believed that the charges were spurious
and that the nomination would go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who are active and who have participated in the
political process,'' he said. ``That is where we find the kind of
people who can deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Lauder, a former U.S. ambassador to Austria
who was a candidate for the Republican mayoral nomination in New
York City in 1989 and is the current president of the Jewish
National Fund, issued a statement saying that he welcomed the
questions and had answered them fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that I have the independence the position
needs,'' he said. ``I'm committed to demonstrating my integrity on
the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition dictates that the vote for president by the 55 members
be as close to unanimous as possible. But those opposed to the vote
Wednesday said that as many as 20 member organizations wanted
further investigation into the allegations and the nominating
process itself and were seeking to postpone the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the Presidents Conference needs, especially
against the backdrop of the Israeli electoral season, is any doubts
and questions about the nature of the possible ties between the
chairman and one of three principal candidates for prime
minister,'' said David Harris, the executive director of the
American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Past chairmen have been identified with particular political
schools of thought in Israel. Rabbi Alexander Schindler, the
chairman from 1977 to 1979, was seen as a left-wing partisan at the
time of his selection. But he is considered a model of presenting a
nonpartisan view.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you become chairman, if you are a person of integrity,
you have to leave your own ideology and try to articulate the
consensus of the American Jewish community,'' the rabbi said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But those questioning Lauder's nomination say that never before
has a candidate made his preferences so clearly plain. Mark
Rosenblum, the founder of Americans for Peace Now, said that on
Middle East peace, for example, Lauder had the reputation for
supporting Netanyahu's policies ahead of those of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is saying he shouldn't be the candidate, but first
there need to be answers to some questions,'' Rosenblum said. ``I
think the problem is whether or not he actively misled people.''

TOWN AT A LOSS FOR EXPLANATION AFTER TEEN HELD IN KILLING OF
PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRUITT, Texas _ If mourners are seeking answers at the funeral
Wednesday for Deborah and Walter McCowan, they're out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   This unincorporated East Texas community of about 150, sitting
between Van and Grand Saline in Van Zandt County, has been
desperate for an explanation since the couple's 13-year-old son, a
well-mannered, chess-playing, honor-roll student, was accused of
killing his parents with a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just devastated by this,'' said the Rev. David McNary,
50, who said the McCowans appeared to be model parents in a model
family.
</P>
<P>
   That family included Walter McCowan's three sons from a previous
marriage, the 13-year-old as well as a 14-year-old and an
11-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just nothing you could pick up and say there was a
problem,'' said McNary, whose church is the center of a community
that lost its businesses and schools to Van after that town struck
oil in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Pruitt is about 100 miles east of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, McNary told worshipers that they've come together in
tragedy ``even though we have more questions than answers.''
</P>
<P>
   What is known, according to Van Zandt County Sheriff's
Department investigators, is that deputies responded to a 911 call
at 2:30 p.m. Saturday from a boy who said he had just shot his
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need help out here,'' the boy was quoted by Chief Deputy
Grady Tucker as saying. ``I shot my mom and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCowan, 35, had just returned after picking up his
44-year-old wife from Grand Saline, where she was assistant
director of nursing at Azalea Trail Nursing Home.
</P>
<P>
   He was shot in the neck with a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle;
he was found in the kitchen. His wife _ the 13-year-old's
stepmother _ was found in the front yard with a mortal chest wound,
Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old heard the shots from a bedroom but saw nothing,
investigators said. The 14-year-old was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question now is why,'' said Tucker. ``It's hard to
try to figure out why a 13-year-old would snap to the point where
he would brutally murder his mom and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy, whom authorities have not identified because he is a
juvenile, is being held at the Van Zandt Juvenile Detention Center.
</P>
<P>
   No one has asked that he be permitted to attend his parent's
funeral Wednesday, said center director Bobby Colicino.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said they had no clue that anything was amiss in the
McCowan home.
</P>
<P>
   At the nursing home where she worked, Deborah McCowan traded
complaints with colleagues about teen-age boys, but there appeared
to be no serious problems between her and her stepson, said her
boss, administrator Tom Nance.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, the three McCowan boys would climb aboard the same
yellow school bus, each saying, ``Good morning, Mr. Skeeters,''
said the driver, Bobby Skeeters, 43.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old would be dropped at the high school, his
brothers at the junior high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a busload of kids like them,'' Skeeters, the Van
High School wood shop teacher, said Tuesday at the Nu-Way
Convenience Store. ``I couldn't believe it when I heard about it.
He (the 13-year-old) was just an absolute joy _ kind of quiet,
always smiling, just never saw him when he wasn't just a super
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys were raised by their natural mother until 1994 when
they were sent to their father, who had remarried. Deborah McCowan
had grown daughters and grandchildren living out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCowan, a devout Baptist, was a diesel mechanic. He had
recently quit working to return to college, intending to enter the
clergy some day, friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the boys' friends described the McCowans as
disciplinarians. A fight between brothers in which cookies were
thrown back and forth could mean a week's grounding: no TV, no
Nintendo and no bike riding, the friends said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the 13-year-old had been grounded at the time of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Punishment was worse for bad grades, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in class when we got our report cards,''
recalled eighth-grader Matthew Zucca, 13, a friend of the arrested
boy. ``He just started crying. I asked `What's wrong?' He said that
each time he got a bad grade, he'd get beaten with a belt by both
of his parents. I was pretty surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``bad grade'' was a low ``B,'' the boy told Zucca.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told him, `At least you passed,' he said, `They don't
care. My parents want me to be a straight A student,' '' Zucca
said.
</P>
<P>
   The snowy-blond 13-year-old, who arrived at school in white
dress shirts, played football during lunch. But he didn't try out
for organized sports because his parents couldn't afford the
uniform and shoes, the boy told friends.
</P>
<P>
   In chess, the 13-year-old was a star.
</P>
<P>
   Junior High Principal Greg Evans said the boy ranked first in
the chess club, which had more than 35 students. He won an
all-school tournament three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a model student on the A/B honor roll with a lot of
friends, seemed to be upbeat and was never seen in the office for a
discipline problem,'' Evans said. ``After this happened I was
curious, so I looked for his discipline file and he doesn't have
one. He's never been tardy to class. Received all kinds of `Star'
awards for academics. Just a super kid. That's why everyone is
struggling with this.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was going on in the home? We have no indication here of
anything. They seemed like a great family. My teachers can't
believe this young man was capable of doing something like this.''

JURY RULES THAT PBS MUST PAY VIDEO DISTRIBUTOR $47 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Nesmith, who first earned fame and fortune as a member
of the 1960s rock group the Monkees, had a new fortune ordered his
way by a federal jury in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-person jury late Monday unanimously found the Public
Broadcasting Service guilty of breach of contract and fraud in
dealing with Nesmith in his more recent career as a video producer,
and awarded him and his company nearly $47 million in compensatory
and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   PBS declined to comment on the verdict beyond a statement
Tuesday saying it intended to contest it.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was unusual because Nesmith was a defendant in the
case, in which PBS sought to recover past royalties due from his
company; the jury rejected the PBS claim while finding in favor of
Nesmith's counterclaim.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Nesmith's lawyers presented evidence
indicating that PBS had misrepresented and concealed business
arrangements from Nesmith and his company, Pacific Arts Inc.,
helping drive him out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decimated my business, they decimated my catalog, by
luring me into this kind of complacency by lying to me,'' Nesmith
said Tuesday. ``I closed the business down in the shambles that it
was, swept everything clean, moved to Santa Fe and wrote a novel.
Then, PBS sued me.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship began in 1990, when Nesmith licensed the PBS
logo and name to start a PBS Home Video line; PBS was to receive 6
percent of the sales revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Nesmith had spent much of the 1980s buying the video rights to
what he called ``documentaries and high-end programming'' at a time
when the video business primarily consisted of theatrical movies
and pornography. Among the programs whose video rights he bought
were ``The Civil War'' from Ken Burns, the ``Nature'' series from
WNET in New York and ``Masterpiece Theater'' from WGBH in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually built the catalog from 1980 to 1989,'' he said.
``Once it was built, I thought I needed to license a logo to sell
it under. PBS was a natural fit because they didn't own a catalog,
and they were looking to see how they could get into the home video
business.''
</P>
<P>
   According to his lawyer, Henry Gradstein of Los Angeles, Nesmith
spent too much on rights and licensing fees and the video line's
design, packaging and marketing. He failed to leave enough money to
operate the business properly.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1992, Gradstein said, Nesmith fell behind on royalty
payments and asked PBS to renegotiate for a longer-term license, to
give him time to get the business into the black. PBS, Gradstein
said, agreed to do so and to find an investor to help raise extra
capital, but never followed through.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1992, Nesmith said, he told PBS he had to sell his
library, which he estimated was worth $10 million to $15 million,
to pay his debts and fold his company without losing too much
money.
</P>
<P>
   Gradstein said PBS ``begged him not to,'' telling Nesmith it
would mean ``the death knell'' of the PBS line, because the titles
would be scattered to new owners, and again promised to find
financial help.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gradstein said, PBS solicited other distributors to
take over the line, and also asked the video companies to terminate
their contracts with Pacific Arts, all on the same day _ Oct. 11,
1993. Most did.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to trial Jan. 4. The jury found PBS guilty of
breach of good faith, intentional misrepresentation, intentional
concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and intentional
interference in contractual relations. It awarded $14.6 million to
Pacific Arts for loss of the library, $29.3 million in punitive
damages, and $3 million in compensatory and punitive damages to
Nesmith.

MARKETING THE MILLENNIUM, AND THE COUNTDOWN TO PAYDAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind.)   (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As time marches relentlessly toward history's biggest
New Year's celebration _ at least, its most outrageously promoted _
entrepreneurs are a step ahead, figuring angles to milk the
millennium. The world may soon be buried in an avalanche of
fin-de-siecle merchandise, from schlocky key chains to plush
``Millanimals'' to stadium jackets that flash the number 2000
electrically.
</P>
<P>
   At 34th Street and Seventh Avenue here, a restaurant chain, the
Riese Organization, has erected a digital billboard counting down
seconds to the millennium. The souvenir shop beneath has just
reordered more New York City Millennium T-shirts. At Macy's across
the street, Waterford Crystal's millennial champagne flutes go for
$99 a pair.
</P>
<P>
   At Bloomingdale's, you can get glass globes that, when shaken,
shower hundreds of tiny white 1's and 0's, the basic vocabulary of
computers, on a model of a personal computer self-destructing from
the horror of Y2K. Need a watch with an alarm programmed to go off
only once _ ever _ at midnight on Dec. 31? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   And things are just warming up. Warner Brothers'
``Mil-Looney-um'' campaign won't gear up until September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bigger than the Olympics,'' said Bob Guberman, a
businessman who literally owns the ``Year 2000'' _ he trademarked
the name _ and is licensing it to manufacturers at the pace of a
man racing against time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a tidal wave that just keeps building,'' Guberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   And it continues to build even though, as purists have not tired
of pointing out, the third millennium technically does not begin
until 2001 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that most people, as yet, are blissfully unaware of
their millennial shopping opportunities. It also seems safe to say
that many may not be thrilled to know.
</P>
<P>
   At many stores, the stuff does not yet seem to be pouring in. A
tour of a dozen souvenir shops in the Times Square area, of
vendors' carts in Battery Park, where people board boats to the
Statue of Liberty, and of the eclectic mix of stores in the Fulton
Mall in Brooklyn revealed exactly no millennial merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there much empirical evidence of universal enthusiasm. At
Star Magic, a chain of Manhattan stores selling ``space gifts that
are out of this world,'' the owner, Shlomo Ayal, said he tried to
sell ``countdown clocks,'' but demand was nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a customer say: `What's the big deal? Just because the
numbers are all zeros, so what?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet according to the merchandise display at the American Museum
of Natural History, there are 761,039 Internet sites devoted to the
millennium, many of which sell merchandise. The city expects that
more than a million visitors, all toting credit cards, will try to
cram themselves into Times Square. Even those expecting the world
to end with the century are viewed as a fertile market. Christian
Publications Bookstore at 315 W. 43rd St. offers apocalyptic titles
like ``End Time Visions: The Road to Armageddon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But not a lot is sacred in the millennial game. The prevailing
view is that a big party should mean big money. For example, the
Times Square Business Improvement District, the owners of 1 Times
Square, the building from which the ball is dropped, and Countdown
Entertainment, a marketing company, have teamed up to put together
a profitable team of licensees for their ``Times Square 2000''
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Waterford, which will make a glittery new ball for Times Square,
is marketing millennial champagne flutes. Korbel, which is
supplying the balloons, is lugging a 4-foot-6-inch-tall champagne
bottle around the country for practice parties.
</P>
<P>
   Another Times Square 2000 licensee is the Original Time Capsule
Co. of Greenfield, Ind., which offers a kit for one's very own
millennial memories, to be opened at whatever date in the future
seems appropriate. A buyer also gets the right to place ``a letter
to future generations'' in a time capsule to be placed in Times
Square. Some 50,000 kits of a planned output of at least 150,000
have already been sold at $19.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Still another Times Square 2000 licensee is Michael Anthony
Jewelers of Mount Vernon, N.Y., which is making a variety of
pieces, including 14-karat-gold pendants of champagne bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buildup is starting,'' said Dan Vasti, Michael Anthony's
licensing director. ``Everything will be hitting everybody all at
once.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a clearly a time for thinking large. Celebration 2000 _
a 12-hour bash planned for Javits Center for which tickets start at
$1,000 and attendees will be picked up in Lincoln Town Cars _ plans
a full line of Celebration 2000 merchandise to go on sale months
before the shindig. ``We spent a lot of time designing that logo,''
said Steve Leber, chairman of Celebration 2000. ``It looks great on
clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the promoter got to the main point. ``People realize that
this is something that happens only once in 100 lifetimes,'' Leber
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe and maybe not. Guberman also owns the rights to ``Year
2001.''

GOODYEAR PLANS TO DISCLOSE AGREEMENT WITH SUMITOMO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (lb) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. is expected to announce Wednesday
that it has signed a deal with Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. that
will effectively give Goodyear control of most of the debt-laden
Japanese company's tire operations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been predicting such an arrangement for two years.
Sumitomo, which owns the Dunlop and Ohtsu brands, and Goodyear
already have a strategic alliance to make, test and sell each
other's tires in their home countries. While the latest deal is
couched in terms of joint ventures and stock swaps, it makes
Goodyear, which is based in Akron, Ohio, the dominant partner and
the world's largest tire maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were two American companies, they'd call it a
straightforward acquisition,'' said someone close to the talks.
``The Japanese feel they would lose face if it looked as though
they'd been acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Goodyear and Sumitomo will swap about $100
million worth of stock. Goodyear will get 10 percent of Sumitomo,
which has a market capitalization of $1 billion; Sumitomo will own
less than 1 percent of Goodyear, which has an $8 billion market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   But far more significant, Goodyear and Sumitomo have agreed to
place many of their plants and marketing operations into joint
ventures, with Goodyear owning the largest shares of most. Goodyear
has agreed to pay Sumitomo $1 billion in cash to make up for the
inequity. Sumitomo is saddled with a great deal of debt; it was
cash payment that clinched the deal, according to the person close
to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes plans to combine purchasing and research
operations, but its crux is in a pooling of plants and distribution
centers around the world. For example, in Western Europe, where
Goodyear and Sumitomo each do about $2 billion in annual revenue,
the two companies will put their total of 14 plants into a
joint-venture company that will sell Goodyear and Sumitomo tires.
Goodyear will own 75 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also calls for Goodyear to take over 75 percent of
Sumitomo's two U.S. factories, which have about $800 million in
sales.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a mirror-image ownership structure in Japan, where
Goodyear has maintained small marketing operations. Those will be
folded into Sumitomo's operations. Though Sumitomo will own the 75
percent stake, Goodyear is contributing relatively little to get a
significant toehold in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   By adding more than $2.5 billion to its annual revenues, the
deal will make Goodyear the world's largest tire maker, with a 22
percent market share. Until now, Goodyear, with 17 percent of
worldwide tire sales, was behind Michelin and Bridgestone.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear badly needs the added sales, if it is to deliver on the
huge growth spurt it has promised Wall Street. Last year,
Goodyear's chief executive, Samir Gibara, told investors that he
would add $10 billion to Goodyear's revenue by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in each of the last three quarters, Goodyear's sales
have declined from the same quarter of the previous year and its
profits have been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's stock has dropped, too. Its shares, which traded as
high as $75.75 last March, closed Tuesday at $50.375, up 12.5
cents.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Goodyear is pretty distant from meeting its own goals,'' said
Efraim Levy, an analyst at S&AMP;P Equity Group, who downgraded his
recommendation on Goodyear shares to ``avoid'' from ``accumulate''
in late fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because the companies already are so used to each other, most
analysts expect the ventures to operate smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like exchanging wedding rings and vows,'' Levy said.
``You've loved each other for a long time, you get along, but it
still solidifies the relationship.''

MILLIONS MAY SEE WEB FASHION SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Victoria's Secret paraded bra-and-panty-clad Tyra Banks and
Stephanie Seymour across TV screens for a mere 30 seconds during
the Super Bowl Sunday, a reported 1 million people turned away from
the game to log on to the Web address promoted in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a brilliant marketing idea.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of sports, sex, fashion, TV, and the Internet
proved irresistible and it has set advertising executives
everywhere abuzz over future possibilities. ``It's a whole new
world. Kudos for them for trying to capture this opportunistic
situation. It was very smart to use as an advertising vehicle for
the Super Bowl,'' says Tom Julian, a fashion trend analyst for the
New York ad agency Fallon McElligott.
</P>
<P>
   Says Ed Razek, chief creative officer at Victoria's Secret:
``What other commercial has triggered a million people to
immediately get up and do something? . . . During an event that
big, we were able to change their behavior and switch their
programming. It's never been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even better, the ad agency Resource Marketing, of Columbus,
Ohio, charged Victoria's Secret less than $250,000 to develop both
the commercial and the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's response was completely unexpected, Razek says, and it
caused the Web site's main computer system to temporarily crash
(it's now back on line, at www.Victorias Secret.com).
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret staff spent Monday and Tuesday scrambling to
prepare for what may prove to be an even bigger event _ the
presentation of its annual lingerie fashion show Wednesday night on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The 7 p.m. show, to be broadcast live on the Web, is a first for
the fashion world (only prerecorded shows have been broadcast on
the Internet). And considering it was promoted during the Super
Bowl, as well as advertised in The Wall Street Journal, USA Today,
Business Week, Barron's, the Financial Times, and the International
Herald Tribune, Victoria's Secret is expecting millions of people
worldwide to watch the 15-minute show.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the system can handle the load remains unclear. Razek
promises that 500,000 to 1 million people can simultaneously hit
the site. And supposedly, more people can log on seconds later.
``We're stretching the limits of the Web and the limits of
technology,'' he says. But rather than create a potential disaster,
Victoria's Secret intends to broadcast the show repeatedly after
the event is over.
</P>
<P>
   The actual show, which Victoria's Secret has presented every
February for the last four years, will be held at the New York
function hall Cipriani's, on Wall Street. An audience of 800
fashion editors, photographers, and celebrities is expected and the
nearby New York Stock Exchange will be flooded in pink lights.
</P>
<P>
   Will the much-hyped event generate more sales? No one can say
for sure. Some women, like Jill Carey, fashion historian at Lasell
College in Newton, were put off by the ad and the concept of men
ogling women in bras. ``It was all about breasts. They showed the
models moving toward you on the runway and the camera focused on
the breasts. . . . I thought it was very sexist. It wasn't quite
pornographic. But certainly it was extremely suggestive.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if women don't take the bait, men might. After all,
Valentine's Day is less than two weeks away. ``It might spur a
gentleman to buy something for his loved one that he has a fantasy
about,'' says Julian.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of sales, exposure is everything in fashion. And as
more people work and shop on line, the Internet fashion show seems
a logical next step. Razek says the company was inspired because of
the initial response to its Web site, which went on line in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first six hours, we got orders from 37 countries,'' he
says. ``In the first two months, we got orders from 92 countries.
That's half the countries in the United Nations. It just showed the
limitless potential of the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Or of underwear.

IS THAT A BUBBLE, OR IS THE OUTLOOK FABULOUS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editorial Observer)  
 (af)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Feb. 3: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bubble talk is back.
</P>
<P>
   From Davos, where Microsoft's Bill Gates was expressing
bewilderment as to why people would pay so much for Internet
stocks, to Washington, where Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, questioned overall stock prices but said some Internet
companies might be good investments even at current prices, people
are talking about investment bubbles that might burst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bubble'' is a pejorative term for an investment whose price
rises and rises, and then collapses. It is widely agreed that just
such a thing happened to Japanese stock and real estate prices in
the late 1980s, and that Japan has yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, talking about bubbles is easier than spotting a
real one, and it is even more difficult to know when one will
burst.
</P>
<P>
   Charles P. Kindleberger, the economist and author of ``Manias,
Panics and Crashes,'' the definitive academic study of such things,
thought he saw a bubble in this country's stock market a few years
back. ``I agreed with Greenspan in 1996 when he talked about
irrational exuberance, and the stock market is up 50 percent since
then,'' said Kindleberger, now retired from MIT. ``I'm still
looking to see what would come up suddenly to keep the lemmings
from running. Where is the cliff they will run over?''
</P>
<P>
   Bubble talk now tends to deal with two related but separate
phenomena. Has the overall level of American stock prices gotten
away from economic reality? Is it possible that Internet companies
will someday earn enough to justify the lofty peaks their stocks
reached last month?
</P>
<P>
   Some dismiss all such talk as nonsense. Markets are rational,
they say, so bubbles cannot exist. Even the Dutch tulip-bulb boom
now has academics who argue it was rational.
</P>
<P>
   That argument, however, does not give sufficient weight to the
role of psychology in investing. ``There is nothing,'' Kindleberger
has written, ``so disturbing to one's well-being and judgment as to
see a friend get rich.'' In any period of speculative excess, those
who urge caution are discredited well before the bubble bursts.
Many thought Yahoo, the Internet company, was overpriced a year
ago. Now it is about 10 times as high as it was then.
</P>
<P>
   In 1720 Sir Isaac Newton, a very smart person, invested in the
South Sea Co., whose dreams of profiting from exploration made it
into a classic bubble. Realizing prices had gone crazy, he sold at
a profit, explaining, ``I can calculate the motions of heavenly
bodies, but not the madness of people.'' But prices kept rising,
and Newton bought again, at the top. He suffered huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   Peter L. Bernstein, an economic historian and consultant to
money managers, is one who thinks that the Internet stocks are in a
bubble, but that while the stock market as a whole is overvalued it
is well short of one. What's the difference? ``A bubble is totally
out of touch with reality, where the greater-fool theory is the
dominant driving force, where you are totally confident that
somebody will be willing to pay higher prices no matter what you
pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, said Bernstein, the most remarkable thing about
this period is ``the really broad acceptance of the idea that
nothing bad is going to happen to the U.S. economy. I don't
remember people feeling this way even in the late 1960s.'' The
economic expansion that ended in 1969 lasted almost nine years, the
only one in American history longer than this one, which began in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan warned last year that the United States could not long
remain an island of prosperity, but it has. When he voices concern
about stock prices now, there is little market reaction, in
contrast to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a bubble, what will happen when it is pricked? The
histories of Japan in the 1990s and the United States in the 1930s
argue that bursting bubbles devastate economies.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not have to be that way, particularly if the bubble
is confined to the Internet stocks. Bernstein compared this boom to
1961, when investors flocked to space technology companies amid
expectations that space would bring untold riches. Those stocks
collapsed with the overall market in 1962, but no recession ensued
and most stocks recovered.

<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Feb. 3: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's passage to democracy remains uncertain and incomplete.
Opposition parties now hold a majority in Congress as well as the
country's second-most-powerful electoral post, the mayoralty of
Mexico City. But Mexico's presidency, where political power is
overwhelmingly concentrated, has been controlled without
interruption by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, for
the past seven decades. That monopoly could well end in next year's
elections. What should definitely end is the traditional system of
letting the incumbent president from the PRI choose the party's
nominee to succeed him. There is still time to act before the
general election campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, President Ernest Zedillo proposed an
American-style primary. But he has done little to bring one about.
Party officials indicated that a national party convention would be
held last year to set nominating rules. But no nominating rules
have yet been set. Mexico's two opposition parties, either of which
has a realistic chance of winning the presidential vote, plan to
choose their candidates in nominating conventions this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The main contenders for the PRI nomination are Francisco
Labastida, now interior minister and a close political ally of
Zedillo, and two state governors, Manuel Bartlett and Roberto
Madrazo. Both governors are from the party's old guard and have
resisted democratic change in the past. Still, they and others
should have the right to a fair and democratic contest for the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious generals of the Mexican Revolution organized the
PRI in the 1920s to keep control over presidential succession.
Through hand-picked nominations, unfair campaign rules and
occasional electoral fraud, they and their PRI successors proved
all too effective. Recent reforms have made for fairer campaigns
and cleaner balloting. The next step should be to introduce fair
competition into the PRI's nomination process as well. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deaths from AIDS in New York City have fallen for the
fourth year in a row, with last year marking the first time since
1985 that the city has seen fewer than 2,000 deaths from the
disease, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City health officials attribute the decrease in deaths
to improved drug therapies, and suggest that broader access to the
drugs and HIV care have allowed all segments of the population with
AIDS to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The declines stretched across sex, age and racial lines, though
AIDS deaths among females, particularly black women, experienced
the smallest declines, according to Dr. Neal Cohen, the New York
City health commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary data for 1998 show that 1,947 New York City
residents died of AIDS last year, a drop of 26 percent from 1997.
The decline was 28 percent for men and 21 percent for women.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Ann Chiasson, the New York City assistant commissioner
for disease intervention research, said on Tuesday that it had
appeared from data released last year that the difference in the
rates of decline in AIDS deaths between men and women was closing,
but ``if anything, it is spreading out a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chiasson said the reasons for the widening difference in the
rates of decline were not clear. ``We want to look more closely at
this,'' she said. ``A large part of the epidemic is one of poverty
and substance abuse. Women have particular problems. Many are
mothers with children who may be HIV-infected. The women's role as
caretaker is sometimes getting in the way of their own care. So
there are a whole bunch of reasons why they may not be in care or
unable to keep up with the very rigorous schedule required for
anti-retroviral therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the early years of the AIDS epidemic, New York City has
been one of the hardest-hit cities in the United States. Although
it has only 3 percent of the nation's population, it has 16 percent
of the AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   The overall decline in AIDS deaths last year represented a 72
percent decline from 1995, when there were more than 7,000 AIDS
deaths. In 1995, on average, nearly 20 New York City residents died
from AIDS each day. Last year, that number fell to 5.3 deaths each
day. In 1985, there were 1,663 AIDS deaths registered, or 4.6 per
day.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of AIDS cases has risen faster among
women than men largely because of heterosexual contact. Though
Health Department figures indicate that both men and women
experienced declines in AIDS deaths last year, the declines were
greater among men.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS deaths among males last year fell by nearly 75 percent from
1995, ranging from 81 percent for white men to 77 percent for
Hispanic men and 69 percent for black men.
</P>
<P>
   Deaths among females fell by more than 66 percent from 1995,
with a 63 percent decline among black women, 70 percent for
Hispanic women and 73 percent for white women.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the declines in AIDS death, the health commissioner said
that HIV prevention remained a critical public health goal. AIDS is
diagnosed in more than 8,000 New York City residents each year, and
the estimated number of residents who have AIDS increased to 41,000
last year _ up 13 percent from 1997.

TOYS SALES FELL UNEXPECTEDLY LAST YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   True, youngsters sent parents scurrying to the malls last year
in search of Rugrats, Blue's Clues and Teletubbies. And who can
forget the Furby frenzy?
</P>
<P>
   But even with a strong economy and such must-have hits, the toy
industry turned in flat results last year and is projecting only
modest gains this year.
</P>
<P>
   The mediocre performance for 1998 and cautious forecast for this
year reflect the continuing effects of changing consumer trends on
the overall toy business. And the shifts _ everything from
consumers abandoning traditional toy stores to shop at mass
merchandise outlets to the effects of technology on child's play _
are being felt throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, wholesale shipments of toys were essentially flat,
declining by $41 million, to $15.2 billion, according to the trade
group Toy Manufacturers of America, which released the figures
Tuesday in advance of the 96th annual American International Toy
Fair, which begins in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little worse than I would have expected,'' said
Thomas Graves, an analyst who follows the industry for Standard &AMP;
Poor's Equity Group.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it did not help that youngsters yawned last year at
some previous hot sellers. Remember Tickle Me Elmo and virtual
pets?
</P>
<P>
   Such once wildly popular playthings contributed to a robust 7
percent increase in toy shipments to retailers in 1997. As a
result, 1998 ``was a pretty tough comparison year,'' Graves said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Toy Manufacturers of America initially estimated
that the industry would grow by as much as 4 percent in 1998, but
later revised its forecast to growth of 2 percent to 3 percent. The
industry, with retail sales of about $22 billion, missed even that
conservative growth target as strong categories like stuffed
animals and toy cars and trucks were offset by slower sellers like
action figures and dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the nation's largest toy retailer _ Toys ``R'' Us _
lost its footing last year, which caused manufacturers to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us had a disastrous year, having reporting several
quarters of disappointing earnings heading into the all important
holiday selling season. For the first nine months of last year,
Toys ``R'' Us lost $442 million. Then, during the holiday season,
which should have been its strongest period, Toys ``R'' Us said
sales at its stores open at least a year declined by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company, after watching shoppers increasingly bypass its
parking lots on their way to discount chains like Wal-Mart Stores
and Kmart, has been drastically paring its inventory to cut costs
and to clear its shelves for new toys it hopes will lure customers
back. In doing so, however, Toys ``R'' Us slashed orders to
manufacturers, which were unable to make up the volume elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy maker, said reduced
orders for its Barbies, Power Wheels and other toys contributed
greatly to its poor performance for the fourth quarter and year.
Jill E. Barad, Mattel's chairman and chief executive, said in
announcing the company's results Tuesday that ``unexpected cutbacks
by retailers and our further adjustment to a just-in-time shipping
pattern negatively impacted our results.''
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, Mattel's net income tumbled 69 percent,
to $59.5 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, from $195.1 million,
or 64 cents, the company said. Mattel also said it took two charges
_ one for $27 million related to a recall of Power Wheels and the
other $4 million to settle a lawsuit. Revenues declined to $1.54
billion from $1.61 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the company earned $332.3 million, or $1.10 a
diluted share compared with $285 million, or 93 cents a diluted
share year earlier. Revenues fell to $4.78 billion from $4.83
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite, the bad results, Mattel's stock rose 31.25 cents, to
$25.375.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, who had been warned to expect poor results, seem to
be satisfied that retailers now have lean inventories and will soon
increase orders from the larger manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, with its recent acquisition of the Learning Co., a
leading software maker, Mattel is likely to benefit from a trend
that is challenging many of its competitors _ how to appeal to
children who are abandoning traditional toys for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet impacts the toy industry in a number of
significant ways,'' said Peter Eio, chairman of the Toy
Manufacturers, who estimated that the toy industry would grow by 2
percent to 3 percent this year. ``First and foremost, it occupies
an increasing amount of children's time, and therefore, to a
certain extent, displaces time that might otherwise be devoted to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on the trend, the industry must meet consumers'
increasing demand for entertaining and educational interactive
play,'' Eio said, adding that ``the real winners will be those
companies who combine new technology with tried and trusted
brands.'' &QL;

TWO LAWMAKERS BOYCOTTING PRAYER SESSION OVER ARAFAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Okla.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two House members from New York are refusing to
attend a big prayer breakfast on Thursday in Washington because
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, is expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The two representatives _ Michael Forbes, a Republican, and
Michael McNulty, a Democrat _ are heeding a conservative Christian
group's call for a boycott and have asked organizers of the prayer
breakfast to withdraw the invitation to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., the chairman of the event this
year, refused to rescind the invitation.
</P>
<P>
   The ecumenical breakfast meeting draws thousands of people,
including world and national leaders. President Clinton is expected
to speak, as he has in the past. Arafat is expected to attend for
the first time, but was not invited to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is simply wrong for Congress to treat this unrepentant
terrorist with the respect due a legitimate world leader,'' Forbes
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   But Largent, in a statement, said politics should be kept out of
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the prayer breakfast is to bring people together
for reconciliation and healing and forgiveness and talk about those
issues that Jesus taught,'' said Largent, himself a conservative
Christian and a member of the House Republican leadership. ``These
are the kinds of meetings we need more of.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Largent said he knew of no other lawmakers who
intended to boycott the breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Louis Sheldon, the leader of the Traditional Values
Coalition, a conservative religious lobbying group, best known for
its adamant anti-gay positions, said that he was encouraged by the
response to his calls for a boycott, but that he did not know how
many people would stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not agree more that a spirit of reconciliation is the
purpose of the breakfasts,'' Sheldon said. ``But Mr. Arafat does
not bring that spirit of repentance that must precede
reconciliation.''

COLUMN: FOR RED WINGS, THE CUP IS SINKING
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Detroit Red Wings visited President Clinton at the
White House last week, they were savoring again their second
straight Stanley Cup title. But the Wings have had a difficult time
in recent months and a third visit to the Executive Mansion next
season is far from a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   In sports as well as politics, uneasy rests the head that wears
the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Consider their recent performances.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Wings lost at home by 3-2 to the New York Rangers,
a team that would not even be in the playoffs if they began today.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, they tied the Devils, 2-2, in New Jersey but teammates
stood idly by while Krzysztof Oliwa injured two Detroit defensemen.
And Oliwa also escaped retribution when he grabbed the face shield
of captain Steve Yzerman and twisted him around. Only Yzerman's
prestige was injured, but he is wearing the shield to protect a
broken nose. Nobody came to his aid, and one tough Wing seemed to
second-guess himself after practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen and sometimes you'd like to change what
happens,'' said Darren McCarty. ``You can't. You live with it and
you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings play host to the New York Islanders on Wednesday at
Joe Louis Arena. With a mediocre record of 24-21-4, the Wings
rarely beat teams over .500. They are battered on defense. Larry
Murphy was knocked unconscious when Oliwa sent him into the boards
and will not face the Islanders. Todd Gill suffered an arm injury
from Oliwa's stick, the Red Wings said, and is doubtful for the
Islander game. Uwe Krupp, signed as a free agent for a $4.1 million
salary, is out with a back injury. Slava Fetisov, a respected
elder, retired last summer and Vladimir Konstantinov, once the
Wings' most intimidating hitter, remains in a wheelchair following
the limousine crash of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On the forward lines, the personnel and personalities seem
unsettled. Brendan Shanahan, the slumping power forward, has fallen
from favor. Sergei Fedorov, a superstar center, is outspoken about
the shuffling of lines and the limited minutes he gets from coach
Scotty Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just don't jump for us anymore,'' Fedorov said. ``I
don't know if it's a lack of confidence or lack of understanding
what kind of style we should play. At some point, it is
frustrating. We can score more than two goals. I am concerned. I
don't think we use all our weapons. This is the second half and
things are not consistent. Your best players have to play and your
top players have to have more work. If things are not well, that's
usually how most coaches would run their team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman was not available after practice to explain how he runs
his team. His media delegate was Barry Smith, an associate coach,
who called Oliwa an ``idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wings' trainer, John Wharton, said the Continental Arena
medical staff, aiding injured Wings, ``looked like a fire drill run
by the Keystone Kops'' because they ran onto the ice with a
stretcher for Murphy that was not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   After his staff aides spoke Tuesday, Bowman appeared on the ice
to promote a line of power fishing boats. One was in front of the
Islanders' bench, awaiting Bowman, while the Islanders stewed in
their dressing room, waiting to practice, their starting time
delayed by a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first instance of bad manners here lately.
Saturday, broadcaster John Davidson, the television analyst for
Rangers games on the MSG network and Fox, was ordered off the
players' bench during practice by one of the locker room's more
officious bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman's personality permeates this organization and this
building and so do the quirks of the Ilitch family, which owns the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Devellano, the senior vice-president and longtime Ilitch
confidante, has said that he and Bowman do not get along. They
rarely communicate.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, Mike Ilitch, has had heart surgery and difficulties
in his Little Caesars pizza empire. His wife, Marian, is getting
into the casino business. Mike Ilitch also owns the Detroit Tigers
and had difficulty arranging financing for a new baseball stadium,
now being built.
</P>
<P>
   Ilitch's daughter, Denise, is among the Wings names on the
Stanley Cup, although she holds no official title with the hockey
club. She represented her parents last week at the White House.
Considered the best and brightest of her generation of Ilitches,
Denise Ilitch helps run the pizza business. She used to be married
to Jim Lites, the president of the Dallas Stars, who have the best
record in the league this season and may dethrone Detroit in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   On sports radio here, the talk is hockey, hockey, hockey. Oh,
yes, the air is thick with intrigue.

ELIAS NEWMAN, 95, A PAINTER KNOWN FOR EXPRESSIVE LANDSCAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Md., Ga., Wash.)  (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elias Newman, a painter active in New York and Israel
and best known for his watercolor landscapes, died Tuesday at
Beekman Hospital in Manhattan. He was 95 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Newman was born in Poland in 1903 and immigrated with his family
to New York when he was 10. He studied for two years at the
National Academy of Design in Manhattan, then at the Educational
Alliance Art School on the Lower East Side, where he later taught.
Moses Soyer and Chaim Gross were among his classmates there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, Newman visited a brother who lived in Jerusalem. He
stayed in what was then called Palestine for two years, mingling
with local and emigre artists and painting the city and the
surrounding countryside, paying particular attention to the
astringent brilliance of desert light.
</P>
<P>
   He made many return trips, was active in art developments in the
new state of Israel, and exhibited in both Jersusalem and Tel-Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   After studying in Paris at the Academie Chaumiere in 1929, he
settled in Manhattan where he married Judith Tesser. They spent
summers on Cape Anne in Massachusetts, where Newman ran his own
seasonal art school at Rockport from 1951 to 1964. The subjects of
his paintings, in oil, gouache and encaustic as well as in
watercolor, alternated between New England landscapes and
expessionist-tinged biblical and Hebraic themes.
</P>
<P>
   He showed regularly at the Babcock Gallery in Manhattan, as well
as in Baltimore, Washington, Boston and Atlanta. His work is in
several museum collections in the United States and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's wife died in 1990. No immediate family members survive.

CIENFUERGOS ABSENT BECAUSE OF DISPUTE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Mauricio Cienfuegos, the Galaxy's midfield
wizard and marquee attraction, has not reported to the team's
training camp in Oxnard because of a contract dispute with Major
League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time MLS All-Star from El Salvador is set to earn
$103,000 this season, which is well short of the league maximum of
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos' agent, Cori Clemetson, said Tuesday that his client
wants to meet with MLS officials this week to discuss his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to speak with Sunil's (Gulati, MLS deputy
commissioner) representatives and try to work out a place and time
we can meet,'' Clemetson said. ``Right now Mauricio is training
three times a week with (Raul) Diaz Arce (also a holdout with San
Jose) in El Salvador. Mauricio has told me he would like to meet
with Sunil and the others himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulati is upset that Cienfuegos hasn't reported to training
camp. He said if he doesn't show up soon, he'll be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be suspended,'' if he doesn't report, Gulati said. ``He
won't get any more money by not showing up. At this point, I don't
talk to players about (re-negotiating) their contracts unless they
are working.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I'm under compensated too, but I don't stay home and
say `please send me more money.' The issue is, we have a lot of
players who believe they should make more money and we have a lot
of owners who are trying not to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Gazidis, senior vice president of player programs, said the
league was willing to talk to Clemetson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a fax a couple of weeks ago from Mauricio's agent
saying he believes his client is under compensated,'' Gazidis said.
``We asked them to send a proposal. We would consider any
reasonable proposal, but they never sent anything and we haven't
heard from them since.''
</P>
<P>
   `'That's not true,'' Clemetson said. ``I called them last Friday
to say we needed to set up a place and time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that Mauricio was paid a base salary of
90,000 last year and will get a 15-percent increase this year. He
feels that the contract is not fair or reasonable for what he's
done as a player or a spokesman. The league-announced maximum is
$250,000, but to our knowledge players are paid above that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has averaged more fans than any other MLS team in its
first three seasons (23,775 per game) and Cienfuegos feels he's a
big part of that. Clemetson said he doesn't see why Cienfuegos
should accept less than others who are earning the maximum and lack
his value to the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mauricio knows what he means to the L.A. market,'' Clemetson
said. ``Basically, Mauricio is asking for a figure above the league
announced maximum ($250,000) per year, which many players receive.
He feels he's earned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano did not want to get in the middle,
except to say he misses his playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I understand, the league wants to give him a raise
but not what he wants,'' Zambrano said. ``I don't want to get
beyond that. I'm not in the position to pick a side. I would like
to have him very much; he's an important part of our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one thing I know is that Mauricio is working out real hard
right now, that's just who he is. Not having him is more of a
psychological blow because he helps the other guys, but other than
that, I know he's taking care of himself physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos isn't the only thing on Zambrano's mind. During a
conference call from Oxnard, he talked about Sunday's college and
supplemental draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has the 10th, 13th, 22nd and 34th picks in the
college draft. It also has the first, 10th and 22nd picks in the
supplemental draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what we consider the starting 11 players in camp so
we're not looking for a bona fide impact player,'' Zambrano said.
``We need to provide some depth in the back and maybe beef up our
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft is not as plentiful as it has been before, but I
think we can pick up a couple of solid players.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Guatemala's Martin Machon bolted to the Mexican league,
Los Angeles is left with a foreign slot. Zambrano announced that
the Galaxy is ready to sign 17-year-old Ecuadorian Jaime Caicedo
Estupinan on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   Estupinan is a big midfield/defender who played on Ecuador's
U-17 and U-20 national teams. He plays in the Ecuadorian first
division with Roca Fuerte.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a player (who) I think has an incredible future,''
Zambrano said. ``With the money allocated to us, we couldn't go out
and find an experienced foreign player because he would command too
much money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaime will come here on a trial basis and then we'll have the
option to purchase his contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Another young prospect impressing Zambrano is 19-year-old
forward Marvin Quijano, who is trying out.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano, born in El Salvador, played for Rio Hondo College in
Whittier last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some great vibes and expectations about this kid,''
Zambrano said. ``He has come into camp and we can see he's a kid
with a future.''

provide some of the top story lines for the National Hot Rod
Association's 1999 season, which begins Thursday with first-round
qualifying for the 39th Winternationals at Pomona Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Force takes aim at an unprecedented ninth Funny Car championship
and Scelzi tries for a three-peat in Top Fuel. Both will be using
the new five-disc clutch, which some believe will allow for some of
the top performances in NHRA history.
</P>
<P>
   Force, winner of the past six Funny Car titles, comes into the
season favored to make it seven straight. But Ron Capps is one of
several who will try to knock the Bell Gardens native off his
pedestal. Capps drives for Funny Car legend Don ``The Snake''
Prudhomme.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are we going to beat Force? Maybe flaten his tires,'' said
Capps, who won a series-high five races in 1998 and finished a
close second to Force in points. ``Seriously. We just have to
eliminate the mistakes and run more consistently. We won more races
then anyone else (in 1998), but John was more consistent. What cost
us the championship was that we had too many first-round losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to win rounds. The key to this thing is to do the
best you can when things aren't going your way. When you're having
your problems, you have to find a way to win a couple rounds and
get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   Force and Capps are just two who figure prominently in what
could be the closest competition in the 25-year history of Winston
drag racing. Others include brothers Cruz and Tony Pedregon, Whit
Bazemore and veteran Al Hofmann.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Pedregon, driver of the Joe Gibbs-owned Pontiac Firebird,
scored 12 poles and won four events in 1998. He also reset the
national elapsed time record three times en route to finishing
third in points.
</P>
<P>
   Bazemore, who finished fifth in points, made the biggest news in
the off-season, signing to drive for rival Chuck Etchells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really going to be exciting,'' Capps said. ``My
predictions are that you are really going to have to run consistent
low 4.80s this year at the tracks with good altitude and cool
weather, because if you don't, you are going to be in the second
half of the field in qualifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Darkhorses for the championship include former International Hot
Rod Association Pro Modified champion Scotty Cannon, who has
already run as quick as 4.97 in preseason testing, and the Jim
Dunn-owned Dodge Avenger that will begin the season piloted by
Frank Pedregon.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest of the Pedregon brothers, Frank is serving as
substitute driver for Kelly Magrath, who is suffering from a
recurring eye injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Cannon) is going to be tough,'' Capps said. ``A
Pro-Mod is the toughest car to drive, and he kicked their butts,
then told them about it. He'll talk trash, but he's a smart
cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Royal Oak High School graduate Randy Anderson has secured
sponsorship for the first two races and should be a factor this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Scelzi is the two-time defending champion in Top Fuel. Scelzi,
driver of the Alan Johnson-owned Team Winston dragster, has a
higher winning percentage then Force, securing victories in 11
victories over the past two seasons. He also owns national records
in elapsed time (4.525) and speed (326.44 mph).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been more excited to start a season,''
said Scelzi, who advanced to seven final rounds and 14 semifinals
in 1998. ``The competition out here is intense. Last season, it
looked like Cory (McClenathan) would run away with the Winston
championship. I know that the other Top Fuels are extremely gifted
with good drivers. I also know that consistency wins championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that as hard as all these teams are working to beat us,
we're working just as hard to stay ahead of them and stay
consistent. Next November, we'll find out who worked the hardest
and most effectively in the offseason. As good as all the teams
were last year, there were still only six different winners. So
again, it comes down to who can win the most rounds and events, and
that takes consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what McClenathan is hoping for. The driver of the Joe
Gibbs entry won six events last season, but faltered enough during
the summer months to allow Scelzi to slip past him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Scelzi has fallen off,'' said McClenathan, who
has finished second four times. ``He's as tough as ever. Our
challenge is to step up and challenge him. We have to rise to the
occasion. Hopefully, we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teams in the mix are five-time champion Joe Amato, who
finished third last season, and La Mirada native Mike Dunn, who
despite not winning an event in 1998 finished fourth in points.
</P>
<P>
   The big breakthrough in both Top Fuel and Funny Car could be the
new five-disc clutch that most teams will use in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how much of a difference it makes,'' McClenathan
said. ``With the four-disc, about three-quarters down the track, it
would crumple down and blow the tires (lose traction) away on
marginal tracks and kill the motor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get the RPMs and the clutch to come together (at
the same time on the race track). With the five-disc, it makes that
transition much smoother. It doesn't seem to smoke the tires, which
will enable you to run more horsepower and go for incredible
(elapsed times) and mph. I wouldn't be surprised if you see a 330
(mph).''
</P>
<P>
   The bar has also been raised in the Pro Stock class, where
defending champion Warren Johnson is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the number on his car that everyone wants, so he's
still the guy everyone will be shooting for,'' said Jeg Coughlin,
who finished second last season. ``It's going to be very tough to
win the championship this season. NHRA Pro Stock racing is
extremely competitive from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be consistent in qualifying and racing and have
a little luck along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Others to watch include former two-time champion Jim Yates, Kirk
Johnson and Mike Thomas, who broke the 200-mph barrier during
testing last week.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Stock Motorcycle, which begins its 14-race schedule at the
Gatornationals in early March, is once again expected to be a
two-bike show.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending champion Matt Hines, who tied a series record
with 10 wins in 1998, is the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   But the Whittier native will see a strong challenge from Angelle
Seeling, who posted three victories in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Larry Kopp is the favorite in Pro Stock
Truck, which is beginning its second season.

ANTLEY COMING BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ Veteran jockey Chris Antley, idle since
December 1997 because of personal problems, will resume his riding
career Wednesday at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   Antley is named on two horses _ Cherry Moon in the second race
and A Lady From Dixie in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran jockeys' agent Ron Anderson, who represents Gary
Stevens, will also handle book for the 32-year-old Antley, who won
the 1991 Kentucky Derby aboard Strike The Gold and experienced
success on the Southland circuit earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a friend who's been around racing for 25 years who
tells me that, when Chris is on his game, he's definitely one of
the 10 best jockeys ever and, possibly, one of the top five,''
Anderson said. ``We're talking about guys like Angel Cordero and
Laffit (Pincay).''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Antley's weight had become a problem, that he
weighed 130-plus pounds during last summer's Del Mar meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Anderson, Antley went to live with his father
in South Carolina, began a low-carbohydrate diet and is down to
110-112 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks tremendous,'' Anderson said. ``He was running a lot,
and he says now he feels like he's 17 again. He's ready to move
forward with his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he's so light tells me he's ready to ride, both
physically and mentally. Otherwise, he wouldn't be this light.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said it will not take a jockey with Antley's reputation
long to re-establish his business in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not gonna be tough to sell, at all,'' Anderson said.
``He's got a great reputation and, when people see him, they'll
know he's ready to ride. In a few weeks' time, he's going to be
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Antley already has picked up one stakes mount. He'll be aboard
the Ian Jory-trained Fabulous Guy in Saturday's $150,000 Turf
Paradise Breeders' Cup at Turf Paradise in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson joins the ranks of jockey agents who represent two
high-profile clients. Scott McClellan handles book for Alex Solis,
who leads the Santa Anita jockey standings, and Chris McCarron. Bob
Meldahl represents Corey Nakatani and Pincay, and Tony Matos is
hooked up with Kent Desormeaux and Victor Espinoza.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson expects Antley to pick up mounts Stevens passes on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's at a point in his career where he's not gonna ride in a
lot of the cheap races anymore,'' Anderson said. ``With all the big
races he rides, why take a chance on getting injured and jeopardize
things?
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris can fill in some of the voids. The Derby-type
3-year-olds that Gary can't ride, Chris will have the opportunity
to pick up some of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the highly competitive local jockey colony, already
the strongest in the world, just got stronger.

 Upgrading Your Phone System  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  What are the options for small businesses that want to
upgrade from voice mail to an integrated phone system with up to
five lines? Pac Bell's Centrex system and other proprietary systems
that offer the features we want seem to charge about $2,500 and up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Small companies your size have the toughest problem
because the bigger the system, the more you get for your money,
says consultant Janice McKevitt, founder of TeleContractors Inc. in
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping from a cheap voice mail system to a broader function
system for a small business will cost over $2,000 in most cases,
although you can buy a ``VoysConnect'' mini-PBX system for $1,749
from catalog and online phone products company Hello Direct. The
system includes a number of features like ``auto attendant,''
off-site notification by pager and message routing.
</P>
<P>
   But before you buy an off-the-shelf system, you better check out
installation, upgrade potential, Y2K compliance and especially
customer support and equipment maintenance. ``I would be hesitant
to consider any system out of a catalog,'' said McKevitt. ``There
are too many unknowns.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the choice is between buying a system or just buying
the service.
</P>
<P>
   With NEC, for example, you acquire the equipment, have it at
your business site and can depreciate it over time as a business
expense. NEC Electra Professional Level 1 offers a six-line system
that costs about $2,100 with another $2,400 for voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   With Centrex, which is operated by Pac Bell at its own
facilities, McKevitt says a five-line system costs about $525 to
install (assuming wiring already exists) plus a monthly service
charge of about $250 plus usage. For voice mail there is a $200
one-time initiation fee plus $15 per line fee each month to forward
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing up, you might check vendor Web sites or talk to a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Business Planning
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are a small nonprofit organization that plans to open a
day care center. Can you suggest where we can find assistance in
preparing a business plan and what this might cost?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: It's a good start to know you need a business plan!
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco small-business consultant Paul Terry says that
nonprofits, which generally must use contributions for their
programs, are increasingly setting up money-making ventures to
finance capital improvements and other developments. Nonprofits
also can set up such ventures to train and create jobs for their
target audience, like unemployed moms, and also to generate
favorable publicity and more contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, it is important that the business activity
be related to your main mission so you do not jeopardize your
nonprofit status.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW03 (19019 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Terry suggests that you should probably do a feasibility study
before embarking on a full-blown business plan. Does a day care
center fit with your mission and your capability? On the flip side,
does the marketplace need, and can it support, such a center?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonprofits often figure that they will start a business and
the unrestricted income will be great,'' says Terry. But it doesn't
always work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   Terry says that it might cost $3,000 to $5,000 for a feasibility
study by a professional consultant and $5,000 to $8,000 for a
business plan. You also might pay a consultant on an hourly basis
to review your plans. In either case, Terry says you need to
appoint a business manager or someone else to ``take ownership'' of
the process and work with the consultant and/or write the plan.
</P>
<P>
   For free help, call your local office of the Service Corps of
Retired Executives or Small Business Development Center. Other
helpful nonprofit organizations in San Francisco include the
Management Center, Keystone Community Ventures and Support Center
for Nonprofit Management ( &LR; www.supportcenter.org/sf) &LR; , &LR;   &LR; which
offers both workshops and consultants who work on a sliding scale.
</P>
<P>
   Web-Wise Words
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your story last week featured some e-commerce success
stories. Can you offer any tips to other entrepreneurs who want to
launch online businesses?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: The founders of Flycast Inc., the leading online
advertising agency have some pointers. Rick Thompson and Larry
Braitman, who founded the San Francisco company three years ago
to &UR;  &LR; let Web advertisers and Web publishers use an automated system
to set ad rates, suggest:
</P>
<P>
   _Get to market as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't take anything for granted when it comes to raising money.
``The deal is not done until the papers are signed.''
</P>
<P>
   _Hire smart and hungry people. ``If you have to make a choice in
the Web market between hiring someone who is bright versus someone
who has a lot of experience, hire the former.''
</P>
<P>
   _Be willing and able to adapt to the changing market. ``There is
no linear path in this business.''

 Why SportsLine USA's Stock Managed to Swim Against the Tide  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sometimes it pays to monitor your favorite stocks on days that
management is extolling their virtues to the Street. You never know
when shares might get a short-term lift, or take a quick hit.
</P>
<P>
   On a day that the Nasdaq composite index closed down nearly 47
points, or almost 2 percent, SportsLine USA managed to swim against
the tide and close yesterday at $37.13, up almost $3 from the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, SportsLine stock hit its highest mark in a year.
</P>
<P>
   So, what triggered this rapid run-up?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, it appears that myriad money managers and other
institutional investors attending the NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities technology stock conference here in San Francisco liked
the spiel they heard from SportsLine CEO Michael Levy.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of yesterday morning, SportsLine shares were
trading sideways around $33. But shortly after Levy's presentation
at the stock confab, the shares shot up to about $35.80 before
going on to finish the trading session by gaining another buck plus
change.
</P>
<P>
   What got the testosterone-filled room (more than 90 percent of
the managers listening were men) all fired up isn't so clear.
Levy's remarks contained the usual boilerplate sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive talked up the value of the company's
partnerships with broadcasting giant CBS and Internet darling
American Online. Other talking points focused on the Web site's
ability to reach a young, predominantly male audience that
advertisers covet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in today's eternally optimistic market, that's all it takes
when investors have cash burning holes in their pockets. Of course,
interesting nuggets of financial data or other valuable tidbits
have been known to dribble out of private sessions following the
presentations (called breakouts), but that couldn't have been the
case this time around. SportsLine's breakout session wasn't
scheduled until well after the market's final bell.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Wall Street's sell-side analysts haven't been
overwhelmingly thrilled by SportsLine's short-term prospects. Of
the nine analysts that follow the stock, according to Zack's
Financial Research, five of them recommend that shareholders
``hold''_ which is about as close as this usually forgiving lot
comes to telling investors to ``sell.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; A DIFFERENT DRUMMER: &LR;  Late last year, a spate of layoffs and
financial cutbacks swept through the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's at least one stock brokerage that is bucking
the trend and actually expanding in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Jones, an iconoclastic firm in St. Louis that focuses on
individual investors, plans to grow its Northern California office
base by about 20 percent, or 30 new offices, says managing
principal John Bachmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has a lot of investors. We need the visibility, and
we need the market share because all of our competitors are
becoming giants,'' Bachmann explains.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't going slowly. Last year, in a region stretching from
Monterey to Redding, Edward Jones opened about 45 offices, bringing
its Northern California total to 150. Nationwide, Jones has more
than 4,300 offices and is opening about 200 new outlets a month.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, because of Edward Jones' rather conservative
buy-and-hold philosophy and one-on-one approach, many of its
offices employ only a single stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our clients to buy good companies and keep them for a
long time,'' Bachmann says. ``We're horrified by the number of
uninformed people trading on the Internet. We think it will be a
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like Edward Jones won't be hosting any Internet stock
conferences any time soon.

 Venture Capitalists Love E-Commerce  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Stock market investors are not the only ones pouring money into
online commerce. So are venture capital firms.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capitalists pumped a record $12.2 billion
into private companies with bright prospects nationwide, including
$4.2 billion in the Bay Area, according to VentureOne, a San
Francisco research firm. Those figures were up 13 percent and 17
percent, respectively, from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winners were companies peddling products and
services online. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _Healtheon Corp., the Santa Clara company started by Netscape
Communications founder Jim Clark to handle health care information
and benefits over the Internet, raised $46 million in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   _NextCard, the San Francisco Internet credit card issuer started
by former Providian Bancorp Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Lent
raised $38.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   _InsWeb Corp., the Redwood City company started by insurance
industry expert Hussein Enan and Silicon Valley veteran Darrell
Ticehurst, raised $30 million to expand its online insurance
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Four other local companies raised $25 million each, including
SaveSmart. The Mountain View company headed by Ashok Narasimhan,
former vice president of product development at VeriFone, delivers
merchant promotions to consumers as they search the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers show that Internet-related companies remain the
strongest space for private as well as public investors,'' said
Jack Wilson, editorial director for Technologic Partners.
</P>
<P>
   In the past quarter, 145 Bay Area companies received $1 billion
in private equity financing, according to VentureOne. As usual,
information technology was the leading category, with 108 such
firms receiving $715 million, or 71 percent of the total. By
contrast, 435 firms received $3.2 billion in &LR;   &LR; the fourth quarter
nationwide, with 256 information technology startups receiving 65
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VENTURE0 (62933 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although Internet-related IPOs went public at record valuations
last year, typically trading at a multiple of their offering price,
the number of venture-backed companies that went public in 1998
fell precipitously. VentureOne reports there were only 77 such IPOs
last year compared to 135 the year before and 232 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the drop was stock market skittishness
about high-tech and small-cap companies last summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bright spots, however, were Internet companies.
VentureOne said they accounted for more than 30 percent of venture
capital-backed initial public offerings last year, compared to the
previous high of 12 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Partly due to the lag in IPOs, ``some venture capital firms have
shifted from early stage to later stage investments,'' said Rolf
Selvig, business development director at VentureOne. ``As a result,
you're seeing fewer deals with larger dollar investments.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Healtheon raised $46 million in private financing
after postponing plans for a $51 million initial stock offering
last October. But now with the rebound in the market for new
issues, the company last month renewed plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   One of Healtheon's VC backers, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers,
also has a stake in NextCard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think NextCard has a very big market opportunity,'' said
Kleiner Perkins partner Russ Siegelman. ``They take unique
advantage of the Web to let consumers instantly order and be
confirmed for a new credit card.''
</P>
<P>
   NextCard CEO Jeremy Lent, 38, helped his previous employer,
Providian Bancorp, launch its $1 billion IPO and could have similar
designs for his 3-year-old startup. NextCard markets exclusively
over the Internet and uses data mining techniques to target the
most profitable potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of VENTURE0 (62933 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The company has quickly become a top 20 online advertiser and
says it has captured as much as 20 percent of the market for online
credit card applications in just nine months. When you apply for a

 Jackson Joins Digital Divide Job Groups  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Two Bay Area community groups that have been pressing Silicon
Valley firms to hire more blacks and Latinos have picked up an
influential new ally _ the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Wing, a representative from Jackson's PUSH/Rainbow
Coalition, will join the Greenlining Coalition and the Coalition
for Fair Employment in Silicon Valley in a meeting tonight in San
Francisco with Shirley J. Wilcher, deputy assistant U.S. secretary
of labor.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the line, Jackson wants to meet with Silicon Valley
CEOs to discuss employment and recruiting practices that have led
to a disproportionately low percentage of black and Latino workers
in high-tech, said Wing, coordinator for PUSH/ Rainbow Coalition
activities in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're laying the groundwork for more focused activities,''
Wing said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was traveling yesterday and was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said Jackson wants to build on the coalition's Wall Street
Project, a year-old effort to get large public companies to hire
more minorities. In January, more than 700 people _ including
President Clinton, three Cabinet officers and the chairmen of AT&AMP;T
and Citigroup _ attended a Wall Street project conference in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jesse Jackson has done on Wall Street, he can do in
Silicon Valley, and easier,'' said Bob Gnaizda, general counsel for
the Greenlining Institute, a San Francisco consumer-advocacy
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenlining Institute and the Coalition for Fair Employment
in Silicon Valley are meeting with Wilcher to discuss issues
highlighted in a Chronicle report published last year titled
``Digital Divide.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of DIGITAL0 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The investigation showed that 33 leading Silicon Valley firms had
Bay Area workforces that were about 4 percent black and 7 percent
Latino, even though blacks and Latinos made up 8 percent and 14
percent of the labor force, respectively. And blacks and Latinos
were far more likely to hold factory, service and support jobs than
managerial or professional positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition joins with you, the Congressional
Black Caucus and other community-based groups, to work to find
solutions to close, and not widen, the Digital Divide in the
Silicon Valley,'' Jackson said in a January 29 letter to the
Coalition for Fair Employment.
</P>
<P>
   Wing said Jackson also sent a January 4 letter to
Hewlett-Packard Co. CEO Louis Platt asking for a meeting with him
and other industry leaders to discuss issues such as diversity,
education and job training.
</P>
<P>
   John Templeton, founder of the Coalition for Fair Employment,
authored a report that said the vast majority of Silicon Valley
technology firms were not filing required diversity reports with
the U.S. Labor Department and that black and Latino workers stood
to lose millions of dollars in wages if those firms did not change
their recruiting, hiring and marketing practices within minority
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton hopes that pressure from the Labor Department and from
the Rainbow Coalition will eventually force Silicon Valley to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Wing and representatives from the Greenlining Institute and the
coalition will meet privately with Wilcher at 5 p.m. and then will
attend an annual scholarship dinner hosted by the Bay Area chapter
of the National Black MBA Association at the Delancey Street
Restaurant.

 Shaman Quits The Drug Business  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
After spending more than $90 million in 10 years, Shaman
Pharmaceuticals quit the drug business this week in a desperate bid
to reinvent itself in the more loosely regulated field of herbal
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman, which is in South San Francisco, had built its
reputation on its unusual approach to drug development: It scoured
the rain forest to seek new drugs from common folk remedies and
promised to share some profits with the native people who found the
herbs.
</P>
<P>
   But those good intentions came to naught Monday when the
money-losing firm laid off 60 people _ two-thirds of its staff _
after deciding it couldn't afford to meet Food and Drug
Administration requirements that it do more tests of a proposed
drug to treat diarrhea in AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   Shaman chief executive Lisa Conte said yesterday the company now
plans to stretch its roughly $13 million in cash by creating a new,
wholly owned private company, Shaman Botanicals. It will have just
two dozen people on the payroll, as opposed to about 90.
</P>
<P>
   The new private firm will continue looking for rain-forest herbs
but with one huge difference _ Shaman Botanicals &UR;  &LR; won't sell drugs,
but rather herbal remedies, a distinction that exempts its products
from the rigorous pharmaceutical-review process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have an opportunity to pull this company out and make
a good return for our shareholders,'' said Conte, who had raised
$7.2 million in December from private investors, including
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Conte will be second in command of the new company, which is
being led by interim chief executive Loren Israelsen. A veteran
herbal marketer, Israelsen knows the fine print of the 1994 law
that created rules that make it easy to get herbal products on the
market within months, as opposed to the years involved in drug
approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Israelsen said Shaman Botanicals hopes to start commercial sales
within 12 to 18 months of two products, one to relieve diarrhea and
the other a salve for herpes. Both of these prospective herbal
remedies are derived from the same Latin American plant, the
croton, which was the basis of Shaman's AIDS diarrhea drug that
foundered due to FDA objections.
</P>
<P>
   Although Conte and Israelsen put the best face on their plan,
industry watchers wondered what went wrong with Shaman's
pharmaceutical business. Cynthia Robbins-Roth, principal of
BioVenture Consulting in San Mateo, said Shaman had some of the
best scientific brains in biotech, like former Stanford Professor
Gerald Reaven, who had headed Shaman's effort to develop drugs to
treat obesity and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaman is a classic example of why pharmaceutical
(development) is such a risky business,'' Robbins-Roth said. ``You
can spend years only to find out the FDA doesn't think your product
works.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, who followed Shaman for Dakin Securities in San
Francisco, said an FDA committee caught the company by surprise
last week by objecting to the tests Shaman used to prove that its
proposed Provir drug alleviated the symptoms of AIDS diarrhea. That
dashed Shaman's hoped to get FDA approval to sell Provir this year
and forced its change in business plans.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant said Shaman will try to salvage something from its 10
years of drug discovery by selling rights to its Provir and
diabetes research, but he questioned whether closing its
pharmaceutical business signals buyers that it lacked confidence in
those efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Conte, who has portrayed Shaman as an ethical company for
promising to share its future profits with people in the rain
forest, defended herself yesterday for accepting stock options for
1.5 million shares at the same shareholders meeting where the firm
announced that it would lay off its drug research staff.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SHAMAN03 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Conte said the options vote was scheduled months ago when the
company's prospects looked brighter. She said the major
shareholders, who approved the company's recent changes were
``supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaman was delisted by the Nasdaq yesterday and now will trade
on the Nasdaq bulletin board, an over-the-counter list. Its shares
lost 9.6 cents to close at 31 cents yesterday after tumbling by
more than half on Monday.

 Gymboree Hires Marketing Whiz To Balance Out Seesawing Sales  &HT;       
 By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Gymboree Corp. has hired a seasoned merchandising veteran to help
the maker of children's wear improve its erratic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree, headquartered in Burlingame, said yesterday that
Melanie Cox, the former general merchandise manager of Urban
Outfitters of Philadelphia, has been named president. She will be
responsible for product development, brand management and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Gary White, who had been chief executive and president, remains
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, what they have needed to do is bring in a strong
merchant to lead the company,'' said Helen Bulwik, director of
global retailing for Andersen Consulting. ``That has been their
greatest weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's former employer, Urban Outfitters, is a successful chain
of apparel and home-fashion stores catering to teens and
twentysomethings. She declined to be interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   During several quarters since 1996, Gymboree has had difficulty
maintaining proper inventory levels. Most recently, the company
overestimated the amount of inventory it needed for the third
quarter of 1998, resulting in markdowns, White said. But stock
levels were back on track in the fourth quarter, which ended
January 31, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White said sales of clothing for girls and newborns is healthy
but ``has not been as good in the boy area.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree posted a net loss of $273,000 in the third quarter as
sales at mature stores declined. Selling, general and
administrative expenses jumped to 37 percent of net sales from 29
percent in the third quarter of 1997. Fourth-quarter results have
not been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree's erratic performance has hurt investor confidence,
sending the retailer's stock down. Gymboree's stock closed at $8.63
yesterday, up 38 cents. Shares, which hit $37 in August 1995, fell
to a low of $4.06 in October.
</P>
<P>
   Executive turnover also has been a problem. Chief Financial
Officer Mary Shephard resigned in May after just three months on
the job. The former head merchant, Mindy Meads, left in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree plans to open between 40 and 50 stores this year, down
from about 130 last year. It recently decided to postpone entry
into Japan because of economic problems there and ``because we
wanted to focus on our core business in the United States,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulwik said that's a good idea. ``I think you always want to
make sure that your core business is secure and growing before you
venture off into other areas,'' she said. ``Expansion for the sake
of expansion tends not to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Gymboree operates 525 stores in the United States and 39 in
Canada and Europe. White said he believes that there is room for
between 600 and 700 Gymborees in the United States. The company
also operates 400 developmental play centers and a Web site
 &LR; (www.gymboree.com). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gymboree is working to open its first Zutopia stores
for children ages 6 to 12 _ a fickle, media-influenced age group
considered more difficult to create fashions for than smaller kids.
The Gymboree chain serves newborns through age 7, though the bulk
of its business is under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Cox might have insights into the youth market through her
experience at Urban Outfitters and, earlier in her career, at the
trendy Wet Seal chain, said one Gymboree observer.

 Chevron, Arco Will Pool West Texas Oil Operations  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Responding to low oil prices, Chevron and Arco said yesterday they
will combine oil operations in the historic Permian Basin region of
West Texas, creating a company with annual revenues of $700 million
and oil reserves worth $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The move caps months of rumors that Chevron intended to shut
down some of its operations in West Texas, where low petroleum
prices have idled thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the joint venture will enable them to
profitably operate more than 7,000 wells on 150 oil fields in the
area that achieved fame in May 1923 with a gusher named for Santa
Rita, patron saint of those who attempt the impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, West Texas largely had been overlooked by drillers
because its varied soils and terrain gave no hint that it sat atop
an ancient sea bed, dating from the Permian Age 200 million years
ago, containing immense amounts of oil. The oil boom of the late
1920s did to the cattle town of Midland what the Gold Rush did to
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture company, to be named by Arco and Chevron in
coming weeks and headquartered in Midland, will assume a workforce
of 850, &UR;  &LR; roughly 170 of whom will be cut. Future profits from
Permian operations will be split, 50-50, between Chevron and Arco
stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of overlapping production,'' said Tom Holland,
Arco spokesman in Midland. ``The value to shareholders is we can
generate more cash for stockholders, combined, than separate.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to form a joint venture came after internal
evaluations by each firm of what should be done with mature Permian
Basin assets. Both companies concluded that partnering with another
firm _ as Shell and Amoco already have done with their Altura joint
venture _ made the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what we'd have done in the old days,'' said Arco's
Holland. ``As assets got depleted, they got sold to smaller
companies. But we've both gotten costs under control, so we now can
manage smaller wells.''
</P>
<P>
   Though greatly depleted today, the Permian Basin still produces
1.2 million barrels of oil a day, or more than either Alaska's
North Slope or the Gulf Coast. It accounts for 20 percent of all
U.S. petroleum reserves and 78 percent of all Texas reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Arco and Chevron have 600 million barrels of oil left
in the ground there, they estimate, in a patchwork of neighboring
fields in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Although both companies have been regarded as potential merger
partners, Chevron spokesman Glenn Weaver said the joint venture
should not be taken as a harbinger of a bigger deal ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular deal was not part of any larger discussions,''
Weaver said.

 3Com Names New Head For Its Palm Division  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
3Com Corp. named industry veteran Robin Abrams to head up its Palm
Computing division yesterday, fortifying the maker of the PalmPilot
as it tries to stay ahead of Microsoft in the market for handheld
computing devices.
</P>
<P>
   The PalmPilot and its successor, the Palm III, have become the
standard for a new kind of personal organizer that fits in a shirt
pocket and lets you easily keep track of phone numbers, addresses
and appointments. More than 2.5 million of the devices have been
sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has its sights set on the fast-growing market. The
Redmond, Wash., software powerhouse introduced a version of its
Windows CE operating system for ``palmtop'' devices last spring.
And just last month, it unveiled a color version of the software,
upping the ante against Palm Computing, whose devices display in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``3Com absolutely needs a strong person at the top of the Palm
division because they've got a very vital and well-funded
competitor in Microsoft,'' said Dataquest analyst Scott Miller.
``Microsoft has an opportunity to steal the agenda from Palm, which
needs to keep control of where this industry is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, 47, comes to 3Com of Santa Clara from VeriFone, a
Hewlett-Packard unit that makes computers for validating credit and
debit-card purchases. She worked there for nearly two years and has
been chief executive since last April. Prior to that, she served
for five years at Apple Computer, where she oversaw the company's
business operations in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   She was credited with holding together Apple's relationship with
its dealers at a time when the company was rapidly losing market
share. She quit in 1997, joining a number of other top managers who
fled the then-troubled company.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams will join 3Com on February 12 as president of Palm
Computing and senior vice president for 3Com, reporting to company
President Bruce Claflin.
</P>
<P>
   Her appointment fills a void created in November, when Palm
Computing's founders _ President Donna Dubinsky and Jeff Hawkins,
vice president for advanced development _ quit to start a firm that
will develop products based on Palm technology. 3Com Senior Vice
President Janice Roberts has been acting president of the
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' challenge will be to keep Microsoft at bay while
strengthening the Palm franchise, which has been a pivotal
moneymaker for 3Com since it acquired the business as part of its
$8.5 billion purchase of U.S. Robotics early in 1997. Last year,
sales of the PalmPilot and Palm III generated revenue of more than
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the industry has now acknowledged that the PalmPilot
is the fastest-growing consumer product in history, and I want to
take it to its next phase,'' Abrams said in explaining her decision
to take the job.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 3Com is more than holding its own against Microsoft _
largely because early versions of the CE devices have performed
poorly in comparison with the PalmPilot and Palm III. One survey by
PC Data showed the Palm products outselling CE devices by a margin
of 5 to 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PALM03 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  However, Microsoft has a knack for improving its products until
they're as good as anyone else's, and the rivalry between 3Com and
Microsoft is only going to get more intense.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen computer and electronics companies are readying
Palm-size devices based on the colorized Windows CE. And Palm
Computing is putting the finishing touches on a new device, the
Palm VII, that will provide users with wireless Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Tim Bajarin, who knew Abrams when she was at Apple,
said, ``There's no question in my mind that she's capable of
managing the Palm division.'' Yet he added that she's going to have
her hands full. ``They've had the market to themselves for two
years, and that game's over.''

YEARS AFTER TORTURE, A CRY AGAINST PINOCHET
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Note contents.) 
(bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Luz de Las Nieves Ayress was first arrested by the
police of the Chilean government as a 25-year-old graduate student,
in the fall of 1973, shortly after Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized
power.
</P>
<P>
   The first time they arrested her, Ms. Ayress said, they tortured
her with electrical currents, stripping her naked and applying
electrodes to her mouth, ears, breasts, vagina and anus. That was
``the easy part,'' Ms. Ayress said. Electroshock they did to
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Ms. Ayress was arrested, she said, she was raped
repeatedly, forced to watch the torture of her father and
15-year-old brother, and slashed on the stomach and breasts. She
spent four years in prison, three months of which she was in
solitary confinement. She was sexually assaulted by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayress' sworn statement has been sent to London, where
Pinochet has been detained. Amnesty International said such torture
was pervasive in Chile under his regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite common,'' said Carlos Salinas, the group's advocacy
director for Latin America. Although he was not familiar with Ms.
Ayress' case file, he said her account is consistent with thousands
of others.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, while undergoing medical treatment in Great
Britain, Pinochet, now 83, was arrested on charges of torture and
hostage-taking during his 17-year regime, on a warrant issued by a
Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayress, who provided her statement at the judge's request,
is also among 50 Chilean victims who filed a request with Attorney
General Janet Reno in October, seeking Pinochet's extradition to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   How did Ms. Ayress survive?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sing,'' Ms. Ayress said, in Spanish. ``I would talk to
myself, talk to the door, talk to the window, talk to the wall. I
had to eat the way dogs eat. I couldn't use my hands, I couldn't
stand, my shoulder was broken. ''
</P>
<P>
   She tries to clarify, gesturing, an animal on all fours, eating
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would eat like a dog and I would create a character with the
plate. Or sing loudly so the other women could hear. When people
were listening to me talk, they would think I was crazy. People
would ask who I was talking to. I would say, to the door, or the
window. Human beings are so interesting to create a defense
mechanism in moments like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayress, 50, does not smile often, but when she does, it is
such a small, sad smile that it should be called something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was little, I used to read about the adventures of
Super Raton _ Mighty Mouse,'' said Ms. Ayress, recalling the
cartoon character who arrived singing, to save to the day. ``I
thought maybe Super Raton would come and get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Ms. Ayress describe electroshock torture?
</P>
<P>
   The smile that is not a smile again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you never put your finger near an outlet and had an
electrical shock?'' Ms. Ayress asks. ``Imagine that, a thousand
times worse. There is a sense of desperation. Your hands are
cuffed, your mouth dries up. You get very thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayress was born in Santiago. Her father owned a medical
supply factory, but he was middle class, Ms. Ayress stresses, not
rich. More important to Ms. Ayress was her political heritage. Her
grandfather, Ms. Ayress said, founded Mutuales, the first
revolutionary movement in Chile. Her parents supported the rights
of women and workers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 11, 1973, Pinochet led a coup d'etat that resulted in
the overthrow of President Salvador Allende Gossens. In the
following years, thousands were tortured and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayress, who had supported Allende, was studying journalism
and child education, and working to feed poor children, when she
was first arrested. She said she was taken to a soccer stadium that
had been turned into a prison, held for a week, tortured and asked
``ridiculous'' questions: Where are the weapons? What do you know
about the submarines?
</P>
<P>
   A few months later she was arrested again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the torture against women was the sexual
kind _ they figured it was the way to break us,'' Ms. Ayress said,
reciting her experiences in the matter-of-fact way of one who has
told a terrible story many times.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Ms. Ayress' story continues, sometimes she cries.
</P>
<P>
   She describes being vaginally penetrated with bottles and
sticks. She said that she became pregnant after being raped and was
told she should be honored to be carrying ``a child of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, they let my mother visit me for five minutes,'' Ms.
Ayress said. ``She asked me to tell her what had happened. My
mother was very strong but when I told her I was pregnant she
cried. She said, `What's the use of living if I can't defend my
own?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ayress miscarried in prison. Later, after marrying, she had
a daughter, who is now an 18-year-old college student.
</P>
<P>
   Separated from her husband, Ms. Ayress makes her living as a
baby sitter, while serving as co-founder and director of the Vamos
a La Pena de El Bronx cultural center.
</P>
<P>
   As for the extradition request Ms. Ayress and her group made to
Ms. Reno, it took three months for a reply, from an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``As related events unfold,'' the letter read, ``please be
assured that all options which reasonably may be open to us are
being assessed.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ President Clinton sandwiched in an education
announcement between fund-raising meals of imported sea bass with
big Democratic Party donors Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared at an elementary school in the working-class
Brighton section of Boston on Tuesday afternoon to draw attention
to a previously announced education proposal to turn around failing
schools. The president said Tuesday he was asking Congress to
approve the use of $200 million in federal education aid to reward
school districts that take steps to improve or close declining
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the school appearance, Clinton spoke to party
donors in Boston and New York who paid $10,000 a person to attend
the fund-raising events for the Democratic National Committee.
White House officials said the lunch and dinner, which were
expected to raise $1.7 million, were the first fund-raisers the
president has attended since he was impeached in December.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's education proposal is part of a broader administration
plan to use the incentive of federal money to bring greater
accountability to local school districts. Schools will be required
to end ``social promotion,'' the practice of moving students from
grade to grade even if they have not mastered the material. Clinton
wants assurances that teachers are qualified to teach their
subjects. School districts that fail to adopt these policies risk
losing their federal education grants.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has drawn criticism from Republicans, who call it an
example of unwarranted federal meddling in local affairs.
Republicans tend to prefer federal education money to be returned
to states and cities in the form of block grants with few strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about more than money,'' Clinton said at Jackson Mann
Elementary School in Boston. ``Some people argue that the federal
government has no business whatsoever holding school districts
accountable for results.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he disagreed, and said he intended to use
some of the $15 billion in federal school aid to encourage policies
that work and end support for failing programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen billion dollars is not chump change,'' Clinton said.
``It's real money and it can make a real difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser, said
that 19 states already had programs in place to rescue failing
schools. He defended the federal role in encouraging such efforts
against Republican criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to have that debate,'' Reed told reporters aboard
Air Force One en route to Boston. ``If anyone in Congress wants to
step over and say continuing social promotion ought to be a local
option, that having unqualified teachers ought to be a local
option, or that ignoring failing schools ought to be a local
option, we challenge them to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Before visiting the school, Clinton spoke at an early afternoon
luncheon and reception at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel, using the
occasion to review themes raised in the State of the Union message
and in his budget submission to Congress. He boasted that his plan
to reserve most of the ballooning federal budget surpluses for
Social Security and Medicare over the next 15 years would have the
effect of reducing the national debt to the lowest level since
1917.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody had come before you in 1992 and said, `Vote for me
for president, in a few years we'll be paying down the national
debt,' you would have given them a quick exit home,'' Clinton told
the party contributors. ``You'd have thought, that guy's been, you
know, chewing on funny reeds or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The guests were served salad, sea bass and mascarpone pastry
with strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   The New York fund-raiser was held in a second-floor dining room
at the fashionable and expensive Le Cirque 2000, where the menu
also included sea bass. Clinton appeared with Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who earlier in the day had led a panel &UR;  &LR; discussion on
day-care programs with a group of women in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of his remarks, Clinton joked that with all the
publicity his wife's trip generated _ and all the speculation about
her possibly running in New York for the U.S. Senate _ ``If I may
borrow a line from President Kennedy, it looks to me increasingly
like I will be known as the person who comes with Hillary to New
York.''

JORDAN MAKES FEW CHANGES IN HIS PREVIOUS TESTIMONY, SOURCES SAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Washington lawyer Vernon Jordan, who has
functioned as a one-man kitchen cabinet throughout President
Clinton's years in the White House, testified for about three hours
Tuesday in Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Following directly on the heels of Monica Lewinsky, who
testified on Monday, Jordan made some slight changes in his
previous testimony, officials familiar with it said. A Republican
aide on Capitol Hill said, ``New ground was broken.'' But a lawyer
allied with the White House said, ``We saw nothing in serious need
of repair after Vernon finished his testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   No one suggested that anything Jordan said had the capacity to
change the course of the trial, which has seemed headed for an
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's deposition was taken in the most secure room of the
Capitol _ S407, in the attic. It is most often used for classified
briefings involving national security. Urbane, poised and the
picture of finesse, Jordan made no public statement as he arrived
Tuesday morning and left Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chief prosecutor, said at a brief
news conference that the depositions of Ms. Lewinsky and Jordan had
provided ``some amplification'' and ``strengthened some points.''
He added: ``I'm generally pleased with them. We never felt we
needed any bombshells to have a compelling case. What we needed was
to validate the record that already existed under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan answered questions from one of the ablest of the House
prosecutors, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. He also answered ``a
question or two,'' as one White House official described it, posed
by the president's lawyers. That official described them as
``open-ended'' queries that gave him a chance to describe himself
and to restate his credentials.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic lawyer said the White House counsel ``just got him
to repeat a couple of things, so there's absolutely no ambiguity in
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing Clinton at the session, which was interrupted for
20 minutes by a blown fuse, were David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and
Cheryl Mills. Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., presided over most of
the questioning, which a witness described as ``pointed and
vigorous.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan stuck to the story that he had already told five
times to the Lewinsky grand jury, the lawyer said, he made two
concessions.
</P>
<P>
   One dealt with a breakfast Ms. Lewinsky said she had attended
with Jordan at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Washington on Dec. 31, 1997.
On that occasion, Ms. Lewinsky has testified, she told Jordan that
Linda Tripp, in whom she had confided about her illicit affair with
the president, had visited her apartment and might have seen drafts
or copies of notes she had written to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go home and make sure they're not there,'' Ms. Lewinsky quoted
Jordan as having told her. She said that she went home and threw
them away.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Jordan had testified that he could not recall the
breakfast meeting, but the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
turned up a receipt from the hotel for an egg-white omelet like the
one Ms. Lewinsky said she ate. On Tuesday, Jordan reportedly
conceded that he had attended the breakfast but denied that he had
suggested Ms. Lewinsky destroy the notes.
</P>
<P>
   The notes are one element in obstruction-of-justice charges
against Clinton contained in the second article of impeachment
voted by the House.
</P>
<P>
   A second concession, the Democratic lawyer said, came when
Jordan conceded that his attempt to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky was
something out of the ordinary for him. The Republicans have
suggested that he undertook it in an effort to buy Ms. Lewinsky's
silence, but he still denies that, the lawyer said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jordan stands not only at the nexus of the Lewinsky case, but at
the center of the power networks linking Washington and corporate
America.
</P>
<P>
   He plays golf with Clinton. They schmooze on the telephone and
tell stories. ``Nothing wrong with a little locker-room talk,'' he
once said. He counsels the president in tough times. And he praises
him unstintingly, referring to him on one recent occasion as ``a
great friend, a great leader and truly a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best-known African-Americans, he currently sits on
the boards of 10 major U.S. corporations, and his wife, Ann, sits
on the boards of five others.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 10 companies give some of their legal business to
Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld, where Jordan is a senior
partner. He seldom appears in court and never lobbies as such, but
his Rolodex and his White House connections are invaluable to
businessmen in keeping an eye on Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He used those connections to help Ms. Lewinsky at American
Express Co. and at Revlon Group, Inc. He is a director of both.
After he intervened twice with senior executives, she was offered a
job by Revlon, but the offer was later rescinded.

MARIO ZACCHINI, HUMAN CANNONBALL, DIES AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Zacchini, the last surviving member of the original
generation of human cannonballs, whose routine employment was being
explosively propelled from a cannon across a circus tent into a
net, died on Thursday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa, Fla. He
was 87 and lived in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Zacchini, who was customarily launched at a speed of 90 mph
while accompanied by fanfare from the circus band and a roar from
the silver-painted cannon, took flight several thousand times,
usually three times a day.
</P>
<P>
   He often said, ``Flying isn't the hard part; landing in the net
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacchini was the next-to-youngest son of the nine children of
Ildebrando Zacchini, a gymnast who ran away with a circus and
subsequently created the Circus Olympia in Italy in the early
1900s. Eventually five of the seven brothers flew from a cannon;
Mario was the last survivor of the nine children.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being three-ring cannon fodder, he spent years
performing an Argentine gaucho act in his father's circus and later
in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey Circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mario was one of the world's foremost rope twirlers, a
terrific gaucho who actually did a back somersault through the
lasso,'' Mario's nephew Hugo said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Zacchini said the family came up with the idea for the act
and built its first cannon in 1922 on the island of Malta. The
attraction created such a sensation that soon two teams of flying
Zacchinis were crisscrossing Europe.
</P>
<P>
   John Ringling discovered the Zacchinis performing in the Tivoli
Gardens in Copenhagen, Denmark, and brought them to the Ringling
Circus by 1929, the nephew said. Two of Mario's older brothers,
Bruno and Hugo, introduced the human cannonball act to the Ringling
show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Hugo and another brother, Victor, began performing a
double cannonball act, being catapulted nearly simultaneously.
Mario put aside his lasso to replace Victor that year.
</P>
<P>
   After the Zacchini family's contract with Ringling expired in
the late 1930s, Mario Zacchini continued to be a human cannonball
at circuses and carnivals and at the World's Fair in New York. At
times he was blasted over two Ferris wheels before landing in the
net. He retired from cannoneering in the early 1940s and put
together his own carnival, which toured the United States for
years.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later the next generation of Zacchinis took up human
cannonballing, performing with the Ringling circus from 1958 to
1963, said the nephew Hugo. In 1965 there were five different
Zacchini cannon acts performing around the United States. Hugo, who
is a son of Mario's brother Edmondo, said he was the last Zacchini
to be a human cannonball; his final flight was on Aug. 29, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   While the Zacchinis always acknowledged that their shattering
cannon blasts were purely sound effects (achieved by igniting half
a cup of black gunpowder), Mario and his family never revealed the
secret of the Zacchini launching mechanism, to deter copycats.
</P>
<P>
   But other circus performers have said that the propulsion was
accomplished by a jolt of compressed air that moved a platform upon
which the performers stood. These days, many human cannonballs from
other circus families are launched with elastic bungee cords.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Zacchini is survived by his wife, Lydia; a daughter,
Yvonne, and two sons, Mario Jr. and Tyrone, all of Tampa.

INTERNET FOR THE BLIND  
 COLOMBIAN QUAKE DATA

<TEXT>
<P>
   Blind students throughout the United States can study off the
Internet, and at reduced cost, through a service at Purdue
University that lets them or their institutions download thousands
of scientific and mathematical images, print them on special paper
and feed them through a heating machine that raises lines and dots
to form images and Braille characters.
</P>
<P>
   The Purdue program stores more than 2,500 diagrams, which have
been redrawn for the blind and the visually impaired. The images
were created over four years from college-level course material
like graphs, chemical structures and biological drawings. The
images and text can be transmitted by regular laser printers onto a
new medium called capsule paper, which is run through a heating
unit to make the printed areas rise.
</P>
<P>
   The special paper costs a little less than $1 a sheet, the
heating unit about $1,000. Subscriptions to the Purdue files start
at less than $100. By contrast, Purdue officials said, it can cost
$5,000 to $10,000 for a publisher to convert one mathematics or
science textbook to Braille.
</P>
<P>
   There are already voice-synthesizing programs for the blind that
read Internet text out loud, but images have to be tagged with a
spoken explanation.

   Colombian Quake Data
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, seismograph needles were swinging as shock waves
from the disastrous earthquake in Colombia on Jan. 25 were being
felt on buried sensors. And within days, the raw data from the
quake, which killed hundreds of people, were being studied not just
by researchers but also by students in college courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a huge difference in teaching something to say, `This
happened two days ago,''' said Anne Meltzer, associate professor of
earth and environmental sciences at Lehigh University, which
installed a new earthquake monitor in bedrock on its campus in
Bethlehem, Pa., just before the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., the
earth sciences center of Columbia University, has six seismic
stations on the campus and coordinates data from about 16 others in
the Northeast, both for research and for monitoring Eastern
earthquakes. The data from the Colombian quake were pulled in time
for graduate students' weekly presentation on Friday, said Arthur
Lerner-Lam, associate adjunct professor at Lamont-Doherty.

MUSICAL `PARADE' TO CLOSE AT END OF FEBRUARY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (jw) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeing ticket sales falling and their producing
partner in bankruptcy court, officials at Lincoln Center Theater
said Tuesday that they would close the musical ``Parade'' at the
end of the month. The show, at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont
Theater, will have lost an estimated $5.5 million when it closes,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, the musical's executive producer, said the
theater simply did not have the money to continue promoting the
show and absorbing its weekly losses.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was that ``Parade'' was co-produced with
Livent, the private Canadian theater producing company that filed
for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code in
November. That left Lincoln Center Theater solely responsible for
weekly running costs and any weekly losses, which last week were
almost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have all the resources we needed to keep the show
open,'' Gersten said.

   ``Parade,'' with music and lyrics by Jason Robert Brown and a
book by Alfred Uhry, opened in mid-December to mixed reviews, with
some critics faulting the musical's somber subject matter: the 1915
lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory supervisor in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   After its final performance, a matinee on Feb. 28, ``Parade''
will have played 39 previews and 84 performances.

   Gersten announced the decision to close the show to the cast
before Tuesday night's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how many times you've done it, it's never easy to
tell a cast,'' Gersten said earlier Tuesday. ``I haven't gotten
used to it yet.''

NY CRUSADE GETS L.T. IN; NOW HAYES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The can't-miss, feel-good (and then some)
hit of the summer, as far as I'm concerned, is going to be in Ohio
this coming August:
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor's Pro Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Taylor's party ``the night before'' the
induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   I won't elaborate. You can always rent ``Scarface'' at your
local video store.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame invited scrutiny as it conducted its annual
balloting in Miami last weekend. Let me suggest that public
perception of the Hall has been altered forever.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, the great revolutionary linebacker from the New York
Giants, was elected, along with three guys whose names I forget.
</P>
<P>
   And that's my point. The circumstances surrounding Taylor's
election caused such a stir that anything else the electorate did
last weekend bordered on footnote material. As in life, ``L.T.''
was a lightning rod. Everyone else was destined to end up in ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Fair is fair. And Taylor fairly and
officially earned his spot among the game's immortals with his
election Saturday. There is no recall, no precedent for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But by his subsequent words, Taylor made fools of everyone who
voted for him. The man has no sense of remorse, nor even a trace of
humility.
</P>
<P>
   The world owes L.T. _ or so he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame's Board of Selectors is a 36-member committee _
one media representative from each of the league's 30 teams, the
president of the Pro Football Writers of America and five at-large
delegates. By virtue of having both the Jets and the Giants, the
New York area has at least two representatives. All 36 selectors
are male.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hall officials in Canton, any fan or media member
can nominate anyone who has been connected with pro football simply
by writing to the Hall of Fame. Players must have been retired for
five seasons. Coaches must simply be retired.
</P>
<P>
   The total list, usually numbering 60-70, is sent to the
selectors along with a mail ballot. The top 15 vote-getters in the
mail ballot become finalists, and their names are placed on the
ballot for the final selection meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting, held on the Saturday morning before the
Super Bowl, nominees are discussed and merits weighed. Usually, the
representative from a particular team's area stands and speaks on
behalf of that team's nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must receive 80 percent of the votes _ 29 of 36 this
time _ to be elected. Only eight negative votes, therefore, would
have denied Taylor admission into the Hall of Fame this year.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say who actually voted against Taylor. Selectors
who attended the meeting said that discussion on L.T. lasted 40
minutes, instead of the usual five. The PFWA representative, Steve
Schoenfeld of the ``Arizona Republic'', announced that because of
L.T.'s off-field escapades, he could not vote for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Paul Zimmerman of ``Sports Illustrated'', the New York
contingent visibly campaigned for Taylor's election. (It should be
noted that two of the at-large selectors also reside in the New
York area, giving candidates like Taylor a decided edge over, say,
a nominee from Seattle or New Orleans).
</P>
<P>
   Politicking, alas, has always been a part of the Pro Football
Hall of Fame process. A persuasive selector, even when he takes
only five minutes, has an advantage over a selector whom no one
wants to hear speak.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be more unfair. But it's true.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, there is no Hall of Fame selection meeting. Voters
are independent agents, for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   But in Miami last week, you had New York media people openly
campaigning and telephoning selectors on Taylor's behalf _ in some
cases, chastising fellow members for even thinking about denying
L.T. on the basis of morals.
</P>
<P>
   The New York people were out of line. Worse, the NFL
commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, crossed the line Friday when he said
that Taylor should get in, because ``without qualification, the
Hall of Fame is about performing on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Some voters are certain that Tagliabue influenced the Taylor
vote.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic. Tagliabue's input doesn't mean a hill of beans to
most owners. So, he opens his mouth and gets a guy he once
suspended into the Hall of Fame?
</P>
<P>
   To me, it is more than ludicrous that an embarrassing loose
cannon like Lawrence Taylor is bound for his Hall of Fame and
baseball's Pete Rose isn't. And it is criminal to think that
Taylor, who once said that the best rehab from his cocaine problem
was to play a lot of golf, is going to Canton, while the Cowboys'
Bob Hayes remains home.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the New York writers can make Hayes their next crusade.
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, they're even bigger fools than their buddy, L.T.,
made of them.

BEHIND GIULIANI'S TRIPS: TERM LIMITS AND LOVE FOR POLITICS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas, Pa., Wash., Fla.) (bl) 
By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani justified his
frequent out-of-state trips as being part of his duty to raise
money for like-minded Republicans in an election year. But his
aides now give a more straightforward explanation for Giuliani's
continued wanderlust: He is a term-limited mayor with no intention
of bidding adieu to the public stage once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's schedule this month, for example, is not unlike that
of a traveling dinner-theater entertainer. Friday, he is the
keynote speaker at a gathering of Pennsylvania Republicans in
Harrisburg. And in coming weeks, he is to address several hundred
members of the Lubavitch movement at a dinner in Miami, speak to
Westchester County legislators and give a breakfast talk to a group
of Hispanic leaders in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing stop on the mayor's itinerary comes
 &UR; after &LR;  he addresses the Dallas Men's Federation on Feb. 11.
Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's spokeswoman, said Tuesday that
Giuliani has been invited by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a potential
Republican candidate for president, to spend the night in the Sam
Houston bedroom at the governor's mansion in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Those who earn their living by political matchmaking and
prognosticating are likely to work overtime imagining what the two
prominent and ambitious Republicans might discuss. Ms. Lategano,
however, described the sleepover as more businesslike than
political. She said Giuliani was eager to discuss educational
policies with Bush, particularly the Texan's approach to bilingual
education.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the mayor has planned trips to Boston and several
forays into upstate New York. The latter trips seem intended to
improve Giuliani's reputation upstate, where resentment still
lingers among Republicans over his decision to cross party lines
and support Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1994, rather than the Republican
who eventually won, George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, records show that the mayor's three political
fund-raising organizations _ Solutions America, Friends of
Giuliani, and Giuliani for New York _ had a total of $607,000 at
the end of 1998, well short of the multimillions that a U.S. Senate
campaign would cost in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And the records showed that Giuliani generally demonstrated his
support for Republican candidates with his time, and not with
overly generous contributions. He gave $1,000 to the failed
senatorial re-election campaign of Alfonse D'Amato, a combined
$6,000 to two state Republican committees, $1,000 to Matt Fong, who
lost in the California race for U.S. Senate, and $1,000 to a
candidate for superintendent of education in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Those records also showed that Giuliani continued to receive
significant financial support from prestigious law firms, various
financiers and, particularly, the city's developers, including
Donald Trump.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani fund-raising operation returned a $500 donation
from another developer, Abe Hirschfeld, who has been accused of
hiring someone to kill a former business partner. When asked why
Hirschfeld's donation was rejected, John Gross, a lawyer and the
treasurer for the mayor's campaigns, said, ``Because he was
indicted.''

COMMENTARY: GUN MAKERS, AND A CULTURE, ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Va., N.C., Ga., Ohio) (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Click, click, click. The sound was faint inside a
Brooklyn courtroom on Monday. It underscored the events being
played out in federal court, where the relatives of people slain by
illegal handguns are suing more than 25 gun manufacturers who they
say negligently marketed guns to states with weak gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   Those sales, the plaintiffs contend in what could be a landmark
civil case, resulted in a flood of illegal weapons to states like
New York where the gun laws are strong.
</P>
<P>
   Click, click, click. The steady sound was not coming from any
weapons demonstration, since the lawyers' arguments seemed almost
abstract. The clicking came from among the spectators, where
Rebecca Peters was busily typing notes about guns and their
availability into her laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the front of the courtroom, lawyers for the gun makers
insisted that their international subsidiaries were legally
separate from the American counterparts. This is a legal point of
some consequence should the jury rule against them, since market
share helps determine each company's share of liability.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peters was struck by how businesses that boasted for decades
about being market leaders were now insisting that corporate
restructuring had made them smaller than imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shell game,'' she said. ``In all of this, the victims
are lost. All this talking about corporate stuff, and the victim
disappears. These guys are just talking about paper
manipulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peters' interest transcends a trial buff's curiosity. She is
a journalist turned lawyer who helped lead a movement for stricter
gun laws in her native Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, she is conducting comparative research on
gun laws in different countries as part of her fellowship at the
Center on Crime, Communities and Culture, a foundation established
by George Soros (which has also helped defray some of the
plaintiffs' expenses on expert testimony).
</P>
<P>
   How guns affect crime and communities has been debated
sufficiently in the case. Defense lawyers have insisted that they
sell only to buyers who meet current regulations. They have also
said that demand by legitimate buyers, not negligent marketing and
oversupply, accounts for high gun sales in states like Virginia,
Florida, Ohio, Georgia and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But is it a coincidence that law-enforcement officials say those
same states account for many guns used in crimes in New York City?
And does that mean that law-abiding citizens should take up arms
just in case they encounter a robber armed with an illegal gun?
Either way, what drives this nation's fascination with guns?
</P>
<P>
   That's where culture comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That an ordinary citizen should be armed in the expectation of
shooting another person has not been accepted in the law or the
culture in Australia,'' Ms. Peters said. ``I really see that as a
benchmark of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Handguns, she said, have been tightly regulated in Australia
since the 1930s. Her campaign there was for uniformity in gun laws
in all Australian states, as well as a ban on semiautomatic rifles
and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws began to be introduced in 1996, soon after a gunman
killed 35 people in Tasmania. The laws also resulted in a buy-back
program that netted some 700,000 weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shooting was the kind of thing people associated with
America,'' she said, offering a sobering lesson on the image that
the United States has around the world. ``The shooting highlighted
that the policies had failed to do what most people in the country
felt was basic for democracy, which is strict control over guns.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, democracy is defined the other way around
by the gun lobby. But that is not the only reversal, Ms. Peters
said, adding that rather than look at the guns and their deadly
effects from a public health perspective _ which stresses
prevention for the greater good _ the issues are usually confined
to criminal justice debates about getting tough on thugs.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers for the industry were eager to show how they help
the police trace weapons, Ms. Peters wondered why so much energy is
spent after someone lies dead in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at this court case, there is still in America a
very entrenched idea that the purpose of gun laws is to punish bad
guys,'' she said. ``There is very little sense in the law that the
purpose of gun laws is to prevent gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   That idea has yet to click in this country.

WARREN MILLER, 74, EXPERT ON VOTING PATTERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Mich., Iowa, Ind., Calif., S.D.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren E. Miller, a political science professor who was one of
the foremost authorities on Americans' voting behavior and their
electoral politics, died on Saturday at Scottsdale Healthcare
Osborn hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 74 and lived in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from diabetes, said his son,
Jeffrey.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a regents' professor at Arizona State University at
his death and had taught there since 1982. He held various posts at
the University of Michigan from 1951 into the 1990s, and was a
professor there from 1956 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A renowned scholar, he was one of the four co-authors of ``The
American Voter'' (1960), a landmark work on voting behavior. The
others were Drs. Angus Campbell, Philip E. Converse and Donald E.
Stokes.
</P>
<P>
   The book drew on thousands of interviews with voters during the
election years 1948, 1952, 1954, 1956 and 1958. Among observations
about voters at that time was that no matter how much candidates
tried to discuss the issues, voters tended to evaluate the
candidates more as personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The authors also found that two-thirds to three-quarters of
voters at that time made up their minds before the campaign and one
of every 10 voters was undecided until the last two weeks before
the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was also the co-author, with J. Merrill Shanks, of ``The
New American Voter'' (1996, Harvard University Press). The work
examines diminishing voter turnout, evolving party-identification
patterns and voting behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the co-authors say cynicism about government and
politics may deter people from voting and other political activity.
But they conclude, ``Nothing we have learned suggests that the
basic institutions in our system of choosing a president are in
need of repair, other than that which can be provided by wise and
effective leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also helped develop the field of quantitative political
science, the use of surveys and computers to analyze political
behavior. He founded the Center for Political Studies, an
institution at the University of Michigan that became the
pre-eminent center for the study of the American voter. From 1970
to 1981, he was the center's director.
</P>
<P>
   He was active for a long time in the American National Election
Studies, a program that carries out vast surveys of voters before
and after every national election. For more than 20 years, he was a
principal investigator for the program, which is now supported by
the National Science Foundation and has become almost an American
institution. All scholars and students of American political
behavior depend on the surveys.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Miller founded, and became the first executive director
of the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social
Research, at the University of Michigan. It is the largest
scholarly archive for quantitative social-science data in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 and 1980, Miller was president of the American Political
Science Association. In 1998, he won the association's Frank J.
Goodnow Award for Distinguished Service to the Profession of
Political Science.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Hawarden, Iowa. After serving in the Army Air
Forces from 1943 to 1946, he attended the University of Oregon,
where he received a bachelor's degree in 1948 and a master's degree
in 1950. He earned a doctorate from Syracuse University in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to Mildred Kiplinger, in 1948, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Jeffrey, of Indianapolis, he is survived
by his wife, Dr. Ruth Jones, also a political scientist; a
daughter, Jennifer, who lives near San Diego, and a sister,
Margaret Wickler of Rapid City, S.D.

ALFRED E. LUDERS Jr., 89; DESIGNED AND RACED SAILBOATS 
(bl) 
By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alfred Edward Luders Jr., an innovative boat designer and racer
who built the America's Cup yacht Weatherly, died Jan. 31 at his
home in Stamford, Conn. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Luders, known as Bill, blended an avocation, racing sailboats,
with his vocation as director of Luders Marine Construction Co. in
Stamford Harbor, a major builder of custom yachts. The firm had
been founded by his father in 1908 and was closed by Bill Luders 60
years later. The craftsmanship of wooden boat construction had been
made obsolete by fiberglass, a material that held no interest for
Luders.
</P>
<P>
   He was an innovator in the use of molded plywood for hull
construction of boats like the popular Luders 16 racing sailboat.
More than 200 of these were built after World War II, with fleets
established from Bermuda to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II and the Korean War, Luders supervised the
building of some 100 ships for the Navy, including subchasers,
minesweepers and harbor tugs.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to racing, Luders' early successes came in the
International 6-meter class of his own design and equipped on tight
budgets imposed by his father. ``Briggs Cunningham was kind,''
Luders said of a well-financed competitor. ``He would give me his
discarded mainsails and jibs.''
</P>
<P>
   Luders was the last survivor among five distinguished skippers
in the 1950s who made the International One-Design fleet on western
Long Island Sound as competitive a racing class as any. The others
were George Hinman, Arthur Knapp, Emil (Bus) Mosbacher and
Cornelius Shields.
</P>
<P>
   When the America's Cup competition was revived in 1958 in
12-meter yachts, Luders built Weatherly to the design of Philip
Rhodes, and Arthur Knapp campaigned her during the trials to chose
a cup defender. Weatherly was not selected that year, but after a
redesign by Luders, and with Mosbacher as skipper, she defended the
cup in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Luders designed and built other 12-meter yachts, the most
notable being American Eagle, which Ted Turner turned into an ocean
racer.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean or distance racing had no appeal to Luders. ``I like to
sleep in a bed, preferably ashore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last racing yachts designed and built by Luders were the
5.5-meter sloops, a class used in Olympic and international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Luders is survived by his wife, Margaret Masterson Luders; a
son, John of New Canaan, Conn.; two grandchildren, and two
great-grandchildren.  &QL;

researchers report that people who have had a course of

they fear reports like this will lead to overuse of antibiotics,

   RESTAURANT-SERVICE (New York) _ Diners divide into two great
human types, the ones who like to talk to their waiter and the ones
who don't. Frank de Falco, a veteran New York diner, belongs to the
second group. He likes advice on food, although he knows a lot
about it. He like advice on wine, although he knows a lot about
that too. These days he's getting a lot of both. Over the last
decade, a distinctly American style of service has been evolving, a
relaxed yet professional approach that suits the national character
better than the old-style formal French service. This
reinterpretation of restaurant protocol is radical enough to merit
a name _ the new American service _ and at fine restaurants, owners
and managers spend as much time thinking about it as they do about
the food. By William Grimes.

   RESTAURANT-TIPS (New York) _ Many uncertainties surround the
dining experience, but one thing is sure. At the end of the meal,
the waiter will present a bill, and the diner, barring a near
nuclear catastrophe, will leave a tip. Last year, American diners
left an estimated $12 billion on the table, at an average of 16.7
percent of the total bill. In Manhattan, the standard tip is closer
to 20 percent at a good restaurant. Regardless of the amount, the
gesture may well be mass delusion. The tip is a puzzle. No one
quite knows why diners tip in the first place, or whether tipping
serves any rational economic purpose. It's not at all clear how the
custom got started, for that matter. By William Grimes.

Hersom is in charge of one of the most prestigious and largest _
700 selections _ wine lists in New York City, and he talks about
wine with as much zip and enthusiasm as he uses moving around the
dining room. Hersom is part of an emerging generation in wine
service who are helping shed the image of the snooty, aloof
sommelier and infusing life into a traditionally stodgy profession.

N.Y. STATE CITES HIGH NUMBER OF MINORITY PUPILS IN SPECIAL
EDUCATION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minority students in New York state are more likely to be
assigned to special education classes than white students,
according to data released Tuesday by the state Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Disproportionate assignments to special education have long
alarmed educators and federal investigators because students in
special education often do not get the services they need and
rarely move on to regular classes or receive a diploma. Federal
authorities have been reviewing New York City's special education
program for two years out of concern about the overrepresentation
of minority children.
</P>
<P>
   New York state compiled the data, a year in advance of the
deadline, as part of a new requirement from the U.S. Department of
Education's Office of Civil Rights, under which states must track
special education placements by race and ethnic group. The state
released the findings Tuesday in Albany at a meeting of the Board
of Regents, which has asked Gov. George Pataki to increase
financing for special education, a catchall term that includes
pupils who are mentally retarded, emotionally disturbed or have
learning disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, according to the report, which is based on
1997-98 data, black children made up 19.5 percent of the state's
public school population but 24.5 percent of the students in
special education. Hispanic children made up 16.8 percent of the
school population but 18.7 percent of the special education
enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   White children, who made up 58 percent of all students,
accounted for 54.3 percent of the special education population.
Asians/Pacific Islanders were 5.2 percent of the overall enrollment
and 1.8 percent of the students in special education. Of a total
public school enrollment of 3.3 million, 11.8 percent of the
students were in special education.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics showed that the inconsistency was even worse for
the most extreme forms of special education placements _ in
buildings separate from regular schools or in classes with only
other special education students for most of the day. While 32.4
percent of white students with learning disabilities were in such
placements, the number was 60 percent for Hispanic students and 57
percent for black children.
</P>
<P>
   State Education Commissioner Richard Mills said an inquiry by
the regents will try to explain the pattern. ``We want to know why
it's happening,'' he said. ``We want to probe deeply into these
issues, district by district.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, 26 percent of children classified with learning
disabilities spend less than 40 percent of their school day in
general education classes. In New York, 44 percent of those with
learning disabilities were spending less than 40 percent of their
days in general classes as of Dec. 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few bright spots in the figures released by the
regents Tuesday. The increase in the number of students placed in
special education rose to 389,887 in the 1997-98 school year from
380,320 in 1996-97. That increase is one-tenth of one percent of
the total student body, the smallest increase in at least a decade,
Mills said.

TYSON'S RETURN HAS RIPPLE EFFECT ON SAVARESE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wake of Mike Tyson's return has a way of capsizing a career
in the heavyweight division. Just ask Lou Savarese, whose crushing
first-round knockout of Buster Douglas last summer was supposed to
put him near the head of the class among heavyweight contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive victory came at about the same time that Tyson
put on his full-court press to get his boxing license back.
</P>
<P>
   And with Tyson back in the mix, every heavyweight who laces up a
pair of gloves can hear the cash register ringing. That makes it
hard for heavyweight contenders to get good bouts.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese was supposed to fight Shannon Briggs on Feb. 27 at
Madison Square Garden. But Briggs, who has been mentioned as a
possible opponent for Tyson on April 24, pulled out of the fight,
because he did not want to join his trainer, Emanuel Steward, in
the Poconos.
</P>
<P>
   Steward is training Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council
heavyweight champion, there for his unification bout against
Evander Holyfield on March 13 at New York's Madison Square Garden.
Briggs said that the heavy, cold mountain air was not good for his
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   After Briggs pulled out, David Tua was mentioned as a possible
replacement. But Tua, the No. 1 contender for the International
Boxing Federation championship, does not want to jeopardize his
standing and his shot at the Holyfield-Lewis winner.
</P>
<P>
   So, Savarese was left in the cold until Lance (Mount) Whitaker
came along. The two will meet on the undercard of the David
Reid-Laurent Boudouani junior middleweight championship bout March
6 in Atlantic City. The bout will be broadcast on HBO as part of
its ``World Championship Boxing'' series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know very much about Lance Whitaker until I saw some
tapes of him fighting Garing Lane and Big Foot Martin,'' Savarese
said. ``But he's a big strong guy who's undefeated and he's a
credible opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese himself would make a credible opponent for Tyson, but
with his booming right hand, he knows he is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even bank on it,'' Savarese said. ``If it happens,
it's great. But there are so many variables with fighting Tyson. I
spoke with Shelly Finkel and he wants the fight. But I talk with
Tommy Brooks, Mike's trainer, and he and Mike don't like the fight.
I don't think they want to fight anybody who's a big puncher.
They've seen the tape from the Douglas fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins-Allen Stand Alone
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a middleweight championship tripleheader is
down to a single middleweight title bout: a rematch between Bernard
Hopkins, the IBF champion, and Robert Allen on Saturday night at
the Washington Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hassine Cherifi, the World Boxing Council middleweight champion,
pulled out of his rematch with Keith Holmes, the former champion,
because of a back injury Cherifi sustained on the final day of
sparring last week.
</P>
<P>
   William Joppy, the World Boxing Association champion, injured
his neck in a traffic accident Jan. 18 while leaving his gym in
Maryland and had to pull out of his bout.
</P>
<P>
   Cherifi underwent a magnetic resonance imaging exam at the
Cleveland Clinic in Florida on Tuesday, but the results were not
final, according to Bobby Goodman of Don King Promotions, the
promoter of the bout. Goodman said they are looking for a contender
to fight Holmes on short notice for the interim title until Cherifi
was able to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Cherifi is expected to be ringside for the card, which will be
broadcast on Showtime on Saturday night at 9 o'clock. As a
replacement championship bout, Sharmba Mitchell, the WBA
super-lightweight champion, will defend his title against Pedro
Saiz.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed's Family Affair
</P>
<P>
   First he dismissed his longtime trainer, Brendan Ingle. Now,
Prince Naseem Hamed has ditched his promoter, Frank Warren. Hamed
and his brother, Riath, have formed a company to manage and promote
the boxer. The flamboyant featherweight's first fight under the
banner of Prince Naseem Enterprises will be against Paul Ingle in
Manchester, England, on April 10. Hamed will act as a co-promoter
with other promoters on a fight-by-fight basis.

4 OFFICERS ARE REASSIGNED AT JAIL WHERE INMATE DIED IN BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Three guards and a corporal at the Nassau
County jail have been placed on restricted duty as officials
investigate the death of an inmate who was brutally beaten at the
jail last month, lawyers for the guards said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest J. Peace, a lawyer for one of the guards, Patrick
Regnier, said that the four correction officers were working the
day tour in an area of the jail known as B-2, where Thomas Pizzuto,
the inmate who later died, was being held. ``They observed the
guy,'' he said, referring to the victim. ``But they didn't see
anything that would cause this guy's injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace added that his own investigation, which he said included
interviews with prisoners, suggested that an inmate or inmates, not
a guard or guards, was responsible for Pizzuto's beating.
</P>
<P>
   Since the death of Pizzuto, which has been ruled a homicide by
the county's medical examiner's office, many former inmates have
come forward to describe brutal treatment by guards there. And the
U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn has begun a civil rights
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, FBI agents swept through the jail and the Nassau
County Medical Center, which are next to each other in East Meadow,
removing documents and interviewing employees, officials said.
Among the documents the agents seized on Tuesday were Pizzuto's
medical records, law enforcement officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Undersheriff Paul Schoernberger said that jail officials met
with the agents ``for a long period of time'' but would not discuss
what records were taken or who was interviewed. He refused to
confirm the names or number of correction officers who had been
reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Regnier, lawyers for the guards identified the
two others who were placed on restrictive duty as Ivano Bavaro and
Edward Velasquez. The identity of the corporal could not be
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Edward P. Jenks, who is representing Bavaro, said his client had
been reassigned to the visiting room of the jail over a week ago.
``I'm confident that a full criminal investigation will only
exculpate my client,'' he said, declining to discuss the case
further. Dennis M. Lemke, Velasquez's lawyer, said that all three
guards had clean records and would be cleared in time.

USC ADDS OFFENSE TO RECRUITING CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC put the finishing touches on its recruiting
class Tuesday, securing two highly regarded offensive lineman, an
area the Trojans viewed as their No.1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas MacKay, a 6-foot-5, 260-pound tackle from Hughson, Calif.,
and Eric Torres, a 6-7, 280-pound tackle from Bishop Montgomery
High, each selected USC, and are expected to sign national letters
of intent today, the first day players are allowed to sign with
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans intend to sign 22 players today and leave one
scholarship open. USC will sign five offensive lineman and three
wide receivers, the two positions where the Trojans are considered
weakest.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, a two-sport star, selected USC over Arizona and Oregon.
Torres chose the Trojans over Arizona State and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Besides MacKay and Torres, the Trojans received commitments from
Lenny Vandermade (6-3, 265) of Mater Dei, Nate Steinbacher (6-6,
315) of Esperanza and Norman Katnik (6-5, 245) of Foothill.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes of the class appear to be in the wide-receiver corps,
where three All-American selections committed to the Trojans:
Kareem Kelly (6-0, 180) of Long Beach Poly, Marcell Allmond (6-3,
195) of St. Paul and Steve Stevenson (6-3, 195) of Charter Oak.
</P>
<P>
   USC is also getting five cornerbacks, led by All-American
Darrell Rideaux (5-9, 165) of Long Beach Poly. The others are
DeShaun Hill (6-0, 190) and Nijrell Eason (6-1, 195) of Long Beach
City College, Craig Mitchell (5-9, 170) of West Los Angeles College
and Troy Polamalu (5-11, 190) of Winston Douglas, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is the cousin of USC secondary coach Dennis Thurman;
Polamalu is the nephew of former USC fullback Kennedy Pola. Hill
committed to USC on Sunday after also considering Arizona and
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most highly regarded recruits is Parade All-American
Bernard Riley (6-3, 305) of Los Alamitos. His teammate, defensive
tackle Sagan Atuatasi (6-2, 285), also committed.
</P>
<P>
   USC also has picked up four linebackers: JC All-American Markus
Steele (6-3, 235) of Long Beach City College, Aaron Graham (6-1,
225) of Bakersfield High, Chris Prosser (6-2, 215) of San Diego
Morse and Omar Nazel (6-4, 220) of Oakland Skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are also adding depth at tight end, with Jacob
Rogers (6-6, 235) of Oxnard and Chad Cook (6-5, 230) of Portland
Jesuit High School. Rogers is already attending classes at USC
after graduating early. Tight end Joe Boskovich of Westlake intends
to enroll at USC as a walk-on. Rounding out the class is kicker
David Newberry (5-11, 175) of Corsicana, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are holding out a slim hope that fullback/linebacker
Lance Briggs of Sacramento Elk Grove, who earlier committed to
Arizona, will change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   If USC's class is lacking in any position, it is running back.
Joe Weber of San Bernardino Pacific committed to Texas A&AMP;M and
Onterrio Smith of Sacramento Grant is expected to sign with
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Trojans' football class stands a good chance to
rate No.1 nationally in track and field. MacKay is one of the
nation's top recruits in the discus, hammer throw and shot put. And
USC also has the defending state champs in the 100 meters
(Rideaux), 200 meters (Kelly) and 110 hurdles (Allmond).
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' football recruiting class is ranked 10th nationally
by PrepStar magazine and 14th by SuperPrep magazine.

   The score was tied, time was running out in regulation, and Tim
Taylor's shot seemed to be headed into the net. Instead, it hit off
the leg of Colorado defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh. The puck turned
over and the Avalanche came back down the ice to score. Another
loss _ this one 3-2 Tuesday night at the FleetCenter _ another blow
to the Bruins' already fragile state.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche won their ninth straight game, and goalie Patrick
Roy won for the first time in the FleetCenter. He has won his last
eight games. The Bruins are winless in six (0-5-1) and have won
once in their last 10 (1-7-2).
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, center Jason Allison had a pair of goals
to snap out of his scoring slump. But that good news was dwarfed by
the palpable disappointment in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The puck had just come out and I whacked at it,'' said Taylor,
who played a superb game against the Avalanche's sensational top
line, especially Peter Forsberg. ``(Roy) wasn't even in his net. It
just barely hit his stick and came out the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hit from behind. I was getting up. It was only Roy,
myself, and the defenseman, and the next thing I know, it's in our
net. I don't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it didn't go in. I'm dumbfounded. We worked
our tails off and once again, we're coming up empty. I've never
been involved in something this dramatic before. We're inches away
from winning the hockey game and we end up in the dressing room
with a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a lot happier if we sucked  &UR; tonight &LR;  and had 2
points.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston played one of its most inspired contests of the season
and wound up with nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins outshot the Avalanche, 12-4, in the first period but
trailed, 1-0, heading into the first intermission after a
power-play goal by Ozolinsh at 6:14. Ozolinsh, who signed with
Colorado Jan. 5, scored his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins battled back hard, scoring twice in the middle
period, once early and once late, to take a 2-1 lead. Allison, who
had only one goal in his last 20 games, got his 10th of the season
just 11 seconds into the period when he skated down the right
circle and beat Roy with a wrist shot into the top right corner on
the power play. It was the just the second power-play goal for
Boston in 39 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Allison potted his second of the night at 18:45 with a little
help from Heinze, who tried to shoot from the slot but had the puck
deflected over to Allison, who popped it past Roy. Coach Pat Burns
had talked to Allison about relaxing and not getting so knotted up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough on him,'' Burns said. ``I see all these stats
thrown up on TV. I talked to Heinzie, too. I said, `You're just not
having any fun. You have to have fun doing it.' I think Jason was
the same thing. I said, `Don't overpass it _ close your eyes and
shoot it sometimes.' I thought he played a strong game. He skated.
He has to skate.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said he hasn't been feeling the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, that's when I play better,'' he said. ``I usually
respond pretty well to big games. We've played pretty well the last
couple of games. We had a couple of bad breaks  &UR; tonight &LR; . We
deserved better. We're a little scared to lose right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison said it felt good to score a couple of goals but it
didn't ease the disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a little nicer if we held on to the game,''
he said. ``Maybe we sat back a little too much. We have to find a
way to win these games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche came back strongly in the third, tying the game at
14:57 on a Bruin miscue. Defensemen Hal Gill and Darren Van Impe
both went to the bench and the Avalanche went to the net. Chris
Drury skated the puck in and got nothing on his shot. Goalie Byron
Dafoe stopped the trickler with his pad, but Adam Deadmarsh was
there to backhand in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   After Taylor's shot nearly beat Roy, Colorado came back on a
rush. Forsberg, on the left side, relayed the puck to Joe Sakic.
Sakic made a quick dish over to Milan Hejduk, who put it past Dafoe
for the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words can't describe it anymore,'' said Rob DiMaio. ``It's
that frustrating right now. I'm out of words to describe the
feeling that's in here now.''

65 ACCUSED OF AIDING HEALTH FRAUDD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ In what New Jersey prosecutors said was the
largest single group of defendants in a single state criminal case,
65 people were indicted Tuesday on charges that they conspired with
a psychologist to defraud health insurers of $3.5 million for sham
treatments of ``neurotic depression.''
</P>
<P>
   The individuals charged were mostly school system workers _
ranging from a vice principal to a custodian _ in Newark, East
Orange, Passaic, Hillside and Plainfield.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges that they received kickbacks, but no
treatment, from the psychologist, Carl Lichtman of Ridgewood.
Lichtman, who has already pleaded guilty in the scheme, paid the
patients 25 percent of what he billed their insurance plans _ from
$425 to as much as $14,000 _ for agreeing to participate in the
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the indictment charged, the individuals received
additional ``referral fees'' from the psychologist for bringing
others into the conspiracy, which ran from the early 1990s to 1996,
when the psychologist was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's indictments represent the culmination of an
investigation that began nearly five years ago. State Attorney
General Peter G. Verniero termed it ``one of the largest and most
complex white-collar cases that we have prosecuted in my tenure and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   He said fraud investigators interviewed about 250 people and
pored over ``mountains of bank, business and personal records'' in
tracking down and charging those who were involved. Verniero said
that the people indicted on Tuesday faced prison sentences of 3 to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtman's cooperation with prosecutors has resulted in guilty
pleas over the last 18 months by another 112 people who were
charged with participating in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   These people were first suspended from their jobs and then given
the opportunity to avoid jail in exchange for permanently giving up
their positions in the school system, making restitution and
serving sentences of up to three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Among those indicted on Tuesday were many who had been offered
the plea agreements and refused, maintaining their innocence. At
one point a group of them brought suit in U.S. District Court here,
claiming that they were illegally suspended from their jobs once
they were named by Lichtman. The suit was dismissed by a judge, but
many continued to maintain that they had been pulled into the
scheme on the belief that it was a legitimate program created to
keep overstressed employees working in stressful urban education
environments.
</P>
<P>
   Elaugh Butler, a former education media specialist, was among
those indicted on Tuesday. She said in an interview last summer
that Lichtman's staff ``implied to me that the money came from some
benefactor or corporation who was sensitive to the pressures of
teaching in an urban environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called for the treatment and never got it,'' she said. ``I
did cash the checks he sent.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheme set up by Lichtman and his no-show patients with
about 35 different health insurers was first discovered by
Prudential Insurance Co., which observed a curious pattern in
Lichtman's claim filings.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Newark, also received an
anonymous call from someone who had been asked to participate in
the scheme but declined. Kevin Heine, a spokesman for Prudential,
said that the information the company turned over to state
prosecutors ``showed a clear pattern of fraudulent activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lichtman, reached at his home, would not comment on the latest
round of indictments nor discuss his role in either the scheme or
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   He was sentenced to 5{ years in prison and served 16 months
before being released on parole and after paying $1.9 million of
the ordered restitution. He has also forfeited his license to work
as a psychologist in the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to Verniero's office, Lichtman filed more than 600
claims for fraudulent services.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that at one point Lichtman was submitting
claims for as many as 50 patients a day _ a pace that would have
required him to work 24 hours a day and on holidays.

   NEW YORK _ Exiled dissident writers are the focus in a series of
discussions that opens Wednesday night at the Miller Theater at
Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 p.m., Wei Jingsheng, one of China's most prominent
political exiles and a visiting scholar at Columbia's School of
International Public Affairs, will engage in a discussion moderated
by the novelist Jamaica Kincaid, who is also vice president of the
PEN American Center.
</P>
<P>
   The series, which runs through Feb. 24 and is called ``Writers
in Exile,'' is being presented in collaboration with the PEN
American Center as part of the Miller's ``Theater of Ideas.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like the literary equivalent of the Australian Open
or Wimbledon, a knockout playwriting tournament begins at 8
Wednesday night with four plays presented under the auspices of the
Turnip Theater Company at the Studio, at 145 West 46th St.
</P>
<P>
   The event is the ``New York City 15-Minute Play Festival,''
comprising 32 original short plays chosen from 250 entries
nationwide and competing through Feb. 20. At each performance, the
audience votes for its favorite. Winners from the first two weeks
move on to finals week, when they compete for cash prizes and the
accolades of audiences and theater professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Spacious Skies
</P>
<P>
   Depicting snowcapped mountains and smoldering volcanoes,
cascading waterfalls and untamed plains, 100 of the finest
Australian and American landscape paintings are on display at the
Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington in a major survey, ``New
Worlds From Old: 19th-Century Australian and American Landscapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., and the
National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, the show, running
through April 19, highlights the works of such artists as Albert
Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church, Thomas Cole, Winslow Homer and
many Australians whose works are on their first visit to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Show
</P>
<P>
   It's 148 years old, some 400 feet long, 8 feet high and, as art
objects go, something of a dinosaur. Now this monumental relic of
the pre-cinema era has taken up residence through May 2 at the
Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The showpiece is a recently rediscovered panorama, ``Pilgrim's
Progress.'' This depiction of John Bunyan's religious allegory was
painted by Joseph Kyle and Jacob Dallas and based on designs by
distinguished contemporary artists.
</P>
<P>
   Presented in theaters, churches and meeting houses and
accompanied by narration, sermons and music, the 54-scene canvas
was unrolled from wooden spools across a stage in a show that
lasted almost two hours. At the Montclair Museum, ``Pilgrim's
Progress,'' is being presented in 200-foot sections on the walls of
two galleries.

BRITISH GROUP URGES FREER EXCHANGE OF ACTORS WITH U.S.
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A British arts group has strongly criticized a union agreement
that governs the number of British and American theater actors
working on opposite sides of the Atlantic, and its report is
raising hopes that the restrictions can be ended or loosened.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current rules, a producer who wants to bring a British
actor to New York must seek the approval of Actors Equity, the
American union, just as British Equity's approval is needed to
bring an American actor to London. In theory the two unions try to
balance the exchange. But over the years some Britons have charged
that provisions for exchange have been unevenly and unfairly
applied.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans have said that because so much British theater is
government-subsidized and costs are lower in London than New York,
British producers and actors would reduce jobs for Americans in a
more open marketplace. It costs roughly $500,000 to mount a play in
London, compared with some $2.5 million in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the British Council, the country's main
international cultural agency, argues that the current policies
mean that audiences in both countries miss seeing a great deal of
theater and that many actors lose opportunities to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of this report is that it provides a thorough
and systematic analysis of a system that is failing actors on both
sides of the Atlantic and ultimately the theatergoing public as
well,'' said Jed Bernstein, executive director of The League of
American Theaters and Producers, the national trade organization.
</P>
<P>
   The report for the British Council charges that American
Equity's influence in the international exchange of actors ``is
unquestionably operating in restraint of trade between the two
countries.'' It adds that the American union's rationale for its
approach is based on ``short-term quasi-economic arguments for
which there is little if any justification.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Eisenberg, executive director of Actors Equity, said
Tuesday that the union was willing to sit down and talk with
British Equity, which has requested a meeting because of the
report. But he said the trade agreement was still needed to protect
American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American actor is underemployed and underpaid,'' Eisenberg
said. ``Frequently, when a production comes in, it takes away a job
and a career opportunity from an American actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do in the exchange is deal with the
artistic complaint of obstruction,'' Eisenberg continued. ``Open
borders, given the lack of subsidy and support, would work to the
detriment of actors in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three ways a British actor's move to New York can be
approved: if he or she is deemed by Actors Equity to be a star; if
the production is mounted by what the union considers a ``unit
company,'' one of long standing that performs in repertory, like
the Royal Shakespeare Company; or if the actor provides ``unique
services,'' like those of the African chanters in ``The Lion
King.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the only way a British actor can be approved by
Equity's Alien Committee is as part of an exchange in which the
British producers put up a bond and guarantee that an equal number
of American actors will be employed in Britain, at United States
wage rates, in commensurate roles.
</P>
<P>
   No equivalent provisions appear in formal agreements between
British Equity and the Society of London Theater and Theatrical
Management Association, but in practice the same categories of
exemption are generally observed.
</P>
<P>
   The curious calculus controlling exchanges, rather than
providing clear guidelines, has prompted many emotional arguments
about who is a star, what constitutes a unit company and the
definition of unique services.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of January, Actors Equity rejected a bid to bring to
Broadway the entire British cast of the Royal National Theater's
highly praised revival of ``Oklahoma!,'' saying that American
actors could fill the roles.
</P>
<P>
   The actors' exchange is ``the only situation of its kind in the
world, and it's terribly close to artists' hearts,'' Sally Cowling,
head of drama and dance for the British Council, said Tuesday in a
telephone interview from London. ``We're just saying this is not in
the artists' best interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first and most simple objective is to add my voice to the
encouraging voices,'' she said. ``There are still a lot of
problems. Let's get around the table again. There were a lot of
companies and individuals on both sides of the Atlantic who didn't
know what the situation was.''
</P>
<P>
   The main argument running through the British report is that the
two countries have a special relationship, culturally and
historically, and that the pattern of cultural exchange generally
operates freely in every realm except the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one seeks to count Dame Janet Baker's appearances at
Carnegie Hall and tally them against Jessye Norman's at the Royal
Festival Hall or the Barbican,'' the report said. ``There is no
suggestion that because Andre Previn takes charge of the London
Symphony Orchestra, a British conductor must be given a reciprocal
opportunity in, say, Chicago or Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   The two actors' unions and the producers' groups from both
countries all met for the first time in London in 1997 to hammer
out some of the issues. At that time the producers proposed a
temporary moratorium, perhaps lasting two or three years, on all
union restrictions governing the actors' exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Equity rejected the idea at the time, saying that the
flow would be in one direction, to the detriment of American
actors. The producers then proposed the idea of some sort of
subsidy package to underwrite American productions in London and
guarantee some American jobs in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become more pressing in recent years as more plays
have emigrated to New York from Britain and Ireland, among them
``Art,'' ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' and ``The Judas Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   American actors on the London stage in recent months have
included Kevin Spacey at the Old Vic as Hickey in a revival of
``The Iceman Cometh'' and David Dukes, Stacey Keach and George
Wendt, who replaced the all-British cast of ``Art.'' There is also
an all-American cast in a revival of ``Show Boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope we can get back round the table,'' said
Rupert Rhymes, the chief executive of the London producers' group.
``Obviously what we'd like to see happen, as far as our members are
concerned, is there be a free exchange, at least for a trial
period.''

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT TAKES TO THE STAGE  
 HONORABLE MENTOR  
 LEO WHO? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ JAY OLIVA, the president of New York University, has
been memorizing lines. He has been working with a dialect coach. He
has been trying not to tumble off the stage. And all because of a
remark he made at the cast party for a student production of a
Gershwin revue last year. ``Somebody said, `We're going to do
`Brigadoon' next,''' Oliva recalled. ``I said, `Terrific, I play
the bagpipes.'''
</P>
<P>
   The students from the Musical Theater Program in the
university's School of Education cast him in the Lerner and Loewe
musical without so much as a formal audition. ``They came around
and said: `There's a part here _ Lundie, a schoolteacher _ and
that's what you are. Would you do it?' I thought, `Why the hell
not?'''
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the bagpipes and the five-string banjo, which
Oliva also plays. The role of Lundie is a speaking part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids wanted to know, `Have you ever acted before?''' he
said. His answer, basically, was no, but that did not stop him from
talking about how he had formed a trio and played in Irish bars
when he was in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the Feb. 12 opening and the seven-performance run,
he has been attending nightly rehearsals. He is even trying to look
the part. ``I just came from the optometrist,'' he said Tuesday.
``It's supposed to be an 18th-century character translated into the
20th. Wearing aviator glasses didn't work. So now I look like my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Honorable Mentor
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Never in my life did I think I'd be going to the
White House, especially not to introduce the first lady,'' FANNIE
CYRIAQUE, a 17-year-old high school senior from Manhattan, was
saying Tuesday. ``Not long ago I didn't even think `I'm going to
college.'''
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday she will introduce HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON at an
East Room ceremony about mentoring. No wonder she has already been
accepted by Northeastern University and the State University of New
York at Stony Brook and is hoping for acceptances from Cornell,
Yale and the University of Michigan: Her mentor has been ROBIN
GUSICK, the community outreach director at Kaplan Educational
Centers, the test-preparation service.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie said she was nervous about speaking at the White House,
but the Clintons have no reason to be nervous about what she will
say. Of Mrs. Clinton she said: ``She represents the mother of
democracy. I admire her 100 percent.'' The West Wing would like
her, too. Of the president's Senate trial, Fannie said: ``I think
the whole impeachment process is irrelevant. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Who?
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The anniversary was in December, but who'd have
come in December?'' said SONIA DEL CORRAL, the daughter of the
Victor in Victor's Cafe 52, on 52nd Street near Broadway. ``There
were too many parties in December.''
</P>
<P>
   So they scheduled the restaurant's 35th anniversary party for
Tuesday night and celebrated VICTOR DEL CORRAL, who came to the
United States from Cuba in 1957 and six years later borrowed $3,000
to open a restaurant at 71st Street and Columbus Avenue. (The
family opened the 52nd Street restaurant in 1980 and later closed
the original one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipes are still my mom's,'' Ms. del Corral said. ``The
food is our interpretation of what the food would be if Fidel
weren't there and food in Cuba had evolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else that seems not to have evolved is del Corral's
awareness of celebrity culture. ``You say, `Dad, there's MICHAEL
DOUGLAS,''' she said, recalling the night in December when the star
of ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Fatal Attraction'' walked in. ``You
explain the movies he's been in, you explain the character, and he
goes over and goes, `Mi amigo.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another night LEONARDO DICAPRIO came in with a group of 19
people. Ms. del Corral tried to explain ``Titanic,'' which del
Corral had not seen.
</P>
<P>
   On yet another night, JENNIFER LOPEZ arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't have to say what movie she'd been in,'' Ms. del
Corral said. ``She's so beautiful, he goes over and sits down and
has dinner with her. Fortunately, she speaks Spanish.''
