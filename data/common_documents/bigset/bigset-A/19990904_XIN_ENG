<HEADLINE> Turkey Asked to Back Negotiations on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Friday stressed that Cyprus anticipates proof
from Turkey that it is willing to change its stance and backs
negotiations for a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou also said the Cyprus government has noted
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's statement that the trend on
the Cyprus issue is positive.
</P>
<P>
Papaterou was commenting on statements made Thursday by Cem
and his British counterpart Robin Cook after a meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus issue, Cem said "the trend is positive."
</P>
<P>
Cook said they both agreed they should work for a solution to
the issue "that is mutually acceptable."
</P>
<P>
"Britain is very committed to making sure that we try and
create the opportunity for both sides to exchange their views and
to come to that (solution)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "proof" the Cyprus government wants from
Turkey, Papapetrou said "the Turkish side should first abandon
the conditions it set out to respond positively to an invitation
by the (United Nations) Secretary-General" for talks on Cyprus
this fall.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demand
international recognition of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots state
as well as the establishment of a confederation of two states on
the island.

<HEADLINE> Oman Oil Exports Reach 150 Million Barrels by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Oman exported over 150
million barrels of crude oil in the first half of this year, with
Japan and Thailand as its two largest oil importers.
</P>
<P>
Oman's oil exports this year reached 150,545,600 barrels by
the end of June. This was slightly up by 0.32 percent compared to
oil exports during the same period last year, which amounted to
150,068,300 barrels, according to latest statistics from the
Omani Ministry of National Economy.
</P>
<P>
Imports by Japan, the largest customer of Omani crude oil,
rose to about 50 million barrels in the first half of the year, up
by 40 percent from 35 million barrels in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The average price of Oman's crude oil went up by 6.1 percent to
12.95 U.S. dollars a barrel during the first six months of this
year from 12.20 dollars in the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oman is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Export
Countries, but it participated in the campaign to raise oil
prices by reducing production.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf country's known oil reserves are close to 5500
million barrels. It has a daily producing capacity of 900,000
barrels.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Security Chief Discuss Money Laundering Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with Federal Security Service Director Nikolai Patrushev
Friday to discuss a widely reported Russian money laundering
scandal.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in the Kremlin, Patrushev said he told
Yeltsin that the case "is purely political and is connected with
the approaching U.S. elections."
</P>
<P>
"It is simply absurd to speak of 15 billion to 20 billion U.S.
dollars (that could have been laundered according to Western media
reports)," the Interfax news agency quoted Patrushev as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was referring the Western media reports that Russian mob
bosses, with Kremlin complicity, spirited as much as 15 billion
dollars in embezzled public and corporate funds through the Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
Some Russian newspapers see the reports as a Western media
campaign to discredit Russia.
</P>
<P>
And both speakers of the two houses of the Russian parliament
have denounced the reports as Western attempts to freeze loans to
Russia and stir up trouble in the country before the 2000
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Patrushev said the Federal Security Service, the main successor
to the Soviet KGB, the Prosecutor General's office and other
Russian law enforcement bodies should work with their U.S.
counterparts to conduct a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
"So far the FBI has not supplied us with any documents or
materials," he said, adding that officials from the Federal
Security Service, the tax police and the Prosecutor General's
office will probably have to visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Russia "does not intend to defend itself in the wake of media
publications (about Russia's alleged money laundering) in some
countries."
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to explain ourselves. As for Russia's good
name, it has one," Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying in Yerevan,
where he was paying a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov told a briefing here Friday that Moscow had not received
any official documented proof of the massive leakage of capital
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
He said the Prosecutor General's office has requested such
information from the U.S. "When they arrive, the Finance Ministry
is ready to assign its experts to analyze the documents," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Zimbabwe To Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Friday said that IMF's 193 million U.S. dollars standby
credit for Zimbabwe to support its economy for the next 14 months
had been approved.
</P>
<P>
It was important for the Zimbabwean government to focus its
economic stabilization effort on tightening money supply, IMF said
in its latest survey.
</P>
<P>
"The stabilization effort centres on continued restraint,
including recent steps to bring monetary supply growth under
control, and price adjustments in the parastatal sectors, notably
in the oil and electricity sectors," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
In its letter of intent to the IMF, the Zimbabwean government
projected that growth in real GDP in 1999 would be 1.2 percent
which was a downward revision from previous expectations because
of lower output from the mining and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe sets a target to cut inflation to 30 percent by the
end of the year and reduces budget deficit to around 5.3 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The country also had to ease control on trade and foreign
exchange, which was imposed last year due to balance of payments
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government had already begun to implement some
of the measures agreed with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Highest Monthly Auto Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa recorded the
highest monthly figures for auto sales in August, according to the
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The total new auto sales for August amounted to 27,398 units, a
7.5 percent higher compared to the figure in August last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the automobile association, the new car sales of
17,853 in the past month were 9.6 percent up over the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of light commercial vehicles and mini-buses were at 8,579
units, an improvement of 5.2 percent over the previous August, but
down by 3.2 percent from July.
</P>
<P>
Toyota came on top of the pile with overall August sales of
6,410 vehicles, followed by Samcor (Mazda, Ford, Jaguar) at 4,394,
Volkswagen at 4,232 and Delta at 4,005.
</P>
<P>
"The market is showing the signs of recovery that were
predicted for the second half of 1999," South African Press
Association quoted Johan van Zyl, managing director of the
marketing section of Toyota South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The growth process is, however, expected to be a gradual one,
but one that holds the promise of a degree of stability.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next three months new model activity can be expected
to stimulate the market as can aggressive marketing on the part of
dealers and manufacturers," the managing director said.
"Generally, the outlook is for the current positive trend to be a
sustainable one."
</P>
<P>
However, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of South Africa added a note of caution, pointing out that medium
and heavy commercial vehicle sales - a leading indicator of
investment trends - had remained under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales for August totaled
966 units, compared to 1,055 for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
August sales were boosted by significant fleet buying, said the
 automobile association.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, with South Africa's economic fundamentals
turning progressively more positive, the association said that
prospects looked more promising.
</P>
<P>
Current industry projections for the next year indicated that
new vehicle sales volumes, in aggregate terms, should grow by 10
percent.

<P>
LUANDA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 27,000
newly-displaced victims of war arrived in the cities of Uige and
Negage of Angola's northern Uige Province in the past two weeks
due to fresh military actions in the areas, media reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-governor of the Uige Province Maravilha Dembo was quoted
as saying that the government is seeking solutions for the urgent
humanitarian situation caused by the newly-emerged displaced
people in the cities of Uige, capital of the province, and Negage,
a city 40 kilometers southeast to Uige.
</P>
<P>
To make an appraisal of the situation of the displaced, who are
in need of accommodation, food, clothes and medical assistance,
Director of the Angolan Branch of the World Food Program (WFP),
Francesco Stripoli, Thursday made a visit to the province.
</P>
<P>
Stripoli has mentioned the availability of the conclusion of
the immediate assistance work for the displaced by the WFP Angolan
Branch, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"We talked directly with the displaced people to make clear
their necessities. All of them asked for tools and seeds for
cultivating the soil," said Stripoli, who visited the camps of the
displaced in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The governor also said the visit paid by Stripoli and his group
has encouraged the local authorities on the issue of reintegrating
the cities and giving assistance to the displaced people.

BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Deputy Foreign
Minister Olexander Maidannyk Friday expressed here his country's
support for Lebanon's position in the Middle East peace process,
the state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We support the implementation of the United Nations
resolutions, including Resolution 425," Maidannyk told a news
conference after meeting with Lebanese Foreign Ministry's Director
General Zafer Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. after Israel's first
invasion of Lebanon in 1978, calls for a unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who came here Thursday on a three-day visit,

GAZA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said Friday afternoon there were
obstacles facing the Palestinians and Israel on the implementation
of the Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing in his office here, Arafat said upon his
return from the Egyptian port city of Alexandria that "so far no
agreement was reached between us and them (the Israelis) and there
are still many difficulties facing the Wye Accord implementation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Minister of Planning and International

regarding the Palestinian prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
"There are some obstacles blocking the agreement and they
should be removed to ensure the arrival at a final solution,"
Erekat added, pointing out that "We cannot get into the final
status talks without the solutions of the current issues with
Israel and receiving written assurances from the United States."
</P>
<P>
No agreement would be reached without the settlement of the
prisoner issue, the PNA official added.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday successfully
tested its fifth-generation "Topol-M" intercontinental ballistic
missile, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the test, the eighth so far, a Topol-M fired from a
Plesetsk testing ground at 15:44 Moscow time (11:44 GMT) hit its
target at the Kura testing ground on Russia's Far Eastern
Kamchatka peninsula "with a high degree of accuracy," Interfax
reported, quoting Strategic Rocket Forces commander
Colonel-General Vladimir Yakovlev.
</P>
<P>
The pre-launch operations, the launch and the flight of the
missile all went ahead smoothly in accordance with the program,
Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M can be launched either from silos or from mobile
platforms. Its availability for service is twice that of other
Russian strategic missiles, and it is 2-2.5 times more accurate,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The range of the three-stage, solid fuel burning Topol-M is
11,000 kilometers. Its length is 22.7 meters with a maximum
diameter of 1.86 meters and launch weight of 47.2 tons.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Expects More Friendly, Closer Sino-Thai Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand will
establish a more friendly and closer relationship of all-round
cooperation on the basis of the existing friendly relations,
visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of accelerated multi-polarization and
globalization, closer Sino-Thai relations will make new
contributions to peace and development of the two countries, the
region and the world at large, Jiang said at a reception hosted by
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called China and Thailand "close neighbors", saying the
two countries enjoy geographical and cultural proximity, whose
peoples have close ties of blood, share a desire for prosperity
and progress and are both committed to peace, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Since our two countries established diplomatic relations 24
years ago, our bilateral relations have always maintained a
momentum of sound development with friendly exchanges and mutually
beneficial cooperation constantly growing in all fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the joint statement on Sino-Thai cooperation for
the 21st century signed by the two countries earlier this year,
Jiang said as the first instrument concluded between China and an
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country for the
bilateral relations, the statement "fully attests to the profound
basis, substantial contents and important significance of China-
Thailand relations".
</P>
<P>
As for the internal situation in China, Jiang said 50 years
after its founding, China has made tremendous progress in its
economic and social development as well as marked improvement in
its overall productivity and its people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial crisis and the mammoth floods,
China's economy continues to grow steadily and China now enjoys
social stability, ethnic unity and prosperous development of all
its undertaking, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the expected return of Macao to her motherland in
December, saying it proves once again after the smooth return of
Hong Kong two years ago that the "one country, two systems" is
correct guideline for accomplishing national reunification.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan is an integral part of the Chinese
territory and the eventual reunification across the Taiwan Straits
is an inevitable trend and commands the popular will.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to divide China is doomed to failure in disgrace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Thai government and people for their
understanding of and support to China over the years in her course
of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Thai people for their "persevering and
pioneering spirit" and "world acknowledged achievements" in
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The darkest day of the Asian financial crisis is over, he said,
adding that the Thai economy is steadily moving towards recovery
thanks to the Thai people's unremitting efforts.
</P>
<P>
He wished that the Thai people will be able to rejuvenate their
country's economy and build Thailand into a more prosperous and
beautiful country in the upcoming new century.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chuan said Thai and Chinese peoples share close
affinities socially, culturally and ethnically.
</P>
<P>
He said President Jiang's visit is a "historic event" in the
relations between the two countries, which will be "enshrined" in
the hearts of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said he is pleased to see the signing of the joint statement
on the Plan of Action for the 21st Century between the two
countries, which covers every dimension of our relations.
</P>
<P>
"The communique reaffirms our determination to co-operate even
more closely as we enter the 21st century in order to bring about
economic prosperity and well-being for the peoples of our two
countries as well as contribute towards peace, security and
economic stability of Asia and of the world as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that Thailand and the People's Republic of
China will also share an even brighter future ahead," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Cashew Workers Call for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Union of
Cashew Workers Friday called on the Assembly or parliament to pass
a bill for protecting the cashew processing industry by banning,
for a 10-year period, the export of raw cashew nuts.
</P>
<P>
General secretary of the union, Boaventura Mondlane, said at a
press conference in Maputo that the government's policy of
liberalizing the trade in cashews, imposed by the World Bank, had
led to the almost total paralysis of the local processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane said that the great majority of cashew processing
workers are out of a job because of this.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization "did not consider any balance between trade and
industry, but prioritized the export of raw nuts at the expense of
the national processing industry," Mondlane pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted the liberalization process would "leave thousands of
workers unemployed, waste the investments that have already been
made, and discourage new investment in the sector."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his union fully supports the bill before
parliament because "it seeks to save the industry, by prioritizing
the supply of cashews to the factories and it will promote just
prices for the producers, protect the workers' rights, and create
a climate of tranquillity for new investments in the sector."
</P>
<P>
The raw nuts were exported to India, and the local processing
factories found themselves starved of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"We want a suspension of raw nut exports," said Mondlane.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane argued that if the Assembly rejects the cashew bill
presented by some deputies of the ruling Mozambique Liberation
Front Party (FRELIMO), or fails to debate it, "it will be losing a
major opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Mondlane said that the National Union of Cashew Workers is
ready to stage demonstrations in all the main cashew centers, but
he declined to give any further details.
</P>
<P>
The workers, he said, would make their dissatisfaction known to
the Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Injured in U.S.-British Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was
injured on Friday in U.S.-British warplanes attacks on civilian
targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:00 (0700 GMT), 10 formations of
United States and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes attacked some civilian facilities and service
installations in the region, injuring one civilian, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the
enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's four-night massive airstrikes against
Iraq, U.S. and British warplanes have made 11,912 sorties over the
two no-fly zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian facilities and military sites, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia can and must help
rebuild the Yugoslav economy, First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai
Aksyonenko said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aksyonenko made the statement following his talks with visiting
Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Borislav Milosevic, the Yugoslav Ambassador to Russia who took
part in the talks, said a commercial contract with Gazprom on the
delivery of natural gas through 2010 had been discussed.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said the Russian government has pledged to support
the project. The Cabinet is expected to review the document at a
meeting next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade expects to receive 1.2 billion cubic meters of Russian
gas before the end of the year, Milosevic said.
</P>
<P>
Oil product deliveries were also discussed. Russia is ready to
begin deliveries, but so far no specific commercial offers have
been received, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
"During the talks, both parties praised the political relations
between the two countries and expressed the desire to strengthen
them," Interfax quoted Milosevic as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Deal Near, But Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians
moved closer to an agreement over the implementation of a
U.S.-brokered peace deal Friday, but disputes still remained.
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said the two sides
were "very close" to reaching a deal on the implementation of the
Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
"We are very close...I'm optimistic. It could be that we'll
even conclude a deal today," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing his remarks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
Office issued a statement saying an agreement would possibly be
signed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A security and logistics preparation team has left for the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where a signing
ceremony was presumably to be held, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian sources said earlier in the day
that the two sides had resolved their difference on the issue of
Palestinian prisoners, the major obstacle to a deal on the
implementation of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Palestinian side had accepted the Israeli
proposal that Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners,
or political prisoners called by the Palestinians. The
Palestinians have demanded the release of 400.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of this dispute, which scotched a tentatively
planned signing ceremony in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria
Thursday afternoon, might pave the way for a final deal on the
Wye implementation. But there was still difference between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
"There is no deal. There are many difficulties," said
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, who
returned to Gaza Friday afternoon from Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were reportedly disputing now over a clause in
the draft deal banning the two sides from taking unilateral
actions in Gaza and the West Bank before a final status agreement
is reached.
</P>
<P>
These actions include the building of Jewish settlements by
the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of an independent
Palestinian state by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright will hold talks with Arafat in Gaza later Friday, the
second meeting between them in two days.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state was forced to intervene between
Israel and the Palestinians after they failed to bridge the gaps
by themselves. She met Arafat in Alexandria, where she had
planned to attend the signing ceremony, Thursday night before
flying to Israel into three and half hours of talks with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in early July promising to move forward
the Middle East peace process on all tracks, Barak has asked
Washington to scale down its mediating role in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to let the two sides resolve
their difference directly.
</P>
<P>
During her five-day visit to the region, which started in
Morocco Wednesday, Albright had planned to look beyond the
current Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to help push forward the
final status talks, which deal with thorny issues like a
Palestinian state and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
She is also trying to help Israel and Syria resume their
talks, which froze three years ago. She will travel to Damascus
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A deal over the implementation of the Wye agreement would be a
major achievement for Barak since it would be his first agreement
with the Palestinians and certainly would boost the confidence of
the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, signed by Arafat and Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, calls on Israel to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over
a period of 12 weeks. Netanyahu froze the deal after carrying out
its first stage.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have
made significant progress in their talks on Barak's proposal to
revise the implementation of the agreement to the benefit of both
sides, including a new timetable for the remaining two stages of
Israeli troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
They have also agreed upon several sideline issues such as the
construction of a seaport in Gaza and the opening of safe
passages between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said, however, if the two sides could not agree on
all issues, it would carry out the Wye agreement as written,
which would mean an extended withdrawal and the release of
Palestinian prisoners according to Israeli criteria.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Eritrean Religious Leaders Meet Over Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the
Ethiopian religious leaders has left for Oslo, Norway to discuss
at the weekend with its Eritrean counterparts how to peacefully
resolve the 16-month border conflict between the two Horn of
Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported Friday that the delegation
is composed of religious leaders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,
the Islamic Affairs Supreme Council and the Catholic and
Evangelical Churches.
</P>
<P>
The peace conference, organized by the Norwegian Church, is the
 continuation of a similar conference held in Oslo earlier this
year, the delegation leader Abune Paulos was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The patriarch expressed conviction that the conference would
come up with some positive results helpful to settle the border
crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A similar peace conference scheduled to be held in France last
month between religious leaders of the Ethiopian and Eritrean
Orthodox churches failed due to the Eritrean side's refusal to
show up at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May last year. Tens
of thousands of people have reportedly been killed and wounded in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Only Thursday, the Office of the Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson said in a statement that Ethiopian troops on the same
day repelled an offensive by the Eritrean troops at Chin Keren on
the Zalambessa front.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government has denied Ethiopia's accusation by
saying that there has not been any fighting on any of the fronts
in the past two months since the start of the rains, "apart from
the occasional shelling invariably initiated by Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry Thursday claimed that the
apparent purpose of Ethiopia's accusations was to divert the
international attention from Ethiopia's reluctance to accept the
peace process sponsored by the Organization of African Unity
(UNITA).

OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Up to 10 people died with 40
others injured Friday morning in a worst traffic accident near
Windsor, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
According to CTV, the massive accident took place at 8:15 a.m.
in fog along a busy highway leading to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Smoke is rising from the piles of wreckage involving at least
40 cars and tractor-trailers on the highway and the nearby field,
where rescuers are trying to find the remains of victims trapped
inside vehicles and burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
The report said the two-way traffic is busy and too narrow,

<P>
The injured people are in "fair conditions" without life risk,

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Uganda to Strengthen Coop in AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye said Friday that his country is willing
to strengthen cooperation with Uganda in AIDS prevention and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks while meeting with Uganda's
First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya
Kategaya at the International Conference Center in Ugandan capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who came here Thursday and spearheaded a big delegation
on a study visit to Uganda, said Tanzania and Uganda are both
suffering from the AIDS scourge and that Tanzania can learn a lot
from Uganda in enhancing people's awareness and mobilization of
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
"We think the experience we have learnt from here will be more
relevant than that learnt from somewhere else like Europe because
we share many things culturally and economically," the Tanzanian
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to increase collaboration in every close-border
activity, in research and treatment, in fighting to bring down the
AIDS drugs available in markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that traditional healers in Tanzania would also learn
from their colleagues in Uganda. Herbal healing can be very
practical and effective if enough research work is done.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya, who acted as the acting prime minister of Uganda,
noted that the problem of HIV/AIDS cannot be viewed as solely a
matter of health. It concerns economy, education, agriculture and
culture.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Uganda still faces a serious situation in AIDS
 prevention although the prevalence rate has been decreasing over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more health centers and surveillance units
to be established across the country in a bid to eradicate the
pandemic from the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian delegation, composed of over 30 people including
ministers, members of parliament, health officials and others, is
leaving for home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS prevalence in Tanzania is roughly 12 percent at
present. A total of 1.5 million people there are supposed to be
HIV-positive. Some 500,000 people have developed full-blown AIDS
and 400,000 children orphaned since the first AIDS case was
reported in 1983 in the country.
</P>
<P>
AIDS prevalence rate in Uganda was more than 25 percent and
even higher in early 90s. It has plummeted to the current level
of a little more than 10 percent as a result of massive
sensitization and firm government commitment.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Uganda is said to be the only country in Africa
which enjoys a downward trend of AIDS prevalence.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Turkey to Become Candidate for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see
neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union (EU)
membership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Papandreou said that Greece wanted to see Turkey
as a candidate country but Turkey and Greece's partners could not
overlook the fact that the neighboring country had
responsibilities and obligations.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey was ready to undertake these responsibilities, Greece
had no objection to helping, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also consistently blocked the more than 1-billion
U.S. dollars EU financial aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that it supports Turkey in its
efforts to join EU but the condition is that Ankara must improve
its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To ease its tense relations with Turkey, Greece will in the
near future partially lift its veto on EU funding for Turkey after
the devastating earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which has
claimed thousands of lives.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parliament to Be Enlarged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Interim
Political Authority (IPA) announced Friday that the number of
seats in the kingdom's parliament will be increased by 50 to 130
after elections scheduled for April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The increase was meant to ensure political stability in the
small southern African country, which was rocked by unrest last
year, IPA co- chairman Khauhelo Raditapole told a press
conference in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take this decision as a compromise in the interest
of peace," although the move "was going to be a heavy burden on
taxpayers." Agence France Presse quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IPA, which will oversee the April elections, also decided
the parliamentary seats will be allocated according to a
combination of proportional representation and the
first-past-the-post system, which had been in place in Lesotho
since the country became independent in 1965.
</P>
<P>
However, Raditapole said the IPA, which consists of two
representatives of each of Lesotho's 12 political parties, was
still mulling over how the 130 seats would be divided between the
two systems of allocation.
</P>
<P>
The IPA was established and charged with holding elections
within 18 months after opposition protests over the outcome of May
1998 elections brought the government to the brink of collapse a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Botswana sent a military intervention force to
the kingdom to restore order, but that mission resulted in the
deaths of 75 people and massive destruction.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Dialogue Best Way to Address Karabakh Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday that Moscow attaches great importance to an
active and direct dialogue between the Armenian and Azerbaijani
presidents in their efforts to tackle the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
"Direct dialogue is the best way to begin looking for a
solution to the Nagorno- Karabakh problem," the Interfax news
agency quoted Ivanov as saying in Yerevan, where the Russian
minister was on a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an enclave inside Azerbaijan where over 80
percent of the population are ethnic Armenians. Armenia and
Azerbaijan have been grappling over the enclave's status over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who flew in from Baku, Azerbaijan, denied reports that
Russia is to abandon the idea of "a common state" in resolving the
problem. "All peace initiatives are put forward jointly. The Minsk
Group is continuing its efforts to resolve the conflict," Ivanov
said, referring to the group chaired by Russian, U.S. and French
officials.
</P>
<P>
Russia wants the closest possible relations with Transcaucasian
countries, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"All the Caucasus nations must sit down and discuss how to
transform the region into a stable and prosperous area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yerevan was the second stop of Ivanov's three-nation
Transcaucasian tour. From Yerevan, Ivanov will go to Tbilisi,
Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Central Bank Intervenes Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, has intervened in the foreign exchange market by
selling five million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at reducing pressure on the currency shilling
 following the end of the coffee season, said a press release
issued by the bank's headquarters Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank is monitoring closely developments in the market and
will not hesitate to intervene if needed, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's capacity to intervene was further enhanced
by receipt of 22.87 million dollars from the International
Monetary Fund Thursday, it added.
</P>
<P>
When the Ugandan shilling dropped to the rock bottom against
the dollar in May, the central bank intervened with big sums and
succeeded in saving the depreciating currency.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- President Thabo Mbeki
held talks with Rwandan Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul
Kagame on Congo peace in Pretoria Friday, South African
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
"The discussions were about the process of making peace in the
Great Lakes region," South African Press Association quoted
Mankahlana as saying.
</P>
<P>
The presidential aide declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni earlier this week warned that
Ugandan troops would launch vigorous counterattacks if provoked by
their Rwandan counterparts in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are supposed allies, but back rival factions
of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), which is fighting to
overthrow Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Kisangani in northeastern Congo between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops last month, stalling the attempts to
implement a cease- fire deal reached in Zambian capital Lusaka on
July 10.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the RCD finally endorsed the Lusaka peace accord
already signed by the six countries directly involved in the
conflicts in the third largest African country.

<HEADLINE> China Is Not a Risk for Panama Canal: Canal Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The presence of the
Hutchison Wampoa Port of China transnational firm in the Panama
Canal does not represent any danger for the security of the
interoceanic waterway, said Ricardo Martinelli, Panama's new
Minister for Canal Matters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he has talked with United States officials, who said
that "there is not any danger" in the presence of the Chinese
consortiums in the reverted areas.
</P>
<P>
Martinelli said that the auctions for the enfranchisement of
the two ports in the canal were crystaline and clean.
</P>
<P>
However, some U.S. sectors, especially those related to the
right, have questioned the fact that both entrances to the Canal,
the port of Cristobal, in the Atlantic, and Balboa, in the
Pacific, are administered by Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
This, according to some U.S. officials, is a consequence of the
transference of the control of the maritime seaway that connects
the two oceans.
</P>
<P>
The Hutchison transnational firm, with headquarters in Hong
Kong, China, won the bidding for the franchise of the two ports in
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract signed with Panama, the Chinese
shipping company must invest more than 100 million dollars to
modernize the two ports and pay Panama more than 22 million
dollars a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Vietnam have put final touches to their trade pact for normal
trade relations, U.S. government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trade pact was revised this week by negotiators of both
countries in Washington and has been sent to Hanoi for review by
the Vietnamese government, a State Department source said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are considering the text and are in the
finalization process," said a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that Washington hopes Hanoi will complete
its review in the coming days, allowing President Bill Clinton or
Barshefsky to formally sign the agreement at a summit of Asia
Pacific leaders in New Zealand next week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will have to be approved by the U.S. Congress and
Vietnam's National Assembly after formal signing, meaning the pact
could be enacted by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
The pact, which took three years to negotiate, will reduce
tariffs on goods and services, protect intellectual property and
improve investment relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For American companies, normal trade ties will expand their
access to a market with 77 million consumers.

</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has accepted the Israeli proposal that
Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners, or political
prisoners called by the Palestinians. The Palestinians had
initially demanded the release of 400.
</P>
<P>
Israel will also begin in a few days to hand over 11 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians. The final withdrawal will be

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Lift Fish Export Ban on East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Public and private
stakeholders in the fisheries sector in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
have complained against the European Union (EU) for maintaining
its ban on fish exports from this East African region.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day environmental workshop at Kisumu, a
Lake Victoria port town in southwestern Kenyan, the participants
urged the EU to lift the ban imposed on the three states early
this year, sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
They described claims by a EU team which recently visited the
region that fish exports from the three states were contaminated
as " discriminatory and one aimed at strangling the region's fish
industry."
</P>
<P>
Ezekiel Okemwa, director of the Kenya Marine and Fisheries
Research Institute, told an international seminar on fisheries and
biodiversity management held in Nairobi late last month that the
country's fishery industry had fulfilled all the EU fish export
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mathias Wafula, an assistant director of fisheries, said at the
workshop that Kenya had completely stamped out fish poisoning -
the EU's main reason for the ban.
</P>
<P>
Since the export ban was imposed, Wafula lamented that the fish
prices in the local market have plummeted from an average of 40
shillings per kilo to between 15 and 20 shillings ( 75 shillings
equal to one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
Wafula also noted that the remaining markets of Japan, Israel
and the United States were relatively insignificant importers of
fish from the region.
</P>
<P>
The participants suggested the harmonization of fisheries
legislation in the three countries for the effective management of
the lake's resources, and urged for more information flow and
exchange of research findings in the respect.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following two days of intensive
shuttle diplomacy by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
A tentatively planned signing ceremony in the Egyptian port
city of Alexandria Thursday afternoon, in which Albright had
planned to attend, was scotched by the continued difference
between the two sides over the issue of Palestinian prisoners
to be released by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright held talks with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza Friday night after separate talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David
Levy early Friday morning and afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A deal over the implementation of the Wye agreement would be a
major achievement for Barak since it will be his first agreement
with the Palestinians since he took office in early July on a
platform to revive the Middle East peace process on
all tracks.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Children under Unbelievable Suffering: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. Envoy Friday pleaded to
the international community to help Sierra Leone children, who he
claimed were under unbelievable suffering, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, the UN Secretary General's special representative
for children, said in his visit to the war-torn country that more
than half of the estimated three million people displaced by the
war were children and that the suffering they had endured,
including abduction, rape and mutilation, was beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
Girls as young as twelve had been abducted and repeatedly raped
by rebels; boys had had their parents and grandparents killed
before their eyes and then had their own hands chopped off, said
the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said there were at least one and a half million S.
Leonean children in desperate need of help.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peace accord signed last month in Togo's capital
Lome, the situation in this west African country was still
precarious and dangerous, said the envoy. Only a few hundred
combatants have been demobilized and it is estimated, he said,
that there are a total of 25,000 men still under arms.
</P>
<P>
The UN official said it was imperative that the rebel leader,
Foday Sankoh, who is still outside the country, should return to
Sierra Leone to give a push to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
While in another latest development, the president of Sierra
Leone, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, is expected to visit Nigeria very soon
for talks with his Nigerian counterpart, Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes as the first Nigerian troops, who have been
defending his government against rebel attacks, arrived home
following the signing of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The visit is believed to be dominated by the issue of the
return of the Nigerian troops, which is welcomed in Nigeria, but
is a source of great concern to many in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean president is expected to seek further
assurances that the withdrawal will be gradual enough for him to
establish his own security measures in their place.

WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A twin-engine plane crashed
into a strip Friday morning in West Palm Beach of Florida State in
the United States, killing all the eight people aboard, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, Beechcraft King Air BE-90, was on a flight from
Pontiac, Michigan State, to Boca Raton, Florida State, when it
reported engine problem.
</P>
<P>
The pilot called the control tower for permission to land at
Palm Beach International Airport, but crashed about one kilometer
short of the runway.
</P>
<P>
George Prellezo, spokesman of the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board, said the aircraft was not an ambulance plane as had
been suspected earlier.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that it took federal aviation officials hours
to confirm the number because the wreckage was so twisted and
crumpled.
</P>
<P>
The plane hit the corner of a roof at a strip mall, then
clipped power lines and flipped onto a chain link fence at the
edge of the airport. It immediately became engulfed in flames.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Vote Result to Be Announced Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to announce the result of the ballot on
East Timor's future at 9:00 pm (EST) Friday in New York, to
be followed by a Security Council meeting, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote conducted by the United Nations under an
agreement reached on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal would
determine whether the majority of the 800,000 people in the
half-island territory want to stay within Indonesia with special
autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials want to announce the result simultaneously in
Dili, capital of East Timor, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A 98.6 percent turnout was registered but violent activities
followed, mostly from the anti-independence groups, raising peace
and security concerns in the ballot counting process and the
3-month post-ballot period before the vote result is implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
estimated that some 50,000 East Timorese have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
East Timor has been considered by the United Nations a
non-self-governing territory since 1976 when Indonesia annexed it,
following former ruler Portugal's withdrawal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is "exhorting" Indonesia to live up to its commitment
to East Timor's security by sending more security forces, a U.N.
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has not decided whether it will take up
the issue of peace-keeping in East Timor despite discussions going
on in capitals and in U.N. corridors, the spokesman Fred Eckhard
said.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects for Uganda, China Economic Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and China enjoy a very
bright prospect for bilateral economic cooperation, Uganda's
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade and
Industry Moses Ali said after week-long visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua here Friday,
adding:" I now have a very different image of China after my visit
to your country. Now I know China is not the same as one we'd been
hearing of."
</P>
<P>
"Surely there is bright future for our economic cooperation
because our economies are highly supplementary. The technology
being used in China is also applicable here. Basically an
agricultural country, Uganda needs simple but practical machines I
saw in China," he added, who visited China in July.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the technology should be affordable and
accessible to Ugandan farmers. The machines, which are not so
sophisticated, can be used here to grow upland rice. They can even
be applied to small-scale sugar and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
With the 21 member countries of the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) removing trade barriers in near
future, commodities made by China can find their way to all these
countries. If these things can reach the COMESA market, Ugandans
will have easy access to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the stumbling block hampering the growth of
bilateral trade, Ali attributed it to lack of high-level contact
between the two countries. He said:" Many of the Chinese things we
use here come from Hong Kong or India or some other place. So
there is no direct link between us and your country. We therefore
should establish contacts at official, technical and academic
levels."
</P>
<P>
Once they know each other, we can familiarize with each other
better, he noted, adding that without the link, bilateral trade
would not gain momentums in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
As to his general impression about China, he said that China
itself is a big market, which makes China immune from any form of
sanctions from the outside. China's manufacturing sector impressed
him most, he admitted. If China concentrates on this sector, its
products can compete favorably with the rest of the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister recalled that China contributed
considerably to the continent's political decolonization. He hoped
that China can contribute equally much to Africa's economic
decolonization.
</P>
<P>
Take Uganda for example, he said, it hopes China can provide
vocational training and more scholarships for Ugandans. Uganda
needs China's help in building infrastructure like roads and
providing technology affordable to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Although our bilateral trade is relatively small now. The two
governments are trying to boost the bilateral trade. I am
confident that it will grow dramatically in the near future," he
concluded.

<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
sharply higher Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. payroll data
allayed worries about another U.S. interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Insurers led the blue chip charge in London amid talk that a 17
billion U.S. dollar merger is imminent in the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark FTSE 100 powered ahead 2.2 percent to 6,332.1, a
rise of 136.5 points. For the week, however, the blue chip index
was down 0.7 percent, or 43.1 points.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax index closed almost 3 percent higher and well
above a significant technical level, fueled by benign U.S. jobs
numbers which stilled fears of another U.S. interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
Commerzbank, the leading gainer, catapulted more than 5 percent
to 35.90 euros, profiting from market speculation that it may be
the next hot takeover target.
</P>
<P>
The index closed stronger 136.5 points or 2.82 percent stronger
at 5,336.22 points, well above the 5,300 points support level.
</P>
<P>
Paris's CAC 40 shot up 2.68 percent, or 121.77 points, to

KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Second Deputy Prime

said that Uganda will, as ever, stick to one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's recent claim of forging state-to-state relations with

Uganda, which enjoys very good relation with China, stuck, is
sticking to and will stick to one-China policy. Taiwan is surely
part of China and the Taiwan issue is an internal issue of China,
he commented.

Soon after its independence from colonial rule in 1962, Uganda

<HEADLINE> Libya to Draw Investments in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Libya is calling for foreign
investments in the infrastructure projects which might help
diversify its oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was sounded at the conclusion of the Symposium on
Prospects of International Investment and Trade in Libya which
opened here Thursday as part of the celebrations for the
country's 30th Anniversary of Revolution which fell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has set an ambition to be a focal
point for investment in Africa and to play a pivotal role in
the economic development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Libya is endeavoring to draw more investments to
develop its transportation capacities, education and health
utilities and power generation and distribution and
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day symposium, participants reviewed proposals
to invest in the country's Great Man-Made River Project which is
considered as the most important project for the coming up future.
</P>
<P>
The project will convey water from a huge reservoir of
underground water of the southern desert to the coastal strip
in the country's north where most people live.
</P>
<P>
The annual water allocation of the project will be about 59
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed to hold a conference for investment in
Libya in the coming spring and workshops will be held to evaluate
the investment projects to be presented to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Libya's economy is more than 95 percent dependent on oil
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The drastic drop in oil prices since the mid 1980's and the
imposition of preserved OPEC quotas on members states have
undermined the country's capacity to realize fast and sustained
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges for U.N. Fact-Finding Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday Urged
the U.N. Security Council to investigate the recent Indian downing
of its naval aircraft and seek "appropriate compensation" for the
lost.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said in a letter to the
president of the Security Council that his government had
requested Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a fact-finding
mission to establish the truth regarding this grave incident. "We
await his positive response," he added.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which happened last month, killed all 16 people
aboard the plane. Pakistan said the aircraft was downed over its
territory while India said its airspace was intruded when its
troops opened fire.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council, which is entrusted with the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security, must take cognizance of the act of aggression by India
and support Pakistan's request for a United Nations fact-finding
mission and its demand on India for appropriate compensation,"
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He did not spell out how much the "appropriate compensation"
should be for the aircraft and the losses of lives.
</P>
<P>
"This aggression has further deteriorated the relations between
India and Pakistan. Unless appropriate redress is provided for
this wanton use of forces, it could lead to a further escalation
of the tensions between the two countries," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country reserves all its rights under Article
51 of the Charter of the United Nations, referring to a
self-defense provision.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which convened Friday on Iraq and other
matters, has made no response to the Pakistani request. No comment
from the Indian side was available so far.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Health Minister Pleads Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The former Minister of
Health in the 1994 interim government of Rwanda, Casmir Bizimungu,
Friday pleaded not guilty to all charges of genocide and crimes
against humanity when he made his initial appearance before the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu, 48, could not enter his plea on August 17 when three
other former cabinet ministers jointly charged with him entered
theirs because the lawyer assigned to him by the Registrar, Judith
Bourne of the United States, was not available on that date.
</P>
<P>
The three, who also pleaded not guilty, are former Minister of
Trade and Industry, Justin Mugenzi, former Minister of the Civil
Service, Prosper Mugiraneza, and former Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Jerome Bicumumpaka.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were brutally massacred during April and July 1994 in
Rwanda. The United Nations Security Council set up the ICTR in
Arusha, north Tanzania, to try leading suspects responsible for
the genocide.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from ICTR, Bizimungu pleaded not
guilty to eight counts charging him with conspiracy to commit
genocide, genocide, or in the alternative, complicity in genocide,
genocide, direct and public indictment to commit genocide, and
crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the accused, together with the
other former ministers, jointly participated in the planning,
preparing or execution of a common plan, to commit the atrocities
against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The crimes were committed by them personally, by the persons
they assisted or by their subordinates, and with their knowledge
and consent," according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu, as Minister of Health, is alleged to have failed to
take any steps to prevent massacres committed in one of the public
hospitals for which he was responsible, Centre Hospitalier de
Kigali (CHK), or to punish the perpetrators, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecution told the court that when massacres started, the
CHK took in numerous wounded Tutsi from various areas in the city.
!0On several occasions, soldiers who were supposed to be guarding
the hospital selected Tutsi patients and killed them on the spot.
A list of the staff of Tutsi descent was drawn up and several of
the people on the list were killed"
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that these massacres were reported to Bizimungu
who did nothing.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecution added that the accused also knew of the
massacres which took place at Burtare University Hospital and at
Kabgayi School of Nursing in Gitarama prefecture, but did not take
any steps to stop them or punish the perpetrators, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
At Kabgayi, the Prosecution added, soldiers and Interahamwe
militiamen also abducted and raped female students and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu was arrested in Kenya on 11 February 1999 and
transferred to the United Nations Detention Facility in Arusha on
February 23 this year.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: Charter Changes Need More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that his country will remain a
consistent tailender among Southeast Asian countries in cornering
direct foreign investments unless it adopts bold economic reforms
through charter changes.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly TV program, Estrada said that Thailand, Malaysia
and other Southeast Asian countries have opened their doors to
foreign investments and have allowed foreigners to gain full
control of local ventures.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1998, Thailand attracted 18.5 billion U.S. dollars
in direct foreign investments and Malaysia 22.4 billion dollars,
but the Philippines got only 7.5 billion dollars, according to
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"The worst-case scenario is already happening, we are already a
consistent tailender in the investments race. We will remain in
that place unless we do something," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said the investments figures also show the need for the
country to make its business climate more attractive to foreign
investors by way of relaxing restrictions on their ownership of
land and full participation in local ventures.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine constitution, foreigners are not allowed
to own land and their shares in industries can not exceed 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that is why he is pushing for economic reforms
through charter changes.
</P>
<P>
He said that these reforms are expected to draw in foreign
investments, reinvigorate local industries, create enough jobs for
the poor, and even bring down the cost of basic services.
</P>
<P>
While Estrada is campaigning for charter changes, many people
in the Philippines show their strong opposition to such a move.
The opposition forces fear that the president might extend his
single six-year term through amendments to the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Exports Fruits, Vegetables Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is making headway
in its agricultural produce export, the Ethiopian Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Ethiopian Fruit and Vegetable Marketing
Enterprise (ETFRUIT) exported in 1997/98 fiscal year 31,188
quintals of fresh horticulture produce of flowers, fruits, and
vegetables above the set target of 31,000 quintals.
</P>
<P>
ETFRUIT presently handles about 90 percent of the total foreign
sales of agricultural produce in the country.
</P>
<P>
It earned last year 31 million birr (nearly four million U.S.
dollars) in foreign currency, up 57 percent against the income of
the previous year, said Mulugeta Demewoz, general manager of the
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
ETFRUIT was firstly established as a marketing enterprise in
April 1980 and restructured as a public enterprise in November
1993. Its major export items include vegetables, cut flowers and
fruits.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, heavily dependent on coffee export, which accounts
for nearly 70 percent, now believes that to start agricultural
produce export is a major alternative to increase foreign exchange
earning.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Rome Before Signing Accord With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived in Rome Saturday morning for a quick round of top level
meetings with Italian leaders, which will precede his flight to
Egypt later Saturday for the signing ceremony of a new peace
agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi told the press after his
meeting with Arafat in the small town of Castelporziano on the
outskirts of Rome that Arafat had "confirmed the long-awaited news
that this evening, he will sign the accord with the Israeli
government."
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said that Arafat had provided him with details of the
modified Wye River accord, from which he could conclude that it
would figure as a "milestone along the road to peace in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
"This Saturday of peace will be remembered," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said, "We would like the model of peace and co-operation
between different people, which we have managed to create in
Europe after many wars, to be extended to the entire Mediterranean
region."
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, Israel and the Palestinians agreed to a new West
Bank land-for-security accord, with Israel pledging within 10 days
to release 350 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, instead of the
400 previously insisted upon by the Palestinians, and grant self-
rule to 7 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will fly out to Sharm El Sheikh on the Egyptian Red Sea
Saturday evening to sign the agreement with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Antelope Poachers Given Harsh Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Three more Tibetan antelope
poachers have each been given 12 years in jail and fined 60,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jiqing, a farmer in Wulan County in northwest China's
Qinghai Province, was found guilty of poaching 88 Tibetan
antelopes recently, together with two other farmers from Jiangdu
County in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Tashi and
Puddo, who are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Ma was nabbed by rangers in a combined raid mounted by the
authorities to try to halt the poaching of rare animals in the Hol
Xil Nature Reserve on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, known as the "
Roof of the World." The reserve is home to more than 20 rare
species under State protection, including yak and Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Wang Baobao, a farmer in Qinghai Province, was
sentenced to six years in prison for poaching Tibetan antelopes.
</P>
<P>
Ma and his accomplices went into the nature reserve on March 10
with two small-calibre rifles and more than 3,500 rounds of
ammunition, killing 88 antelopes, while Tashi and Puddo illegally
purchased the antelope furs at a price of 530 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Tashi and Puddo are wanted by the police.
</P>
<P>
China launched the largest ever anti-poaching campaign in April
this year.

<P>
FUKUOKA, Japan, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China will face
defending champion South Korea in the final of the Asian
Basketball Championships for Men with the winners taking the sole
ticket to the Sydney Olympic Games
</P>
<P>
Both sides enjoy easy semi-finals wins on Saturday as China won
its sixth-straight game in a 105-51 rout of Chinese Taipei, the
third game in which China scored more than 100 points, while South
Korea crashed Saudi Arabia 85-59 in another semi.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Jiang Xingquan refused to make any
predictions to Sunday's final match-up against South Korea, saying
just "We'll try our best."
</P>
<P>
South Korea's head coach Shin Sun-woo said, "The chance to win
the game for both teams is 50-50."
</P>
<P>
"It will be a rebound game," Shin added.
</P>
<P>
Veteran guard Hur Jae said he was very confident for South
Korea to win the final and the sole berth to Sydney allocated in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Resting their starting line-up, Chinese Taipei failed to
blocked outrange shots of Chinese, who hit the target from behind
the arch 12 times in 29 attempts.
</P>
<P>
Hu Weidong scored all his 18 points behind the arc in a half-
time play to lead the game, with six Chinese players scored in
double digits.
</P>
<P>
"We save our strength for Sunday's 3-4 places playoff against
Saudi Arabia," Chinese Taipei's coach Chen I-Fei said.
</P>
<P>
Seo Jang-Hoon led South Koreans in scoring with 22 points.
Talking about a potential match-up with Chinese pivot Wang Zhizhi,
Seo said, "Wang is taller and younger than me, but I have edge on
experiences and skills, so I don't think I will lose to Wang in
tomorrow's final match."
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's earlier matches, Japan took the fifth place
through a 77-61 win over Kuwait, while Lebanon stole the victory
from Syria 61-60 on Boustani Ghazi's winning free-throw with 2.3
seconds to go in the 7-8 places playoff.

</P>
<P>
While inspecting the Hong Kong Customs and the Excise
Department's departmental review to mark its 90th Anniversary,
Tung said the department had taken vigorous actions against rights
infringement activities and had established close links with
Chinese mainland's international law enforcement authorities as
well as relevant authorities to protect intellectual property
rights.
</P>
<P>
"The department's success in law enforcement has helped
upholding the law and order of Hong Kong, " said Tung.
</P>
<P>
He added that more importantly the department had proven to the
world through its unrelenting boundary control and active
participation in the international customs arena that Hong Kong
remained a separate customs territory after its return to China,
and that the concept of "one country, two systems" had been
implemented successfully in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"With the approach of the 21st century, we commit ourselves to
developing Hong Kong into a center of innovation and technology,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to reach the goal the department shall
continue to play an important role in the protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>

<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri
Saturday expressed her regret at the outcome of the autonomy
ballot held by the U.N. in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
As Leader and presidential candidate of the PDI-P that won most
votes in the June 7 general election, Megawati said: "I am very
concerned and of course very sad for the autonomy ballot's
result." "For me the most important issue was not the result of
the ballot itself, what concerned me was things that might happen
after the polling, especially the refugee issue," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. announced Saturday morning that over 78.5 percent of
East Timorese voters voted for independence from Indonesia during
the August 30 direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 15,000 East Timorese people had fled
to East Nusa Tenggara since the announcement of the direct ballot
result.
</P>
<P>
Megawati also admitted that she had received reports about
manipulative and cheating activities within the ballot's process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food and vegetable prices in East Timor have
increased 100-200 percent after the announcement of the result of
the ballot Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"If this should continue, then East Timor will be short of
food," said one of the local food seller there.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Paralyzes Pakistan's Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's major cities
Saturday witnessed complete shutdown as traders ignored the
government's pleas and closed down their businesses to protest
against the imposition of the general sales tax.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike was called by the All Pakistan
Organization of Small Traders and Cottage Industry, which was
backed by all the opposition parties, including the main Pakistan
People's Party led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Karachi, the country's biggest commercial center, remained
completely closed after a violent anti-government rally on Friday
evening. However, activities at the Karachi port were normal.
</P>
<P>
There was scant traffic on roads and attendance was thin in
governmental offices, banks and educational institutions. There
were reports of three bomb blasts and burning of 11 vehicles in
different parts of the city, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lahore, the hometown of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was also
closed, though a nominal number of traders opened their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Traders in the capital Islamabad and its twin city Rawalpindi
as well as northern town of Peshawar were also on strike.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parities have launched a fresh wave of
anti-government movements, taking advantage of the opportunity as
traders are angry at the government's decision to impose sales tax
on oil, gas and other service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale rallies were held in cities including Karachi and
Lahore during the past days and several protesters were killed in
clashes with police.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resumed their peace
talks on October 25, a senior official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio interview
that the recent fighting that killed some MILF members in Basilan,
the Southern Philippines, would not affect the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I see the possibility of the peace talks opening on October
25," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the peace process would proceed
smoothly despite last week's battle in Basilan for the rescue of a
four-year old girl kidnapped by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Government troops engaged suspected members of the extremist
group Abu Sayyaf and MILF in a battle last week to secure the
release of the girl. Around 40 rebels were killed and a dozen
government soldiers were wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and the MILF broke down
eight months ago after troops from the two sides clashed for weeks
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF is fighting for an independent Muslim
state in Mindanao, but the rebel group's demand has been firmly
rejected by the government.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Saturday expressed her condolences to the family of
former Foreign Minister A.C. Shahul Hameed who died of a heart
attack in Colombo Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"I learnt with shock and grief the passing away of Mr. A.C.S.
Hameed, a veteran parliamentarian of the United National Party
(UNP)," said President Kumaratunga in a letter to Hameed's wife.
</P>
<P>
She highly praised Hameed for his unremitting endeavor to bring
peace to this war-ravaged island nation.
</P>
<P>
"The country lost Mr. Hameed at a very crucial and decisive
time when his services were much needed," said the president.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Hameed had been a strong supporter of the need
for political consensus between the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
and the UNP for meaningful devolution of power as a measure of
achieving peace, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Hameed, 71, a senior member of the main opposition UNP, died at
a private hospital where he was admitted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was the longest serving foreign minister in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Hameed was involved in unsuccessful negotiations with the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Hameed had played a key role in efforts to defuse
tension between the PA and the UNP and bring about a settlement to
the country's long drawn-out ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that his death was a setback to the ongoing
peace effort in the country which has been plagued by the 16-year
old civil war between the government and the LTTE rebels.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 27,277 crimes
were committed in Kuwait in 1998, once every 20 minutes, according
to a report published recently by the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thirty murders were recorded last year, an 88 percent increase
compared with the 16 cases in 1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In addition to murders, the report said, the crimes were
diverse in nature, ranging from theft and drug trafficking to
dud checks, armed robbery and bribery.
</P>
<P>
The report said one of the most important causes is the
widespread availability of weapons left behind by Iraqi troops
during its occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although the authorities were alarmed by
the vast spread of crimes, no serious action was taken to combat
the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry urged other government bodies, along
with the Parliament, to join in the anti-crime campaign, as the
ministry is "unable to deal with the sharp increase of crimes
singlehandly."

Forces (TNI) Saturday accepted the choice of the majority of East
Timorese rejecting the offer of special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI takes the result of the ballot as being the East
Timorese people's aspiration and conscience," Chief of TNI's
Information Service Brig. Gen. Sudrajat said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official announcement of the result of the
August 30 direct ballot, 344,580 voters or 78.5 percent chose
independence against 94,388 voters or 21.5 percent preferring
wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Sudrajat called on all sides involved to accept and respect the
ballot's result as a democratic decision and to participate in the
effort to maintain security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the tripartite agreement among Indonesia,
Portugal and the United Nations, TNI and Indonesian Police (Polri)
troops would continue to be stationed in East Timor up to the end
of November this year.
</P>
<P>
"Until the end of November, TNI and Polri troops will maintain
order and security in East Timor in cooperation with the U.N.," he
was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the TNI would do if clashes between the
pro-independence and pro-integration groups continued to occur in
the post-ballot period, Sudrajat said whatever security
disturbances would occur, the TNI and Polri were ready to perform
their duties as expected.
</P>
<P>
But the TNI would also approach the rival parties in East Timor
and call on them to restrain themselves and take part in efforts
to maintain security.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, we call on all sides to help prevent the security
situation from deteriorating," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Identifies Strategies for Ability-driven Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has identified
three key strategies toward building an ability-driven education
system which values every individual's part in the society.
</P>
<P>
The strategies are: the flexibility in the education structure,
identification of talents and abilities, and a review of
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Education Minister Teo Chee Hean made the
announcement Saturday at his ministry's workplan seminar held
here, saying that his ministry will be working on the three
strategies in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
When strategies and programs in these areas are fully
developed, he said, they will take Singapore closer to an
ability-driven education system.
</P>
<P>
The concept of ability-driven education is supported by the
belief that every individual has a valuable contribution to make
to society and country, said Teo.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ministry has over the last one year taken two
major steps towards an ability-driven education system.
</P>
<P>
First, it has developed and implemented the school excellence
model to broaden the way schools are appraised.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, schools will need to take a more holistic
approach to educating their students, beyond a narrow focus on
academic results, he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, the new university admission system will be introduced
in the year 2003, which will move away from the current reliance
on the A level exams for admission towards a more well-rounded
evaluation of a person's ability.
</P>
<P>
These steps are important changes that will help shape the
behavior and motivation of Singapore's schools and students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed whether Singapore will continue to be an
exceptional nation will depend on the people, on how well their
talents and abilities have been identified, developed and
harnessed.

<HEADLINE> Jiang: Chinese Thais, Chinese in Thailand, Good Example of Nationality Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Saturday spoke highly of the Chinese Thais and
Chinese in Thailand for their arduous efforts and important role
in promoting friendly relations and economic and trade cooperation
between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Thursday afternoon for a state visit,
described them as "good example of different nationalities living
in harmony within one country".
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a grand banquet jointly sponsored by the
Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Thailand and the Chinese-Thai
Friendship Association, which was attended by some 1,300 people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the Thai government has always been practicing
a nationality equality policy, which serves to make the Chinese
Thais and Chinese here live and work in peace and contentment with
local people, and make concerted and positive contributions for
prosperity in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government grants high comment and appreciation
over this," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Jiang said the motherland's complete
reunification represents the common aspiration of all Chinese at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the "One country, two systems", which was
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is China's
basic policy in handling the Hong Kong and Macao issues, as well
as the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The prerequisite of this policy is that there is but one China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lee Teng-hui brazenly called the relations across the
Taiwan straits "the state-to-state" ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said this is a "very dangerous step" towards splitting
China and a severe provocation against the one-China principle
that is well received by the international community.
</P>
<P>
This has also undermined the basis for stable relations across
the Taiwan straits and for peaceful reunification, and has been
condemned by the international community, including the overseas
compatriots, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese tradition for reunification and
against separatism has always been consistent and the people
across the straits share the same origin and the blood-is-thicker-
than-water sentiment cannot be cast off.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is firm in its determination to
safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Jiang said, "The situation in
China is good," citing the political stability, harmony among
different nationalities, the deepening of the reform and the
steady pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics is
gradually exerting its great vitality, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has
stood the test of the past two years and is continuing to maintain
prosperity, and the forthcoming return of Macao to the motherland
will be a new page in China's reunification cause, which he said
can be a great celebration by Chinese at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Korn Dabbaransi, Thai deputy prime minister and chairman of the
Chinese-Thai Friendship Association, and Boonsong Srifuengfung,
chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, also spoke at the
banquet, extending a warm welcome to Jiang on his state visit to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who is accompanying Jiang on
the ongoing Thai tour, was among those present at the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is scheduled to leave Bangkok for Phuket later Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Mission-Critical Firms to Comply with Y2K Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reiterated Saturday its directive to all mission-critical offices
to make public their state of readiness for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Companies that do not follow the law will open themselves to
prosecution for damages, if their products or services fail, said
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Year
2000 Compliance, or Y2K bug, in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
"These firms expose themselves to damage claims and prosecution
from consumers and business partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2k bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems that
prevent them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1, 2000
onward.
</P>
<P>
As a result, such computer systems could mistake the year 2000
for the 1900, hence possibly jeopardizing operation of computer
dependent industries.
</P>
<P>
Aguiluz said that all mission-critical firms in the Philippines
have until September 30, the deadline set by the Y2K law, to
submit their state of Y2K readiness to the Y2K commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the law signed by President Joseph Estrada in June,
mission-critical sectors, which include government services,
public utilities, tele-communications, transportation, finance,
health care and manufacturing, must disclose the readiness of
their products to continue functioning by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But as of August 30, less than 1,000 of the 18,000 companies
monitored by the Y2K commission have submitted their readiness
statements.
</P>
<P>
"We've advised them to submit their statements so we can take
the needed measures to make them Y2K ready," Aguiluz said.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong formula one power
Grand Prix, a round of this year's formula one powerboat world
championship, has been deferred to next year, according to a news
release sent by Hong Kong powerboat association reaching here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was confirmed at the end of 1998 as the venue for the
ninth round of the 1999 Union International Motonuatique (UIM) F1
world championship slated for October 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
"Although a number of prestigious companies have made firm
sponsorship commitments, the total funding was not sufficient to
stage the event to the professional standard which both Hong Kong
and the UIM F1 world championship rightly expect," said Peter
Wearing Smith, chairman and CEO of organizer Grand Prix
International Promotions Limited.
</P>
<P>
UIM, governing body of the F1 world championship, expressed its
disappointment at the cancellation of the Hong Kong event from the
1999 calendar.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is one of the best locations we have seen for many
years... however, Hong Kong has a firm position in our 2000
championship," commented Nicolo Di San Germano, UIM series
promoter.
</P>
<P>
The F1 world championship is organized by UIM, which has
attracted millions of spectators worldwide since its inception in
1981.
</P>
<P>
The release added that the three-million-US-dollar Hong Kong F1
powerboat Grand Prix has already received vital support from local
organizations involved in the event, such as Tai Po district board,
the regional services department, marine police, marine department,
Hong Kong police, transport department, Hong Kong Powerboat
Association and many others.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday called on all parties in East Timor to
implement the result of the ballot on its future in a peaceful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The council met on the matter after Secretary-General Kofi
Annan made a statement to the council, announcing the ballot
result, which is in favor of independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The council urged all parties to respect the result and called
on all East Timorese, numbering some 800,000, to work together for
its implementation, according to a presidential statement issued
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council is looking to Indonesia to take the necessary
constitutional steps to implement the ballot result in accordance
with the May 5 agreement, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the need for the result to be implemented in an
atmosphere of peace and security without further violence.
</P>
<P>
Annan made a similar appeal to the political parties in East
Timor for patience and calm in coming days.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics show that a total of 98.6 percent of voters
turned out and 78.5 percent of voters were for independence with
another 21.5 percent voting for special autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. brokered May 5 agreement between Indonesia and
Portugal provides for a transitional period for Indonesia to end
its links with East Timor, former Portuguese colony until 1975
when Indonesia occupied it after Portugal's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the transfer of East Timor
authority to the United Nations in a peaceful and orderly way
before the U.N. starts a process for East Timor to go toward
independence.

JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's jailed
pro-independence leader Xanana Gusmao here Saturday called on the
East Timorese people to reconcile in the new spirit of brotherhood
to maintain peace and order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Xanana, who is also president of the National Council for East
Timor Resistance, made the statement following the announcement of
the outcome of the ballot held on August 30 for the future of East
Timor which was integrated into Indonesia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech, Xanana called for fixing August 30 as
the East Timor National Independence day.
</P>
<P>
"Today might have been a very happy day for celebration. But
today, violence was faced by citizens unable to defend
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement by the U.N., over 78 percent of
the East Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Hopes for China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley is hoping for progress in China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) when Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet later this month, the
Dominion newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen leaders of the 21 members of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, including President Jiang and President
Clinton, will go to Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand, for
an informal meeting of APEC leaders on September 12.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled Jiang-Clinton bilateral talks are "their affairs,
" but any steps toward China's WTO membership will be "a great
boost" to the APEC meeting, the Wellington-based paper quoted
Shipley as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said it is "a widely-held view" that China, the 10th
biggest economy in the world, should take part in the next round
of talks on global trade. The talks will be launched at the WTO
ministerial meeting in November in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The new WTO Director-General, Mike Moore, said in Geneva
recently that the APEC meeting could provide "a window for some
progress" on China's entry into the trade watchdog.

KATHMANDU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The 8th round of ministerial
level talks between Nepal and Bhutan to resolve the Bhutanese
refugee issue will be held next week, The Kathmandu Post quoted a
minister as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture Chakra Prasad Bastola, who is now
overlooking the Foreign Ministry, told the House of
Representatives Friday that ministerial level talks between the
two countries will be held during the second week of September. He
didn't specify where the talks would be held.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal Will try to resolve the issue bilaterally," Bastola
said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Murari Raj Sharma later told reporters that
Bhutan has already agreed to hold the talks but no date has been
fixed.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees now live in seven refugee
camps in eastern Nepal after fleeing their homeland around 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Seven rounds of ministerial talks between the two Himalayan
kingdoms have so far ended in failure as to the repatriation of
the refugees. Nepal wants to repatriate all the refugees, whereas
Bhutan wants to take back only those who were forcefully evicted.

of the autonomy ballot results Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trucks and private vehicles had been seen fleeing Dili since
06:00 a.m. local time.
</P>

The refugees included workers from outside East Timor and
Timorese.

The Indonesian government had coordinated refugees that swarmed
Saturday through sea and trans-provincial roads that connected
East Timor to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the United Nations Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) announced that over 78 percent of East Timorese had voted
for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, some figures from the pro-integration groups said
they would reject the results of the direct ballot which was held
on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The ballot, which was held under an agreement signed by the UN,
Indonesia and Portugal in May, would decide whether East Timor
enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within Indonesia or become
independent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Respects Choice of East Timorese: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday said the Indonesian government respected the
choice of the majority of East Timorese rejecting the offer of
special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Our brothers in East Timor in fact have chosen to refuse a
special autonomy status offered by Indonesian government," said
the president in a television speech following the announcement of
the outcome of the direct ballot on August 30.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that East Timor has chosen independence from
Indonesia by vote, with 78.5 percent ballots supporting separation
and 21 percent favoring autonomy under Jakarta's rule.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the decision made by the East Timorese to
separate from Indonesia is a bitter one for the Indonesian people,
the president urged the Indonesians to accept the fact patiently.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said he has asked the Indonesian Armed Forces
and Police to take strict measures to maintain safety of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said in January if the East Timorese rejected the
offer, he would ask the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to
annul a 1978 decree which legally integrated the former Portuguese
colony into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will hold its next meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot was conducted by the U.N. under an agreement
reached on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hails Israeli-Palestinian New Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, GAZA STRIP, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The newly-
reached agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is "another
important step on the road to the Israeli and Palestine peace," U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, stricken between Israeli and Palestinian officials
Friday night, will be signed Saturday evening in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh under the supervision of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Telling a press conference, Albright spoke highly of the
efforts from both sides in hammering out the deal, saying that "
They have really seized, I believe, a historic opportunity" to
define peace for generations to come in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here Friday to broker the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations and had two hours of talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Working intensively, the Israelis and Palestinians solved
problems together, negotiated solutions together and began to re-
establish trust and confidence in each other," she added.
</P>
<P>
She also thanked Mubarak for his "terribly intensive and hard
work" to help end the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a revision of the Wye River accord signed
about a year ago in Washington, Israel will withdraw from 11
percent, instead of 13.1 percent as previously demanded, of the
West Bank in three stages, starting in the next few days and
ending January 20.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel pledged to release hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners -- a fundamental and emotional issue that had long been
disputed. Under the deal, the Palestinian side accepts the Israeli
proposed number of 350 prisoners to be freed. Chief Palestinian
negotiator Nabil Shaath also said a joint committee will discuss
release of more prisoners in December.
</P>
<P>
In the accord, both sides are barred from taking unilateral
steps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, they will start negotiating a
permanent peace agreement within the next few days and conclude it
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Within five or six months, they would complete a framework
agreement to outline solutions for some most complex issues, which
include Palestinian statehood, the status of Jerusalem -- which
the Palestinians want as their capital, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and the future of Jewish settlements in Palestinian-
majority areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of
the European Union denied on Friday that the bloc had raised
conditions for the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the
EU and Mexico are advancing, representative of the European
Council Parliamentary Assembly, Enric Pamitjavila, told the press
in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of the Mexican state of Chiapas, 650
kilometers east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
There are good relations and big possibilities for the signing
of the FTA that would benefit both parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the EU had conditioned the signing of the FTA on
the solution of the on-going political conflict with the rebel
National Liberation Zapatista Army (EZLN) in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The EZLN rose in arms on January 1, 1994, demanding respect to
the rights of the indigenous peoples in Chiapas and other states
of the country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Sets Up Fund for State-owned Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
taken measures to intensify the reform of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) by setting up the Fund for the Restructuring and Equitising
State-owned Enterprises (FRESOE), English daily Vietnam News
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
FRESOE, aimed at assisting the restructuring and equitisation
of SOEs towards making the public sector more efficient, will be
established both at central and local levels as well as at state
corporations.
</P>
<P>
One of the main objectives of the fund will be to provide for
the training of workers and financial assistance to those who take
voluntary retrenchment during the restructuring and equitisation
process.
</P>
<P>
It will also help workers at equitised SOEs to buy preferential
shares, and provide financial assistance to other SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be financed with proceeds from restructuring,
equitisation, sale or lease of enterprises (change of SOE
ownership).
</P>
<P>
The decision will become effective on September 15, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Text of Annan's Statement to U.N. Security Council on East Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full
text of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's statement to the
Security Council in which he announced the result of East Timor
ballot on its future:
</P>
<P>
On 5 May 1999, Portugal, Indonesia and the United Nations
concluded an historic set of agreements intended to resolve the
long-standing issue of East Timor. These 5 May Agreements
requested me to determine, through a popular consultation based
upon a universal, direct, and secret ballot, whether the East
Timorese people would accept or reject a proposed special autonomy
for East Timor within the unitary Republic of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
To enable me to fulfill this request, the United Nations
Security Council established on 11 June, 1999, the United Nations
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) which proceeded to organize and
conduct the popular consultation. It registered 451,792 voters in
East Timor and around the world, in a registration process which
the Electoral Commission, a body composed of three independent
commissioners, deemed to be a sound basis for the conduct of the
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Thus, on 30 August, 1999, in a show of courage and
determination, the people of East Timor turned out in massive
numbers to vote in the popular consultation, expressing their will
as to the future of the Territory. The votes cast have now been
counted, and the Electoral Commission has assessed all outstanding
complaints and certified the results of the popular consultation
process. Therefore, in fulfillment of the task entrusted to me by
the 5 May Agreements, I hereby announce that the result of the
vote is 94,388, or 21.5 percent, in favor and 344,580, or 78.5
percent, against the proposed special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The people of East Timor have thus rejected the proposed
special autonomy and expressed their wish to begin a process of
transition towards independence.
</P>
<P>
After 24 years of conflict, East Timor now stands on the
threshold of what we all hope will be a process of orderly and
peaceful transition towards independence. The coming days, however,
will require patience and calm from the people of East Timor. I
hardly need stress how important it is for its leaders to exercise
wisdom and reason.
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for all concerned to seize the opportunity to
lay a firm and lasting foundation for cooperation and peace, and
to usher in an era of stability and prosperity for all future
generations of East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
Those who voted to accept the proposed special autonomy must
not consider this outcome a loss. Nor indeed should the majority
consider it a victory; for there are no winners and no losers
today. Rather, this moment heralds the opportunity for all East
Timorese to begin to forge together a common future in what is to
become an independent East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Today, I ask all parties to bring to an end the violence which
for 24 years has caused untold suffering to East Timor. I ask them
to begin in earnest a process of dialogue and reconciliation
through the East Timor Consultative Commission. I call upon the
Government of Indonesia, which made possible the consultation
process through a statesmanlike initiative of the President of the
Republic, to ensure its successful culmination by carrying out its
responsibility to maintain law and order in the Territory.
</P>
<P>
I should like to thank both Indonesia and Portugal for their
commitment and perseverance in this process. I am confident that
the Governments will fulfill their remaining obligations under the
5 May Agreements. Let me assure both Governments that the United
Nations will continue to work with them to ensure the
implementation of the results of the consultation through a
peaceful and orderly process. Let me also assure the people of
East Timor that the United Nations will not fail them in guiding
East Timor in its transition towards independence.

<HEADLINE> Chile Allows Peso to Trade Freely Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Central Bank
announced on Friday a rule allowing the local currency, peso, to
trade freely against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The parity of the peso against the dollar declined two pesos to
around 521 pesos per dollar after the Central Bank's announcement.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, which is independent from the government, had
maintained a system to enter the market to sell or buy dollars,
depending on whether the peso weakened or strengthened against the
U.S. currency. To determine when that intervention should occur,
the bank set a minimum and maximum price for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Exporters Association, Cristobal Valdes, called
the bank's move an important step to encourage exports.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes A Major Force in Polar Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON, September 4 (Xinhua)-- China is becoming a major
force in international polar research, according to Chen Liqi,
chief scientist of China's first government sponsored Arctic
expedition.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches great importance to polar
research, which reflects the country's concern for environmental
changes worldwide, and has upgraded the general level of its
scientific research," said Chen, who is aboard the homeward bound
expedition ship Snow Dragon.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has set up two expedition stations in the
South Pole, established its own polar research centers, polar
archives and information management system, and owns a 20,000-
tonnage freighter and expedition icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that an effective Chinese polar expedition and
research network has come into being," remarked Chen, who also
director of the Polar Research Office under the State Oceanic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years China has sent 15 expeditions to the South
Pole, conducting year-round observations and multi-subject
research, and amassed large amounts of valuable data, samples and
information," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese scientists have published dozens of polar research
works, and some of them have met international standards." the
scientist added.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Dragon, which belongs to China's third generation of
polar expedition icebreakers, is equipped with advanced guiding,
automatic steering and experimental systems, including a 200
square meter lab and state of the art ocean research instruments.
</P>
<P>
"With an increasing number of Chinese scientist paying visits
to the poles, the Snow Dragon, China's mobile polar expedition
station, will become well known worldwide," the chief scientist
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket
price increased by 23 cents to 18.26 U.S. dollars per barrel this
week, the Mines and Energy Ministry announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Due to recovery of crudes demand in the international market,
the average value of the Venezuelan oil basket has risen to 13.40
dollars per barrel in the first eight months this year.
</P>
<P>
Following the sharp fall in oil prices in 1998, the oil
producing countries on March 12 decided to cut oil output by two
million barrels a day until next year. Since then the value of
crudes has increased by more than 6 dollars.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, the Venezuelan oil basket dropped by 5.57 dollars
per barrel. Accordingly, the government income fell almost 6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company,
suffered an 84 percent decline in its income in 1998.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Direct Ballot Won by Pro-Independence Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- East Timor has chosen
independence from Indonesia by vote, the United Nations Mission in
East Timor (UNAMET) Chief Ian Martin announced in Dili, capital of
East Timor, on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said 94,388 voters, or 21.5 percent, voted in favor of
autonomy under Jakarta's continued rule and 344,580, or 78.5
percent rejected it. A total of 98.6 percent of the total 450,000
registered voters cast their votes during the polling day in or
outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the results of the ballot was moved forward
by three days to avoid possible leaks. The announcement was
originally scheduled for September 7.
</P>
<P>
"If the results are not immediately announced they could be
leaked. So it is better if they are announced tomorrow
(Saturday)," Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said after an
emergency meeting, abruptly called by President B.J. Habibie on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Habibie called a meeting with Alatas,
State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi, Defense Minister Wiranto
and Indonesian Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi to talk about the
latest development in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the government remained committed to accepting the
results of the ballot, whatever they were.
</P>
<P>
Alatas quoted Wiranto as saying the military and the police
would continue to maintain peace and order during any transitional
period in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Alatas said the legitimate procedure following
the ballot was for the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to
have the final say on the issue, because it was this body which
legislated the integration of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will hold its next session in November.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted Indonesian officials as saying that the
announcement of the results was moved up to Saturday as the
situation in East Timor continued to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Violence was looming in East Timor as both the pro-integration
and pro-independence forces are anxiously waiting for the
declaration of the ballot results.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET office was targeted in the violence on Wednesday,
killing at least two people. On Thursday, two local UNAMET staff
members were killed and 20 houses razed in the town of Maliana,
138 kilometers west of Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of East Timorese have fled to Belu and Timor Tengah
Selatan districts in East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia to
avoid possible bloodshed in the territory. About 76 Indonesian and
foreign reporters who had covered the ballot left Dili Friday
aboard an aircraft chartered by BBC London.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said that on a UNAMET request, the Indonesian military
has sent two extra battalions, or around 1,400 soldiers, to the
hotspot to assist the police in their duty.
</P>
<P>
He repeated that the results of the ballot must be accepted as
the best option.
</P>
<P>
However, pro-integration supporters in East Timor seemed to be
taking a less conciliatory stance.
</P>
<P>
Jose Abilio Soares, the Jakarta-appointed governor of East
Timor, said the pro-integration camp would not accept UNAMET's
decision regardless of the results.
</P>
<P>
East Timor's Manatuto district chief Vidal Domingos Doutel
Sarmento said people in the district considered the ballot unfair
and they are going to reject the results of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
East Timorese went to the direct ballots on August 30 to decide
whether to accept or reject an offer of wide-ranging autonomy
within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said in January if the East Timorese rejected the
offer, he would ask the MPR to annul a 1978 decree which legally
integrated the former Portuguese colony into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot was conducted by the U.N. under an agreement
reached on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Over 78 percent of East
Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in Monday's
direct ballot to choose the territory's future, U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan announced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The result was announced simultaneously in Dili, capital of
East Timor, former Portuguese colony until 1975 when Indonesia
occupied it after Portugal's withdrawal. The U.N. has seen it as a
non-self-governing territory since 1976 when Indonesia made it a
province.
</P>
<P>
Annan said another 21 percent of voters were for special
autonomy within Indonesia. Vote count was 344,580 for independence
and 94,388 for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The ballot was held under a U.N. brokered agreement between
Indonesia and Portugal on May 5.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Glaciologists Making Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- After more than 40 years of
studying China's glaciers, Chinese glaciologists have made big
success, according to Shi Fengya, of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He says that China places a great deal of importance on
glaciology because it has the largest number of glaciers in the
world, covering 59,000 square kilometers of land. China began its
studies in 1958 when the first expedition team went to the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau to study the use of ice and snow, Shi says, and in
the past 41 years they have made a great contribution to the
scientific use of water resources and prevention of disasters.
</P>
<P>
They set up a Qinghai-Tibet ice core data bank and an
environmental data bank to provide information on almost a million
years of climatic changes on the plateau for research on future
climate change.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, glaciologists discovered Asia's biggest icecap,
"Guliya", in the Kunlun Mountains, which has helped research on
millions of years of climate changes on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 and 1990, glaciologist Qin Dahe joined international
colleagues in an Antarctic expedition to study glaciers there and
became the first Chinese to cross the South Pole. Since then,
Chinese glaciological studies have become better known around the
world.
</P>
<P>
China published its first book on glaciology -- A Glaciological
Study on the Route of the 1990's International Trans-Antarctic
Expedition - in 1995. The book was written by Qin and shed more
light on glaciological research in the Antarctic with the analysis
of ice and snow samples from his 5,896-km. trip around the
Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
He draws attention to the ionization process in middle and
upper atmospheric levels in the polar area and its relation to the
icy surface.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Chinese glaciologists climbed to the highest
point on the South Pole, 3,910 meters above sea level, and
collected a large number of core samples to use as data for
research on global climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists covered more than 1,100 kilometers of ground
in the Antarctic.

XINING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- During a leisurely card game
with friends, former farmer Ma Xiangrui considers the hardships he
and other villagers endured in Qinghai province before New China
was formed in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"We had to work year after year in the fields. We couldn't
escape starvation," said the 75-year-old Ma, who is a member of
the Tu ethnic group in Tangla Village, one of the poorest in
northwest China. The village is in Donggou Township of the Huzhu
Tu Autonomous County in northeast Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
"Now our life has become more and more wealthy and easy," said
the old man, pointing to various new houses in the village which
have replaced the shabby shelters of old. More than 70 percent of
the Tu families in the village now have televisions, and 90
percent have earned enough money to buy modern furniture. VCD
players, refrigerators and motorcycles have also become popular in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Life in the new and old days is just like difference between
heaven and earth," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The Tu ethnic group lives mainly in Qinghai and the southern
part of Gansu Province in northwest China. The Huzhu Tu Autonomous
County is China's only autonomous county for the Tu ethnic group.

<HEADLINE> Tu Ethnic Group Living Wealthy Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tu ethnic group came into being during the Tan Dynasty (618-
907). The sleeves of Tu women's dresses are sewn from five colors
of cloth: red, yellow, green, purple and blue. They wear brightly-
colored vests and belts, and are sometimes called the "Rainbow
Nationality."
</P>
<P>
Though the Tu are famous for their vibrant dress and folk
dancing and singing, they live in remote rural regions with
laggard economy. For a long time before the founding of New China,
the Tu were considered poor and backward.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, especially during the country'
s opening and reform of the past 20 years, the group has become
more and more prosperous, said Wa Shide, a county official.
</P>
<P>
The Tu have improved their economic status with the help of
agricultural technology and expanding their business dealings
outside the county. Statistics show that the county's per capita
annual income increased from 70 yuan in 1978 to 1,100 yuan last
year. Meanwhile, the county's poverty-stricken sank from 280,000
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, advanced farming equipment and techniques have
helped more and more Tu people improve farming productivity and
also freed many of them from the obligations of farm labor to do
business with traders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiangrui's son, Ma Cunshou, is a young businessman in the
village. He has two motorcycles, a tractor, and household
appliances such as a refrigerator, a washing machine and a VCD
player.
</P>

"I am not the richest -- many more in the village are even
better off," he said.

county, he recently built a new house and bought a car.
</P>
<P>
Living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Tu people have
realized their home is rich in tourism possibilities because of
the scenery and ethnic folk customs. To attract visitors, the
county has opened a series of tourist sites featuring landscapes
and religious temples. In many of these areas, ethnic people give
performances of ethnic dance, display folk art, and demonstrate
traditional customs.
</P>
<P>
The county has received more than 100,000 tourists from a dozen
countries and regions worldwide, including Japan, Italy, the
United States and Germany since last year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Electronics Exports Trend Unpredictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Robust electronics exports have
played a key role in East Asia's economic recovery so far this
year, but any cyclical changes in the world market could weaken
the region's major sources of strength, economists warned.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight months, East Asian economies registered
stronger growth than even optimistic economists had expected,
mainly due to robust electronics exports, which account for around
50 percent of the total exports in South Korea, the Philippines,
Singapore and other Southeast Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a buoyant U.S. economy, a Japanese economy on the
mend and a resurgent Asian region, the higher demand since the end
of last year in the world electronic markets have improved East
Asia's export performance.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, overall earnings from exports in the first
half of the year grew by 13.6 percent on a year earlier, while in
Malaysia, 7 percent. In South Korea and Singapore, exports are
also picking up now.
</P>
<P>
The stronger export growth this year has played a key part in
the region's recovery. In South Korea, for example, gross domestic
product grew at a higher than expected 9.8 percent in the second
quarter of 1999 from the year-earlier quarter, when the economy
shrank 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia are also turning around quickly. Even
Indonesia, which has sustained a 20 percent drop in output, is now
expected to start expanding in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
David Fernandez, an economist with J.P. Morgan, said: "If you
look at where the growth has come from so far, it is important not
to point to reform. Most everything has to do with electronics."
</P>
<P>
However, the momentum in electronics exports may not be
maintained for too long, as memory chip prices have weakened
marginally from their peak, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, non-oil domestic exports climbed 7.5 percent
year-to-year in June, slowing from a 15.5 percent surge in May,
because of a slowdown in electronics exports.
</P>
<P>
After months of steady growth in export orders, electronic
orders in Singapore rose less than 1 percent in June and its disk
drive exports shrank 7.9 percent in June compared with growth of
5.7 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that export growth in economies like Singapore
tends to be volatile in the months ahead if they are reliant on
the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
A weaker electronics market means that East Asian economies'
performance during the second half of the year may not be as
spectacular as in the first half, they said.
</P>
<P>
But other analysts said that if the economies have diversified
beyond chip making into their products, they may continue to
benefit from exports of other products such as personal computers
and cellular phones, which are still enjoying healthy demand.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is very hard to predict when the cyclical
changes in the world electronics market will start. But one thing
is certain that those which are too reliant on electronic exports
are bound to suffer sooner or later when a demand cycle begins.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when the electronics market experienced a cyclical
change, East Asia's exports growth began nose-diving. In 1998, the
region's export revenues suffered a contraction in terms of the
dollar. An uptrend only began at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Many East Asian economies should learn a lesson from
over-dependence on electronic exports and change their economic
structures to avert a potential economic decline, economists said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Universities in China will
welcome 2.7 million freshmen this month, 330,000 of which are a
direct result of the Ministry of Education's attempt to increase
college enrollment.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that the estimated goal of an 11
percent college entrance rate for high school graduates in 2000
will be reached ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
For high school students, the national college entrance
examination held every July is no longer ultra-competitive, as
reforms have transformed China's higher education system into an
attainable pursuit for most high school students.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government announced last month that it will
increase the allocation for education in the national budget by
one percentage point annually over the next three to five years
and provide higher education opportunities for 15 percent of its
people by the year 2010, over the current nine percent.
</P>
<P>
College freshmen will have to pay their own tuition this year,
but those who lack the funds to do so will still have an
opportunity to go to school: On September 1, the Chinese
government will begin offering loans to financially-strapped
college students in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Wuhan. These
students will be required to pay half of the interest on the loans
within four years of graduation.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin, speaking at the Third National
Education Work Conference in June, urged the nation to make
education a priority and asked that reforms be deepened in China's
higher education system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is determined to build up a vigorous
higher education system that will inspire creativity from its
personnel, said Zhong Binling, a ministry official. China will
overhaul its current management and funding of higher education,
reduce the pressure-cooker atmosphere for applicants, and create a
favorable environment for quality education programs, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the ministry formed a plan to revitalize
education in the 21st century, which outlined a trans-century
picture for education reform and development. The Chinese
government also issued a regulation on improving education and
pushing forward quality education, saying that the fundamental
point of education is to improve the quality of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
Ren Lijian, a researcher at Nanjing University, said that in
the coming century, higher education will no longer be only for
the privileged, but a reasonable goal for all young people.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand-China Society Chief Hails China's Progress in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Bill Willmott, son of an
English teacher to China in the 1930-40s, said that 50 years ago
he lived in "a very different China from today."
</P>
<P>
Willmott was born in Chengdu, a well-known city in China's
southwestern province of Sichuan, stayed there through his teenage
years, immigrated to New Zealand in the 1970s and later traveled
to China 15 times. He said the Asian giant's progress in the past
half a century is "immense" and "earth-shaking."
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, "peasants around Chengdu lived in abject poverty .
.. and in the city, the bodies of starved people were found on the
streets every morning. Inflation of over 100 percent per month was
impoverishing university professors and factory workers alike," he
recalled during a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
he said, taxes on peasants were slashed to a minimum, factory
wages were raised, inflation was brought under control and
universities were democratized."
</P>
<P>
"They were exciting and optimistic days," said Willmott, now
president of the New Zealand-China Friendship Society.
</P>
<P>
He said that wherever he was, he followed with great interest
the development in China and is happy with the achievements China
has made since 1949.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has the standard of living of the ordinary Chinese
risen beyond their wildest imagination, but the Chinese society
has been transformed from a semi-feudal, agrarian base to a
progressive, industrializing economy, one of the fastest growing
in the world."
</P>
<P>
"Most important of all, the Chinese people have been
transformed. Life expectancy has doubled in 50 years, infant
mortality -- that terrible tragedy so common in the past -- has
been reduced to almost the same rate as in industrialized
countries. The health facilities in China are better than in any
other country at a comparable stage of economic development. ...
Education has taken giant steps at every level from pre-school to
university," Willmott said.
</P>
<P>
He described the changes in women's lives in China as "the most
striking."
</P>
<P>
"Women were denigrated and oppressed in the old China, and for
so many their lot was misery and poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
But today, he said, they can happily "hold up half the sky."
The employment rate among Chinese women is the highest in Asia and
even higher than the average for industrialized countries. China
has a greater proportion of women in its lawmaking National People
's Congress and in high government positions than in any other
Asian country and most industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
"These are all indications of the humanitarian and dedicated
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over 50 years," Willmott
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is still rural poverty, rapid advances are
being made to eliminate it. Although there are still huge problems
to overcome, the Chinese government is tackling them with
fortitude and wisdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The progress China has made in half a century is immense, and
friends of China everywhere will rejoice in the celebration of the
great event of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People'
s Republic of China," Willmott said.

<HEADLINE> The Burhan's Family: A Deep Love Of The Motherland (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th founding anniversary of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Xinhua News Agency is
releasing a series of stories about 50 Chinese men and women,
young and old, to present a picture of the changes that have taken
place in China over the past 50 years. These people will describe
their own experiences and how they fit into the changes in the
motherland. The following is the 14th article.
</P>
<P>
URUMQI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Oegur, a former vice president
of the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, says that the greatest
spiritual legacy his father-in-law Burhan Shahidi, Xinjiang's
great patriot, left was a deep love of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Burhan, who died in 1989, is loved and respected by all the
ethnic groups of Xinjiang for his role in the peaceful liberation
of Xinjiang in 1949 and his devotion to the motherland. He was
chairman of the Provincial People's Government for many years
after the New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
Burhan had eight children, five of whom are still living. His
daughter Suum, who is Oegur's wife, was the second eldest. Oegur,
who is now 81, was among the first group of people in Xinjiang to
join the Communist Party in 1949 after liberation. He was posted
to Alma Ata as Deputy Counsul-General in former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Oegur and Suum gave up a chance of staying in
Moscow and returned to Xinjiang after graduating from university
there to make a contribution to the motherland. Oegur became vice-
president of the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences and wrote
books, one of which was the Brief History of the Uygur Ethnic
Group in China.
</P>
<P>
In looking back over the past 50 years, he says that great
changes have taken place in Xinjiang: Fifty years ago it was just
a desert with little industry and completely backward. Xinjiang
couldn't even produce a single nail.
</P>
<P>
Today it has a well-integrated industrial system and
petrochemical products and agricultural machinery that are used
all over China, he says, and he and his wife are very happy with
their lives today in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> KLA Chief Pledges to Respect Disarmament Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) Hashim Thaqi said here Friday that the KLA intended to
respect the September 19 disarmament deadline while Italy called
for easing ethnic tension in the war-devastated Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Thaqi, head of the self-proclaimed provisional government in
Kosovo, had talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on
Friday. A Foreign Ministry statement released after their
encounter quoted Thaqi as saying that the KLA fully intended to
respect its commitments to the international community and put a
stop to the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, free elections would soon be held in Kosovo to
create new legitimate institutions, Thaqi said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Dini told Thaqi that "everyone must
do everything possible to reduce tensions and promote the peaceful
living together of the different ethnic groups in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The objective of a multi-ethnic Kosovo remains the
international community's priority," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He called on ethnic Albanian leaders to put a stop to the
exodus of Kosovo Serbs and to help in the reconstruction and
administration of the region as well as development of
institutions there.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the KLA's future credibility and its political
role in Kosovo depended upon this co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Thaqi's Rome visit is part of a round of meetings with European
leaders in various capitals after he announced that he aims to
turn the KLA into a political party. He arrived in Rome on Friday
morning.

dollars as of August 31, partly due to foreign debt payments, Bank
Indonesia said in its latest weekly report.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of net foreign exchange reserves was still
above the minimum target of 14.3 billion dollars set by the
International Monetary Fund, the report quoted by The Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gross foreign exchange reserves, which are net foreign exchange
reserves plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts, also
declined 146.2 million dollars to 26.8 billion dollars, the report
added.

<HEADLINE> The Burhan's Family: A Deep Love Of The Motherland (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Burhan's son Mulati and daughter-in-law Kamar share Oegur's
amazement over the great changes that have taken place in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, they graduated from the Beijing Petroleum
Institute but gave up a chance to stay and work in Beijing and
returned to Xinjiang to explore for petroleum.
</P>
<P>
They say that back then, exploration was very difficult
because transportation meant on foot or the back of a camel. Now,
however, they use helicopters to cross the desert and in one day
can finish what used to take an entire whole summer.
</P>
<P>
His wife Kamar's parents and siblings emigrated to the Soviet
Union before the 1990s, but she says that her roots are in China
because she is Burhan's daughter-in-law. Her husband Mulati says,
"My father lived a very simple life in those days and left nothing
for us when he died but a great love of China that has inspired
generations."
</P>
<P>
Burhan's family has been around now for five generations and
numbers about 60. They have intermarried with people from various
ethnic groups like the Uygurs, Kazakhs, Tatars, Uzbeks, and Han.
</P>
<P>
The big family is held together by the one strong belief
inherited from Burhan Shahidi: a deep love of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Christie Faces Drugs Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic 100m champion
Linford Christie is likely to learn his fate next week, after
attending a hearing into his positive drugs test on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Christie is hoping to clear his name in the investigation into
whether or not he took the banned substance nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
Though retired and only running for fun while he coaches other
sprinters, the 39-year-old was suspended after failing a drugs
test after an indoor meet at Dortmund, Germany, in February.
</P>
<P>
Christie faced the same three-man panel that heard the case of
Scottish athlete Dougie Walker, who was eventually cleared of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Jayne Pearce, spokeswoman for UK Athletics, said: "The hearing
has concluded and we will make a further announcement as soon as
the outcome is known."
</P>
<P>
Christie, who has protested his innocence, said after his
suspension: ""I'm virtually retired.
</P>
<P>
"For me to take drugs at the end of my career or when my career
is finished is stupid and ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard the news it was a shock. I'm innocent and I
keep telling everybody I'm innocent. It sounds like the same old
record but I did no wrong, so that's it."
</P>
<P>
If Christie is found guilty, he faces a two-year ban.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Rolls on, No. 8 Novotna Beaten at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland advanced to the round of 16 today at the U.S. Open
Tennis Championships here, but her opponent in last year's
semifinal, Jana Novotna of Czech Republic, will be going home.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Hingis beat German qualifier Sandra Kloesel 6-3,
6-1. Hingis needed only 61 minutes to eliminate her 20-year-old
rival. Hingis closed out the match with a two-handed backhand
winner, her 30th winner overall to just nine for the German.
However Hingis was a little sloppy, committing 25 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Now in her 104th week as the world's No. 1 player, Hingis has
won six WTA Tour titles this year, including the Australian Open
this year.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who formed a very successful doubles team with Hingis
until parting ways this year, was taken out in straight sets 6-3,
6-3 by Anke Huber of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, the 1998 Wimbledon champion, had 27 unforced errors
and just 11 winners in just her fourth match since losing in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will take on 1994 U.S. Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-
Vicario of Spain in the fourth round. The 10th seed had little
trouble with Switzerland's Patty Schnyder, ousting her in straight
sets 6-2, 6-2 in the first match of the day.
</P>
<P>
Hingis is 11-1 lifetime versus Sanchez-Vicario, including the
last 11 straight. This will be their second meeting in a Grand
Slam this year, with Hingis prevailing 6-3, 6-2 in the French Open
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario needed only 62 minutes to improve to 4-2
lifetime against Schnyder, who beat the now-retired Steffi Graf
last year in her final career match at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
American Mary Joe Fernandez posted the second upset of the day
as she eliminated No. 13 Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 7-5, 6-0.
A two-time semifinalist, Fernandez took advantage of 38 unforced
errors by her Belgium opponent to earn a fourth-round meeting with
third seed and fellow American Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Barbara Schett of Austria had little trouble moving on
as she routed Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain 6-1, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, American seventh seed Todd Martin fired 20
aces en route to a 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win over fellow Richey
Reneberg.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Greg Rusedski of Britain also reached the round of
16 with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 win David Prinosil of Germany; No. 14
Tommy Haas of germany survived a scare from Argentina's Mariano
Puerta before pulling out a 6-3, 6-2, 2-6, 6-7 (3-7), 6-1 tough
victory.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Agrees to Return to Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley, who seems
to publicly discuss the possibility of retirement during every
offseason, will be returning to the Houston Rockets for at least
one more year.
</P>
<P>
A team spokesman today confirmed that the Rockets have reached
an agreement with Barkley, who has been unavailable for comment.
Houston television station KRIV reported that Barkley will ink a
one-year deal worth $9 million.
</P>
<P>
Barkley's business manager Glenn Guthrie would not comment on
any contract talks but said his client will be leaving on Monday
for a tour in Barcelona, Spain. It is unknown when Barkley
officially will sign the deal.
</P>
<P>
Voted one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, Barkley will be
entering his 16th season and fourth with the Rockets. Despite
turning 36 during this past season, he finished second in the
league in rebounding at 12.3 boards per game.
</P>
<P>
He will remain part of a starting frontline of future Hall of
Famers whose career to be on the decline as they attempt to grow
old gracefully. Small forward Scottie Pippen turns 34 next month
and center Hakeem Olajuwon is 36. The trio battled injuries last
season before Houston lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first
round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
While leading the Rockets in rebounding last season, Barkley
was second in scoring at 16.1 points per game and second in
assists at 4.6 per contest. However, injuries again forced Barkley
to miss significant action and he shot less than 48 percent from
the field,his lowest total since coming into the league with
Philadelphia in 1984.
</P>
<P>
A groin injury, a torn triceps muscle and hernia surgery forced
him to miss time during the 1997-98 campaign, when he averaged a
career-low 15.2 points in 68 games.
</P>
<P>
Barkley has not played more than 71 games during the regular
season since 1992-93, when he earned his only Most Valuable Player
award as he led Phoenix to the NBA Finals in his first season
there.

<HEADLINE> Kipketer, Szabo Keep Perfect Records At Van Damme Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kipketer, the Danish, ran the season's best time in the 800
meters with 1:42.27, beating Hezekiel Sepeng by five meters.
Sepeng set a South African record of 1:42.69. If they reach next
victory, the two champions will share the 1 million U.S. dollars
Golden League jackpot.
</P>
<P>
"The jackpot is out there," Kipketer said. "It is like a
lottery. I just have to run fast."
</P>
<P>
Szabo also seized her chance in the women's 3,000-meter race.
Morocco's Zahra Ouaziz tried to shake off Szabo for much of the
race, but the Romanian just bided her time and waited to outkick
her. The result was similar to the World Championships at Seville
last week.
</P>
<P>
Szabo finished in 8:25.82, her second-fastest time this year.
</P>
<P>
In a very good performance, Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran
the second-fastest men's 3,000 in history, 7:23.09, only 2.42
seconds off Kenyan Daniel Komen's record.
</P>
<P>
Steeplechase world record-holder Bernard Barmasai also won his
sixth race out of six Friday, but the IAAF has eliminated him from
the jackpot competition. He said he might sue the IA.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot be employed somewhere and get no salary," Barmasai
said. "I want to run good in Berlin and then afterwards do
something."
</P>
<P>
The IAAF punished Barmasai for saying he colluded with Kenyan
teammate Christopher Koskei to determine the outcome of the Golden
League race at Zurich. Barmasai denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai finished fifth at the World Championships, but said
the Zurich scandal had cost him too much sleep and concentration.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, the women's 100-meter world champion, was the
only other athlete with a 5-for-5 record. But she has opted out of
any competition this season because of the back injury she
sustained during the 200 meters semifinals at Seville.
</P>
<P>
The Van Damme meet had 53 medalists from the World
Championships, including 18 world champions. The main absentee was
triple gold medalist Maurice Greene, who is running in Britain
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Bruny Surin, the silver medalist at Seville, won the
100 in 10.04, edging Jon Drummond.
</P>
<P>
American Michael Johnson, world champion and 200/400m world
record holder, won the 200 at 19.93, 0.09 seconds off the season's
best of Nigerian Francis Obikwelu.
</P>
<P>
Inger Miller continued to dominate the women's 200 in the
absence of Jones, beating Beverly McDonald of Jamaica, matching
their 1-2 finish at Seville.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Mohammed Mourhit set a European record for 10,000
meters, breaking the mark of Portugal's seconds in finishing
second to Charles Kamathi of Kenya. Kamathi ran the year's fastest
time, 26:51.49. The Moroccan-born Mourhit, now competing for
Belgium, was timed at 26:52.30.

LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's official countdown to
the millennium kicked off on Friday with a free open-air concert
in Omagh, a Northern Irish town which suffered car bomb carnage a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
As Irish pop band The Corrs played to some 30,000 fans, two
Protestant and Catholic teenagers, Leanne Martin and Brendan
Grimes, joined Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam in
lighting a special "millennium beacon", the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
The people of Omagh said they were offering the beacon as a
symbol of hope to 22 other British cities for their New Year
celebrations. The flame will light their millennium beacons.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a message of support for the
festivities, which launched Britain's "Year 2000" celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Brendan Grimes is a relative of Mary Grimes and her daughter
Averil Monaghan who were killed in the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine people were killed and more than 200 were injured
when a car bomb exploded on the main street of the bustling market
town in August 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Strike Deal on Reviving Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- In a major breakthrough in
the Middle East peace process, Israel and Palestine reached Friday
agreement on the implementation of a U.S.-brokered peace deal,
breaking an eight-month impasse.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister of International
Cooperation Nabil Shaath, who replaced Saeb Erekat as the senior
negotiator hours ago, announced that the two sides would sign an
agreement in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
"All the issues have been settled...I hope it will usher in a new
era of peace," Shaath said, refusing to give further details on the
new deal.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited announcement came after the two sides had overcome
their last obstacle in the negotiations, agreeing upon on the issue of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinian side had accepted the Israeli proposal
that Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners, or political
prisoners called by the Palestinians, with a promise to discuss more
relase at a later stage. The Palestinians have demanded the release of
400.
</P>
<P>
Under the new deal, Israel will hand over 11 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period of five-month,
starting the troop withdrawals in a few days and completing by January
20.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also re-launch negotiations in early September
on thorny issues like the possibility of an independent Palestinian
state and the fate of Jerusalem and over 3 million Palestinian
refugees. The negotiations were frozen after a ceremonial start in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following two days of intensive shuttle
diplomacy by visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright held talks with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza
Friday night after separate talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
She was forced to intervene after a tentatively planned signing
ceremony in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria Thursday afternoon in
her presence was scotched by the continued difference between the two
sides over the issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said that Albright's five-day visit to the region,
which has also brought her to Morocco and will bright her to Syria,
Jordan, and possibly, Lebanon, would focus on the Israeli-Palestinian
permanent talks and the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, which
froze three years ago.
</P>
<P>
A deal over the implementation of the Wye agreement will certainly
be a major achievement for Barak, who ousted his hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu three months ago on a platform to revive the Middle
East peace process on all its tracks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first since Barak took office in early July, put
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track following an
eight-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu halted the implementation of the Wye agreement late
last year, two months after he signed it with Arafat last October,
in a failed attempt to woo back rebellious far-right coalition
partners who oppose any territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
The victory of Barak has raised expectation in the Arab world as
well in the international community that the century-long conflict in
the region might finally be put behind forever.
</P>
<P>
Doubt was raised after Barak proposed to the Palestinians to
renegotiate on the implementation of the Wye agreement. It turned out,
however, that the revised deal would bring benefit to both sides.
</P>
<P>
For the Israeli side, the new timetable for the withdrawal, in
which a final stage of troop withdrawal will be postponed until the
final status talks have been well underway, will help reduce the risk
of potential confrontation between the Palestinians and Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
About 15 Jewish settlements would be partially or fully isolated
after the final stage is carried out. Under the new deal, a prospect
for a permanent peace agreement will help calm the outrages of the
public including the settlers.
</P>
<P>
For the Palestinians, the revised deal will offer them land with
more continuity, an important element of an independent state requires.
It will also offer the release of more political prisoners, since the
original accord allows Israel to free prisoners purely out of its
choice.
</P>
<P>
The last, and the most important, the deal will significantly
boost confidence between the two sides, which has been severely
damaged by the stalemate in the last three years, when they enter
the final status talks dealing with issues lying in the heart of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the deal will also help advance the Israeli
peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Barak's election victory, Israeli and Syrian leaders
have exchanged many messages of peace through third parties. But the
hope for an immediate resumption of peace talks dimmed after the
Israeli-Palestinians ran into deadlock.
</P>
<P>
A peace with Syria will effectively put an end to the conflict in
southern Lebanon, where Syria is a main power broker. Barak has
imposed a one-year timeline for himself to pull Israeli troops from an
occupying zone in southern Lebanon.

<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved
higher Friday as the government's employment report eased
investors' concerns about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 235.24 at
11,078.45. The Blue chip index fell 94.67 points Thursday
on fears of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index scored its biggest point gain of
108.87 at 2,843.11, surpassing the closing record high of
103.16 for a point gain set on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 38.13 at 1,357.24.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Labor Department reported
that employers added smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to their
payrolls in August and average hourly earnings rose just 0.2
percent from a year ago. The data eased fears about higher
interest rates among investors who had believed that any
inflationary signs could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates for the third time this year.

KATHMANDU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The 8th round of ministerial
level talks between Nepal and Bhutan to resolve the Bhutanese
refugee issue will be held next week, The Kathmandu Post quoted a

<P>
HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong formula one power
Grand Prix, a round of this year's formula one powerboat world
championship, has been deferred to next year, according to a news
release sent by Hong Kong powerboat association reaching here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was confirmed at the end of 1998 as the venue for the
ninth round of the 1999 Union International Motonuatique (UIM) F1
world championship slated for October 28 and 29.
</P>
<P>
"Although a number of prestigious companies have made firm
sponsorship commitments, the total funding was not sufficient to
stage the event to the professional standard which both Hong Kong
and the UIM F1 world championship rightly expect," said Peter
Wearing Smith, chairman and CEO of organizer Grand Prix
International Promotions Limited.
</P>
<P>
UIM, governing body of the F1 world championship, expressed its
disappointment at the cancellation of the Hong Kong event from the
1999 calendar.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is one of the best locations we have seen for many
years... however, Hong Kong has a firm position in our 2000
championship," commented Nicolo Di San Germano, UIM series
promoter.
</P>
<P>
The F1 world championship is organized by UIM, which has
attracted millions of spectators worldwide since its inception in
1981.
</P>
<P>
The release added that the three-million-US-dollar Hong Kong F1
powerboat Grand Prix has already received vital support from local
organizations involved in the event, such as Tai Po district board,
the regional services department, marine police, marine department,
Hong Kong police, transport department, Hong Kong Powerboat
Association and many others.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Accepts E. Timor Ballot's Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Defense
Forces (TNI) Saturday accepted the choice of the majority of East
Timorese rejecting the offer of special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"The TNI takes the result of the ballot as being the East
Timorese people's aspiration and conscience," Chief of TNI's
Information Service Brig. Gen. Sudrajat said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official announcement of the result of the
August 30 direct ballot, 344,580 voters or 78.5 percent chose
independence against 94,388 voters or 21.5 percent preferring
wide-ranging autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Sudrajat called on all sides involved to accept and respect the
ballot's result as a democratic decision and to participate in the
effort to maintain security in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the tripartite agreement among Indonesia,
Portugal and the United Nations, TNI and Indonesian Police (Polri)
troops would continue to be stationed in East Timor up to the end
of November this year.
</P>
<P>
"Until the end of November, TNI and Polri troops will maintain
order and security in East Timor in cooperation with the U.N.," he
was quoted by the Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked what the TNI would do if clashes between the
pro-independence and pro-integration groups continued to occur in
the post-ballot period, Sudrajat said whatever security
disturbances would occur, the TNI and Polri were ready to perform
their duties as expected.
</P>
<P>
But the TNI would also approach the rival parties in East Timor
and call on them to restrain themselves and take part in efforts
to maintain security.
</P>
<P>
"Even now, we call on all sides to help prevent the security
situation from deteriorating," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Identifies Strategies for Ability-driven Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has identified
three key strategies toward building an ability-driven education
system which values every individual's part in the society.
</P>
<P>
The strategies are: the flexibility in the education structure,
identification of talents and abilities, and a review of
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Education Minister Teo Chee Hean made the
announcement Saturday at his ministry's workplan seminar held
here, saying that his ministry will be working on the three
strategies in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
When strategies and programs in these areas are fully
developed, he said, they will take Singapore closer to an
ability-driven education system.
</P>
<P>
The concept of ability-driven education is supported by the
belief that every individual has a valuable contribution to make
to society and country, said Teo.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the ministry has over the last one year taken two
major steps towards an ability-driven education system.
</P>
<P>
First, it has developed and implemented the school excellence
model to broaden the way schools are appraised.
</P>
<P>
Under this program, schools will need to take a more holistic
approach to educating their students, beyond a narrow focus on
academic results, he said.
</P>
<P>
Second, the new university admission system will be introduced
in the year 2003, which will move away from the current reliance
on the A level exams for admission towards a more well-rounded
evaluation of a person's ability.
</P>
<P>
These steps are important changes that will help shape the
behavior and motivation of Singapore's schools and students, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed whether Singapore will continue to be an
exceptional nation will depend on the people, on how well their
talents and abilities have been identified, developed and
harnessed.

<P>
"The Chinese government grants high comment and appreciation
over this," he stressed.

reunification represents the common aspiration of all Chinese at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the "One country, two systems", which was
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is China's
basic policy in handling the Hong Kong and Macao issues, as well
as the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The prerequisite of this policy is that there is but one China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Lee Teng-hui brazenly called the relations across the
Taiwan straits "the state-to-state" ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said this is a "very dangerous step" towards splitting
China and a severe provocation against the one-China principle
that is well received by the international community.
</P>
<P>
This has also undermined the basis for stable relations across
the Taiwan straits and for peaceful reunification, and has been
condemned by the international community, including the overseas
compatriots, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the Chinese tradition for reunification and
against separatism has always been consistent and the people
across the straits share the same origin and the blood-is-thicker-
than-water sentiment cannot be cast off.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is firm in its determination to
safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Jiang said, "The situation in
China is good," citing the political stability, harmony among
different nationalities, the deepening of the reform and the
steady pace of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics is
gradually exerting its great vitality, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has
stood the test of the past two years and is continuing to maintain
prosperity, and the forthcoming return of Macao to the motherland
will be a new page in China's reunification cause, which he said
can be a great celebration by Chinese at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Korn Dabbaransi, Thai deputy prime minister and chairman of the
Chinese-Thai Friendship Association, and Boonsong Srifuengfung,
chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, also spoke at the
banquet, extending a warm welcome to Jiang on his state visit to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen, who is accompanying Jiang on
the ongoing Thai tour, was among those present at the banquet.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is scheduled to leave Bangkok for Phuket later Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Mission-Critical Firms to Comply with Y2K Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reiterated Saturday its directive to all mission-critical offices
to make public their state of readiness for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
Companies that do not follow the law will open themselves to
prosecution for damages, if their products or services fail, said
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Year
2000 Compliance, or Y2K bug, in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
"These firms expose themselves to damage claims and prosecution
from consumers and business partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2k bug is a built-in flaw in older computer systems that
prevent them from correctly recognizing dates from January 1, 2000
onward.
</P>
<P>
As a result, such computer systems could mistake the year 2000
for the 1900, hence possibly jeopardizing operation of computer
dependent industries.
</P>
<P>
Aguiluz said that all mission-critical firms in the Philippines
have until September 30, the deadline set by the Y2K law, to
submit their state of Y2K readiness to the Y2K commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the law signed by President Joseph Estrada in June,
mission-critical sectors, which include government services,
public utilities, tele-communications, transportation, finance,
health care and manufacturing, must disclose the readiness of
their products to continue functioning by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
But as of August 30, less than 1,000 of the 18,000 companies
monitored by the Y2K commission have submitted their readiness
statements.
</P>
<P>
"We've advised them to submit their statements so we can take
the needed measures to make them Y2K ready," Aguiluz said.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Paralyzes Pakistan's Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's major cities
Saturday witnessed complete shutdown as traders ignored the
government's pleas and closed down their businesses to protest
against the imposition of the general sales tax.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide strike was called by the All Pakistan
Organization of Small Traders and Cottage Industry, which was
backed by all the opposition parties, including the main Pakistan
People's Party led by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Karachi, the country's biggest commercial center, remained
completely closed after a violent anti-government rally on Friday
evening. However, activities at the Karachi port were normal.
</P>
<P>
There was scant traffic on roads and attendance was thin in
governmental offices, banks and educational institutions. There
were reports of three bomb blasts and burning of 11 vehicles in
different parts of the city, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Lahore, the hometown of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was also
closed, though a nominal number of traders opened their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Traders in the capital Islamabad and its twin city Rawalpindi
as well as northern town of Peshawar were also on strike.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parities have launched a fresh wave of
anti-government movements, taking advantage of the opportunity as
traders are angry at the government's decision to impose sales tax
on oil, gas and other service sectors.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale rallies were held in cities including Karachi and
Lahore during the past days and several protesters were killed in
clashes with police.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resumed their peace
talks on October 25, a senior official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio interview
that the recent fighting that killed some MILF members in Basilan,
the Southern Philippines, would not affect the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I see the possibility of the peace talks opening on October
25," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the peace process would proceed
smoothly despite last week's battle in Basilan for the rescue of a
four-year old girl kidnapped by the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
Government troops engaged suspected members of the extremist
group Abu Sayyaf and MILF in a battle last week to secure the
release of the girl. Around 40 rebels were killed and a dozen
government soldiers were wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and the MILF broke down
eight months ago after troops from the two sides clashed for weeks
in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF is fighting for an independent Muslim
state in Mindanao, but the rebel group's demand has been firmly
rejected by the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Saturday expressed her condolences to the family of
former Foreign Minister A.C. Shahul Hameed who died of a heart
attack in Colombo Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"I learnt with shock and grief the passing away of Mr. A.C.S.
Hameed, a veteran parliamentarian of the United National Party
(UNP)," said President Kumaratunga in a letter to Hameed's wife.
</P>
<P>
She highly praised Hameed for his unremitting endeavor to bring
peace to this war-ravaged island nation.
</P>
<P>
"The country lost Mr. Hameed at a very crucial and decisive
time when his services were much needed," said the president.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Hameed had been a strong supporter of the need
for political consensus between the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
and the UNP for meaningful devolution of power as a measure of
achieving peace, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Hameed, 71, a senior member of the main opposition UNP, died at
a private hospital where he was admitted on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was the longest serving foreign minister in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Hameed was involved in unsuccessful negotiations with the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Hameed had played a key role in efforts to defuse
tension between the PA and the UNP and bring about a settlement to
the country's long drawn-out ethnic war.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that his death was a setback to the ongoing
peace effort in the country which has been plagued by the 16-year
old civil war between the government and the LTTE rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 27,277 crimes
were committed in Kuwait in 1998, once every 20 minutes, according
to a report published recently by the Kuwaiti Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thirty murders were recorded last year, an 88 percent increase
compared with the 16 cases in 1997, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In addition to murders, the report said, the crimes were
diverse in nature, ranging from theft and drug trafficking to
dud checks, armed robbery and bribery.
</P>
<P>
The report said one of the most important causes is the
widespread availability of weapons left behind by Iraqi troops
during its occupation of Kuwait in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
The report said that although the authorities were alarmed by
the vast spread of crimes, no serious action was taken to combat
the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry urged other government bodies, along
with the Parliament, to join in the anti-crime campaign, as the
ministry is "unable to deal with the sharp increase of crimes
singlehandly."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Opposition Leader Regrets at E. Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) Megawati Soekarnoputri
Saturday expressed her regret at the outcome of the autonomy
ballot held by the U.N. in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
As Leader and presidential candidate of the PDI-P that won most
votes in the June 7 general election, Megawati said: "I am very
concerned and of course very sad for the autonomy ballot's
result." "For me the most important issue was not the result of
the ballot itself, what concerned me was things that might happen
after the polling, especially the refugee issue," she said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. announced Saturday morning that over 78.5 percent of
East Timorese voters voted for independence from Indonesia during
the August 30 direct ballot.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that about 15,000 East Timorese people had fled
to East Nusa Tenggara since the announcement of the direct ballot
result.
</P>
<P>
Megawati also admitted that she had received reports about
manipulative and cheating activities within the ballot's process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food and vegetable prices in East Timor have
increased 100-200 percent after the announcement of the result of
the ballot Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"If this should continue, then East Timor will be short of
food," said one of the local food seller there.

good work.
</P>
<P>
While inspecting the Hong Kong Customs and the Excise

well as relevant authorities to protect intellectual property
rights.

<P>
"The department's success in law enforcement has helped
upholding the law and order of Hong Kong, " said Tung.

participation in the international customs arena that Hong Kong
remained a separate customs territory after its return to China,
and that the concept of "one country, two systems" had been
implemented successfully in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"With the approach of the 21st century, we commit ourselves to
developing Hong Kong into a center of innovation and technology,"
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that to reach the goal the department shall
continue to play an important role in the protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has transformed from a seaport into a leading
international commercial center and the department has enlarged

JINAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
now lead the country in the export of aquatic products, handling
some 204,000 tons in the first half of this year, up more than a
year-on-year 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Resultant foreign currency earnings amounted to 375 million U.S.

</P>
<P>
The output increase was mainly attributed to expansion in the
breeding acreage of shrimps and fan shells and the upgrading of
the breeding technology, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
A special sales agency has been set up in Shandong to promote
the trade of aquatic products with Japan and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: Charter Changes Need More Foreign Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that his country will remain a
consistent tailender among Southeast Asian countries in cornering
direct foreign investments unless it adopts bold economic reforms
through charter changes.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly TV program, Estrada said that Thailand, Malaysia
and other Southeast Asian countries have opened their doors to
foreign investments and have allowed foreigners to gain full
control of local ventures.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1998, Thailand attracted 18.5 billion U.S. dollars
in direct foreign investments and Malaysia 22.4 billion dollars,
but the Philippines got only 7.5 billion dollars, according to
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
"The worst-case scenario is already happening, we are already a
consistent tailender in the investments race. We will remain in
that place unless we do something," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
He said the investments figures also show the need for the
country to make its business climate more attractive to foreign
investors by way of relaxing restrictions on their ownership of
land and full participation in local ventures.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine constitution, foreigners are not allowed
to own land and their shares in industries can not exceed 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that is why he is pushing for economic reforms
through charter changes.
</P>
<P>
He said that these reforms are expected to draw in foreign
investments, reinvigorate local industries, create enough jobs for
the poor, and even bring down the cost of basic services.
</P>
<P>
While Estrada is campaigning for charter changes, many people
in the Philippines show their strong opposition to such a move.
The opposition forces fear that the president might extend his
single six-year term through amendments to the constitution.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Exports Fruits, Vegetables Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is making headway
in its agricultural produce export, the Ethiopian Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Ethiopian Fruit and Vegetable Marketing
Enterprise (ETFRUIT) exported in 1997/98 fiscal year 31,188
quintals of fresh horticulture produce of flowers, fruits, and
vegetables above the set target of 31,000 quintals.
</P>
<P>
ETFRUIT presently handles about 90 percent of the total foreign
sales of agricultural produce in the country.
</P>
<P>
It earned last year 31 million birr (nearly four million U.S.
dollars) in foreign currency, up 57 percent against the income of
the previous year, said Mulugeta Demewoz, general manager of the
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
ETFRUIT was firstly established as a marketing enterprise in
April 1980 and restructured as a public enterprise in November
1993. Its major export items include vegetables, cut flowers and
fruits.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia, heavily dependent on coffee export, which accounts
for nearly 70 percent, now believes that to start agricultural
produce export is a major alternative to increase foreign exchange
earning.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Trade and Industry, hides and
skins have been in the second place for a long time but dropped to
the third in the fiscal year of 1997/98 due to the East Asian and
Russia's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the exports of oil seeds and pulses, meat and
horticulture are growing at a higher rate than all other products
in the country.
</P>
<P>
A number of countries including the Netherlands, Germany,
Switzerland, the United States and Japan are major trading
partners of Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Antelope Poachers Given Harsh Penalties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Three more Tibetan antelope
poachers have each been given 12 years in jail and fined 60,000
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jiqing, a farmer in Wulan County in northwest China's

County in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, Tashi and
Puddo, who are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Ma was nabbed by rangers in a combined raid mounted by the

with two small-calibre rifles and more than 3,500 rounds of
ammunition, killing 88 antelopes, while Tashi and Puddo illegally
purchased the antelope furs at a price of 530 yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Tashi and Puddo are wanted by the police.

five-day trip designed to assess the humanitarian consequences of
nine years of U.N. sanctions on Iraq.

Upon arrival in Baghdad, the delegation said they would
examine the effect of economic sanctions on the Iraqi civilian
population, the Iraqi government policies and related
U.S. economic and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation said they would also investigate the
effects of depleted uranium, the health hazards suffered by the
U.S. veterans and the Iraqi civilians, as well as the escalation
of U.S. bombing campaign against Iraq.
</P>

total cost of more than three billion yuan, with work starting six
years ago.

The investment was partly from Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund. Key equipment and technology were introduced
from Germany, Belgium, Norway and the United States.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Beijing residents,
medical experts and health officials today celebrated the first
anniversary of a successful national public awareness campaign on
the dangers of high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Through lectures, telephone hotlines and bulk mailings, the
Ministry of Health (MOH) program has given more than 10,000 people
nationwide the information on hypertension, which affects more
than 100 million Chinese, or one-thirteenth of the nation's total
population.
</P>
<P>
"Most hypertension cases could be prevented if the people are
aware of daily nutritional needs and healthy lifestyle habits.
Unfortunately, lots of them know nothing about hypertension
prevention," says Liu Lisheng, chairwoman of the China
Hypertension League, a non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
This general lack of awareness calls for massive health
education programs and effective disease-prevention networks,
which in turn will help the government and medical fields that
have pursued the "health-for-all" goal for 50 years, she says.
</P>
<P>
China has won international recognition for wiping out the
countrywide iodine deficiency syndrome (IDD) and protecting
millions of newborns from polio and tetanus.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the introduction of iodized salt into family kitchens
in 1993, China is expected by the year 2000 to eradicate IDD,
which leaves its sufferers physically and mentally handicapped. (

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Calls for Peace, Stability in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano urged all African Nations to adopt a culture of peace, so
as to establish mutual trust between countries and their
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a session of the African Committee
of the Socialist International, Chissano blamed the "irresponsible
and warmongering attitude" of Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), for
the deteriorating situation in Angola.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I would like once again to make a vigorous appeal
to Savimbi to spare the Angola people from the agony, hunger,
disease, death and destruction which have been in that country for
more than 40 years."
</P>
<P>
Chissano, who is also chairman of the South African Development
 Community (SADC), said that achieving peace and stability "is
vital in order to give Angolans the calm they have been denied
over these years, and to allow this conflict, one of the most
tragic legacies of the cold war, to be definitively buried as a
nightmare of the past."
</P>
<P>
Both factions of the main rebel movement, the Congolese Rally
for Democracy (RCD), signed the ceasefire in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Chissano expressed the belief that the the prospects for peace
were good. But, he said in order to fully implement the agreement,
the entire international community must take up its
responsibilities so as to help reconcile the members of the
warring groups.
</P>
<P>
He said it was urgent that the United Nations would send
observers to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"Our own experience shows that such a sensitive matter as the
conflict in the DRC can only be solved through a combination of
factors, including the political will of those involved", he
added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Mozambique +is determined to do all that it can
for the restoration of peace throughout the Great Lakes region."

<HEADLINE> Army to Remain in Eastern Border Region: Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Iranian Army
Ali Shahbazi said on Saturday that the presence of army units in
the region along the country's eastern border will continue.
</P>
<P>
"The mission is in response to orders issued by leader of
the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei," he said in
Mashhad, capital of the eastern province of Khorasan, quoted
by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Iran massed up to 200,000 troops from both the army and the
Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) along its eastern border
with Afghanistan to pressure the ruling Taliban to return the
bodies of killed Iranian diplomats and a correspondent in northern
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi said the Army's presence in the 1,000-square-kilometer
region "will continue till all objectives of the mission are
attained."
</P>
<P>
Four days ago, Rahim Safavi, head of IRGC, said the elite
force will remain along the Afghan border as long as the Taliban
are in power in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We will stay in the area until there is a stable and
popularly supported government in Afghanistan," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The massive troop presence in the eastern region actually
has dual missions: the first is to keep pressure to bear
on the Taliban, and the second is to tighten crackdown on
drug trafficking and banditry, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi described the army's performance in confronting
bandits and establishing security in the region as "successful"
and said Khamenei has announced his satisfaction.

With 20 million babies born each year, China has formed a
network of 3,600 epidemic-control agencies and 64,000 township
clinics across the country to carry out regular vaccinations. The
program will reach 90 percent of the newborns next year.
</P>
<P>
"Laying importance on disease prevention and control is an
unchanged health policy of China," says MOH official Shao Ruitai.
"Its effectiveness has been witnessed in the past 50 years, and
has paved the way for the health-for-all goal which is advocated
by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
</P>
<P>
The prevalent rate of infectious diseases last year was only
one percent of the level 50 years ago. "A well-functioning disease-
control system and its 280,000 workers play a prominent role,"
says Shao at the MOH's department of disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
Also, WHO Director-General Dr. Gro Brundtland has described
China's progress in achieving better health as "extraordinarily
rapid and comprehensive."
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Beijing last year, the WHO head said it is
astounding that the life expectancy in China has doubled and the
infant mortality rate has dropped from 200 per 1,000 to 35 per 1,
000 live births since the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949.

Ordinary Chinese are showing their interest in pursuing a
healthy daily lifestyle. A poll conducted by Horizon Market
Survey Company, a well-known non-governmental firm in China, early
this year showed that 70 percent of Chinese regard good health as
"the most important thing in life," rather than happiness or
fortune. The respondents also believed physical exercise is the
best way to keep fit.
</P>
<P>
The survey results may explain the glut of fitness programs on
TV, the booming sales of sports equipment in recent years, not to
mention the familiar sight in parks and side streets of people
jogging, doing deep-breathing exercises, and even practising the
tango.
</P>
<P>
But public health experts have warned that the road to "health
for all" is by no means smooth for China, since chronic illnesses
like hypertension and cardiovascular disease, and also
environmental pollution and industrialization are imposing greater
threats to the Chinese than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The weapon-of-choice to battle the problems should be health
education, for it's both inexpensive and highly effective, experts
suggest.
</P>
<P>
The health ministry plans to improve a health education network
which is expected to cover all cities and 80 percent of rural
areas by 2010. The network will be responsible for distributing
information on food hygiene, maternal and infant health care,
smoking control, and prevention of infectious and chronic diseases.

HONG KONG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
said here Saturday that he is optimistic about the economic growth
of Hong Kong in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a radio hotline program, Tung said the latest
economic statistics on the second quarter revealed signs of an
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The local people are regaining their consumption ability and
confidence, the export is improving and the number of tourist
arrivals in Hong Kong is on the rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung stressed that it is an important job of the government to
create more employment opportunities for local residents and the
government has carried out many infrastructure projects to spur
the economic growth and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 13,000 jobs are expected to be created when
some infrastructure projects are started in the fourth quarter of
this year and that other infrastructure projects to be implemented
in the coming two years will also produce 120,000 job vacancies.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the development of small and medium-
sized enterprises, Tung said the government has offered them loans
totaling 2.5 billion HK dollars (320 million U.S. dollars) and he
is now trying to convince local banks to keep an eye on the
potential of these enterprises and offer loans to them.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to offer some grants to small hi-tech
firms and the details of the plan will be published very soon, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Subclan Fighting Breaks Out in Somalia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting flared up
between rival subclans from the main Abgal clan of Ali Mahdi
Mohamed in the town of Jowhar, 90 Kilometers north of Mogadishu
Friday, killing at least four and wounding more than seven others.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses contacted on the telephone lines in
the town, more than five battle wagons and nearly 100 fighters
from both sides were involved in the armed confrontation between
the Daud subclan of Warlord Muse Sudi Yalahow and those of the
Galamh subclan.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have not been in good terms ever since the
fighting over the tax imposition in Karan market of North
Mogadishu by Muse Sudi Yalahow took place in early March this
year.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out Friday when heavily armed militiamen from
the Daud subclan escorting lorries from the central region of
Mudug towards the capital were intercepted by the Galmah
militiamen manning an illegal roadblock at the entrance of the
town.
</P>
<P>
The Galmah militiamen have allegedly asked for extortion money
exceeding 20,000 shillings (1.8 U.S. dollars) from each of the
lorries on the convoy, a demand was strongly refused by the Daud
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
The Daud militiamen, annoyed by the extortion demands, opened
fire on the militiamen manning the checkpoint and wounded one of
them very seriously.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation, the Galamh sublcan militiamen attacked a Land
Rover and also wounded one from the Daud clansmen. Elders from the
town and the Imam of Abgal, Iman Mohamud Imam Omar, came out to
put off the flames of the war.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace talks came to a deadlock Friday afternoon
with each side encouraged by reinforcement militiamen from
Mogadishu, thus intensifying the clan arrogance.
</P>
<P>
Jowhar town, one of the most peaceful and farming towns in
Southern Somalia, was shocked by the thunder noise of the
Russian-Made anti-tank B- 10 and the anti-aircraft heavy machine
guns used by both sides in the poorly built town.
</P>
<P>
Although the exchange of the heavy gunfire subsided in the
Friday night, the tension showed no signs of reduction Saturday,
with the rival militiamen still in defensive positions over the
river of the town.

Annan announced that 78.5 percent of East Timor's residents voted
in favor of independence from Indonesia in a recent ballot.
</P>
<P>
"I now welcome the result, as a true expression of the will of
the people of East Timor," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the Indonesian government to "maintain
security and order throughout the independence process" as it had
agreed.
</P>
<P>
"This result holds out to the people of East Timor the exciting
prospect of building their own destiny through independence. It
must not be turned into tragedy through further violence," Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the foreign secretary said the international
community should be prepared to act if violence continues in the
wake of the independence referendum. Indonesia invaded East Timor
in 1975.
</P>
<P>
Britain put a naval destroyer on standby on Friday in response
to worsening violence in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Commends Uganda's Efforts to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye has commended Uganda for its efforts in
fighting AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he paid a courtesy call on Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni Friday evening, a press release from the
President's Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who is accompanied by the Deputy Minister of Health
Tatu Ntimizi, is leading a delegation of 30 members who are in
Uganda to study how the country is handling the AIDS scourge.
</P>
<P>
He praised Uganda for its bold political decision to create
awareness about AIDS and its dangers to the population, adding
that they had learnt a lot from Uganda during their three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to put into practice what the delegation has learnt
in Uganda, adding that the two countries should continue
cooperating in the fight against the pandemic disease.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also stressed the need for the East African
region to fight AIDS together as one group of nations.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Museveni briefed his guests on the strategy
taken to combat the epidemic in Uganda and told them that the
government took a deliberate step to talk openly to the population
at different fora and at public rallies about the presence of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
With the government efforts, the incidence of AIDS among
pregnant women has gone down from 30 percent in 1986 to 12 percent

<HEADLINE> Feature: Former Slave Now Master of Own Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Mosewa, a villager of the
ethnic Yi group, has turned his new home into a snazzy urban-style
residence, with marble flooring, leather sofas, and modern
electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
In his late 50s, Mosewa is also a motorcyclist who can nimbly
navigate the winding mountain roads in the Liangshan Yi Autonomous
Prefecture, in southwestern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I earned nearly 50,000 yuan and spent 70,000 yuan
on decorating the new home," he says. During the interview, he
occasionally flips open his mobile phone to make calls.
</P>
<P>
"My present life is even better than that of my owner when I
was a child slave 50 years ago," he adds.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 600,000 slaves in Liangshan at the time,
according to Mosewa. Life was harsh for slaves who were considered
merely the property of their masters. Slaves often had to sleep
with livestock, received beatings, and were traded at the whim of
their owner, he recalls.
</P>
<P>
The Yi are the sixth largest ethnic group in China, with a
population of 1.8 million in Liangshan. The nightmare of slavery
did not end for the Yi until 1956, seven years after the People's
Republic was founded.
</P>
<P>
In response to the strong outcry by the Yi people, the Chinese
government abolished the slavery system, stripped the slave owners
of their privileges, and distributed their land, livestock and
farm tools among the former slaves.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the Yi people not only lead a more satisfactory life,
they also are engaged in state affairs. Mosewa's second son is now
working in the prefectural government. According to official
statistics, over 50 percent of government officials at county
level in Liangshan are Yi.
</P>
<P>
Like Mosewa, many of his villagers have become well-off, thanks
to favorable government policies.
</P>
<P>
"The children now are much luckier" than their parents and
grandparents, he says, referring to the high illiteracy rate among
Yi people in the past. "Even slave owners were illiterate."
</P>
<P>
Of his five children, two are university graduates and three
are middle school graduates.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly 4,000 schools in the prefecture, including
five higher educational institutions. Some young people of Yi have
even acquired masters degrees and Ph.D.s.

<HEADLINE> Asian Parliamentarians' Conference Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The four-day Asian
Parliamentarians' Conference for Peace and Cooperation ended here
Saturday evening after adopting some resolutions and the charter
and rules of the Association of Asian Parliaments for Peace
(AAPP).
</P>
<P>
The charter of the AAPP was signed before the concluding
session.
</P>
<P>
"The association (AAPP) ... will forge unity among the people's
representatives in Asia and indeed among the peoples themselves.
It will make the peoples more aware than now of the need for peace
and inspire and equip them to attain, sustain and carry forward,"
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was elected as the
first president of the AAPP, told the final plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The association "will promote a culture of peace throughout the
continent and the world at large... The association is born out of
our unity. This unity must last forever," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Speaker Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury, who chaired the
conference, said, "Parliamentarians here have demonstrated their
willingness to strengthen our partnerships ... at the national,
regional and international level, to advance the causes that we
have been discussing over the past few days."
</P>
<P>
"By combining our forces, we are contributing to make Asia a
better connected region, a more integrated continent, a territory
with lighter boundaries and fewer barriers among us," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our overriding conclusion is that peace must be perceived as
the most important prerequisite for development," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the participating delegations, Malaysian
Parliament Speaker Tun Mohamed Zahir bin Jaji Ismail said the
conference "has provided the opportunity, allowing our voices to
be heard" and the "parliaments and parliamentarians are more than
before committed to the cause of peace in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly of
Cambodia and the newly-elected vice president of the AAPP, in his
speech asked for "support and suggestions to make our next
conference a successful one as a contribution to peace in the
region and in the world."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia will host the next conference of Asian
parliamentarians for peace and development in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Present at the conference were some 110 delegates from 31
countries and 20 dignitaries representing civil society
organizations. The conference was initiated by Bangladesh early
this year.

SHANGHAI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong International

</P>
<P>
About 20 scheduled flights carrying a total 3,000 passengers

<HEADLINE> Program Promotes Hypertension Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-nine year old Granny
Wang calls herself a student, even though she isn't registered at
any school and is unlikely to receive a diploma.
</P>
<P>
She is one of 10,000 people, mostly senior citizens, who have
attended lectures on hypertension awareness that are part of a
national health education program initiated in the Chinese capital
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"I have benefited from the program since I learned how to
prevent high blood pressure by using the right medicine," says
Wang Lianghui, whose life had been threatened by the disease
several times.
</P>
<P>
High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than 100
million Chinese, or one-thirteenth of the nation's total
population. It is one of the major causes of stroke-related deaths
in China.
</P>
<P>
"Most hypertension cases could be prevented if the people are
aware of healthy nutrition and lifestyle habits. Unfortunately,
lots of them even have no idea of hypertension prevention," says
Liu Lisheng, chairwoman of the China Hypertension League (CHL), a
non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
"Such a serious consequence calls for massive campaigns of
health education. The program is a good attempt," she said at
today's ceremony for the first anniversary of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The program, which was jointly launched by the Ministry of
Health (MOH), the CHL and the transnational pharmaceutical company
Pfizer, offers lectures by medical professionals and hotline
counseling and distributes brochures to people in other parts of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Beijing was chosen to launch the program because it has the
highest rate of hypertension in the country, with one in every
five citizens suffering from abnormally-high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"The causes vary from obesity, high cholesterol, excessive
intake of salt, smoking, and stress to lack of physical exercise,"
says Dr. Kong Ningling from the People's Hospital in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The city is carrying out a hypertension observation project,
which enables some four million urban residents to have their
blood pressure levels checked regularly.
</P>
<P>
A similar education program will soon begin in Shanghai, and
more public awareness activities are expected during the National
Hypertension Day on October 8, Kong Lingzhi, an MOH official.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Nile Basin Initiative
(NBI) Secretariat was officially opened Friday in Entebbe, 40
kilometers south of Uganda's capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
It was established at the end of the fifth meeting of the Nile
Technical Advisory Committee, the technical arm of the NBI, a
press release from the NBI said Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat will be the nucleus for planning the NBI
activities. It serves both the advisory committee and the Nile
Council of Ministers, the highest decision-making body of the NBI.
</P>
<P>
During its deliberations this week, working groups of the
committee examined various priority projects including the
efficient use of water for agricultural production, opportunities
for power trade in the basin and water resources planning and
management.
</P>
<P>
Other project areas discussed include environmental analysis
and management, applied training and public information, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
The Nile basin countries realized that the development of Nile
waters will require significant financial resources. So they
called for financial contributions from the outside.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in history that all Nile basin
countries had expressed a serious concern about the need for joint
discourse. They will pursue such discourse till a permanent legal
and institutional framework is in place.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka's Presidential
polls which are scheduled for the end of next year, are expected
to be moved forward to January, The Daily Mirror said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The polls in the second week of January next year will be
announced after the government presents its new budget for next
year in the parliament in November this year, the newspaper quoted
official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The officials were not immediately available for comment but
speculation has been rife in the local media that the polls will
be moved forward, the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chandrika Kumaratunga became the Sri Lankan president in
November 1994, winning a record 62.3 percent votes.
</P>
<P>
The decision on early elections was taken after surveys showed
the President Kumaratunga's popularity had not dropped as much as
that of lawmakers from her coalition in the past five years, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary polls, which are scheduled in August next year,
will be held soon after, the paper added.

<HEADLINE> Albright Makes Brief Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 4 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright arrived here Saturday afternoon from
Syria on a brief visit to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which would only last several hours, was not
officially included in her Middle East tour, her first since
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak took power from his hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Upon her arrival, Albright went straight into talks with
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hoss, who is also the foreign minister,
will explain to Albright Lebanon's stance in the peace talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of Lebanon since 1978 and set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has been demanding that Israel unconditionally
withdraws from both its south soil and Golan Heights it captured
from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria, an undisputed power broker in Lebanon, is stationing a
350,000-strong troops across the country to help maintain
stability after its 15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Hoss will also express to Albright his rejection that the
estimated 360,000 Palestinian refugees now sheltering in his
country be permanently resettled here.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said in his visit to the U.S. after taking office
that he would not allow Palestinian refugees to return to their
land and asked their host countries to resettle them, mostly
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government fear that the move would tip the country's
delicate balance between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
Albright has visited Egypt, Israel, Palestinian self-rule area
and Syria. She is expected to fly to Egyptian Red Sea city of
Sharm El-Sheikh to attend a signing ceremony of a new peace deal
between the Palestinians and Israel.

time, they will have to wait for more than a month to see the
results.
</P>
<P>
Political parties ended their campaigns Friday evening for the
first phase of polling in 145 constituencies spread over 16 states
and union territories and 343 seats for state assemblies.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 million voters will decide the fate of 966
candidates including Congress President Sonia Gandhi, who is
contesting the Lower House elections for the first time, and
caretaker Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who spearheaded the
campaign for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by his
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
The campaign was marked by promises and pledges, blames and
allegations, charges and counter-charges, and even acrimonious
personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
BJP and the Congress, the two major political forces in this
South Asian country with a population of nearly 1 billion, blamed
each other for the political instability in recent years ever
since the downfall of the BJP-led coalition last April.
</P>
<P>
The Congress, which rejected proposals to form a coalition with
other political forces, failed to gather enough outside support
from among the opposition to form a minority government after the
Vajpayee government had been voted out in Lok Sabha, the Lower
House of the Indian Parliament, by a one-vote margin.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, the strength of the major rival of the then ruling
BJP greatly weakened in the following month when three senior
party leaders questioned Gandhi's qualifications to occupy the
post of prime minister because of her Italian origin.
</P>
<P>
Sharad Pawar, Purno Agitok Sangma and Tario Anwar formed a new
group called the Nationalist Congress after their expulsion from
the party.
</P>
<P>
In a sharp contrast, the BJP managed to unite its camp under
the NDA, formed with 23 other small parties almost immediately
after the downfall of the fragile coalition.
</P>
<P>
Reading through the manifestos of the NDA and the Congress
issued toward the end of August, one can hardly find much
differences in their domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Both promised to provide a stable central government while
ensuring a fixed term of five years for all elected bodies
including Lok Sabha and state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
The NDA's manifesto sought to free the country of the triple
curses of hunger, fear and corruption and transform it into a new
India that is prosperous, strong, self-confident and at peace with
itself and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Congress said it understood stability best because of its
history, its basic character, its performance and, above all, its
long years of administrative experience.
</P>
<P>
The BJP blamed the political instability in recent years on
Gandhi and her party, saying it was unreasonable for the Congress
to pull down the BJP-led government last April and forced yet
another general election on the country which will last for more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the BJP and its alliance gave much publicity
to the success in the recent armed conflict with Pakistan in
Kargil of Kashmir and challenged the resolve of the Congress to
defend the country under a leader of foreign origin.
</P>
<P>
According to polls by several news organizations and other
agencies, more than 60 percent of the voters said they could not
accept a person of foreign origin to be their prime minister
though they might support the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
The polls showed that the NDA was clearly better positioned
than the Congress and, most probably, would win the election.
</P>
<P>
However, the final results are highly unpredictable as the
Congress also got the upper hand in several states and union
territories including New Delhi, where the party took over the
power last year from the BJP.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army, decided Saturday to take part in the
review of the Northern Ireland peace process, to start Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came in a vote after a two-hour "fairly intense"
meeting of Sinn Fein's national executive in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein Vice-President Pat Doherty said, "Despite these
strongly held views, the national executive agreed to accept the
recommendation from party president Gerry Adams that in the wider
interests of the peace process Sinn Fein will participate
positively in the review."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party's executive met in
Northern Ireland's capital of Belfast Saturday to discuss their
strategy for the forthcoming review.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble said earlier his party would be in the
review but wanted guarantees from Sinn Fein about its commitment
to non-violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Up to 10 people died with 40
others injured Friday morning in a worst traffic accident near
Windsor, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
According to CTV, the massive accident took place at 8:15 a.m.
in fog along a busy highway leading to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Smoke is rising from the piles of wreckage involving at least
40 cars and tractor-trailers on the highway and the nearby field,
where rescuers are trying to find the remains of victims trapped
inside vehicles and burnt to death.
</P>
<P>
The report said the two-way traffic is busy and too narrow,
indicating that may be a possible cause for the horrible accident,
which cannot be "exaggerated".
</P>
<P>
The injured people are in "fair conditions" without life risk,
according to the television.
</P>
<P>
Another traffic accident was reported at 5 a.m. Friday at
another section of the highway in the southern province of Canada.
The casualties are not yet available.

JAKARTA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Dane women's singles top seed
Camilla Martin was ousted in Indonesia Open badminton tournament

</P>
<P>
The world champion Martin had to bow out to Indonesian Lidya
Jaelawijaya by 11-13, 11-7 and 9-11.
</P>
<P>
After losing the opening set 11-13, Martin trailed again in the

7.
</P>
<P>
In the deciding set, the scores were tied four times at 3-3, 5-
5, 6-6 and 9-9. Aided by the crowd in the stadium, Lidya took the
last two points and entered the semi-finals of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
This was Martin's second lost in one week. She became the
victim to unseeded Japanese Kanako Yonekura in Singapore Open on
August 26.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's Ellen Angelina beat fourth seed Mette Sorensen from
Denmark with 11-7, 11-9, and Yuli Marfuah, also from Indonesia,

<P>
OTTAWA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The 8th Summit of la
Francophonie opened Friday morning in Canada's Atlantic city of
Moncton, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
The biannual gathering is being attended by heads of 52
governments, who were met at the gate of the headquarter building
by Governor General of Canada Romeo LeBlanc and Prime Minister
Jean Chretien
</P>
<P>
Among dignitaries at the meeting are United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan and la Francophonie Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac was given a red-carpet
reception upon his arrival at the airport.
</P>
<P>
Chretien, as host to the summit, chairs the opening meeting of
the countries using French as a common Language.
</P>
<P>
With Youth as the theme of the Moncton summit, the three-day
meeting will be devoted to discussions on how to better integrate
young people to face political, economic, scientific and
technological and social challenges in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Member countries will also explore ways to expand cooperation
in trade and prevention of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
A plan of action is expected at the end of the Moncton summit
to reflect achievements, future objectives, as well as concerns of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The international organization was launched in Paris in
February 1986, when 41 governments were represented at the first
summit. La Francophonie community has ever since expanded to group
52 governments, including the participating governments of New
Brunswick and Quebec of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Uganda to Strengthen Coop in AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye said Friday that his country is willing
to strengthen cooperation with Uganda in AIDS prevention and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks while meeting with Uganda's
First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Eriya
Kategaya at the International Conference Center in Ugandan capital
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye, who came here Thursday and spearheaded a big delegation
on a study visit to Uganda, said Tanzania and Uganda are both
suffering from the AIDS scourge and that Tanzania can learn a lot
from Uganda in enhancing people's awareness and mobilization of
non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
"We think the experience we have learnt from here will be more
relevant than that learnt from somewhere else like Europe because
we share many things culturally and economically," the Tanzanian
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to increase collaboration in every close-border
activity, in research and treatment, in fighting to bring down the
AIDS drugs available in markets," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that traditional healers in Tanzania would also learn
from their colleagues in Uganda. Herbal healing can be very
practical and effective if enough research work is done.
</P>
<P>
Kategaya, who acted as the acting prime minister of Uganda,
noted that the problem of HIV/AIDS cannot be viewed as solely a
matter of health. It concerns economy, education, agriculture and
culture.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that Uganda still faces a serious situation in AIDS
 prevention although the prevalence rate has been decreasing over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more health centers and surveillance units
to be established across the country in a bid to eradicate the
pandemic from the country as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian delegation, composed of over 30 people including
ministers, members of parliament, health officials and others, is
leaving for home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS prevalence in Tanzania is roughly 12 percent at
present. A total of 1.5 million people there are supposed to be
HIV-positive. Some 500,000 people have developed full-blown AIDS
and 400,000 children orphaned since the first AIDS case was
reported in 1983 in the country.
</P>
<P>
AIDS prevalence rate in Uganda was more than 25 percent and
even higher in early 90s. It has plummeted to the current level
of a little more than 10 percent as a result of massive
sensitization and firm government commitment.
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, Uganda is said to be the only country in Africa
which enjoys a downward trend of AIDS prevalence.

<HEADLINE> Greece Hopes Turkey to Become Candidate for EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see
neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union (EU)
membership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Papandreou said that Greece wanted to see Turkey
as a candidate country but Turkey and Greece's partners could not
overlook the fact that the neighboring country had
responsibilities and obligations.
</P>
<P>
If Turkey was ready to undertake these responsibilities, Greece
had no objection to helping, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean
Sea and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has also consistently blocked the more than 1-billion
U.S. dollars EU financial aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has repeatedly said that it supports Turkey in its
efforts to join EU but the condition is that Ankara must improve
its human rights record and its relations with Athens.
</P>
<P>
To ease its tense relations with Turkey, Greece will in the
near future partially lift its veto on EU funding for Turkey after
the devastating earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which has
claimed thousands of lives.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parliament to Be Enlarged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Interim
Political Authority (IPA) announced Friday that the number of
seats in the kingdom's parliament will be increased by 50 to 130
after elections scheduled for April 2000.
</P>
<P>
The increase was meant to ensure political stability in the
small southern African country, which was rocked by unrest last
year, IPA co- chairman Khauhelo Raditapole told a press
conference in Maseru.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take this decision as a compromise in the interest
of peace," although the move "was going to be a heavy burden on
taxpayers." Agence France Presse quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IPA, which will oversee the April elections, also decided
the parliamentary seats will be allocated according to a
combination of proportional representation and the
first-past-the-post system, which had been in place in Lesotho
since the country became independent in 1965.
</P>
<P>
However, Raditapole said the IPA, which consists of two
representatives of each of Lesotho's 12 political parties, was
still mulling over how the 130 seats would be divided between the
two systems of allocation.
</P>
<P>
The IPA was established and charged with holding elections
within 18 months after opposition protests over the outcome of May
1998 elections brought the government to the brink of collapse a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Botswana sent a military intervention force to
the kingdom to restore order, but that mission resulted in the
deaths of 75 people and massive destruction.

<HEADLINE> Ivanov: Dialogue Best Way to Address Karabakh Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday that Moscow attaches great importance to an
active and direct dialogue between the Armenian and Azerbaijani
presidents in their efforts to tackle the Nagorno-Karabakh issue.
</P>
<P>
"Direct dialogue is the best way to begin looking for a
solution to the Nagorno- Karabakh problem," the Interfax news
agency quoted Ivanov as saying in Yerevan, where the Russian
minister was on a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an enclave inside Azerbaijan where over 80
percent of the population are ethnic Armenians. Armenia and
Azerbaijan have been grappling over the enclave's status over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov, who flew in from Baku, Azerbaijan, denied reports that
Russia is to abandon the idea of "a common state" in resolving the
problem. "All peace initiatives are put forward jointly. The Minsk
Group is continuing its efforts to resolve the conflict," Ivanov
said, referring to the group chaired by Russian, U.S. and French
officials.
</P>
<P>
Russia wants the closest possible relations with Transcaucasian
countries, Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"All the Caucasus nations must sit down and discuss how to
transform the region into a stable and prosperous area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yerevan was the second stop of Ivanov's three-nation
Transcaucasian tour. From Yerevan, Ivanov will go to Tbilisi,
Georgia.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Central Bank Intervenes Foreign Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda, the country's
central bank, has intervened in the foreign exchange market by
selling five million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at reducing pressure on the currency shilling
 following the end of the coffee season, said a press release
issued by the bank's headquarters Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank is monitoring closely developments in the market and
will not hesitate to intervene if needed, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's capacity to intervene was further enhanced
by receipt of 22.87 million dollars from the International
Monetary Fund Thursday, it added.
</P>
<P>
When the Ugandan shilling dropped to the rock bottom against
the dollar in May, the central bank intervened with big sums and
succeeded in saving the depreciating currency.

Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni earlier this week warned that
Ugandan troops would launch vigorous counterattacks if provoked by
their Rwandan counterparts in the Democratic Republic of the

</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are supposed allies, but back rival factions
of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), which is fighting to
overthrow Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out in Kisangani in northeastern Congo between
Ugandan and Rwandan troops last month, stalling the attempts to
implement a cease- fire deal reached in Zambian capital Lusaka on
July 10.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the RCD finally endorsed the Lusaka peace accord
already signed by the six countries directly involved in the
conflicts in the third largest African country.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Highest Monthly Auto Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa recorded the
highest monthly figures for auto sales in August, according to the
National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The total new auto sales for August amounted to 27,398 units, a
7.5 percent higher compared to the figure in August last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the automobile association, the new car sales of
17,853 in the past month were 9.6 percent up over the same month
last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of light commercial vehicles and mini-buses were at 8,579
units, an improvement of 5.2 percent over the previous August, but
down by 3.2 percent from July.
</P>
<P>
Toyota came on top of the pile with overall August sales of
6,410 vehicles, followed by Samcor (Mazda, Ford, Jaguar) at 4,394,
Volkswagen at 4,232 and Delta at 4,005.
</P>
<P>
"The market is showing the signs of recovery that were
predicted for the second half of 1999," South African Press
Association quoted Johan van Zyl, managing director of the
marketing section of Toyota South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The growth process is, however, expected to be a gradual one,
but one that holds the promise of a degree of stability.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next three months new model activity can be expected
to stimulate the market as can aggressive marketing on the part of
dealers and manufacturers," the managing director said.
"Generally, the outlook is for the current positive trend to be a
sustainable one."
</P>
<P>
However, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers
of South Africa added a note of caution, pointing out that medium
and heavy commercial vehicle sales - a leading indicator of
investment trends - had remained under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales for August totaled
966 units, compared to 1,055 for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
August sales were boosted by significant fleet buying, said the
 automobile association.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, with South Africa's economic fundamentals
turning progressively more positive, the association said that
prospects looked more promising.
</P>
<P>
Current industry projections for the next year indicated that
new vehicle sales volumes, in aggregate terms, should grow by 10
percent.

<P>
LUANDA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 27,000
newly-displaced victims of war arrived in the cities of Uige and
Negage of Angola's northern Uige Province in the past two weeks
due to fresh military actions in the areas, media reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Vice-governor of the Uige Province Maravilha Dembo was quoted

humanitarian situation caused by the newly-emerged displaced
people in the cities of Uige, capital of the province, and Negage,
a city 40 kilometers southeast to Uige.
</P>
<P>
To make an appraisal of the situation of the displaced, who are
in need of accommodation, food, clothes and medical assistance,
Director of the Angolan Branch of the World Food Program (WFP),
Francesco Stripoli, Thursday made a visit to the province.
</P>
<P>
Stripoli has mentioned the availability of the conclusion of
the immediate assistance work for the displaced by the WFP Angolan
Branch, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"We talked directly with the displaced people to make clear
their necessities. All of them asked for tools and seeds for
cultivating the soil," said Stripoli, who visited the camps of the
displaced in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The governor also said the visit paid by Stripoli and his group
has encouraged the local authorities on the issue of reintegrating
the cities and giving assistance to the displaced people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright is expected to visit Lebanon Saturday
afternoon although Beirut is not initially listed on her Middle
East tour, foreign diplomats said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"No final date has so far been fixed. The Americans usually
tell us about a visit a few hours before it happens," Prime
Minister Salim Hoss told reporters after meeting U.S. Ambassador
David Satterfield.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also met with Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri for the possible Albright visit as President Emile Lahoud is

In her last tour to the region in September 1997, Albright made

Foreign Diplomats said Albright is expected to make a
three-hour stop in Beirut on her way back from Damascus, Syria to

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Supports Lebanon on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Deputy Foreign
Minister Olexander Maidannyk Friday expressed here his country's
support for Lebanon's position in the Middle East peace process,
the state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We support the implementation of the United Nations
resolutions, including Resolution 425," Maidannyk told a news
conference after meeting with Lebanese Foreign Ministry's Director
General Zafer Hassan.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the U.N. after Israel's first
invasion of Lebanon in 1978, calls for a unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who came here Thursday on a three-day visit,
also expressed hope that tracks on Syria and Lebanon be revived as
soon as possible.

GAZA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said Friday afternoon there were
obstacles facing the Palestinians and Israel on the implementation
of the Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing in his office here, Arafat said upon his
return from the Egyptian port city of Alexandria that "so far no
agreement was reached between us and them (the Israelis) and there
are still many difficulties facing the Wye Accord implementation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation Saeb Erekat said the situation has seen no change
regarding the Palestinian prisoner issue.
</P>
<P>
"There are some obstacles blocking the agreement and they
should be removed to ensure the arrival at a final solution,"
Erekat added, pointing out that "We cannot get into the final
status talks without the solutions of the current issues with
Israel and receiving written assurances from the United States."
</P>
<P>
No agreement would be reached without the settlement of the
prisoner issue, the PNA official added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Albright's visit to the self-rule areas
Friday evening would resolve all the problems in a satisfactory
way in order to sign the expected deal in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt,
on Saturday.

MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday successfully
tested its fifth-generation "Topol-M" intercontinental ballistic
missile, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the test, the eighth so far, a Topol-M fired from a
Plesetsk testing ground at 15:44 Moscow time (11:44 GMT) hit its
target at the Kura testing ground on Russia's Far Eastern
Kamchatka peninsula "with a high degree of accuracy," Interfax
reported, quoting Strategic Rocket Forces commander
Colonel-General Vladimir Yakovlev.

<P>
The pre-launch operations, the launch and the flight of the
missile all went ahead smoothly in accordance with the program,
Yakovlev said.
</P>
<P>
The Topol-M can be launched either from silos or from mobile
platforms. Its availability for service is twice that of other
Russian strategic missiles, and it is 2-2.5 times more accurate,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The range of the three-stage, solid fuel burning Topol-M is

<HEADLINE> Jiang Expects More Friendly, Closer Sino-Thai Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand will
establish a more friendly and closer relationship of all-round
cooperation on the basis of the existing friendly relations,
visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of accelerated multi-polarization and
globalization, closer Sino-Thai relations will make new
contributions to peace and development of the two countries, the
region and the world at large, Jiang said at a reception hosted by
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called China and Thailand "close neighbors", saying the
two countries enjoy geographical and cultural proximity, whose
peoples have close ties of blood, share a desire for prosperity
and progress and are both committed to peace, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Since our two countries established diplomatic relations 24
years ago, our bilateral relations have always maintained a
momentum of sound development with friendly exchanges and mutually
beneficial cooperation constantly growing in all fields," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the joint statement on Sino-Thai cooperation for
the 21st century signed by the two countries earlier this year,
Jiang said as the first instrument concluded between China and an
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country for the
bilateral relations, the statement "fully attests to the profound
basis, substantial contents and important significance of China-
Thailand relations".
</P>
<P>
As for the internal situation in China, Jiang said 50 years
after its founding, China has made tremendous progress in its
economic and social development as well as marked improvement in
its overall productivity and its people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial crisis and the mammoth floods,
China's economy continues to grow steadily and China now enjoys
social stability, ethnic unity and prosperous development of all
its undertaking, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the expected return of Macao to her motherland in
December, saying it proves once again after the smooth return of
Hong Kong two years ago that the "one country, two systems" is
correct guideline for accomplishing national reunification.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Taiwan is an integral part of the Chinese
territory and the eventual reunification across the Taiwan Straits
is an inevitable trend and commands the popular will.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to divide China is doomed to failure in disgrace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Thai government and people for their
understanding of and support to China over the years in her course
of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the Thai people for their "persevering and
pioneering spirit" and "world acknowledged achievements" in
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The darkest day of the Asian financial crisis is over, he said,
adding that the Thai economy is steadily moving towards recovery
thanks to the Thai people's unremitting efforts.
</P>
<P>
He wished that the Thai people will be able to rejuvenate their
country's economy and build Thailand into a more prosperous and
beautiful country in the upcoming new century.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chuan said Thai and Chinese peoples share close
affinities socially, culturally and ethnically.
</P>
<P>
He said President Jiang's visit is a "historic event" in the
relations between the two countries, which will be "enshrined" in
the hearts of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said he is pleased to see the signing of the joint statement
on the Plan of Action for the 21st Century between the two
countries, which covers every dimension of our relations.
</P>
<P>
"The communique reaffirms our determination to co-operate even
more closely as we enter the 21st century in order to bring about
economic prosperity and well-being for the peoples of our two
countries as well as contribute towards peace, security and
economic stability of Asia and of the world as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that Thailand and the People's Republic of
China will also share an even brighter future ahead," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Cashew Workers Call for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's National Union of
Cashew Workers Friday called on the Assembly or parliament to pass
a bill for protecting the cashew processing industry by banning,
for a 10-year period, the export of raw cashew nuts.
</P>
<P>
General secretary of the union, Boaventura Mondlane, said at a
press conference in Maputo that the government's policy of
liberalizing the trade in cashews, imposed by the World Bank, had
led to the almost total paralysis of the local processing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane said that the great majority of cashew processing
workers are out of a job because of this.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization "did not consider any balance between trade and
industry, but prioritized the export of raw nuts at the expense of
the national processing industry," Mondlane pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He noted the liberalization process would "leave thousands of
workers unemployed, waste the investments that have already been
made, and discourage new investment in the sector."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his union fully supports the bill before
parliament because "it seeks to save the industry, by prioritizing
the supply of cashews to the factories and it will promote just
prices for the producers, protect the workers' rights, and create
a climate of tranquillity for new investments in the sector."
</P>
<P>
The raw nuts were exported to India, and the local processing
factories found themselves starved of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
"We want a suspension of raw nut exports," said Mondlane.
</P>
<P>
Mondlane argued that if the Assembly rejects the cashew bill
presented by some deputies of the ruling Mozambique Liberation
Front Party (FRELIMO), or fails to debate it, "it will be losing a
major opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Mondlane said that the National Union of Cashew Workers is
ready to stage demonstrations in all the main cashew centers, but
he declined to give any further details.
</P>
<P>
The workers, he said, would make their dissatisfaction known to
the Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 3 (Xinhua) -- One Iraqi civilian was
injured on Friday in U.S.-British warplanes attacks on civilian
targets in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:00 (0700 GMT), 10 formations of
United States and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace
violated northern Iraqi airspace over Dohuk, Neineva and Erbil
provinces.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes attacked some civilian facilities and service
installations in the region, injuring one civilian, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the
enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's four-night massive airstrikes against
Iraq, U.S. and British warplanes have made 11,912 sorties over the
two no-fly zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian facilities and military sites, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

Aksyonenko said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Aksyonenko made the statement following his talks with visiting

Oil product deliveries were also discussed. Russia is ready to
begin deliveries, but so far no specific commercial offers have
been received, the ambassador said.

between the two countries and expressed the desire to strengthen
them," Interfax quoted Milosevic as saying.

<P>
LUANDA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The government of Angola's
western Kwanza-Sul Province Friday urged local population to equip
themselves with arms for civilian defense and fight against the
rebels, the official Angolan news agency Angop reported.
</P>
<P>
The government said that the population should help the Armed
Forces of Angola and the National Police in combatting the rebels
of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led
by Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
It encouraged the armed forces, the national police and
civilian defense to continue their reinforcement in a bid to win
the battle against the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the ruling People's Liberation Movement of
Angola (MPLA) in Sumbe, capital of the province, the MPLA's
provincial branch expressed its discontent with the
political-military situation in the province, which suffers the
rampant crimes committed by the UNITA, especially the ambush on
vehicles on roads.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Deal Near, But Still </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians
moved closer to an agreement over the implementation of a
U.S.-brokered peace deal Friday, but disputes still remained.
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said the two sides
were "very close" to reaching a deal on the implementation of the
Wye River Accord.
</P>
<P>
"We are very close...I'm optimistic. It could be that we'll
even conclude a deal today," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Echoing his remarks, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
Office issued a statement saying an agreement would possibly be
signed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A security and logistics preparation team has left for the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, where a signing
ceremony was presumably to be held, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Both Israeli and Palestinian sources said earlier in the day
that the two sides had resolved their difference on the issue of
Palestinian prisoners, the major obstacle to a deal on the
implementation of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the Palestinian side had accepted the Israeli
proposal that Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners,
or political prisoners called by the Palestinians. The
Palestinians have demanded the release of 400.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of this dispute, which scotched a tentatively
planned signing ceremony in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria
Thursday afternoon, might pave the way for a final deal on the
Wye implementation. But there was still difference between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
"There is no deal. There are many difficulties," said
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, who
returned to Gaza Friday afternoon from Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The two sides were reportedly disputing now over a clause in
the draft deal banning the two sides from taking unilateral
actions in Gaza and the West Bank before a final status agreement
is reached.
</P>
<P>
These actions include the building of Jewish settlements by
the Israeli side and a unilateral declaration of an independent
Palestinian state by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright will hold talks with Arafat in Gaza later Friday, the
second meeting between them in two days.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state was forced to intervene between
Israel and the Palestinians after they failed to bridge the gaps
by themselves. She met Arafat in Alexandria, where she had
planned to attend the signing ceremony, Thursday night before
flying to Israel into three and half hours of talks with Barak.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in early July promising to move forward
the Middle East peace process on all tracks, Barak has asked
Washington to scale down its mediating role in the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to let the two sides resolve
their difference directly.
</P>
<P>
During her five-day visit to the region, which started in
Morocco Wednesday, Albright had planned to look beyond the
current Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to help push forward the
final status talks, which deal with thorny issues like a
Palestinian state and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
She is also trying to help Israel and Syria resume their
talks, which froze three years ago. She will travel to Damascus
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A deal over the implementation of the Wye agreement would be a
major achievement for Barak since it would be his first agreement
with the Palestinians and certainly would boost the confidence of
the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, signed by Arafat and Barak's hard-line
predecessor Benjamin Netanyahu, calls on Israel to hand over 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over
a period of 12 weeks. Netanyahu froze the deal after carrying out
its first stage.
</P>
<P>
In the past month, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have
made significant progress in their talks on Barak's proposal to
revise the implementation of the agreement to the benefit of both
sides, including a new timetable for the remaining two stages of
Israeli troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
They have also agreed upon several sideline issues such as the
construction of a seaport in Gaza and the opening of safe
passages between Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said, however, if the two sides could not agree on
all issues, it would carry out the Wye agreement as written,
which would mean an extended withdrawal and the release of
Palestinian prisoners according to Israeli criteria.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Eritrean Religious Leaders Meet Over Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the
Ethiopian religious leaders has left for Oslo, Norway to discuss
at the weekend with its Eritrean counterparts how to peacefully
resolve the 16-month border conflict between the two Horn of
Africa neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported Friday that the delegation
is composed of religious leaders of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,
the Islamic Affairs Supreme Council and the Catholic and
Evangelical Churches.
</P>
<P>
The peace conference, organized by the Norwegian Church, is the
 continuation of a similar conference held in Oslo earlier this
year, the delegation leader Abune Paulos was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The patriarch expressed conviction that the conference would
come up with some positive results helpful to settle the border
crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A similar peace conference scheduled to be held in France last
month between religious leaders of the Ethiopian and Eritrean
Orthodox churches failed due to the Eritrean side's refusal to
show up at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May last year. Tens
of thousands of people have reportedly been killed and wounded in
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Only Thursday, the Office of the Ethiopian Government
Spokesperson said in a statement that Ethiopian troops on the same
day repelled an offensive by the Eritrean troops at Chin Keren on
the Zalambessa front.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government has denied Ethiopia's accusation by
saying that there has not been any fighting on any of the fronts
in the past two months since the start of the rains, "apart from
the occasional shelling invariably initiated by Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry Thursday claimed that the
apparent purpose of Ethiopia's accusations was to divert the
international attention from Ethiopia's reluctance to accept the
peace process sponsored by the Organization of African Unity
(UNITA).

<HEADLINE> Oman Oil Exports Reach 150 Million Barrels by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Oman exported over 150
million barrels of crude oil in the first half of this year, with
Japan and Thailand as its two largest oil importers.
</P>
<P>
Oman's oil exports this year reached 150,545,600 barrels by
the end of June. This was slightly up by 0.32 percent compared to
oil exports during the same period last year, which amounted to
150,068,300 barrels, according to latest statistics from the
Omani Ministry of National Economy.
</P>
<P>
Imports by Japan, the largest customer of Omani crude oil,
rose to about 50 million barrels in the first half of the year, up
by 40 percent from 35 million barrels in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The average price of Oman's crude oil went up by 6.1 percent to
12.95 U.S. dollars a barrel during the first six months of this
year from 12.20 dollars in the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oman is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Export
Countries, but it participated in the campaign to raise oil
prices by reducing production.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf country's known oil reserves are close to 5500
million barrels. It has a daily producing capacity of 900,000
barrels.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin, Security Chief Discuss Money Laundering Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with Federal Security Service Director Nikolai Patrushev
Friday to discuss a widely reported Russian money laundering
scandal.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting in the Kremlin, Patrushev said he told
Yeltsin that the case "is purely political and is connected with
the approaching U.S. elections."
</P>
<P>
"It is simply absurd to speak of 15 billion to 20 billion U.S.
dollars (that could have been laundered according to Western media
reports)," the Interfax news agency quoted Patrushev as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was referring the Western media reports that Russian mob
bosses, with Kremlin complicity, spirited as much as 15 billion
dollars in embezzled public and corporate funds through the Bank
of New York.
</P>
<P>
Some Russian newspapers see the reports as a Western media
campaign to discredit Russia.
</P>
<P>
And both speakers of the two houses of the Russian parliament
have denounced the reports as Western attempts to freeze loans to
Russia and stir up trouble in the country before the 2000
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Patrushev said the Federal Security Service, the main successor
to the Soviet KGB, the Prosecutor General's office and other
Russian law enforcement bodies should work with their U.S.
counterparts to conduct a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
"So far the FBI has not supplied us with any documents or
materials," he said, adding that officials from the Federal
Security Service, the tax police and the Prosecutor General's
office will probably have to visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Russia "does not intend to defend itself in the wake of media
publications (about Russia's alleged money laundering) in some
countries."
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to explain ourselves. As for Russia's good
name, it has one," Interfax quoted Ivanov as saying in Yerevan,
where he was paying a one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov told a briefing here Friday that Moscow had not received
any official documented proof of the massive leakage of capital
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
He said the Prosecutor General's office has requested such
information from the U.S. "When they arrive, the Finance Ministry
is ready to assign its experts to analyze the documents," the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Zimbabwe To Stabilize Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Friday said that IMF's 193 million U.S. dollars standby
credit for Zimbabwe to support its economy for the next 14 months
had been approved.
</P>
<P>
It was important for the Zimbabwean government to focus its
economic stabilization effort on tightening money supply, IMF said
in its latest survey.
</P>
<P>
"The stabilization effort centres on continued restraint,
including recent steps to bring monetary supply growth under
control, and price adjustments in the parastatal sectors, notably
in the oil and electricity sectors," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
In its letter of intent to the IMF, the Zimbabwean government
projected that growth in real GDP in 1999 would be 1.2 percent
which was a downward revision from previous expectations because
of lower output from the mining and manufacturing sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe sets a target to cut inflation to 30 percent by the
end of the year and reduces budget deficit to around 5.3 percent
of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The country also had to ease control on trade and foreign
exchange, which was imposed last year due to balance of payments
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government had already begun to implement some
of the measures agreed with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Asked to Back Negotiations on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman
Michalis Papapetrou Friday stressed that Cyprus anticipates proof
from Turkey that it is willing to change its stance and backs
negotiations for a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou also said the Cyprus government has noted
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem's statement that the trend on
the Cyprus issue is positive.
</P>
<P>
Papaterou was commenting on statements made Thursday by Cem
and his British counterpart Robin Cook after a meeting in London.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus issue, Cem said "the trend is positive."
</P>
<P>
Cook said they both agreed they should work for a solution to
the issue "that is mutually acceptable."
</P>
<P>
"Britain is very committed to making sure that we try and
create the opportunity for both sides to exchange their views and
to come to that (solution)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "proof" the Cyprus government wants from
Turkey, Papapetrou said "the Turkish side should first abandon
the conditions it set out to respond positively to an invitation
by the (United Nations) Secretary-General" for talks on Cyprus
this fall.
</P>
<P>
Ankara and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash demand
international recognition of the breakaway Turkish Cypriots state
as well as the establishment of a confederation of two states on
the island.

<HEADLINE> China Is Not a Risk for Panama Canal: Canal Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The presence of the
Hutchison Wampoa Port of China transnational firm in the Panama
Canal does not represent any danger for the security of the
interoceanic waterway, said Ricardo Martinelli, Panama's new
Minister for Canal Matters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said he has talked with United States officials, who said
that "there is not any danger" in the presence of the Chinese
consortiums in the reverted areas.
</P>
<P>
Martinelli said that the auctions for the enfranchisement of
the two ports in the canal were crystaline and clean.
</P>
<P>
However, some U.S. sectors, especially those related to the
right, have questioned the fact that both entrances to the Canal,
the port of Cristobal, in the Atlantic, and Balboa, in the
Pacific, are administered by Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
This, according to some U.S. officials, is a consequence of the
transference of the control of the maritime seaway that connects
the two oceans.
</P>
<P>
The Hutchison transnational firm, with headquarters in Hong
Kong, China, won the bidding for the franchise of the two ports in
1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract signed with Panama, the Chinese
shipping company must invest more than 100 million dollars to
modernize the two ports and pay Panama more than 22 million
dollars a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Vietnam have put final touches to their trade pact for normal
trade relations, U.S. government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The trade pact was revised this week by negotiators of both
countries in Washington and has been sent to Hanoi for review by
the Vietnamese government, a State Department source said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides are considering the text and are in the
finalization process," said a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
Officials here said that Washington hopes Hanoi will complete
its review in the coming days, allowing President Bill Clinton or
Barshefsky to formally sign the agreement at a summit of Asia
Pacific leaders in New Zealand next week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will have to be approved by the U.S. Congress and
Vietnam's National Assembly after formal signing, meaning the pact
could be enacted by the year-end.
</P>
<P>
The pact, which took three years to negotiate, will reduce
tariffs on goods and services, protect intellectual property and
improve investment relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For American companies, normal trade ties will expand their
access to a market with 77 million consumers.

NAIROBI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Public and private
stakeholders in the fisheries sector in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
have complained against the European Union (EU) for maintaining
its ban on fish exports from this East African region.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a two-day environmental workshop at Kisumu, a
Lake Victoria port town in southwestern Kenyan, the participants
urged the EU to lift the ban imposed on the three states early
this year, sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
They described claims by a EU team which recently visited the
region that fish exports from the three states were contaminated
as " discriminatory and one aimed at strangling the region's fish
industry."

<P>
Ezekiel Okemwa, director of the Kenya Marine and Fisheries
Research Institute, told an international seminar on fisheries and
biodiversity management held in Nairobi late last month that the
country's fishery industry had fulfilled all the EU fish export
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Mathias Wafula, an assistant director of fisheries, said at the
workshop that Kenya had completely stamped out fish poisoning -
the EU's main reason for the ban.
</P>
<P>
Since the export ban was imposed, Wafula lamented that the fish
prices in the local market have plummeted from an average of 40
shillings per kilo to between 15 and 20 shillings ( 75 shillings
equal to one U.S. dollar).
</P>
<P>
Wafula also noted that the remaining markets of Japan, Israel
and the United States were relatively insignificant importers of
fish from the region.
</P>
<P>
The participants suggested the harmonization of fisheries
legislation in the three countries for the effective management of
the lake's resources, and urged for more information flow and
exchange of research findings in the respect.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Strike Deal on Reviving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official announced Friday that the Palestinians had reached
agreement with Israel over the implementation of a U.S.-brokered
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath announced in Gaza
that the two sides would sign the agreement at the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
The deal was reached after the two sides had resolved their
difference on the issue of Palestinian prisoners, overcoming the
last major obstacle to a pacakge agreement on the implementation
of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has accepted the Israeli proposal that
Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners, or political
prisoners called by the Palestinians. The Palestinians had
initially demanded the release of 400.
</P>
<P>
Israel will also begin in a few days to hand over 11 percent of
the West Bank to the Palestinians. The final withdrawal will be
completed by January 20, according to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following two days of intensive
shuttle diplomacy by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
A tentatively planned signing ceremony in the Egyptian port
city of Alexandria Thursday afternoon, in which Albright had
planned to attend, was scotched by the continued difference
between the two sides over the issue of Palestinian prisoners
to be released by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright held talks with Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza Friday night after separate talks
with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David
Levy early Friday morning and afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A deal over the implementation of the Wye agreement would be a
major achievement for Barak since it will be his first agreement
with the Palestinians since he took office in early July on a
platform to revive the Middle East peace process on
all tracks.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Children under Unbelievable Suffering: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. Envoy Friday pleaded to
the international community to help Sierra Leone children, who he
claimed were under unbelievable suffering, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, the UN Secretary General's special representative
for children, said in his visit to the war-torn country that more
than half of the estimated three million people displaced by the
war were children and that the suffering they had endured,
including abduction, rape and mutilation, was beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
Girls as young as twelve had been abducted and repeatedly raped
by rebels; boys had had their parents and grandparents killed
before their eyes and then had their own hands chopped off, said
the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu said there were at least one and a half million S.
Leonean children in desperate need of help.
</P>
<P>
Despite the peace accord signed last month in Togo's capital
Lome, the situation in this west African country was still
precarious and dangerous, said the envoy. Only a few hundred
combatants have been demobilized and it is estimated, he said,
that there are a total of 25,000 men still under arms.
</P>
<P>
The UN official said it was imperative that the rebel leader,
Foday Sankoh, who is still outside the country, should return to
Sierra Leone to give a push to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
While in another latest development, the president of Sierra
Leone, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, is expected to visit Nigeria very soon
for talks with his Nigerian counterpart, Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
His visit comes as the first Nigerian troops, who have been
defending his government against rebel attacks, arrived home
following the signing of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The visit is believed to be dominated by the issue of the
return of the Nigerian troops, which is welcomed in Nigeria, but
is a source of great concern to many in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean president is expected to seek further
assurances that the withdrawal will be gradual enough for him to
establish his own security measures in their place.

WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A twin-engine plane crashed
into a strip Friday morning in West Palm Beach of Florida State in
the United States, killing all the eight people aboard, reports
reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, Beechcraft King Air BE-90, was on a flight from
Pontiac, Michigan State, to Boca Raton, Florida State, when it
reported engine problem.
</P>
<P>
The pilot called the control tower for permission to land at
Palm Beach International Airport, but crashed about one kilometer
short of the runway.
</P>
<P>
George Prellezo, spokesman of the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board, said the aircraft was not an ambulance plane as had
been suspected earlier.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that it took federal aviation officials hours
to confirm the number because the wreckage was so twisted and
crumpled.
</P>
<P>
The plane hit the corner of a roof at a strip mall, then
clipped power lines and flipped onto a chain link fence at the
edge of the airport. It immediately became engulfed in flames.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Vote Result to Be Announced Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to announce the result of the ballot on
East Timor's future at 9:00 pm (EST) Friday in New York, to
be followed by a Security Council meeting, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's vote conducted by the United Nations under an
agreement reached on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal would
determine whether the majority of the 800,000 people in the
half-island territory want to stay within Indonesia with special
autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials want to announce the result simultaneously in
Dili, capital of East Timor, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A 98.6 percent turnout was registered but violent activities
followed, mostly from the anti-independence groups, raising peace
and security concerns in the ballot counting process and the
3-month post-ballot period before the vote result is implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
estimated that some 50,000 East Timorese have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
East Timor has been considered by the United Nations a
non-self-governing territory since 1976 when Indonesia annexed it,
following former ruler Portugal's withdrawal in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is "exhorting" Indonesia to live up to its commitment
to East Timor's security by sending more security forces, a U.N.
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has not decided whether it will take up
the issue of peace-keeping in East Timor despite discussions going
on in capitals and in U.N. corridors, the spokesman Fred Eckhard
said.

<HEADLINE> Bright Prospects for Uganda, China Economic Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and China enjoy a very
bright prospect for bilateral economic cooperation, Uganda's
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade and
Industry Moses Ali said after week-long visit to China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua here Friday,
adding:" I now have a very different image of China after my visit
to your country. Now I know China is not the same as one we'd been
hearing of."
</P>
<P>
"Surely there is bright future for our economic cooperation
because our economies are highly supplementary. The technology
being used in China is also applicable here. Basically an
agricultural country, Uganda needs simple but practical machines I
saw in China," he added, who visited China in July.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the technology should be affordable and
accessible to Ugandan farmers. The machines, which are not so
sophisticated, can be used here to grow upland rice. They can even
be applied to small-scale sugar and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
With the 21 member countries of the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) removing trade barriers in near
future, commodities made by China can find their way to all these
countries. If these things can reach the COMESA market, Ugandans
will have easy access to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the stumbling block hampering the growth of
bilateral trade, Ali attributed it to lack of high-level contact
between the two countries. He said:" Many of the Chinese things we
use here come from Hong Kong or India or some other place. So
there is no direct link between us and your country. We therefore
should establish contacts at official, technical and academic
levels."
</P>
<P>
Once they know each other, we can familiarize with each other
better, he noted, adding that without the link, bilateral trade
would not gain momentums in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
As to his general impression about China, he said that China
itself is a big market, which makes China immune from any form of
sanctions from the outside. China's manufacturing sector impressed
him most, he admitted. If China concentrates on this sector, its
products can compete favorably with the rest of the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister recalled that China contributed
considerably to the continent's political decolonization. He hoped
that China can contribute equally much to Africa's economic
decolonization.
</P>
<P>
Take Uganda for example, he said, it hopes China can provide
vocational training and more scholarships for Ugandans. Uganda
needs China's help in building infrastructure like roads and
providing technology affordable to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Although our bilateral trade is relatively small now. The two
governments are trying to boost the bilateral trade. I am
confident that it will grow dramatically in the near future," he
concluded.

LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
sharply higher Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. payroll data

Insurers led the blue chip charge in London amid talk that a 17
billion U.S. dollar merger is imminent in the financial sector.

rise of 136.5 points. For the week, however, the blue chip index
was down 0.7 percent, or 43.1 points.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Dax index closed almost 3 percent higher and well
above a significant technical level, fueled by benign U.S. jobs
numbers which stilled fears of another U.S. interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
Commerzbank, the leading gainer, catapulted more than 5 percent
to 35.90 euros, profiting from market speculation that it may be
the next hot takeover target.
</P>

The index closed stronger 136.5 points or 2.82 percent stronger

<HEADLINE> Libya to Draw Investments in Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Libya is calling for foreign
investments in the infrastructure projects which might help
diversify its oil-dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was sounded at the conclusion of the Symposium on
Prospects of International Investment and Trade in Libya which
opened here Thursday as part of the celebrations for the
country's 30th Anniversary of Revolution which fell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan government has set an ambition to be a focal
point for investment in Africa and to play a pivotal role in
the economic development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Libya is endeavoring to draw more investments to
develop its transportation capacities, education and health
utilities and power generation and distribution and
communications networks.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day symposium, participants reviewed proposals
to invest in the country's Great Man-Made River Project which is
considered as the most important project for the coming up future.
</P>
<P>
The project will convey water from a huge reservoir of
underground water of the southern desert to the coastal strip
in the country's north where most people live.
</P>
<P>
The annual water allocation of the project will be about 59
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed to hold a conference for investment in
Libya in the coming spring and workshops will be held to evaluate
the investment projects to be presented to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Libya's economy is more than 95 percent dependent on oil
earnings.
</P>
<P>
The drastic drop in oil prices since the mid 1980's and the
imposition of preserved OPEC quotas on members states have
undermined the country's capacity to realize fast and sustained
economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges for U.N. Fact-Finding Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday Urged
the U.N. Security Council to investigate the recent Indian downing
of its naval aircraft and seek "appropriate compensation" for the
lost.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said in a letter to the
president of the Security Council that his government had
requested Secretary-General Kofi Annan to send a fact-finding
mission to establish the truth regarding this grave incident. "We
await his positive response," he added.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which happened last month, killed all 16 people
aboard the plane. Pakistan said the aircraft was downed over its
territory while India said its airspace was intruded when its
troops opened fire.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council, which is entrusted with the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security, must take cognizance of the act of aggression by India
and support Pakistan's request for a United Nations fact-finding
mission and its demand on India for appropriate compensation,"
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
He did not spell out how much the "appropriate compensation"
should be for the aircraft and the losses of lives.
</P>
<P>
"This aggression has further deteriorated the relations between
India and Pakistan. Unless appropriate redress is provided for
this wanton use of forces, it could lead to a further escalation
of the tensions between the two countries," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country reserves all its rights under Article
51 of the Charter of the United Nations, referring to a
self-defense provision.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, which convened Friday on Iraq and other
matters, has made no response to the Pakistani request. No comment
from the Indian side was available so far.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan Health Minister Pleads Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The former Minister of
Health in the 1994 interim government of Rwanda, Casmir Bizimungu,
Friday pleaded not guilty to all charges of genocide and crimes
against humanity when he made his initial appearance before the
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu, 48, could not enter his plea on August 17 when three
other former cabinet ministers jointly charged with him entered
theirs because the lawyer assigned to him by the Registrar, Judith
Bourne of the United States, was not available on that date.
</P>
<P>
The three, who also pleaded not guilty, are former Minister of
Trade and Industry, Justin Mugenzi, former Minister of the Civil
Service, Prosper Mugiraneza, and former Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Jerome Bicumumpaka.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were brutally massacred during April and July 1994 in
Rwanda. The United Nations Security Council set up the ICTR in
Arusha, north Tanzania, to try leading suspects responsible for
the genocide.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release from ICTR, Bizimungu pleaded not
guilty to eight counts charging him with conspiracy to commit
genocide, genocide, or in the alternative, complicity in genocide,
genocide, direct and public indictment to commit genocide, and
crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution alleged that the accused, together with the
other former ministers, jointly participated in the planning,
preparing or execution of a common plan, to commit the atrocities
against Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The crimes were committed by them personally, by the persons
they assisted or by their subordinates, and with their knowledge
and consent," according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu, as Minister of Health, is alleged to have failed to
take any steps to prevent massacres committed in one of the public
hospitals for which he was responsible, Centre Hospitalier de
Kigali (CHK), or to punish the perpetrators, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecution told the court that when massacres started, the
CHK took in numerous wounded Tutsi from various areas in the city.
!0On several occasions, soldiers who were supposed to be guarding
the hospital selected Tutsi patients and killed them on the spot.
A list of the staff of Tutsi descent was drawn up and several of
the people on the list were killed"
</P>
<P>
It is alleged that these massacres were reported to Bizimungu
who did nothing.
</P>
<P>
The Prosecution added that the accused also knew of the
massacres which took place at Burtare University Hospital and at
Kabgayi School of Nursing in Gitarama prefecture, but did not take
any steps to stop them or punish the perpetrators, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
At Kabgayi, the Prosecution added, soldiers and Interahamwe
militiamen also abducted and raped female students and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu was arrested in Kenya on 11 February 1999 and
transferred to the United Nations Detention Facility in Arusha on
February 23 this year.

</P>
<P>
The offensive initiated by the Taliban movement in late July
has met strong counter-attacks from the opposition United Front.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has made little change in the military balance
between the two warring sides, but inflicted heavy losses on the
civilian population, according to U.N. accounts.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestine Strike Deal on Reviving Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 3 (Xinhua) -- In a major breakthrough in
the Middle East peace process, Israel and Palestine reached Friday
agreement on the implementation of a U.S.-brokered peace deal,
breaking an eight-month impasse.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister of International
Cooperation Nabil Shaath, who replaced Saeb Erekat as the senior
negotiator hours ago, announced that the two sides would sign an
agreement in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
"All the issues have been settled...I hope it will usher in a new
era of peace," Shaath said, refusing to give further details on the
new deal.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited announcement came after the two sides had overcome
their last obstacle in the negotiations, agreeing upon on the issue of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinian side had accepted the Israeli proposal
that Israel release 350 Palestinian security prisoners, or political
prisoners called by the Palestinians, with a promise to discuss more
relase at a later stage. The Palestinians have demanded the release of
400.
</P>
<P>
Under the new deal, Israel will hand over 11 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians in three stages over a period of five-month,
starting the troop withdrawals in a few days and completing by January
20.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also re-launch negotiations in early September
on thorny issues like the possibility of an independent Palestinian
state and the fate of Jerusalem and over 3 million Palestinian
refugees. The negotiations were frozen after a ceremonial start in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached following two days of intensive shuttle
diplomacy by visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright held talks with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat in Gaza
Friday night after separate talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
She was forced to intervene after a tentatively planned signing
ceremony in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria Thursday afternoon in
her presence was scotched by the continued difference between the two
sides over the issue of Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Washington has said that Albright's five-day visit to the region,
which has also brought her to Morocco and will bright her to Syria,
Jordan, and possibly, Lebanon, would focus on the Israeli-Palestinian
permanent talks and the resumption of Israeli-Syrian talks, which
froze three years ago.
</P>
<P>
A deal over the implementation of the Wye agreement will certainly
be a major achievement for Barak, who ousted his hard-line predecessor
Benjamin Netanyahu three months ago on a platform to revive the Middle
East peace process on all its tracks.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first since Barak took office in early July, put
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process back on track following an
eight-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu halted the implementation of the Wye agreement late
last year, two months after he signed it with Arafat last October,
in a failed attempt to woo back rebellious far-right coalition
partners who oppose any territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
The victory of Barak has raised expectation in the Arab world as
well in the international community that the century-long conflict in
the region might finally be put behind forever.
</P>
<P>
Doubt was raised after Barak proposed to the Palestinians to
renegotiate on the implementation of the Wye agreement. It turned out,
however, that the revised deal would bring benefit to both sides.
</P>
<P>
For the Israeli side, the new timetable for the withdrawal, in
which a final stage of troop withdrawal will be postponed until the
final status talks have been well underway, will help reduce the risk
of potential confrontation between the Palestinians and Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
About 15 Jewish settlements would be partially or fully isolated
after the final stage is carried out. Under the new deal, a prospect
for a permanent peace agreement will help calm the outrages of the
public including the settlers.
</P>
<P>
For the Palestinians, the revised deal will offer them land with
more continuity, an important element of an independent state requires.
It will also offer the release of more political prisoners, since the
original accord allows Israel to free prisoners purely out of its
choice.
</P>
<P>
The last, and the most important, the deal will significantly
boost confidence between the two sides, which has been severely
damaged by the stalemate in the last three years, when they enter
the final status talks dealing with issues lying in the heart of
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the deal will also help advance the Israeli
peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Barak's election victory, Israeli and Syrian leaders
have exchanged many messages of peace through third parties. But the
hope for an immediate resumption of peace talks dimmed after the
Israeli-Palestinians ran into deadlock.
</P>
<P>
A peace with Syria will effectively put an end to the conflict in
southern Lebanon, where Syria is a main power broker. Barak has
imposed a one-year timeline for himself to pull Israeli troops from an
occupying zone in southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Sour Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks moved
higher Friday as the government's employment report eased
investors' concerns about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 235.24 at
11,078.45. The Blue chip index fell 94.67 points Thursday
on fears of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index scored its biggest point gain of
108.87 at 2,843.11, surpassing the closing record high of
103.16 for a point gain set on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 38.13 at 1,357.24.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the Labor Department reported
that employers added smaller-than-expected 124,000 jobs to their
payrolls in August and average hourly earnings rose just 0.2
percent from a year ago. The data eased fears about higher
interest rates among investors who had believed that any
inflationary signs could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates for the third time this year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 14.56 at 625.89 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 7.18 at 786.39. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 8.55 at 435.97.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Town Hosts Britain's Millennium Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's official countdown to
the millennium kicked off on Friday with a free open-air concert
in Omagh, a Northern Irish town which suffered car bomb carnage a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
As Irish pop band The Corrs played to some 30,000 fans, two
Protestant and Catholic teenagers, Leanne Martin and Brendan
Grimes, joined Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam in
lighting a special "millennium beacon", the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
The people of Omagh said they were offering the beacon as a
symbol of hope to 22 other British cities for their New Year
celebrations. The flame will light their millennium beacons.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair sent a message of support for the
festivities, which launched Britain's "Year 2000" celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Brendan Grimes is a relative of Mary Grimes and her daughter
Averil Monaghan who were killed in the Omagh bombing.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine people were killed and more than 200 were injured
when a car bomb exploded on the main street of the bustling market
town in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst carnage from any bomb atta ck in some 30 years
of guerrilla conflict in the British province.

<HEADLINE> Christie Faces Drugs Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Olympic 100m champion
Linford Christie is likely to learn his fate next week, after
attending a hearing into his positive drugs test on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Christie is hoping to clear his name in the investigation into
whether or not he took the banned substance nandrolone.
</P>
<P>
Though retired and only running for fun while he coaches other
sprinters, the 39-year-old was suspended after failing a drugs
test after an indoor meet at Dortmund, Germany, in February.
</P>
<P>
Christie faced the same three-man panel that heard the case of
Scottish athlete Dougie Walker, who was eventually cleared of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Jayne Pearce, spokeswoman for UK Athletics, said: "The hearing
has concluded and we will make a further announcement as soon as
the outcome is known."
</P>
<P>
Christie, who has protested his innocence, said after his
suspension: ""I'm virtually retired.
</P>
<P>
"For me to take drugs at the end of my career or when my career
is finished is stupid and ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
"When I first heard the news it was a shock. I'm innocent and I
keep telling everybody I'm innocent. It sounds like the same old
record but I did no wrong, so that's it."
</P>
<P>
If Christie is found guilty, he faces a two-year ban.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Rolls on, No. 8 Novotna Beaten at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Martina Hingis of
Switzerland advanced to the round of 16 today at the U.S. Open
Tennis Championships here, but her opponent in last year's
semifinal, Jana Novotna of Czech Republic, will be going home.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old Hingis beat German qualifier Sandra Kloesel 6-3,
6-1. Hingis needed only 61 minutes to eliminate her 20-year-old
rival. Hingis closed out the match with a two-handed backhand
winner, her 30th winner overall to just nine for the German.
However Hingis was a little sloppy, committing 25 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Now in her 104th week as the world's No. 1 player, Hingis has
won six WTA Tour titles this year, including the Australian Open
this year.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who formed a very successful doubles team with Hingis
until parting ways this year, was taken out in straight sets 6-3,
6-3 by Anke Huber of Germany.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, the 1998 Wimbledon champion, had 27 unforced errors
and just 11 winners in just her fourth match since losing in the
quarterfinals at Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will take on 1994 U.S. Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-
Vicario of Spain in the fourth round. The 10th seed had little
trouble with Switzerland's Patty Schnyder, ousting her in straight
sets 6-2, 6-2 in the first match of the day.
</P>
<P>
Hingis is 11-1 lifetime versus Sanchez-Vicario, including the
last 11 straight. This will be their second meeting in a Grand
Slam this year, with Hingis prevailing 6-3, 6-2 in the French Open
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez-Vicario needed only 62 minutes to improve to 4-2
lifetime against Schnyder, who beat the now-retired Steffi Graf
last year in her final career match at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
American Mary Joe Fernandez posted the second upset of the day
as she eliminated No. 13 Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 7-5, 6-0.
A two-time semifinalist, Fernandez took advantage of 38 unforced
errors by her Belgium opponent to earn a fourth-round meeting with
third seed and fellow American Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Barbara Schett of Austria had little trouble moving on
as she routed Virginia Ruano Pascual of Spain 6-1, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
On the men's side, American seventh seed Todd Martin fired 20
aces en route to a 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win over fellow Richey
Reneberg.
</P>
<P>
Ninth seed Greg Rusedski of Britain also reached the round of
16 with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-1 win David Prinosil of Germany; No. 14
Tommy Haas of germany survived a scare from Argentina's Mariano
Puerta before pulling out a 6-3, 6-2, 2-6, 6-7 (3-7), 6-1 tough
victory.

<HEADLINE> Barkley Agrees to Return to Rockets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley, who seems
to publicly discuss the possibility of retirement during every
offseason, will be returning to the Houston Rockets for at least
one more year.
</P>
<P>
A team spokesman today confirmed that the Rockets have reached
an agreement with Barkley, who has been unavailable for comment.
Houston television station KRIV reported that Barkley will ink a
one-year deal worth $9 million.
</P>
<P>
Barkley's business manager Glenn Guthrie would not comment on
any contract talks but said his client will be leaving on Monday
for a tour in Barcelona, Spain. It is unknown when Barkley
officially will sign the deal.
</P>
<P>
Voted one of the NBA's 50 Greatest Players, Barkley will be
entering his 16th season and fourth with the Rockets. Despite
turning 36 during this past season, he finished second in the
league in rebounding at 12.3 boards per game.
</P>
<P>
He will remain part of a starting frontline of future Hall of
Famers whose career to be on the decline as they attempt to grow
old gracefully. Small forward Scottie Pippen turns 34 next month
and center Hakeem Olajuwon is 36. The trio battled injuries last
season before Houston lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the first
round of playoffs.
</P>
<P>
While leading the Rockets in rebounding last season, Barkley
was second in scoring at 16.1 points per game and second in
assists at 4.6 per contest. However, injuries again forced Barkley
to miss significant action and he shot less than 48 percent from
the field,his lowest total since coming into the league with
Philadelphia in 1984.
</P>
<P>
A groin injury, a torn triceps muscle and hernia surgery forced
him to miss time during the 1997-98 campaign, when he averaged a
career-low 15.2 points in 68 games.
</P>
<P>
Barkley has not played more than 71 games during the regular
season since 1992-93, when he earned his only Most Valuable Player
award as he led Phoenix to the NBA Finals in his first season
there.

<TEXT>
<P>
Kipketer, the Danish, ran the season's best time in the 800
meters with 1:42.27, beating Hezekiel Sepeng by five meters.
Sepeng set a South African record of 1:42.69. If they reach next
victory, the two champions will share the 1 million U.S. dollars
Golden League jackpot.
</P>
<P>
"The jackpot is out there," Kipketer said. "It is like a
lottery. I just have to run fast."
</P>
<P>
Szabo also seized her chance in the women's 3,000-meter race.
Morocco's Zahra Ouaziz tried to shake off Szabo for much of the
race, but the Romanian just bided her time and waited to outkick
her. The result was similar to the World Championships at Seville
last week.
</P>
<P>
Szabo finished in 8:25.82, her second-fastest time this year.
</P>
<P>
In a very good performance, Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj ran
the second-fastest men's 3,000 in history, 7:23.09, only 2.42
seconds off Kenyan Daniel Komen's record.
</P>
<P>
Steeplechase world record-holder Bernard Barmasai also won his
sixth race out of six Friday, but the IAAF has eliminated him from
the jackpot competition. He said he might sue the IA.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot be employed somewhere and get no salary," Barmasai
said. "I want to run good in Berlin and then afterwards do
something."
</P>
<P>
The IAAF punished Barmasai for saying he colluded with Kenyan
teammate Christopher Koskei to determine the outcome of the Golden
League race at Zurich. Barmasai denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai finished fifth at the World Championships, but said
the Zurich scandal had cost him too much sleep and concentration.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, the women's 100-meter world champion, was the
only other athlete with a 5-for-5 record. But she has opted out of
any competition this season because of the back injury she
sustained during the 200 meters semifinals at Seville.
</P>
<P>
The Van Damme meet had 53 medalists from the World
Championships, including 18 world champions. The main absentee was
triple gold medalist Maurice Greene, who is running in Britain
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Bruny Surin, the silver medalist at Seville, won the
100 in 10.04, edging Jon Drummond.
</P>
<P>
American Michael Johnson, world champion and 200/400m world
record holder, won the 200 at 19.93, 0.09 seconds off the season's
best of Nigerian Francis Obikwelu.
</P>
<P>
Inger Miller continued to dominate the women's 200 in the
absence of Jones, beating Beverly McDonald of Jamaica, matching
their 1-2 finish at Seville.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Mohammed Mourhit set a European record for 10,000
meters, breaking the mark of Portugal's seconds in finishing
second to Charles Kamathi of Kenya. Kamathi ran the year's fastest
time, 26:51.49. The Moroccan-born Mourhit, now competing for
Belgium, was timed at 26:52.30.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Glaciologists Making Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- After more than 40 years of
studying China's glaciers, Chinese glaciologists have made big
success, according to Shi Fengya, of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He says that China places a great deal of importance on
glaciology because it has the largest number of glaciers in the
world, covering 59,000 square kilometers of land. China began its
studies in 1958 when the first expedition team went to the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau to study the use of ice and snow, Shi says, and in
the past 41 years they have made a great contribution to the
scientific use of water resources and prevention of disasters.
</P>
<P>
They set up a Qinghai-Tibet ice core data bank and an
environmental data bank to provide information on almost a million
years of climatic changes on the plateau for research on future
climate change.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, glaciologists discovered Asia's biggest icecap,
"Guliya", in the Kunlun Mountains, which has helped research on
millions of years of climate changes on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
In 1989 and 1990, glaciologist Qin Dahe joined international
colleagues in an Antarctic expedition to study glaciers there and
became the first Chinese to cross the South Pole. Since then,
Chinese glaciological studies have become better known around the
world.
</P>
<P>
China published its first book on glaciology -- A Glaciological
Study on the Route of the 1990's International Trans-Antarctic
Expedition - in 1995. The book was written by Qin and shed more
light on glaciological research in the Antarctic with the analysis
of ice and snow samples from his 5,896-km. trip around the
Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
He draws attention to the ionization process in middle and
upper atmospheric levels in the polar area and its relation to the
icy surface.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Chinese glaciologists climbed to the highest
point on the South Pole, 3,910 meters above sea level, and
collected a large number of core samples to use as data for
research on global climatic changes.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists covered more than 1,100 kilometers of ground
in the Antarctic.

ATHENS -- Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Friday
that his country was keen to see neighboring Turkey become a
candidate for European Union (EU) membership.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos, Papandreou said that Greece wanted to see Turkey
as a candidate country but Turkey and Greece's partners could not
overlook the fact that the neighboring country had
responsibilities and obligations. (Greece-Turkey)

<HEADLINE> Tu Ethnic Group Living Wealthy Life (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- During a leisurely card game
with friends, former farmer Ma Xiangrui considers the hardships he
and other villagers endured in Qinghai province before New China
was formed in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"We had to work year after year in the fields. We couldn't
escape starvation," said the 75-year-old Ma, who is a member of
the Tu ethnic group in Tangla Village, one of the poorest in
northwest China. The village is in Donggou Township of the Huzhu
Tu Autonomous County in northeast Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
"Now our life has become more and more wealthy and easy," said
the old man, pointing to various new houses in the village which
have replaced the shabby shelters of old. More than 70 percent of
the Tu families in the village now have televisions, and 90
percent have earned enough money to buy modern furniture. VCD
players, refrigerators and motorcycles have also become popular in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Life in the new and old days is just like difference between
heaven and earth," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
The Tu ethnic group lives mainly in Qinghai and the southern
part of Gansu Province in northwest China. The Huzhu Tu Autonomous
County is China's only autonomous county for the Tu ethnic group.

<HEADLINE> Tu Ethnic Group Living Wealthy Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Tu ethnic group came into being during the Tan Dynasty (618-
907). The sleeves of Tu women's dresses are sewn from five colors
of cloth: red, yellow, green, purple and blue. They wear brightly-
colored vests and belts, and are sometimes called the "Rainbow
Nationality."
</P>
<P>
Though the Tu are famous for their vibrant dress and folk
dancing and singing, they live in remote rural regions with
laggard economy. For a long time before the founding of New China,
the Tu were considered poor and backward.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, especially during the country'
s opening and reform of the past 20 years, the group has become
more and more prosperous, said Wa Shide, a county official.
</P>
<P>
The Tu have improved their economic status with the help of
agricultural technology and expanding their business dealings
outside the county. Statistics show that the county's per capita
annual income increased from 70 yuan in 1978 to 1,100 yuan last
year. Meanwhile, the county's poverty-stricken sank from 280,000
to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, advanced farming equipment and techniques have
helped more and more Tu people improve farming productivity and
also freed many of them from the obligations of farm labor to do
business with traders nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiangrui's son, Ma Cunshou, is a young businessman in the
village. He has two motorcycles, a tractor, and household
appliances such as a refrigerator, a washing machine and a VCD
player.
</P>
<P>
"I am not the richest -- many more in the village are even
better off," he said.

Every year, an average of 30,000 people in the county leave to
work in the city, Wa Shide said.
</P>
<P>
"More important than earning money, those working outside the
county have brought back new ideas on opening and reform which
will play a significant role in developing local economy and
construction," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hu Kui, a savvy Tu businessman, has become a well-known
merchant in the province. He runs a private trade company dealing
with ethnic commodities, general merchandise, foodstuffs and
ornamental jewelry. One of the 2,000 Tu business people in the
county, he recently built a new house and bought a car.
</P>
<P>
Living on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the Tu people have
realized their home is rich in tourism possibilities because of
the scenery and ethnic folk customs. To attract visitors, the
county has opened a series of tourist sites featuring landscapes
and religious temples. In many of these areas, ethnic people give
performances of ethnic dance, display folk art, and demonstrate
traditional customs.
</P>
<P>
The county has received more than 100,000 tourists from a dozen
countries and regions worldwide, including Japan, Italy, the
United States and Germany since last year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Electronics Exports Trend Unpredictable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Robust electronics exports have
played a key role in East Asia's economic recovery so far this
year, but any cyclical changes in the world market could weaken
the region's major sources of strength, economists warned.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight months, East Asian economies registered
stronger growth than even optimistic economists had expected,
mainly due to robust electronics exports, which account for around
50 percent of the total exports in South Korea, the Philippines,
Singapore and other Southeast Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a buoyant U.S. economy, a Japanese economy on the
mend and a resurgent Asian region, the higher demand since the end
of last year in the world electronic markets have improved East
Asia's export performance.
</P>
<P>
In the Philippines, overall earnings from exports in the first
half of the year grew by 13.6 percent on a year earlier, while in
Malaysia, 7 percent. In South Korea and Singapore, exports are
also picking up now.
</P>
<P>
The stronger export growth this year has played a key part in
the region's recovery. In South Korea, for example, gross domestic
product grew at a higher than expected 9.8 percent in the second
quarter of 1999 from the year-earlier quarter, when the economy
shrank 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia are also turning around quickly. Even
Indonesia, which has sustained a 20 percent drop in output, is now
expected to start expanding in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
David Fernandez, an economist with J.P. Morgan, said: "If you
look at where the growth has come from so far, it is important not
to point to reform. Most everything has to do with electronics."
</P>
<P>
However, the momentum in electronics exports may not be
maintained for too long, as memory chip prices have weakened
marginally from their peak, economists said.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, non-oil domestic exports climbed 7.5 percent
year-to-year in June, slowing from a 15.5 percent surge in May,
because of a slowdown in electronics exports.
</P>
<P>
After months of steady growth in export orders, electronic
orders in Singapore rose less than 1 percent in June and its disk
drive exports shrank 7.9 percent in June compared with growth of
5.7 percent in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that export growth in economies like Singapore
tends to be volatile in the months ahead if they are reliant on
the electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
A weaker electronics market means that East Asian economies'
performance during the second half of the year may not be as
spectacular as in the first half, they said.
</P>
<P>
But other analysts said that if the economies have diversified
beyond chip making into their products, they may continue to
benefit from exports of other products such as personal computers
and cellular phones, which are still enjoying healthy demand.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is very hard to predict when the cyclical
changes in the world electronics market will start. But one thing
is certain that those which are too reliant on electronic exports
are bound to suffer sooner or later when a demand cycle begins.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when the electronics market experienced a cyclical
change, East Asia's exports growth began nose-diving. In 1998, the
region's export revenues suffered a contraction in terms of the
dollar. An uptrend only began at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Many East Asian economies should learn a lesson from
over-dependence on electronic exports and change their economic
structures to avert a potential economic decline, economists said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Universities in China will
welcome 2.7 million freshmen this month, 330,000 of which are a
direct result of the Ministry of Education's attempt to increase
college enrollment.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said that the estimated goal of an 11
percent college entrance rate for high school graduates in 2000
will be reached ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
For high school students, the national college entrance
examination held every July is no longer ultra-competitive, as
reforms have transformed China's higher education system into an
attainable pursuit for most high school students.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government announced last month that it will
increase the allocation for education in the national budget by
one percentage point annually over the next three to five years
and provide higher education opportunities for 15 percent of its
people by the year 2010, over the current nine percent.
</P>
<P>
College freshmen will have to pay their own tuition this year,
but those who lack the funds to do so will still have an
opportunity to go to school: On September 1, the Chinese
government will begin offering loans to financially-strapped
college students in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Wuhan. These
students will be required to pay half of the interest on the loans
within four years of graduation.

Chinese President Jiang Zemin, speaking at the Third National
Education Work Conference in June, urged the nation to make
education a priority and asked that reforms be deepened in China's
higher education system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education is determined to build up a vigorous
higher education system that will inspire creativity from its
personnel, said Zhong Binling, a ministry official. China will
overhaul its current management and funding of higher education,
reduce the pressure-cooker atmosphere for applicants, and create a
favorable environment for quality education programs, Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the ministry formed a plan to revitalize
education in the 21st century, which outlined a trans-century
picture for education reform and development. The Chinese
government also issued a regulation on improving education and
pushing forward quality education, saying that the fundamental
point of education is to improve the quality of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
Ren Lijian, a researcher at Nanjing University, said that in
the coming century, higher education will no longer be only for
the privileged, but a reasonable goal for all young people.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand-China Society Chief Hails China's Progress in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Bill Willmott, son of an
English teacher to China in the 1930-40s, said that 50 years ago
he lived in "a very different China from today."
</P>
<P>
Willmott was born in Chengdu, a well-known city in China's
southwestern province of Sichuan, stayed there through his teenage
years, immigrated to New Zealand in the 1970s and later traveled
to China 15 times. He said the Asian giant's progress in the past
half a century is "immense" and "earth-shaking."
</P>
<P>
In the 1940s, "peasants around Chengdu lived in abject poverty .
.. and in the city, the bodies of starved people were found on the
streets every morning. Inflation of over 100 percent per month was
impoverishing university professors and factory workers alike," he
recalled during a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
he said, taxes on peasants were slashed to a minimum, factory
wages were raised, inflation was brought under control and
universities were democratized."
</P>
<P>
"They were exciting and optimistic days," said Willmott, now
president of the New Zealand-China Friendship Society.
</P>
<P>
He said that wherever he was, he followed with great interest
the development in China and is happy with the achievements China
has made since 1949.
</P>
<P>
"Not only has the standard of living of the ordinary Chinese
risen beyond their wildest imagination, but the Chinese society
has been transformed from a semi-feudal, agrarian base to a
progressive, industrializing economy, one of the fastest growing
in the world."
</P>
<P>
"Most important of all, the Chinese people have been
transformed. Life expectancy has doubled in 50 years, infant
mortality -- that terrible tragedy so common in the past -- has
been reduced to almost the same rate as in industrialized
countries. The health facilities in China are better than in any
other country at a comparable stage of economic development. ...
Education has taken giant steps at every level from pre-school to
university," Willmott said.
</P>
<P>
He described the changes in women's lives in China as "the most
striking."
</P>
<P>
"Women were denigrated and oppressed in the old China, and for
so many their lot was misery and poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
But today, he said, they can happily "hold up half the sky."
The employment rate among Chinese women is the highest in Asia and
even higher than the average for industrialized countries. China
has a greater proportion of women in its lawmaking National People
's Congress and in high government positions than in any other
Asian country and most industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
"These are all indications of the humanitarian and dedicated
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over 50 years," Willmott
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is still rural poverty, rapid advances are
being made to eliminate it. Although there are still huge problems
to overcome, the Chinese government is tackling them with
fortitude and wisdom," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The progress China has made in half a century is immense, and
friends of China everywhere will rejoice in the celebration of the
great event of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People'
s Republic of China," Willmott said.

<HEADLINE> The Burhan's Family: A Deep Love Of The Motherland (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th founding anniversary of
the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Xinhua News Agency is
releasing a series of stories about 50 Chinese men and women,
young and old, to present a picture of the changes that have taken
place in China over the past 50 years. These people will describe
their own experiences and how they fit into the changes in the
motherland. The following is the 14th article.
</P>
<P>
URUMQI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Oegur, a former vice president
of the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences, says that the greatest
spiritual legacy his father-in-law Burhan Shahidi, Xinjiang's
great patriot, left was a deep love of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Burhan, who died in 1989, is loved and respected by all the
ethnic groups of Xinjiang for his role in the peaceful liberation
of Xinjiang in 1949 and his devotion to the motherland. He was
chairman of the Provincial People's Government for many years
after the New China was founded.
</P>
<P>
Burhan had eight children, five of whom are still living. His
daughter Suum, who is Oegur's wife, was the second eldest. Oegur,
who is now 81, was among the first group of people in Xinjiang to
join the Communist Party in 1949 after liberation. He was posted
to Alma Ata as Deputy Counsul-General in former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Oegur and Suum gave up a chance of staying in
Moscow and returned to Xinjiang after graduating from university
there to make a contribution to the motherland. Oegur became vice-
president of the Xinjiang Academy of Social Sciences and wrote
books, one of which was the Brief History of the Uygur Ethnic
Group in China.
</P>
<P>
In looking back over the past 50 years, he says that great
changes have taken place in Xinjiang: Fifty years ago it was just
a desert with little industry and completely backward. Xinjiang
couldn't even produce a single nail.
</P>
<P>
Today it has a well-integrated industrial system and
petrochemical products and agricultural machinery that are used
all over China, he says, and he and his wife are very happy with
their lives today in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> KLA Chief Pledges to Respect Disarmament Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA) Hashim Thaqi said here Friday that the KLA intended to
respect the September 19 disarmament deadline while Italy called
for easing ethnic tension in the war-devastated Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
Thaqi, head of the self-proclaimed provisional government in
Kosovo, had talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini on
Friday. A Foreign Ministry statement released after their
encounter quoted Thaqi as saying that the KLA fully intended to
respect its commitments to the international community and put a
stop to the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, free elections would soon be held in Kosovo to
create new legitimate institutions, Thaqi said.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Dini told Thaqi that "everyone must
do everything possible to reduce tensions and promote the peaceful
living together of the different ethnic groups in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The objective of a multi-ethnic Kosovo remains the
international community's priority," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He called on ethnic Albanian leaders to put a stop to the
exodus of Kosovo Serbs and to help in the reconstruction and
administration of the region as well as development of
institutions there.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that the KLA's future credibility and its political
role in Kosovo depended upon this co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Thaqi's Rome visit is part of a round of meetings with European
leaders in various capitals after he announced that he aims to
turn the KLA into a political party. He arrived in Rome on Friday
morning.

JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign
exchange reserves fell 133.4 million U.S. dollars to 15.8 billion
dollars as of August 31, partly due to foreign debt payments, Bank
Indonesia said in its latest weekly report.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of net foreign exchange reserves was still
above the minimum target of 14.3 billion dollars set by the
International Monetary Fund, the report quoted by The Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>

Gross foreign exchange reserves, which are net foreign exchange
reserves plus outstanding foreign exchange contracts, also
declined 146.2 million dollars to 26.8 billion dollars, the report

<P>
Burhan's son Mulati and daughter-in-law Kamar share Oegur's
amazement over the great changes that have taken place in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, they graduated from the Beijing Petroleum
Institute but gave up a chance to stay and work in Beijing and
returned to Xinjiang to explore for petroleum.
</P>
<P>
They say that back then, exploration was very difficult
because transportation meant on foot or the back of a camel. Now,
however, they use helicopters to cross the desert and in one day
can finish what used to take an entire whole summer.
</P>
<P>
His wife Kamar's parents and siblings emigrated to the Soviet
Union before the 1990s, but she says that her roots are in China
because she is Burhan's daughter-in-law. Her husband Mulati says,
"My father lived a very simple life in those days and left nothing
for us when he died but a great love of China that has inspired
generations."
</P>
<P>
Burhan's family has been around now for five generations and
numbers about 60. They have intermarried with people from various
ethnic groups like the Uygurs, Kazakhs, Tatars, Uzbeks, and Han.
</P>
<P>
The big family is held together by the one strong belief
inherited from Burhan Shahidi: a deep love of the motherland.

UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- East Timor has voted

direct ballot to choose the territory's future, U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan announced Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The result was announced simultaneously in Dili, capital of
East Timor, former Portuguese colony until 1975 when Indonesia
occupied it after Portugal's withdrawal. The U.N. has seen it as a
non-self-governing territory since 1976 when Indonesia made it a
province.
</P>
<P>
Annan said another 21 percent of voters were for special
autonomy within Indonesia. Vote count was 344,580 for independence
and 94,388 for autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The ballot was held under a U.N. brokered agreement between
Indonesia and Portugal on May 5.

<HEADLINE> Albright Hails Israeli-Palestinian New Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, GAZA STRIP, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The newly-
reached agreement between Israel and the Palestinians is "another
important step on the road to the Israeli and Palestine peace," U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, stricken between Israeli and Palestinian officials
Friday night, will be signed Saturday evening in the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh under the supervision of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Telling a press conference, Albright spoke highly of the
efforts from both sides in hammering out the deal, saying that "
They have really seized, I believe, a historic opportunity" to
define peace for generations to come in the region.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived here Friday to broker the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations and had two hours of talks with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Working intensively, the Israelis and Palestinians solved
problems together, negotiated solutions together and began to re-
establish trust and confidence in each other," she added.
</P>
<P>
She also thanked Mubarak for his "terribly intensive and hard
work" to help end the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a revision of the Wye River accord signed
about a year ago in Washington, Israel will withdraw from 11
percent, instead of 13.1 percent as previously demanded, of the
West Bank in three stages, starting in the next few days and
ending January 20.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel pledged to release hundreds of Palestinian
prisoners -- a fundamental and emotional issue that had long been
disputed. Under the deal, the Palestinian side accepts the Israeli
proposed number of 350 prisoners to be freed. Chief Palestinian
negotiator Nabil Shaath also said a joint committee will discuss
release of more prisoners in December.
</P>
<P>
In the accord, both sides are barred from taking unilateral
steps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
According to the accord, they will start negotiating a
permanent peace agreement within the next few days and conclude it
within a year.
</P>
<P>
Within five or six months, they would complete a framework
agreement to outline solutions for some most complex issues, which
include Palestinian statehood, the status of Jerusalem -- which
the Palestinians want as their capital, the fate of Palestinian
refugees and the future of Jewish settlements in Palestinian-
majority areas.

<HEADLINE> EU Poses No Conditions on Trade Pact With Mexico: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking official of
the European Union denied on Friday that the bloc had raised
conditions for the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the
EU and Mexico are advancing, representative of the European
Council Parliamentary Assembly, Enric Pamitjavila, told the press
in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of the Mexican state of Chiapas, 650
kilometers east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
There are good relations and big possibilities for the signing
of the FTA that would benefit both parties, he said.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the EU had conditioned the signing of the FTA on
the solution of the on-going political conflict with the rebel
National Liberation Zapatista Army (EZLN) in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
The EZLN rose in arms on January 1, 1994, demanding respect to
the rights of the indigenous peoples in Chiapas and other states
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the government and the EZLN were bogged
down in 1996, when the rebel group left the negotiations table and
charged the government authorities with reneging the so-called San
Andres Larrainzar Accords signed by the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
taken measures to intensify the reform of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) by setting up the Fund for the Restructuring and Equitising
State-owned Enterprises (FRESOE), English daily Vietnam News
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
FRESOE, aimed at assisting the restructuring and equitisation
of SOEs towards making the public sector more efficient, will be
established both at central and local levels as well as at state
corporations.
</P>
<P>
One of the main objectives of the fund will be to provide for
the training of workers and financial assistance to those who take
voluntary retrenchment during the restructuring and equitisation
process.
</P>
<P>
It will also help workers at equitised SOEs to buy preferential
shares, and provide financial assistance to other SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be financed with proceeds from restructuring,
equitisation, sale or lease of enterprises (change of SOE
ownership).
</P>
<P>
The decision will become effective on September 15, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Text of Annan's Statement to U.N. Security Council on East Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full
text of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's statement to the
Security Council in which he announced the result of East Timor
ballot on its future:
</P>
<P>
On 5 May 1999, Portugal, Indonesia and the United Nations
concluded an historic set of agreements intended to resolve the
long-standing issue of East Timor. These 5 May Agreements
requested me to determine, through a popular consultation based
upon a universal, direct, and secret ballot, whether the East
Timorese people would accept or reject a proposed special autonomy
for East Timor within the unitary Republic of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
To enable me to fulfill this request, the United Nations
Security Council established on 11 June, 1999, the United Nations
Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) which proceeded to organize and
conduct the popular consultation. It registered 451,792 voters in
East Timor and around the world, in a registration process which
the Electoral Commission, a body composed of three independent
commissioners, deemed to be a sound basis for the conduct of the
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Thus, on 30 August, 1999, in a show of courage and
determination, the people of East Timor turned out in massive
numbers to vote in the popular consultation, expressing their will
as to the future of the Territory. The votes cast have now been
counted, and the Electoral Commission has assessed all outstanding
complaints and certified the results of the popular consultation
process. Therefore, in fulfillment of the task entrusted to me by
the 5 May Agreements, I hereby announce that the result of the
vote is 94,388, or 21.5 percent, in favor and 344,580, or 78.5
percent, against the proposed special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The people of East Timor have thus rejected the proposed
special autonomy and expressed their wish to begin a process of
transition towards independence.
</P>
<P>
After 24 years of conflict, East Timor now stands on the
threshold of what we all hope will be a process of orderly and
peaceful transition towards independence. The coming days, however,
will require patience and calm from the people of East Timor. I
hardly need stress how important it is for its leaders to exercise
wisdom and reason.
</P>
<P>
Now is the time for all concerned to seize the opportunity to
lay a firm and lasting foundation for cooperation and peace, and
to usher in an era of stability and prosperity for all future
generations of East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
Those who voted to accept the proposed special autonomy must
not consider this outcome a loss. Nor indeed should the majority
consider it a victory; for there are no winners and no losers
today. Rather, this moment heralds the opportunity for all East
Timorese to begin to forge together a common future in what is to
become an independent East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Today, I ask all parties to bring to an end the violence which
for 24 years has caused untold suffering to East Timor. I ask them
to begin in earnest a process of dialogue and reconciliation
through the East Timor Consultative Commission. I call upon the
Government of Indonesia, which made possible the consultation
process through a statesmanlike initiative of the President of the
Republic, to ensure its successful culmination by carrying out its
responsibility to maintain law and order in the Territory.
</P>
<P>
I should like to thank both Indonesia and Portugal for their
commitment and perseverance in this process. I am confident that
the Governments will fulfill their remaining obligations under the
5 May Agreements. Let me assure both Governments that the United
Nations will continue to work with them to ensure the
implementation of the results of the consultation through a
peaceful and orderly process. Let me also assure the people of
East Timor that the United Nations will not fail them in guiding
East Timor in its transition towards independence.

<HEADLINE> Chile Allows Peso to Trade Freely Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Central Bank
announced on Friday a rule allowing the local currency, peso, to
trade freely against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The parity of the peso against the dollar declined two pesos to
around 521 pesos per dollar after the Central Bank's announcement.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, which is independent from the government, had
maintained a system to enter the market to sell or buy dollars,
depending on whether the peso weakened or strengthened against the
U.S. currency. To determine when that intervention should occur,
the bank set a minimum and maximum price for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Exporters Association, Cristobal Valdes, called
the bank's move an important step to encourage exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
SNOW DRAGON, September 4 (Xinhua)-- China is becoming a major
force in international polar research, according to Chen Liqi,
chief scientist of China's first government sponsored Arctic
expedition.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches great importance to polar
research, which reflects the country's concern for environmental
changes worldwide, and has upgraded the general level of its
scientific research," said Chen, who is aboard the homeward bound
expedition ship Snow Dragon.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has set up two expedition stations in the
South Pole, established its own polar research centers, polar
archives and information management system, and owns a 20,000-
tonnage freighter and expedition icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that an effective Chinese polar expedition and
research network has come into being," remarked Chen, who also
director of the Polar Research Office under the State Oceanic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years China has sent 15 expeditions to the South
Pole, conducting year-round observations and multi-subject
research, and amassed large amounts of valuable data, samples and
information," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese scientists have published dozens of polar research
works, and some of them have met international standards." the
scientist added.
</P>
<P>
The Snow Dragon, which belongs to China's third generation of
polar expedition icebreakers, is equipped with advanced guiding,
automatic steering and experimental systems, including a 200
square meter lab and state of the art ocean research instruments.
</P>
<P>
"With an increasing number of Chinese scientist paying visits
to the poles, the Snow Dragon, China's mobile polar expedition
station, will become well known worldwide," the chief scientist

<P>
CARACAS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket
price increased by 23 cents to 18.26 U.S. dollars per barrel this
week, the Mines and Energy Ministry announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Due to recovery of crudes demand in the international market,
the average value of the Venezuelan oil basket has risen to 13.40
dollars per barrel in the first eight months this year.
</P>
<P>
Following the sharp fall in oil prices in 1998, the oil
producing countries on March 12 decided to cut oil output by two
million barrels a day until next year. Since then the value of
crudes has increased by more than 6 dollars.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, the Venezuelan oil basket dropped by 5.57 dollars
per barrel. Accordingly, the government income fell almost 6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company,
suffered an 84 percent decline in its income in 1998.

<HEADLINE> East Timor's Direct Ballot Won by Pro-Independence Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- East Timor has chosen
independence from Indonesia by vote, the United Nations Mission in
East Timor (UNAMET) Chief Ian Martin announced in Dili, capital of
East Timor, on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said 94,388 voters, or 21.5 percent, voted in favor of
autonomy under Jakarta's continued rule and 344,580, or 78.5
percent rejected it. A total of 98.6 percent of the total 450,000
registered voters cast their votes during the polling day in or
outside East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the results of the ballot was moved forward
by three days to avoid possible leaks. The announcement was
originally scheduled for September 7.
</P>
<P>
"If the results are not immediately announced they could be
leaked. So it is better if they are announced tomorrow
(Saturday)," Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said after an
emergency meeting, abruptly called by President B.J. Habibie on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Habibie called a meeting with Alatas,
State Secretary/Justice Minister Muladi, Defense Minister Wiranto
and Indonesian Police Chief Gen. Roesmanhadi to talk about the
latest development in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Alatas said the government remained committed to accepting the
results of the ballot, whatever they were.
</P>
<P>
Alatas quoted Wiranto as saying the military and the police
would continue to maintain peace and order during any transitional
period in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Alatas said the legitimate procedure following
the ballot was for the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to
have the final say on the issue, because it was this body which
legislated the integration of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will hold its next session in November.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted Indonesian officials as saying that the
announcement of the results was moved up to Saturday as the
situation in East Timor continued to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
Violence was looming in East Timor as both the pro-integration
and pro-independence forces are anxiously waiting for the
declaration of the ballot results.
</P>
<P>
The UNAMET office was targeted in the violence on Wednesday,
killing at least two people. On Thursday, two local UNAMET staff
members were killed and 20 houses razed in the town of Maliana,
138 kilometers west of Dili, capital of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of East Timorese have fled to Belu and Timor Tengah
Selatan districts in East Nusa Tenggara province of Indonesia to
avoid possible bloodshed in the territory. About 76 Indonesian and
foreign reporters who had covered the ballot left Dili Friday
aboard an aircraft chartered by BBC London.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said that on a UNAMET request, the Indonesian military
has sent two extra battalions, or around 1,400 soldiers, to the
hotspot to assist the police in their duty.
</P>
<P>
He repeated that the results of the ballot must be accepted as
the best option.
</P>
<P>
However, pro-integration supporters in East Timor seemed to be
taking a less conciliatory stance.
</P>
<P>
Jose Abilio Soares, the Jakarta-appointed governor of East
Timor, said the pro-integration camp would not accept UNAMET's
decision regardless of the results.
</P>
<P>
East Timor's Manatuto district chief Vidal Domingos Doutel
Sarmento said people in the district considered the ballot unfair
and they are going to reject the results of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
East Timorese went to the direct ballots on August 30 to decide
whether to accept or reject an offer of wide-ranging autonomy
within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said in January if the East Timorese rejected the
offer, he would ask the MPR to annul a 1978 decree which legally
integrated the former Portuguese colony into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot was conducted by the U.N. under an agreement
reached on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal.

DILI, East Timor, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Being afraid of fresh
violence, citizens in Dili, capital of East Timor, have packed
their belongings and started an exodus following the announcement
of the autonomy ballot results Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trucks and private vehicles had been seen fleeing Dili since
06:00 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
The refugees included workers from outside East Timor and
Timorese.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government had coordinated refugees that swarmed
Saturday through sea and trans-provincial roads that connected
East Timor to other provinces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the United Nations Mission in East Timor
(UNAMET) announced that over 78 percent of East Timorese had voted
for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, some figures from the pro-integration groups said
they would reject the results of the direct ballot which was held
on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The ballot, which was held under an agreement signed by the UN,
Indonesia and Portugal in May, would decide whether East Timor
enjoy wide-ranging autonomy within Indonesia or become
independent.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Respects Choice of East Timorese: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Saturday said the Indonesian government respected the
choice of the majority of East Timorese rejecting the offer of
special autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Our brothers in East Timor in fact have chosen to refuse a
special autonomy status offered by Indonesian government," said
the president in a television speech following the announcement of
the outcome of the direct ballot on August 30.
</P>
<P>
It was announced that East Timor has chosen independence from
Indonesia by vote, with 78.5 percent ballots supporting separation
and 21 percent favoring autonomy under Jakarta's rule.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the decision made by the East Timorese to
separate from Indonesia is a bitter one for the Indonesian people,
the president urged the Indonesians to accept the fact patiently.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said he has asked the Indonesian Armed Forces
and Police to take strict measures to maintain safety of East
Timor.
</P>
<P>
Habibie said in January if the East Timorese rejected the
offer, he would ask the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) to
annul a 1978 decree which legally integrated the former Portuguese
colony into Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The MPR will hold its next meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
The direct ballot was conducted by the U.N. under an agreement
reached on May 5 by Indonesia and Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Peace, Stability Urged in Post-Ballot East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday called on all parties in East Timor to
implement the result of the ballot on its future in a peaceful
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The council met on the matter after Secretary-General Kofi
Annan made a statement to the council, announcing the ballot
result, which is in favor of independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The council urged all parties to respect the result and called
on all East Timorese, numbering some 800,000, to work together for
its implementation, according to a presidential statement issued
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The council is looking to Indonesia to take the necessary
constitutional steps to implement the ballot result in accordance
with the May 5 agreement, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the need for the result to be implemented in an
atmosphere of peace and security without further violence.
</P>
<P>
Annan made a similar appeal to the political parties in East
Timor for patience and calm in coming days.
</P>
<P>
U.N. statistics show that a total of 98.6 percent of voters
turned out and 78.5 percent of voters were for independence with
another 21.5 percent voting for special autonomy within Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. brokered May 5 agreement between Indonesia and
Portugal provides for a transitional period for Indonesia to end
its links with East Timor, former Portuguese colony until 1975
when Indonesia occupied it after Portugal's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also provides for the transfer of East Timor
authority to the United Nations in a peaceful and orderly way
before the U.N. starts a process for East Timor to go toward
independence.

<HEADLINE> East Timorese People Urged to Reconcile </HEADLINE>

<P>
JAKARTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- East Timor's jailed
pro-independence leader Xanana Gusmao here Saturday called on the
East Timorese people to reconcile in the new spirit of brotherhood
to maintain peace and order in the territory.
</P>
<P>
Xanana, who is also president of the National Council for East
Timor Resistance, made the statement following the announcement of
the outcome of the ballot held on August 30 for the future of East
Timor which was integrated into Indonesia in 1976.
</P>
<P>
In his written speech, Xanana called for fixing August 30 as
the East Timor National Independence day.
</P>
<P>
"Today might have been a very happy day for celebration. But
today, violence was faced by citizens unable to defend
themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement by the U.N., over 78 percent of
the East Timorese voted in favor of independence from Indonesia in
Monday's direct ballot to choose the territory's future.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976, but the move has never been recognized by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Indonesian government proposed to
give wide-ranging autonomy to East Timor. In May, the U.N.,
Indonesia and Portugal signed an agreement on the holding of a
direct ballot in East Timor to decide the territory's future.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Hopes for China's Entry Into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley is hoping for progress in China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) when Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and U.S. President Bill Clinton meet later this month, the
Dominion newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen leaders of the 21 members of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, including President Jiang and President
Clinton, will go to Auckland, the largest city of New Zealand, for
an informal meeting of APEC leaders on September 12.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled Jiang-Clinton bilateral talks are "their affairs,
" but any steps toward China's WTO membership will be "a great
boost" to the APEC meeting, the Wellington-based paper quoted
Shipley as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said it is "a widely-held view" that China, the 10th
biggest economy in the world, should take part in the next round
of talks on global trade. The talks will be launched at the WTO
ministerial meeting in November in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
The new WTO Director-General, Mike Moore, said in Geneva
recently that the APEC meeting could provide "a window for some
progress" on China's entry into the trade watchdog.
