	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Pavol Demitra scored with 3:21 to go as the St.
Louis Blues beat the suddenly struggling Phoenix Coyotes 3-2
Thursday night to end a six-game winless slump.
	   Phoenix got off to a franchise-best 17-3-4 start, but is 0-2-1

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad Friday
in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq says
have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes several hours earlier beginning
Thursday night. The bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of
smoke and sets the skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   But as a new day dawned, the tension of the night was nowhere
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. However, traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim
sabbath.
	   The aerial attack a few hours earlier had set off the loudest
explosions heard so far since the United States launched the
operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52H heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, from where smoke drifted up. The
Corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   To protest the strikes, Iraq's ally Russia called home for
consultations its ambassador to the United States, the U.S. State
Department said.
	   The Pentagon said more than 200 missiles hit 50 sensitive sites
in the first attack, including President Saddam Hussein's military
intelligence headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks for special
security guards who protect weapons sites.
	   An assessment of the damage from the second round of attack
wasn't available. Foreign reporters in Baghdad are based at a press
center in the Information Ministry and cannot move around the
sprawling city of 5 million without official escorts.
	   There was also no word on casualties from Friday's bombardment,
which began at about 4 a.m. (0100 GMT) and lasted more than 10
minutes.
	   At least three explosions were heard, the result of incoming
missiles or bombs. Loud reports also were created by anti-aircraft
guns firing at the unseen enemy.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said earlier that at least
25 people were killed and 75 were injured until Thursday night when
at least a dozen explosions rocked Baghdad.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there have been no
American casualties.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals would find it hard to cope with
the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a
Baghdad hospital damaged by explosions.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq for
its alleged obstruction of the United Nations Special Commission,
which is responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction _ chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of the illegal weapons,
the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Clinton said ``it would have been a disaster'' if the United
States had allowed Saddam to defy UNSCOM without any penalty.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops, 22 warships, including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles, 210 aircraft and the aircraft
carrier USS Enterprise in the Gulf off the coast of southern Iraq.
The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   The United States has said the strikes, which will last several
days, are aimed at military installations in a bid to degrade
Saddam's ability to harm U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
the real U.S. aim is to topple Saddam. ``I don't think it is a
question of those weapons,'' he said on Cable News Network.
	   The strikes have divided the 15-member Security Council, with
Russia, China and Kenya supporting Iraq's demand for a cease-fire.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow would insist on
dismissal of UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler, whose negative report
about Iraq triggered the U.S.-British action.
	   In the report Tuesday, Butler said Iraq had reneged on its Nov.
14 pledge to cooperate with his inspectors. He cited Iraq's refusal
to allow entry into five sites, including an office of Iraq's
ruling Baath Party.
	   Butler defended his report and dismissed as ``utterly wrong''
any suggestion that it was timed to help Clinton deflect attention
from impeachment proceedings over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   ``It danced to no one's tune ... I want to say simply, slowly
and plainly that any suggestion that that report was not factual,
was not objective, is utterly false,'' he said Thursday.
	   Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf told reporters
earlier Thursday that inspection teams carried out visits to 427
sites in the last month, and five cases of non-cooperation could
hardly be a reason for such punishing air strikes.
	   Among the places hit in the first wave of attacks was the house
of Saddam's youngest daughter, Hala, Baghdad Radio reported. She
was safe but her house was demolished, it said.
	   The president visited her house and some of the other targeted
sites Thursday.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address,
saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to face'' but
``depending on a long technological arm.''

Indonesian students protest U.S. air strikes on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A small group of protesters rallied
Friday outside the Jakarta headquarters of the United Nations to
protest U.S. missile attacks on Iraq.
	   The 20 demonstrators from a Muslim student group handed a
petition condemning the attack to U.N. officials. They also urged
the Indonesian government to cut diplomatic ties with the United
States and Britain, which also participated in the attacks.
	   The Indonesian government has urged an end to the airstrikes.
	   Indonesia and Iraq have had good relations as members of the
Non-Aligned Movement, a group of developing nations. Both countries
are predominantly Muslim.
	   Iraq said at least 25 people were killed and 75 were injured in
two rounds of bombing.

Chinese rowers sweep five golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China's rowers, fired up after a
disappointing World Championships, swept all five of Friday's Asian
Games races, winning by margins ranging from 2.5 to more than 11
seconds,
	   Coach Gao Hongyin gave some of the credit to track coach Ma
Junren, famous for ``Ma's army'' of women distance runners who set
world records in the early 1990s. Because of a dispute with
national officials, none of Ma's runners are in the Asian Games,
but Gao said Ma had helped with the rowers' training.
	   ``We suffered a severe defeat in the World Championship in
Germany earlier this year. After that we held a training camp in
Guangdong and that proved very helpful,'' he said.
	   Gao said Ma went to the southern province camp to lecture about
his experiences in training.
	   In Friday's 2,000-meter races, singles sculls winner Cai Yukun
had to come from behind against Indonesia's Lasmin, but had a lead
of more than three seconds after 1,500 meters. He won by nearly
five seconds, finishing in 7 minutes, 1.92 seconds. Lasmin took
silver in 7:06.86 and Pakistan's Mohammad Akram took bronze in
7:10.63.
	   The lightweight men's pair of Gao Bingrong and Liu Jian had the
closest finish, beating Japan's Kazuaki Mimoto and Daisaku Takeda
by 2.5 seconds _ 6:24.04 to 6:26.55. The Japanese pair had narrowed
the gap by almost three seconds over the last 500 meters. North
Koreans Ri Chol Jin and Kim Song Chol won bronze in 6:36.82.
	   In lightweight coxless fours racing, China's Liu Zewu, Mao
Zhixing, Wang Xutao and Zhou Guoyang beat Japan's four 5:56.32 to
6:00.13. India's four won bronze in 6:11.48.
	   China's Ou Shaoyan won by more than 11 seconds in lightweight
women's single sculls, finishing in 7:47.34 to 7:59.05 for Hong
Kong's Ng Ga-loc. Thailand's Phuttharaksa Nikree was third in
8:06.93.
	   The Chinese lightweight women's coxed fours team, including
three rowers from the boat that finished fourth in the World
Championships, won their race by five seconds over Japan _ 6:39.74
to 6:44.74 _ with North Korea third in 657.70. Peng Ying joined the
September race's three _ Fan Ruihua, Liu Bili and Shen Senping.
	   ``Now we are on the right track to clean sweep the Asiad rowing
gold medals for the third time,'' said coach Gao.
	   In the last games in 1994, China won 11 of 12 rowing golds. They
had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.

Major Hong Kong bank latest to announce salary freeze
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEDES to UPDATE with confirmation, comments from bank
official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A major local bank will join the growing rank
of large Hong Kong companies to freeze salaries during the economic
downturn.
	   Hang Seng Bank, the largest locally incorporated bank, will
freeze salaries next year for its 7,800 staff members to cut costs,
the bank's spokeswoman Jacqueline Kam said.
	   ``It will be a very difficult year because of the economic
situation. The banking community will be deeply affected,'' she
said.
	   The bank operates 156 branches and has a handful of employees
working overseas and in China.
	   Kam said the bank will still give employees a year-end bonus as
planned next week. Last year, employees with good performance
earned an average 5.5-percent pay increase, she said.
	   The news followed a flurry of layoffs, pay cuts and salary
freezes as Hong Kong sinks deeper into recession.
	   The bank's parent, British banking giant HSBC Holdings, also
announced earlier that it will freeze salaries for more than 13,000
employees in Hong Kong at its flagship unit, Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp.
	   Two blue-chip property developers also reportedly announced pay
freezes for some employees.
	   On Thursday, the government announced that unemployment is at
5.5 percent, the highest since it started keeping such statistics
in 1981.
	   Officials say more people face layoffs or pay cuts ahead of the
Chinese New Year in February, when most companies review their
operations and lay off unneeded staff.
	   The once-robust economy contracted 7 percent in the third
quarter and is forecast to shrink by 5 percent for all of 1998.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Yoon Yong-il, relying on
a more consistent serve return, beat Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7,
6-4, 6-3, 6-2 Friday for the Asian Games gold men in men's tennis.
	   Yoon set up 14 break points and converted six, while Iwabuchi

	   Men's singles bronze medals went to Indians Srinath Prahlad and
Mahesh Bhupathi, the semifinal losers.
	   In Thursday's women's singles final, Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki
beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2.

Belfast parties strike deal on forming new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Overcoming months of stalemate,
Northern Ireland's rival politicians agreed early Friday on the
shape of the new coalition government envisioned in April's peace
accord.
	   As importantly, the eight parties that support the accord also
announced agreement on the six areas where the future Belfast
administration would shape policy in conjunction with the
neighboring Irish Republic, which won independence from Britain in
1922.
	   The breakthrough came after 18 straight hours of negotiations at
Stormont Parliamentary Buildings in east Belfast, would-be
headquarters for the administration made up of the province's
British Protestants and Irish Catholics. British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, breaking off from monitoring the U.S.-British
bombardment of Iraq, phoned several key leaders late Thursday.
	   ``I welcome this important breakthrough and congratulate the
Northern Ireland leaders and the Irish Republic on reaching a
genuine accommodation of mutual benefit to north and south,'' said
Mo Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
	   Mowlam would see many of her responsibilities handed over to
local politicians next year _ if, critically, they can overcome
still-bigger obstacles to form the government now detailed on
paper.
	   ``This clears the way for the transfer of power from London to
the Assembly,'' said Protestant politician David Trimble, referring
to the 108-member legislature elected in June from which the
administration is to be drawn.
	   Trimble, as leader of the biggest party, the Ulster Unionists,
would lead the administration, which should have been formed in
October.
	   According to Friday's agreed text the cabinet-style
administration, to be called the Executive Committee, will have 10
departments, four more than the current British government system,
which has directly ruled Northern Ireland since 1972. Trimble's
Ulster Unionists had sought to limit the new system to seven
departments.
	   The departments _ to be headed by five Protestants and five
Catholics _ will be agriculture and rural development; environment;
regional development; social development; education; higher and
further education, training and employment; enterprise, trade and
investment; culture, arts and leisure; health, social services and
public safety, and finance and personnel.
	   The six areas of formal cooperation with the Irish government
are to be: cross-border waterways, food safety, trade and business
development, European Union funding, marine matters, and promotion
of the native Gaelic language and Ulster-Scots dialect. Catholic
politicians had sought two others.
	   Friday's agreement also specified six general areas _
agriculture, education, environment, health, tourism and transport
_ where the two parts of Ireland would cooperate more informally.
The north's Catholic politicians hope this agenda will help achieve
their long-term goal of unification.
	   Despite the exhausting achievement, politicians left Stormont
aware that a bigger obstacle must still be overcome.
	   Trimble, facing considerable opposition from hard-line
Protestants both inside and outside his party, is refusing to
include the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party in the new government unless
the Irish Republican Army starts disarming.
	   On paper Sinn Fein, which gets 17 percent of the Northern Irish
vote, would be entitled to two of the 10 Executive posts and a
similar share of positions on cross-border committees. Trimble and
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams discussed the impasse in private late
Thursday.
	   Complicating the picture, the hard-line Democratic Unionist
Party led by Protestant evangelist Ian Paisley also would be
entitled to two posts. Paisley condemns the entire peace process as
a sham, and has boycotted negotiations since 1997 because of Sinn
Fein's involvement.

Australian engineer, pilot die in plane crash in Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAET, Philippines (AP) _ Two persons, including an Australian
engineer, died when a twin-engine plane they were flying in crashed
into a mountain village in bad weather, police said Friday.
	   Police Superintendent Rogelio Granada said villagers found the
six-seater Beechcraft 95 half buried in mud late Thursday in
Mabini, a mountain village on the outskirts of Daet town in
Camarines del Norte province.
	   Daet is about 220 kilometers (137 miles) east of Manila.
	   Granada said the villagers began searching for the plane after
seeing it plunge into a mountain a day earlier.
	   He said the pilot may have lost his way in the heavy rain and
strong winds.
	   Granada said villagers found the decapitated remains of two
persons, including the Filipino pilot and his passenger, Australian
telephone engineer Mark Madrigale of Melbourne.
	   Other identification documents were lost or stolen by local
villagers, Granada added.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Holding aloft posters accusing
President Bill Clinton of bombing Iraq to cover up domestic
scandals, four Malaysian groups protested in front of the United
States embassy in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``U.S. is ruled by lust and lies'' and ``Clinton, don't cover
your sex scandal'' were some of the messages on the posters held
Friday by about 20 activists of pro-government groups, who also
presented a memorandum to U.S. diplomats.
	   ``The U.S. is going against the United Nations. Even (Secretary
General) Kofi Annan is against the bombing,'' said Mohd. Ali
Rustam, Malaysia's deputy transport minister, who led the protest.
	   He said he took part as head of a Malaysian youth organization
known as the 4B group. The other groups were the Malaysian Youth
Council, the World Assembly of Youth and the National Union of
Malaysian Muslim students.
	   Mohd. Rustam deplored Thursday's bombing of Baghdad saying it
was an affront to Muslims who were preparing for the holy month of
fasting which begins this weekend.
	   The protesters submitted a memorandum addressed to Clinton to
Anna Borg, the deputy chief of the embassy. It demanded an
immediate end to the hostility and an emergency meeting of the U.N.
Security Council to discuss the issue.
	   Malaysia has formally deplored the attacks.
	   The bombing could add to the already cool ties between
predominantly Muslim Malaysia and Washington.
	   Last month, Vice President Al Gore angered Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's government by praising Malaysia's
anti-government protesters, calling them ``brave'' for their
struggle to demand democracy.
	   Making matters worse, Gore spoke in front of Mahathir and
several other prominent Asian leaders, then walked out of a banquet
held in his own honor.
	   Gore was in Kuala Lumpur to stand in for Clinton at a summit of
Pacific Rim nations.

Report: Diana's mother complains of conspiracy theories around
</HEADLINE>
Diana's death &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's mother lashed out at conspiracy
theorists who want to believe her daughter's death was more than a
tragic accident, saying the pain they cause is like ''having
repetitive major emotional surgery without an anesthetic,'' a
British tabloid reported Friday.
	   ''I trawled the depths of my imagination, alongside extensive
factual knowledge, and found no shred of evidence to support the
stories,'' Frances Shand Kydd was quoted as saying in the Daily
Mail.
	   Diana's mother was speaking Thursday at a remembrance service
for families of deceased children at St. George's Cathedral in
south London, the newspaper said.
	   Diana died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. The French
investigation into the accident continues, but speed and alcohol
are considered the main causes. Although, some people, including
Mohamed Al Fayed, whose son Dodi was also killed, have questioned
whether the crash was merely an accident.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd did not cite any of the theories, but she
condemned ''those who got lost in the moral maze, abandoned trust
and told and sold their stories, those who had no story and
invented utterly painful theories on her death,'' the Daily Mail
said.
	   Diana's mother also spoke of the pain she feels walking by shop
windows filled with her daughter's image on items for sale.
	   ''It seemed to me the wish to make money was boundless,'' Mrs.
Shand Kydd was quoted as saying.
	   She also recalled the nights before Diana's funeral when she
walked unnoticed among the crowds flocking to Kensington Gardens.
Tens of thousands of people came to lay flowers and mementos at the
gates of the palace after Diana's death.
	   ''I remember vividly how it was ... the profound silence,
dignity and gentleness of shared sorrow. Seeing tears flowing down
the cheeks of men and women of every age and color,'' she was
quoted as saying. ''I was sure many of them were also letting go of
personal sorrows and regrets, unencumbered by embarrassment. It
seemed strangely like an instant legacy from Diana, and I felt
proud to bits of her living.''

Report: SilkAir crash investigators consider desperate measure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Investigators of last year's SilkAir crash are
considering a desperate measure to gain clues to the mysterious
tragedy _ a test that would destroy the flight data recording tape,
Singapore government television reported Friday.
	   The failure of the two ``black boxes'' to record the final five
minutes of cockpit conversation and airplane activity before the
Boeing 737-300 crashed into a Sumatran jungle river is one of the
biggest puzzles of the Dec. 19, 1997 crash.
	   The government-run text TV service reported that Oetarjo Diran,
the chief Indonesian investigator, is considering putting the
flight data recorder tape through a final test in Los Angeles.
	   ``The test is final because in peeling off the tape's protective
coating to reach the innermost data storage, it would destroy the
tape in the process,'' the text TV report said.
	   ``The important question we would like to know is, why did the
data recorders quit?'' the report quoted Diran as saying.
	   Diran was due in Singapore on Friday to meet privately with
relatives of some of the 104 passengers and crew members killed in
the crash.
	   SilkAir plans to fly 300 Indonesian and Singaporean relatives to
Palembang in Indonesia for a memorial service Saturday.
	   Many of them have expressed anger over the slow progress in
finding the cause of the crash and over the offers of compensation
from the airline, a subsidiary of national carrier Singapore
Airlines.
	   Suggesting the possibility of further negotiations on
compensation offers, SilkAir general manager Mak Swee Wah told a
Singapore newspaper on Friday, ``We are not hard-hearted. ... We
are not hiding behind contracts and conventions. We are
listening.''
	   So far, the airline has offered no more than the dlrs 75,000
called for in the Warsaw Convention for victims of air crashes, and
as little as dlrs 20,000 for some, depending on their age and
income level, according to local news reports.
	   The television report said members of Diran's team were unable
to say when the outcome of the investigation would be available.
``The total damage of the aircraft, and the severe lack of clues
makes this an extremely complex investigation,'' the report quoted
the investigators as saying.
	   In reference to international media reports about the
possibility of pilot suicide as the cause of the crash, the
television report quoted the investigators as saying ``they could
not afford to dismiss any possibility until proven invalid.''
	   Investigators have drawn up 12 scenarios, and are exploring
various combinations of possible malfunctions, the report said.
	   The investigators interviewed by government television
reiterated a previous preliminary report, in which they had ruled
out weather, an act of terrorism, hazardous materials, maintenance
or repair as contributing to the crash.
	   The team is now looking closely at engineering factors, human
factors and aircraft structure, the report said.

Kosovo truce appears unraveling, verifiers powerless to stop it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 3rd graf to reflect that not all six Serbs in barroom
slaying were teen-agers &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo's fragile truce
threatening to unravel, ethnic Albanian rebels are vowing revenge
for the killing of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash this
weekend.
	   At the same time, Serb police launched a strong crackdown
Thursday on a suspected rebel-controlled village, reportedly
killing two ethnic Albanian fighters and capturing 34 in a day-long
battle.
	   Serb authorities said they raided the village of Glodjane in
search of gunmen who slaughtered six young Serbs, including four
teen-agers, on Monday in a bar in Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
west of Pristina.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern district of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and police officers wearing
flak jackets blocked a bridge leading to the Kapesnica district.
Police snipers looked down from surrounding rooftops.
	   The barroom killings, which took place hours after Yugoslav army
troops killed 36 Kosovo Liberation Army rebels near the Albanian
border, enraged the Serb population, which makes up about 10
percent of the population of Kosovo. Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic threatened to crush ethnic Albanian ``terrorists'' in the
province, which is a part of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   In a statement Thursday, the KLA denied responsibility for the
Pec killings and blamed the Serb secret police for the slayings.
	   ``We are convinced that this is the act of Serb secret police in
order to further strain relations between Serbs and Albanians,''
the rebel statement said. ``The murders of more than 30 of our
soldiers and commanders will not induce us to take revenge on the
civilian population _ we shall take revenge on the Serb police and
the military.''
	   The recriminations have raised concern that the Oct. 12 truce,
which ended months of fighting in this rebellious province, is
unraveling. The October agreement, hammered out by Milosevic and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, was designed to buy time for Serbs
and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to negotiate a long-term agreement on
the province's future.
	   But U.S.-led diplomatic efforts have failed to narrow the gap
between the ethnic Albanians -- who seek independence for Kosovo --
and the Serbs who refuse more than autonomy within Serbia.
	   Under the October accord, Milosevic agreed to allow up to 2,000
unarmed international civilians to verify compliance. But the
verifiers were unable to enter Glodjane, 10 kilometers (six miles)
south of Pec during Thursday's fighting.

Yorta Yorta people lose land rights claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A group of Aborigines lost their
claim to a big tract of Australian bushland after a judge on Friday
found that the ``tide of history'' had washed away their native
title rights.
	   Federal Court Justice Howard Olney ended the Yorta Yorta
people's four-year quest to win back limited control over 1,242
square miles (2,000 sq. kms) of land on the border of Victoria and
New South Wales states.
	   The Yorta Yorta people's defeat follows a recent victory by
another group of Aborigines, the Miriuwung Gajerrong, who won a
similar claim to lands in Australia's northwest.
	   Lawyers for the Yorta Yorta said they had not decided whether
they would appeal.
	   Olney found that native title did not exist because the Yorta
Yorta had lost their traditional connection with the land on which
their ancestors hunted and fished.
	   ``The tide of history has indeed washed away any real
acknowledgment of their traditional laws and any real observance of
their traditional customs,'' Olney said.
	   Monica Morgan, a Yorta Yorta spokeswoman, said outside the court
that the system of white law had failed her people.
	   ``We have been in this country for thousands and thousands and
thousands of years,'' she said. ``It'll take longer than a few
seconds from a judge to wipe away who we are.''
	   The Yorta Yorta laid claim to government-owned land and waters
along the Murray River in southeastern Australia about equidistant
from the two state capitals Sydney and Melbourne.
	   Before white settlement, the region was among the most densely
populated in Australia.
	   But it was rich farming and grazing land and the Aborigines were
shot, poisoned or moved off during settlement. Historians said the
Aboriginal population dropped by up to 85 percent in one
generation.
	   The community wanted to be recognized as the owners of the land,
the waters and its natural resources which they said were the
original territory of their ancestors.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With Kosovo's fragile truce
threatening to unravel, ethnic Albanian rebels are vowing revenge
for the killing of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash this
weekend.
	   At the same time, Serb police launched a strong crackdown
Thursday on a suspected rebel-controlled village, reportedly
killing two ethnic Albanian fighters and capturing 34 in a day-long
battle.
	   Serb authorities said they raided the village of Glodjane in
search of gunmen who slaughtered six young Serbs, including four
teen-agers, on Monday in a bar in Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
west of Pristina.

 &UR; Canucks 2, Avalanche 1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In Vancouver, British Columbia, Adrian Aucoin scored a
power-play goal with 2:15 left in regulation as Vancouver beat
Colorado.
	   Aucoin's shot from the left circle banked in off Colorado
defenseman Greg De Vries' skate and into the open side as the
Canucks beat the Avalanche for the first time in their last 10
visits to Vancouver. Prior to Thursday, Colorado had never lost a
regular season game at General Motors Place, running up an 8-0-1
streak.
	   The Avalanche lost for only the second time in their last eight
games (5-2-1). Along with missing leading scorer Peter Forsberg,
who pulled himself out of the lineup prior to the game because of a
groin injury, the Avalanche lost the services of Avalanche captain
Joe Sakic, who suffered a shoulder injury in the third period.
 &UR; Islanders 5, Kings 4, OT
	   In Inglewood, California, Ted Donato had two goals and Bryan
Berard scored exactly two minutes into overtime as the New York
Islanders rallied from behind three times to beat the Los Angeles
Kings.
	   Barry Richter scored less than 2{ minutes into the third period
to tie the score for the third time. Eric Brewer also scored for
the Islanders, who won their second in a row after seven straight
losses.
	   Right wing Pavel Rosa scored twice in his NHL debut, but could
not prevent the Kings' 13th loss in 16 games. Luc Robitaille had a
power-play goal and set up a goal by Steve Duchesne that ended a
20-game dry spell by the Kings' defenseman.
 &UR; Sharks 3, Predators 1
	   In San Jose, California, Stephane Matteau and Marco Sturm scored
first-period goals, leading San Jose over Nashville.
	   Sharks goaltender Mike Vernon stopped 30 of 31 Nashville shots.
	   San Jose is 2-5-2 in its last nine games. Nashville is 1-5-2 in
its last eight and has lost five consecutive road games.

Dollar slips, Japanese stocks finish higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar slipped against the yen Friday as
investor attention shifted to the possible impeachment of U.S.
President Bill Clinton. Tokyo stock prices finished higher.
	   At mid-afternoon, the dollar bought 116.06 yen, down 0.04 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.13 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 64.30
points, or 0.48 percent, closing the week at 14,194.29. On
Thursday, the average closed up 30.69 points, or 0.22 percent.
	   The dollar's value was initially boosted on news that South
Korean navy ships sank a North Korean spy submarine early Friday,
but the U.S. currency later retreated amid concerns over President
Clinton's possible impeachment, traders said.
	   After a nearly six-hour pursuit, South Korean navy ships sank
the 10-ton sub in seas off South Korea's southern shore just before
dawn.
	   The news caused safe-haven dollar buying earlier in the session,
just as reports of the bombing of Iraq had one day earlier. But as
with the Iraq situation, traders came to the conclusion the
submarine infiltration was not likely to escalate.
	   Overseas investors, led by U.S. banks, sold the dollar off its
intraday high of 116.58 yen to adjust their dollar positions ahead
of key developments in Clinton's impeachment proceedings, traders
said.
	   The House of Representatives was scheduled to debate an
impeachment motion later Friday and cast votes on it Saturday.
	   ``A lot depends on the results of the voting, but basically even
if worst comes to worst for Clinton, the scale of the dollar's
decline should be limited,'' said Minoru Matsuda, vice president of
foreign exchange at Citibank in Tokyo.
	   Traders expressed confidence that the cruise missile strikes
against Iraqi military installations would end by the start of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Saturday.
	   On the stock market, share prices were slightly lower at one
point in the morning, but later moved into positive territory by
shrugging off concerns about the missile attacks on Iraq.
	   Traders said local newspaper reports that Haseko Corp., a major
condominium builder, has decided to ask its creditor banks to
forgive debts owed by the company helped buoy market sentiment.
	   Many Japanese general contractors are reportedly burdened with
bad debts left over following the collapse of the nation's
easy-credit ``bubble'' economy of the late 1980s.
	   An estimated 303 million shares changed hands on the exchange's
first section, down from Thursday's 355 million shares. Advances
outnumbered declines 656 to 463, with 167 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,101.70
points. The TOPIX fell 8.17 points, or 0.75 percent, the day
before.
	   Also supporting the Tokyo stock market was an 85.22-point gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average to 8,875.82 at Thursday's
close, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.295 percent from Thursday's close of
1.335 percent, driving its price up to 104.26 yen from 103.91 yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar slipped against the yen Friday as

President Bill Clinton. Tokyo stock prices finished higher.
	   At mid-afternoon, the dollar bought 116.06 yen, down 0.04 yen

shrugging off concerns about the missile attacks on Iraq.
	   Traders said local newspaper reports that Haseko Corp., a major
condominium builder, has decided to ask its creditor banks to
forgive debts owed by the company helped buoy market sentiment.
	   Many Japanese general contractors are reportedly burdened with
bad debts left over following the collapse of the nation's
easy-credit ``bubble'' economy of the late 1980s.
	   An estimated 303 million shares changed hands on the exchange's
first section, down from Thursday's 355 million shares. Advances
outnumbered declines 656 to 463, with 167 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,101.70
points. The TOPIX fell 8.17 points, or 0.75 percent, the day
before.
	   Also supporting the Tokyo stock market was an 85.22-point gain
in the Dow Jones industrial average to 8,875.82 at Thursday's
close, traders said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.295 percent from Thursday's close of
1.335 percent, driving its price up to 104.26 yen from 103.91 yen.

Chief inspector defends report on Iraq and says he won't quit

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler defended his report that Iraq did not fully cooperate with
U.N. monitors and said he had no intention of quitting.
	   Butler's report, which triggered U.S. and British airstrikes
Wednesday, concluded that Iraq had placed new obstacles on the work
of inspectors charged with verifying the destruction of Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Speaking hours after Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Moscow would insist on his dismissal, Butler was asked if he would
quit. ``Absolutely not,'' he shot back.
	   Butler also defended the veracity of his report against charges
it was one-sided.
	   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective, is utterly
false,'' he said.
	   Butler dismissed as ``utterly wrong'' any suggestion that the
report's release Tuesday night was timed to suit the U.S.
government and help President Bill Clinton deflect attention from
impeachment proceedings.
	   In the past month, the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, has tested the promise Iraq made on Nov. 14,
under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, to resume full
cooperation with UNSCOM. Butler's report concluded Iraq had fallen
short of compliance.
	   During a divisive U.N. Security Council meeting Wednesday night,
China's U.N. Ambassador Qin Huasun said Butler had played ``a
dishonorable role in this crisis'' and called the report
``unfounded and evasive of the facts.''
	   Russia's U.N. envoy, Sergey Lavrov, who called the formal
council meeting, said the report's conclusion was biased and he
echoed Iraq's contention that Butler had cited only five incidents
in 300 inspection operations.
	   Russia, China, Iraq and Kenya called for a cease-fire at
Wednesday night's council meeting but no action was taken because
of divisions among the 15 members.
	   Russia called another round of council consultations on Thursday
and circulated a non-binding draft presidential statement calling
for an immediate cessation of hostilities. However, given the
divisions on the council, the Russian draft has little chance of
being approved.
	   Lavrov said the statement was ``an attempt to start the
discussion in the council on how we can bring the situation back
into political and diplomatic efforts.''
	   The council scheduled another meeting on Iraq for Friday.
	   Butler said he expected the Security Council in the days and
weeks ahead to again tell Iraq to cooperate with UNSCOM.
	   ``We would go back and start our work tomorrow if they would
give us genuine cooperation,'' he said.
	   Butler was asked why UNSCOM's conclusions were in sharp contrast
to the report of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
concluded that Baghdad had cooperated with nuclear inspectors.
	   He said the IAEA's job was different because it was dealing with
a nuclear weapons program ``that was in the making'' _ which is
vastly different from UNSCOM's work with already completed
missiles, chemical and biological weapons.
	   Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the United States
claims to be after Iraq's weapons, but he said Washington's real
aim is to topple Saddam Hussein.
	   ``I don't think it's a question of those weapons,'' Hamdoon said
on CNN's ``Larry King Live''. ``They know for sure that there is no
more such weapons in the whole country of Iraq.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and sets the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   But as a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday had set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   Early Friday, about 100 U.N. humanitarian workers were evacuated
by bus to the Jordanian capital Amman, a U.N. official told The
Associated Press. U.N. executives had hoped to keep the workers _
who monitor food aid for Iraqis _ in place, but apparently reversed
the decision after the Thursday night bombardment.
	   CNN said that U.N. workers spent most of the night huddled under
a staircase listening to explosions and shattering glass from U.S.
strikes near their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Some 30 U.N. humanitarian workers deemed ``essential'' remained
in Baghdad. The U.N. official spoke on condition of anonymity.

Russian recalls its ambassador to Britain over Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has recalled its ambassador to Britain for
urgent consultations over the American and British attacks on Iraq,
the Foreign Ministry announced Friday.
	   The move came after the Russian ambassador to Washington was
recalled to Moscow on Thursday for urgent consultations for the
same reason.
	   A terse Foreign Ministry statement said Ambassador Yuri Fokin
would return from London to Moscow as soon as possible. It gave no
further details.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and other Russian political leaders have
denounced the American and British attacks and demanded their
immediate halt. Russia, a traditional ally of Iraq, insists the
military attacks will wreck any chances of a peaceful solution.
	   Washington has said the attacks will continue despite Russian
protests.

EU fisheries ministers agree on catch quotas for 1999, after 17
</HEADLINE>
hours of negotiations &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union fisheries ministers on
Friday agreed on new catch quotas for 1999 following all-night
negotiations, carefully walking a tightrope between the demands of
their fishermen and the need to protect dwindling stocks.
	   Many of the EU's executive Commission demands for sizable cuts
in the quotas to protect stocks were taken into account but the
powerful fisheries nations were also able to soften the blow for
their fishermen in several sectors.
	   The brokering between the conservation and economic issues
produced ``a reasonable and responsible balance,'' said Lord Sewel,
Scottish Office minister.
	   The 15 fisheries ministers reached unanimous agreement on about
100 different quotas for various types of fish in waters around the
EU. Only Italy abstained when ministers voted early Friday.
	   Overall, no catch decreased by more than 40 percent and most
were well within that limit. Some catches of saithe were cut by 31
percent, North Sea whiting by 27 percent, and North Sea haddock by
23 percent.
	   Fishermen though also realized some cuts were tough but
necessary. ``This was a successful exercise, against a background
of very extreme proposals,'' Barrie Deas, chief executive of the
National Federation of Fishermen's Organizations, said.
	   ``The problem is to balance the long-term sustainability of the
stocks with the short-term viability of the fishing industry,'' he
added.
	   The ministers also dealt with the controversial issue of setting
new quotas for bluefin tuna, one of the world's most expensive
fishes, in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. The bluefin is a
delicacy for exclusive sushi tables in Japan and represents some
dlrs 250 million in trade, considering one ton easily sells at dlrs
15,000.
	   Greece and Italy had overfished their share of bluefin tuna in
1997 but wanted to share the penalty burden with the other nations
fishing for bluefin.
	   France, Spain and Portugal, the other fleets involved, refused
to go beyond a compromise proposal by the EU commission and the new
quotas had to be approved by a qualified majority vote, with Italy
and Greece voting against.
	   Because of years of overfishing, the fish has become ever rarer,
and the 15-nation EU has seen its catch quota decline to 20,165
tons in 1999 compared to 28,108 tons this year. In addition, the
international ICCAT organization that sets the tuna quotas, had
penalized the EU an additional 4,029 tons for the overfishing in
1997.
	   Under the new quota, Greece lost 54 percent of its quota, even
though its overfishing exceeded that. Italy, which overfished its
quota by about 30 percent lost 16 percent, EU officials said.
France on the other hand obtained a sizable increase of almost 20
percent to become the EU's biggest bluefin catcher ahead of Spain,
which had to accept a small decrease in its quota.

Human rights, legal groups criticize Australian refugee system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A trio of legal and human rights
organizations on Friday called for a Parliamentary inquiry into the
Australian government's refugee policy.
	   In a joint call, the Law Council of Australia, Amnesty
International and the International Commission of Jurists
petitioned Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock to
instigate a probe.
	   But Ruddock rebuffed the request, saying that Australia's
refugee system was recognized as being among the fairest in the
world.
	   The three organizations said there was growing concern about
government moves to limit judicial review of decisions made by the
Refugee Review Tribunal.
	   An apparent lack of government-funded legal representation for
those seeking asylum in Australia also drew criticism from the
groups.
	   ``This is a totally unacceptable situation, particularly where a
refugee denied asylum may be deported to face persecution, torture
or death,'' said Fabian Dixon, president of the Law Council.
	   Amnesty International spokesman Des Hogan said the submission
was the result of ongoing concern about the government's treatment
of refugees. He cited the recent case of a Somali asylum-seeker who
was granted a last-minute stay of deportation only after
intervention by Amnesty and the United Nations.
	   Jurists spokesman Steve Mark said access to the courts was a
human right recognized around the world and was a central pillar of
the rule of law.
	   A spokesman for Ruddock, however, said Australia had one of the
most credible and fair refugee systems in the world.

penalized the EU an additional 4,029 tons for the overfishing in
1997.

China beats Philippine pros, South Korea trounces Kazakstan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A team of professionals from the
basketball-mad Philippines fell short Friday in efforts to take
away China's Asian Games title, losing 82-73 in a semifinal.
	   China will play South Korea, a 101-64 winner over Kazakstan, in
the gold medal game Saturday. The Philippines will play Kazakstan
for the bronze.
	   A Chinese gold medal would tie the Philippines' total of four
from Asian Games basketball.
	   ``We didn't shoot the ball that well. Our three-pointers just
weren't sinking,'' said Tim Cone, coach of the Philippine team that
was put together from its professional league in an all-out effort
to get back to the top of Asian basketball.
	   Just 3 of 14 went in, and the Philippines' field goal percentage
was just 36 percent overall, while China shot 42 percent.
	   ``The bottom line is there's a lot of people crying in that
locker room there,'' Cone said.
	   China, which led 44-32 at the half, had three men scoring in
double figures. Forward Sun Jun scored 15, shooting 50 percent from
the floor.
	   Under pressure, the Philippines allowed the Chinese 28 free
throws, and they made 24. The Filipinos were 16 of 22 from the
line.
	   Johnny Abarriento scored 13, Alvin-Vergara Patrimonio 12 and
Kenneth Duremdes 10 for the Philippines, which had a large number
of upset supporters in the crowd.
	   The Filipinos were able to hold down scoring by Chinese centers
Gong Xiaobin and Wang Zhizhi, but Sun and Liu Yudong did the
damage. Liu scored 13.
	   For South Korea, Hyun Joo-yup scored 23 points, and four other
players also were in double figures as the Koreans shot 60 percent
from the floor. They led 49-29 at halftime.
	   Igor yanin led Kazakstan with 9.

Fog continues to disrupt third Test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Dense fog continued to spoil the
third and decisive cricket Test between Pakistan and Zimbabwe in
Faisalabad Friday.
	   Misty conditions and thick fog canceled play on the first day
Thursday and seemed likely to cancel the second day. Although
another check will be made after lunch, umpires are not optimistic.
	   ``It's quite foggy out there and I doubt if there will be any
play today,'' said Pakistan umpire Salim Badar.
	   Zimbabwe led the three-match series 1-0 after winning the first
Test by seven wickets. The second Test was also marred by dense fog
in Lahore with poor visibility resulting in the loss of 13 hours of
play and a draw.

Research ship freed from ice, heads to Australia for repairs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Antarctic research ship
Aurora Australia, which broke down in heavy ice more than two weeks
ago, returned to clear waters Friday and began a homeward trip
under its own power.
	   Australian Antarctic Division director Tony Press said the ship
would rendezvous with the South African oceangoing tug John Ross
later Friday and then head for the Australian port of Fremantle for
repairs.
	   The Aurora was stranded about 75 nautical miles off the
Australian Antarctic station known as Davis after its propeller
broke down.
	   The Japanese Antarctic vessel Shirase helped it out of the ice,
first breaking a clear passage and then towing the ship.
	   At one point a tow cable broke, but there were no serious
difficulties, Press said.
	   Temporary repairs on the propeller seemed to be working and its
engineers would decide later whether the John Ross would tow or
escort it to Fremantle, where it is due early in January, he said.

China calls for end to U.S., British attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin has sent a personal
message to U.S. President Bill Clinton urging an end to U.S. and
British air strikes on Iraq, China's state media reported Friday.
	   Jiang argued that diplomacy still could convince Iraq to resume
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors, the Communist Party
newspaper People's Daily and other state-run news media reported.
	   Jiang was responding Thursday to a message from Clinton
explaining the U.S. position.
	   The United States wants Iraq to prove it has dismantled nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons programs _ a condition accepted by
Iraq at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, on Thursday
accused the United States of ignoring the will of the U.N. Security
Council and violating principles of international law when it
unilaterally began the attacks.
	   China also accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, of withholding information showing Iraqi progress in a
report he gave to the Security Council. Butler has strongly denied
such accusations.
	   The state-run China Daily newspaper, in a commentary titled
``Real Threat,'' argued: ``A world run by big powers acting outside
the framework of international relations has subjected itself to a
clear threat of power politics.''

Report: China finds victims of Japanese germ warfare experiments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Remains of 30 people killed by Japanese
germ warfare experiments in occupied China have been unearthed in
the central Chinese city of Nanjing, state media said Friday.
	   The remains were found in a former basement laboratory by
construction workers preparing to put up an office building on a
major street, the People's Daily newspaper reported.
	   Excavated from the site were 29 severed heads and one
dismembered body, the newspaper said.
	   Thousands of Chinese civilians, Soviet prisoners of war and
others were killed during wartime Japanese experiments of
biological and chemical weapons. Much of the research was conducted
in northeastern China, but other sites have been found elsewhere in
the country.
	   The Nanjing laboratory was used by Unit 1644 of the Japanese
army, which specialized in producing cholera, typhoid and plague,
the People's Daily said.
	   A three-month autopsy on the remains, which were found in
August, confirmed they were victims of bacteria experiments by Unit
1644, the newspaper said. It did not say whether there was any
indication of the victims' sex or nationality.
	   The announcement came less than a week after annual memorial
services to mark the capture of Nanjing on Dec. 13, 1937, by
Japanese troops.
	   The invading soldiers went on a weeks-long rampage that killed
as many as 300,000 people and became known as the ``Rape of
Nanjing'' or the ``Nanjing Massacre.''
	   The most notorious germ warfare group of the former Imperial
Japanese Army, Unit 731, operated in Harbin in northeastern China.
	   Earlier this year, one of its elderly veterans was barred from
the United States as a war criminal when he tried to attend a
conference on Unit 731 and the Nanjing atrocities.

Cabinet formed by Hoss wins vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The ``salvation and change'' Cabinet put
together by Lebanon's new prime minister, Salim Hoss, won a vote of
confidence from the Parliament after a two-day debate.
	   Eighty-five legislators voted late Thursday for the new
government and 31 abstained. Twelve Parliament members were absent.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist who served as prime minister
four times in the past, announced his 16-member Cabinet on Dec.4.
Hoss was named to the post after Rafik Hariri, the previous
premier, declined reappointment by Lebanon's new president, Emile
Lahoud.
	   In his policy statement to the Parliament, Hoss said the
priorities of his government would be economic reform, monetary
stability and fighting corruption in the administration.
	   He also vowed to cut government spending in order to reduce
budget deficits and ``halt financial drain caused by past
policies.''
	   Hariri, who had been prime minister since 1992, is a member of
Parliament and a billionaire businessman. He is credited with
restoring economic confidence and attracting investment to Lebanon
as it rebuilt from its devastating 1975-90 civil war.
	   He was absent from the late-night voting.
	   Hariri attended the opening session on Wednesday but later
announced he would boycott further deliberations. He charged that
most of the speakers used the debate to attack his policies rather
than to discuss the proposals put forward by Hoss.

Pipe bomb damages synagogue in Cape Town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A pipe bomb early Friday exploded
at a synagogue here and caused some damage, but no injuries were
reported.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   Police said they had not ruled out that the attack was in
connection with the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq.
	   ``We were expecting things like that to happen, on American and
British embassies, and buildings and things,'' said Superintendant
Nina Kirsten of the Cape Town police.
	   The bomb was thrown at the entrance to the synagogue in the
well-off suburb of Wynberg during the night. The explosion smashed
windows and damaged doors, causing about 30,000 rand (dlrs 5,000)
in damage, Kirsten said.
	   Police have blamed previous pipe bomb attacks aimed at
businesses, police buildings and the homes of Muslim clerics on an
Islamic vigilante group called PAGAD, or People Against Gangsterism
and Drugs.

Paul McCartney goes on the internet to talk direct to his fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Giving his first ever cyber interview, Sir Paul
McCartney chatted with fans, gave away his specialty mashed potato
recipe and talked about his late wife, Linda.
	   The session, held Thursday night to promote Mrs. McCartney's
posthumous album ''White Prairie,'' lasted 80 minutes.
	   McCartney told fans he had not yet decided if he would perform
in a string of concerts organized by Chrissie Hynde of the
Pretenders as a tribute to his wife, who died of breast cancer in
April.
	   ''If I can get it together I will appear,'' he said, answering a
question from Joseph Greco of Texas. ''But I am not sure I can do
it emotionally at all, to tell you the truth.''
	   When asked by a fan in Mexico if he'd ever tour again, the
former Beatle said, ''Yes, I think I might. I like touring.
Normally what happens is that I wait until the urge grabs me.''
	   McCartney also showed an animated video of Mrs. McCartney's
songs and some photographs and paintings.

SilkAir crash investigators consider desperate ``black box''
</HEADLINE>
measure
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 7th-8th grafs with more comments from investigator;
EDITS thruout.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Investigators of last year's crash of a SilkAir
jetliner have begun considering a desperate measure to gain clues
about the cause of the mysterious tragedy _ a test that would
destroy the flight data recording tape, Singapore government
television reported Friday.
	   The failure of the two ``black boxes'' to record the final five
minutes of cockpit conversation and airplane activity before the
Boeing 737-300 crashed into a Sumatran jungle river is one of the
biggest puzzles of the Dec. 19, 1997 crash.
	   State-run television reported that Oetarjo Diran, the chief
Indonesian investigator, was considering putting the flight data
recorder tape through a final test in Los Angeles.
	   ``The important question we would like to know is, why did the
data recorders quit?'' Diran said in the television report, saying
the recorders had been tested in Washington and in Paris in
attempts to bring out their hidden secrets.
	   Another test would be final because any new data could only be
obtained by peeling off a protective coating, a move which would
destroy the tape, the television report said.
	   Family members of the victims told The Associated Press that the
idea had been mentioned months ago in a closed meeting.
	   Diran also indicated investigators have not ruled out the
possibility of a suicide by the pilot of the plane, 41-year-old
Capt. Tsu Way Ming.
	   ``We are not assuming a priori that it isn't suicide,'' Diran
said. ``But we are looking in what way the human performance or the
human character in the air is contributing to the accident.''
	   On Friday, Diran met privately in Singapore with relatives of
some of the 104 dead passengers and crew members. SilkAir plans to
fly 300 Indonesian and Singaporean relatives to Palembang in
Indonesia for a memorial service Saturday.
	   Many of the relatives have expressed anger over the slow
progress in finding the cause of the crash and over the offers of
compensation from the airline, a subsidiary of national carrier
Singapore Airlines.
	   Suggesting the possibility of further negotiations on
compensation offers, SilkAir general manager Mak Swee Wah told a
Singapore newspaper Friday, ``We are not hard-hearted. ... We are
not hiding behind contracts and conventions. We are listening.''
	   So far, the airline has offered no more than the dlrs 75,000
called for in the Warsaw Convention for victims of of air crashes,
and as little as dlrs 20,000 for some, depending on their age and
income level, according to local news reports.
	   The television report said members of Diran's team were unable
to say when the outcome of the investigation would be available.
``The total damage of the aircraft, and the severe lack of clues
makes this an extremely complex investigation,'' the report quoted
the investigators as saying.
	   The investigators have drawn up 12 scenarios of what would have
happened given various combinations of malfunctions as the plane
traveled at 35,000 feet from Jakarta to Singapore, the report said.
	   Those interviewed in government television reports reiterated
the results of a previous preliminary finding, in which they ruled
out weather, an act of terrorism, hazardous materials, maintenance
or repair as contributing to the crash.
	   The team is now looking closely at engineering factors, human
factors and aircraft structure, the report said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 200 Indonesian students on
Friday staged an anti-government rally as police and troops blocked
roads near the presidential palace and other strategic sites in the
wake of a clash between protesters and security officers.
	   Extra police were also deployed near the U.S. Embassy amid fears
of demonstrations in the predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian
country against the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq.
	   Twenty activists from an Islamic student group rallied against
the bombing outside the Jakarta headquarters of the United Nations.
	   Separately, students gathered for a pro-democracy protest at a
campus of the state-run University of Indonesia and said they
planned to march to Parliament. Some of them carried bamboo staves.
	   On Thursday, at least 4,000 students singing ``revolution until
we die'' attempted to storm the Parliament building. Hundreds were
injured when police and soldiers stopped them with plastic bullets,
batons and tear gas.
	   The huge street battle came just hours after Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie warned that the protests could lead to the
breakup of the sprawling nation, the world's fourth most populous
country.
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic turmoil in
decades and has been plagued by political uncertainty as well.
Habibie took over in May from authoritarian President Suharto, who
was dislodged by riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Yet students have kept up their protests since Suharto's ouster,
demanding that Habibie force the powerful military out of politics
and put his predecessor and onetime mentor on trial for corruption.
	   Nine students were killed Nov. 13 in clashes with security
forces during a government assembly that met to plan an overhaul of
Suharto's rigid political system. Students said the reforms did not
go far enough.
	   Habibie has allowed political parties to form and has scheduled
Parliamentary elections next year. He also has ordered an
investigation into Suharto's wealth.

Japanese ambassador gives details of aid to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan's ambassador to Malaysia
gave details Friday of a dlrs 2 billion financial aid program for
the recession-hit Southeast Asian country.
	   Ambassador Issei Nomura said the aid will comprise a dlrs 1
billion yen-denominated loan as part of its Official Development
Assistance program, as well as a dlrs 500 million loan from the
Japanese Export-Import Bank.
	   The package will also include dlrs 560 million in the form of
guarantees on the bulk of euroyen notes which Malaysia is offering,
Nomura said.
	   The Japanese aid was announced last week in Tokyo as part of a
larger package for struggling Asian economies, but details were
revealed for the first time by Nomura.
	   Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said his government wouldn't approach any other governments
for financial aid. But he added the government may consider
borrowing from international commercial banks.
	   Nomura pointed out that the Malaysian loan package is separate
from the Miyazawa aid plan for struggling East Asian economies
announced earlier this year by Japan's finance minister. Malaysia
has applied for a portion of the dlrs 30 billion being made
available under the Miyazawa plan, but that request is still being
assessed, Nomura said.
	   ``The Malaysian side has recently proposed a list of projects
under the initiative, which is now under consideration by the
Japanese government,'' the ambassador said.
	   He added that there was no fixed allocation for Malaysia under
the Miyazawa plan.
	   However, Nomura said Malaysia has the option to apply for a
special yen loan facility. The maximum amount available would be
approximately dlrs 5 billion.
	   These funds, like the cash freed up under the Official
Development Assistance loan, will largely be used in the
development of infrastructure. But there's one caveat to the aid
program _ any developments must create business for Japanese
companies.

Cabinet formed by Hoss wins vote of confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The ``salvation and change'' Cabinet put
together by Lebanon's new prime minister, Salim Hoss, won a vote of
confidence from the Parliament after a two-day debate.
	   Eighty-five legislators voted late Thursday for the new
government and 31 abstained. Twelve Parliament members were absent.
	   Hoss, a U.S.-educated economist who served as prime minister
four times in the past, announced his 16-member Cabinet on Dec.4.
Hoss was named to the post after Rafik Hariri, the previous
premier, declined reappointment by Lebanon's new president, Emile
Lahoud.
	   In his policy statement to the Parliament, Hoss said the
priorities of his government would be economic reform, monetary
stability and fighting corruption in the administration.
	   He also vowed to cut government spending in order to reduce
budget deficits and ``halt financial drain caused by past
policies.''

Fog disrupts flights, train services in New Delhi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Heavy fog across north India for the
third day Friday disrupted flights, slowed trains and forced car
drivers to be cautious.
	   Domestic and international airlines grounded their aircraft at
the capital's main airport until noon. Flights from other airports
in northern India also were hit, officials at the New Delhi airport
said.
	   The fog will thin out over the next two days, said S.C. Gupta, a
meterologist at the government's weather department. He said foggy
conditions often occur in December in northern India.
	   Train drivers slowed down because of poor visibility. Last
month, at least three railroad accidents, involving the death of
some 200 people, occurred during fog.
	   In New Delhi, car and bus drivers crawled on the crowded streets
in the morning. A few minor collisions were reported, police said.

China sweeps rowing, spoils Philippine campaign in basketball
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China spoiled the Philippines' all-out
campaign for the Asian Games basketball gold medal Friday, and
spoiled everybody's chances in rowing.
	   Defending champion China and the Philippines each have three
gold medals from past Asian Games basketball tournaments, and the
Philippines had hoped to climb back on top by putting together a
special team from its professional league.
	   Cold shooting hurt, however, and China advanced to a gold medal
game against South Korea by beating the Filipinos 82-73 in a
semifinal. The Koreans trounced Kazakstan 101-64. The losers will
play for the bronze medal.
	   ``The bottom line is there's a lot of people crying in that
locker room there,'' said Tim Cone, coach of the Philippine team.
	   In rowing, China swept all five of the day's golds, and coach
Gao Hongyin said, ``Now we are on the right track to clean sweep
the Asiad rowing gold medals for the third time.''
	   In the last games in 1994, China won 11 of 12 rowing golds. They
had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   The Chinese were stung by failures at the rowing World
Championships in September, and called a special training camp
before the Asian Games. Gao said the rowers had advice in training
from track coach Ma Junren, whose ``Ma's army'' of women distance
runners set world records in the early 1990s.
	   Because of a dispute with national officials, none of Ma's
runners is in the Asian Games, but Ma went to the rowers' training
camp.
	   In Friday's races, Chinese rowers won by margins ranging from
2.5 to more than 11 seconds.
	   Singles sculls winner Cai Yukun had to come from behind against
Indonesia's Lasmin, but won by nearly five seconds.
	   The lightweight men's pair of Gao Bingrong and Liu Jian had the
closest finish, beating Japan's Kazuaki Mimoto and Daisaku Takeda
by 2.5 seconds _ 6:24.04 to 6:26.55.
	   Six more rowing finals were scheduled Saturday.
	   In early track events, China's Wang Yinghang overtook favorite
Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final 300 meters and won the
men's 50-kilometer walk.
	   Wang collapsed after crossing the finish line in 3 hours, 59
minutes, 26 seconds, a second ahead of Korepanov, who was eighth in
the event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   The Chinese gained still another gold when Li Fang and Chen Li
beat South Koreans Cho Yoon-jeong and Park Sung-hee 6-2, 7-6 (7-2)
in women's doubles tennis.
	   China so far has collected 109 gold medals in these games, which
end Sunday.
	   South Korea, second in the standings, has 60. It gained one
early Friday in men's singles tennis, where Yoon Yong-il beat
Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 in the final.
	   Japan stood third with 48, followed by Kazakstan with 19 and
Thailand and Taiwan with 18 each.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Yoon Yong-il, relying on
a more consistent serve return, beat Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7,
6-4, 6-3, 6-2 Friday for the Asian Games gold men in men's tennis.
	   Yoon set up 14 break points and converted six, while Iwabuchi
managed only three of 10.
	   It was the South Koreans' second tennis gold here, but China
spoiled their bid for a third in the women's doubles, where Li Fang
and Chen Li beat Cho Yoon-jeong and Park Sung-hee 6-2, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Earlier, the Koreans had won the men's team event, also over
Japan.
	   Men's singles bronze medals went to Indians Srinath Prahlad and
Mahesh Bhupathi, the semifinal losers.
	   Japan's Rika Hiraki and Nana Miyagi and China's Yi Jing-qian and
Li Li received the women's doubles bronzes.
	   In Thursday's women's singles final, Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki
beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2.
	   Thai brothers Paradorn and Narathorn Srichaphan won the men's
doubles, and Iwabuchi and Miyagiu won the mixed doubles for Japan.

Dueling protesters rally outside U.S. Consulate in Australia

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Two groups of Australian demonstrators
on Friday traded insults after those against the U.S. and British
attacks on Iraq burned an American flag outside the U.S. Consulate
in Australia.
	   The chants of critics of the attack competed with those of a
pro-United States rally across the street where the Bruce
Springsteen's song ``Born in the USA'' blared from a high-powered
sound system.
	   Both groups, made up of about 100 protesters each, yelled at one
another.
	   The pro-U.S. group accused their rivals of being modern-day
versions of sympathizers with former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
	   The anti-U.S. group shouted back accusations depicting their
opponents as supporters of ``murderers of Jews and Arabs.'' They
were joined by a third group which criticized the Australian
government's support for the bombing.

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ A bomb went off Friday near the state
government's headquarters in insurgency-wracked Assam, killing at
least four people and injuring five, a domestic news agency
reported.
	   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast at
Dispur, capital of the northeastern Indian state where several
insurgencies have raged for two decades.
	   Press Trust of India said the bomb may have been planted in a
vehicle parked near a gas station adjoining the administrative
complex.
	   Guerrillas in Assam have been fighting Indian security forces
for causes ranging from more autonomy to creation of a separate
nation for tribespeople in the region.

Judge allows Cape Town trial of Boesak to continue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Friday dealt a blow to
Allan Boesak, denying a motion to dismiss all the embezzlement
charges against the former top African National Congress official.
	   Judge John Foxcroft dismissed five of the 32 counts but ordered
the trial to continue Feb. 8 on the rest of the charges. Boesak is
accused of stealing more than 1 million rand (dlrs 300,000 at the
time) from an anti-apartheid organization he headed.
	   Boesak's lawyers had asked Foxcroft to throw out the entire
case, saying it had collapsed after a key witness recanted.
	   Last month, Boesak's former bookkeeper Freddie Steenkamp
admitted he lied under oath due to a personal grudge when he
testified against his ex-boss. Steenkamp, already serving six years
in jail, was the state's key witness.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak is accused of embezzling the money from the
Foundation for Peace and Justice charity.
	   Donations came from pop singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other individuals and
groups.
	   Foxcroft ruled that there was not enough evidence to support the
counts involving a donation by the Coca-Cola Foundation, a
children's charity and three by the Church of Norway. But he said
potential proof remained for the other 27 counts.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

7-year-old girl freed after two days of captivity in southern
</HEADLINE>
Russia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police at a border checkpoint in southern Russia
freed a 7-year-old girl who had been kidnapped earlier in the week,
a news report said Friday.
	   Border guards found the girl on a bus that was crossing from
Dagestan to the breakaway republic of Chechnya on Thursday night,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The bus driver said the girl was his daughter, but police in the
town of Khasavyurt, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) south of
Moscow, noticed that she matched descriptions of a girl who went
missing on Wednesday. They arrested the driver and one other
person, who was unidentified in the report.
	   Also Thursday, police in Khasavyurt freed a Russian man who was
kidnapped in Moscow and driven under guard to the border of
Chechnya, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Police freed the man, whose name was not released, when they
stopped the car he was in as it approached a checkpoint, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   The kidnapped man told police he had been forced into his own
car near a Moscow metro station on Dec. 2 by two Chechens and was
told to drive to Chechnya.
	   Russia's Caucusus region has been plagued by crime for years,
much of it emanating from Chechnya. Kidnapping for ransom has
become a booming business since the republic fought a 1994-96
independence war with Russia.

Stepping up warning, defense minister warns Iraq not to attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister warned Friday.
	   On the first day of the U.S. bombings of Iraq, Israeli leaders
were much more low key, saying only they reserved the right to
defend the country in the event of an Iraqi attack.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told Israel radio there has
been no change in the military's assessment that chances of an
Iraqi missile attack on Israel are slim.

operation achieve its goals, but that Israel has ``no interest,
directly or indirectly,'' in taking part in the fighting.

Mordechai told the radio.

had the ability now.
	   Mordechai said American-made Patriot anti-missile batteries have
been deployed as a precaution. He said the plan was to deploy the
batteries as soon as there was an American strike against Iraq. He
said more American equipment is on the way here.
	   The Israeli military recommended that Israelis check their gas
masks, renew outdated models, stock up on plastic sheeting and tape
to seal off a room in their houses, if necessary. In 1991, Israelis
spent many hours in sealed rooms, wearing gas masks, during the
Iraqi missile attacks.
	   About 25,000 Israelis have traded in their old gas masks for new
ones after the army opened 65 distribution centers around the
country Thursday, the army said.
	   Protective kits distributed to Israeli citizens include gas
masks, automatic atropine needle injectors to counter nerve gas and
powder to treat chemical burns. There are special tents for infants
and gas masks with plastic extensions for men with beards.

Stepping up warning, defense minister warns Iraq not to attack

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister warned Friday.
	   On the first day of the U.S. bombings of Iraq, Israeli leaders
were much more low key, saying only they reserved the right to
defend the country in the event of an Iraqi attack.
	   Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told Israel radio there has
been no change in the military's assessment that chances of an
Iraqi missile attack on Israel are slim.

Ito, Darsha win 200 sprints

 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito won his third sprint
gold medal of the Asian Games with an effortless 200-meter victory
Friday while Sri Lanka's Damayanthi Darsha secured a double.
	   Ito, who outclassed the field in the 100-meter event and clocked
a 10.00 time in the semifinal, was again much too good for his
Asian rivals in the 200.
	   He was well clear at the bend and had the race to himself down
the stretch, finishing in 20.25 seconds, outside his Asian record
of 20.16.
	   Han Chaoming of China was a distant second in 20.75 while Sugath
Tillekeratne of Sri Lanka was third in 20.83.
	   After Ito's joyous celebrations of the 100 and 4x100 triumphs,
he seemed low key Friday.
	   Darsha showed much more emotion after making a great late surge
to beat Asian record holder and games 100 champion Li Xuemei of
China. The pair got away together at the start but Li had a slender
edge going through the bend. Li held her advantage to the 180-meter
mark before Darsha fought past to add the victory to her earlier
400 gold medal.
	   Darsha crossed the line in 22.48 seconds, ahead of Li in 22.53
and Yan Jiankui of China in 23.15.
	   China's Wang Yinghang overcame two warnings and overtook
favorite Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final kilometer to
win the men's 50-kilometer walk.
	   Wang collapsed after crossing the finish line in 3 hours, 59
minutes, 26 seconds, a second ahead of Korepanov, who was eighth in
the event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   Sanutkkao Sakchai of Thailand led through the opening 20
kilometers at a furious pace, stretching the field before quitting
at 34 kilometers.
	   Wang said he got the two warnings _ for lifting both feet at the
same time _ because he tried to keep up with the Thai.
	   ``Anyway, I never lost confidence in my strength and stamina,''
said Wang. ``Without these two warnings, I would have won the title
more easily.''
	   Japan's national record holder Fumio Imamura took the bronze.

Spence holds lead after two rounds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COOLUM, Australia (AP) _ Australian Craig Spence followed up his
opening-round 65 with a 67 Friday to hold a four-shot lead midway
through the Coolum Classic pro-am golf tournament.
	   Australasian PGA Tour officials suspended play for the day after
a lightning storm swept across the course, forcing 56 professionals
to abandon their second rounds which they will resume at dawn
Saturday.
	   The 24-year-old Spence has had the Hyatt Regency resort course
at his mercy for two days, attacking the water-laced course with
his driver and sweeping in 12 birdie putts with his favorite
long-handle putter.
	   Spence, who struggled with his technique when using a
conventional putter, has a 12-under total of 132.
	   Australian Paul Moloney, with his second consecutive 68, is at
136, four strokes back. Presidents Cup player Craig Parry shot 68
Friday and fellow Australian Scott Laycock had 69 to be level at
140, eight strokes back of the leader.
	   Stuart Appleby was five under after 11 holes when the storm
struck. He will complete his second round on Saturday. (djp)

Japanese stocks close higher, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with late dollar, closing bond
prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose for a third straight day
on Friday, buoyed by a rise on Wall Street despite the U.S.
military strike on Iraq. The dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed the week at
14,194.29 points, up 67.30 points, or 0.48 percent, from Thursday.
	   The dollar bought 115.20 yen in late afternoon, up 0.90 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
116.13 yen overnight.
	   Investors in Japanese stocks were cheered by the gain in the
U.S. market Thursday amid a second wave of U.S. and British missile
attacks against Iraq, traders said. That signaled receding fears
about possible fallout in the form of damage to the global economy,
they said.
	   ``It's not going to turn into a Middle East war and it's not
going to push up oil prices'' sharply over the long term, said
Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Baring Securities in Tokyo.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.22 points, or 1.0
percent, to 8,875.82, reaching its peak in the last minutes of
trading.
	   Reports that Haseko Corp., a major Japanese condominium builder,
has decided to ask its creditor banks to forgive debts owed by the
company also helped buoy market sentiment, traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section gained 9.44 points, or 0.87 percent, to 1,101.70
points. The TOPIX fell 8.17 points, or 0.75 percent, the day
before.
	   An estimated 303 million shares changed hands on the exchange's
first section, down from Thursday's 355 million shares. Advances
outnumbered declines 656 to 463, with 167 issues unchanged.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar retreated amid
concerns over an impending impeachment vote against U.S. President
Bill Clinton, giving back early gains, traders said.
	   It fell as low as 114.98 yen in late trading.
	   Overseas investors, led by U.S. banks, sold the dollar off its
intraday high of 116.58 yen to adjust their dollar positions ahead
of key developments in Clinton's impeachment proceedings, they
said.
	   ``A lot depends on the results of the voting, but basically even
if worst comes to worst for Clinton, the scale of the dollar's
decline should be limited,'' said Minoru Matsuda, vice president of
foreign exchange at Citibank in Tokyo.
	   The House of Representatives was scheduled to debate an
impeachment motion later Friday and cast votes on it Saturday.
	   The dollar had risen in early trading on word that a South
Korean navy ships sank a 10-ton North Korean sub in seas off South
Korea's southern shore just before dawn.
	   The U.S. currency is often viewed as a safehaven investment
during times of instability.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 1.320 percent from Thursday's close of 1.335
percent, driving its price up to 104.04 yen from 103.91 yen.

Second weightlifter tests positive for doping at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Kuwaiti has become the second
weightlifter to test positive for banned drugs at the Asian Games,
officials said Friday.
	   Jaber Al-Ajmi has been disqualified after testing positive for
nandrolone, a banned anabolic steroid, the Olympic Council of Asia
said in a statement.
	   Al-Ajmi was tested at random Dec. 14 after finishing 10th in the
over 105-kilogram division. He placed 10th with a total lift of 270
kilograms, well behind the 427.5 of winner Kim Tae-hyun of South
Korea.
	   Both samples from his urine test were found positive for
nandrolone, the council said.
	   It said Al-Ajmi still was subject to sanctions to be taken by
the International Weightlifting Federation.
	   Earlier, Jordanian weightlifter Ayed Khawaldeh tested positive
for the banned substance triamterene, the council said. Triamterene
is a diuretic, used to help lose weight, allowing a competitor to
compete in lower weight categories. Diuretics can also be used to
mask the use of other drugs.
	   On Wednesday, Dr. Rueangsak Siriphol, chairman of the games'
medical control subcommittee, said about 800 athletes would have
been tested by the time competition ends Sunday. More than 6,000
athletes from 41 countries are competing in 36 sports.
	   At the last Asian Games four years ago in Hiroshima, Japan, 15
athletes out of 700 tested were found to have used banned
substances, he said.
	   This time, several athletes were thrown off their national teams
before the games began as a result of advance testing. Those
announced publicly included four South Korean gymnasts, a South
Korean swimmer and a Japanese billiards player.

China's premier gets in on the call for cleaner air
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji is pushing Beijing
officials to clean up the heavy air pollution that has turned the
capital of China into one of the world's most polluted cities.
	   Zhu told municipal Communist Party and government leaders they
should strengthen laws and make sure environmental regulations are
enforced, the People's Daily reported Friday on its front page.
	   City officials, who met on Thursday, responded with a 19-point
plan to clean up the brown shroud of smog that settles over the
traffic-clogged, industry-choked city on windless days.
	   But Vice Premier Li Lanqing, in his own companion instructions
to Beijing leaders, noted the capital already has all kinds of laws
and regulations meant to cut pollution.
	   What was lacking was an ``earnest spirit, a system of strict
responsibility and effective legal protection,'' the party
newspaper quoted him as saying.
	   Beijing's air pollution is on average five times worse than the
standard set by the World Health Organization.
	   Much of the problem comes from China's reliance on coal, which
supplies three-fourths of its energy needs. Beijing's new measures
include mandates to use low-sulfur coal, which produces less
pollution, and cleaner burning fuels, such as natural gas.
	   Beijing's heavy traffic is another target. The city's cleanup
plan calls for increasing emissions testing and banning vehicles
that fail to meet standards which are the strictest in the whole
nation.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan's ambassador to Malaysia
gave details Friday of a dlrs 2 billion financial aid program for
the recession-hit Southeast Asian country.
	   Ambassador Issei Nomura said the aid will comprise a dlrs 1
billion yen-denominated loan as part of its Official Development
Assistance program, as well as a dlrs 500 million loan from the
Japanese Export-Import Bank.
	   The package will also include dlrs 560 million in the form of
guarantees on the bulk of euroyen notes which Malaysia is offering,
Nomura said.
	   The Japanese aid was announced last week in Tokyo as part of a
larger package for struggling Asian economies, but details were
revealed for the first time by Nomura.
	   Speaking to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said his government wouldn't approach any other governments
for financial aid. But he added the government may consider
borrowing from international commercial banks.
	   Nomura pointed out that the Malaysian loan package is separate
from the Miyazawa aid plan for struggling East Asian economies
announced earlier this year by Japan's finance minister. Malaysia
has applied for a portion of the dlrs 30 billion being made
available under the Miyazawa plan, but that request is still being
assessed, Nomura said.
	   ``The Malaysian side has recently proposed a list of projects
under the initiative, which is now under consideration by the
Japanese government,'' the ambassador said.
	   He added that there was no fixed allocation for Malaysia under
the Miyazawa plan.
	   However, Nomura said Malaysia has the option to apply for a
special yen loan facility. The maximum amount available would be
approximately dlrs 5 billion.
	   These funds, like the cash freed up under the Official
Development Assistance loan, will largely be used in the
development of infrastructure. But there's one caveat to the aid
program _ any developments must create business for Japanese
companies.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. auto giant General Motors Corp. will increase
its stake in its Japanese affiliate, Isuzu Motors Ltd., to 49
percent from the current 37.5 percent, the companies announced
Friday.
	   GM will expand its interest in Isuzu from March 2, with Isuzu
issuing 232.5 million new shares to the American company for 52.55
billion yen (dlrs 456 million), company officials said at a press
conference in Tokyo.
	   The automakers said they will broaden their cooperation in the
commercial vehicles field by giving Isuzu full responsibility to
develop trucks and other commercial vehicles for the entire GM
group.
	   ``This agreement will further leverage Isuzu's strong position
in the commercial vehicles segment to ensure that Isuzu plays an
even more important role in GM's global commercial vehicle
development and integration process,'' the companies said in a
joint release.
	   Isuzu is one of the world's top truck makers, and produced more
than 100,000 trucks last year.
	   In September, GM announced it would increase its stake in
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. to 10 percent.
	   Friday's announcement comes amid a wave of consolidation in the
global auto industry which has forced carmakers to bolster existing
tie-ups and seek new alliances.
	   Earlier this week, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that
DaimlerChrysler is considering taking a stake in Japan's Nissan
Motor Co.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Moody's Investor Service said Friday it has
lowered financial strength ratings for Singapore's four biggest
banks because of the poor quality of assets the groups hold in
crisis-ridden East Asia.
	   However, Singapore's banking system continues to be the
healthiest in Asia, the ratings agency said.
	   The lowered ratings for financial strength, and also for debt in
some cases, ``reflect asset quality problems arising from the East
Asian financial crisis.''
	   Despite the Singapore economy's many strengths, weaker domestic,
regional and possibly global demand suggest economic growth will
not regain its former pace soon, the agency said.
	   The planned acquisition of Hong Kong's Kwong On Bank Ltd.,
announced Wednesday, should improve average asset quality and
earnings for Development Bank of Singapore, but reduce its capital
ratios in the absence of a new capital issue, Moody's said.
	   The agency said it has confirmed the long-term foreign currency
deposit rating of DBS at AA2, reflecting its majority government
ownership and importance to Singapore as the flagship of the
banking system and its largest bank.
	   However, its bank financial strength rating was downgraded to
C-plus from B-plus, reflecting its increased risk profile.
	   The financial strength rating for Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
Ltd. was cut from B-plus to B; and its long-term foreign currency
deposit rating to AA3 from AA2.
	   Moody's downgraded the financial strength rating for the United
Overseas Bank Ltd. from B-plus to B. It has emerged from the first
phase of the crisis as Singapore's strongest bank, but has
substantial operations in Malaysia, Moody's said.
	   The financial strength rating for Overseas Union Bank was cut
from C-plus to C, reflecting its ``relatively lower capital levels
and its weaker earnings, which raise its vulnerability to the risky
operating environment over the medium term,'' Moody's said.
	   For Singapore's smallest domestic bank, the upcoming merger
between Keppel Bank of Singapore Ltd. and Tat Lee Bank Ltd.,
Moody's said its financial strength rating remained at C. But the
banks' long-term foreign currency deposit ratings were downgraded
to A2 from A1.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A major local bank will join the growing rank
of large Hong Kong companies to freeze salaries during the economic
downturn.
	   Hang Seng Bank, the largest locally incorporated bank, will
freeze salaries next year for its 7,800 staff members to cut costs,
the bank's spokeswoman Jacqueline Kam said.
	   ``It will be a very difficult year because of the economic
situation. The banking community will be deeply affected,'' she
said.
	   The bank operates 156 branches and has a handful of employees
working overseas and in China.
	   Kam said the bank will still give employees a year-end bonus as
planned next week. Last year, employees with good performance
earned an average 5.5-percent pay increase, she said.
	   The news followed a flurry of layoffs, pay cuts and salary
freezes as Hong Kong sinks deeper into recession.
	   The bank's parent, British banking giant HSBC Holdings, also
announced earlier that it will freeze salaries for more than 13,000
employees in Hong Kong at its flagship unit, Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corp.
	   Two blue-chip property developers also reportedly announced pay
freezes for some employees.
	   On Thursday, the government announced that unemployment is at
5.5 percent, the highest since it started keeping such statistics
in 1981.
	   Officials say more people face layoffs or pay cuts ahead of the
Chinese New Year in February, when most companies review their
operations and lay off unneeded staff.
	   The once-robust economy contracted 7 percent in the third
quarter and is forecast to shrink by 5 percent for all of 1998.

Moody's downgrades Singapore banks, cites deteriorated asset
</HEADLINE>
quality

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Moody's Investor Service said Friday it has
lowered financial strength ratings for Singapore's four biggest
banks, citing a deterioration in asset quality due to the Asian
economic crisis.
	   Still, the ratings agency said Singapore's banking system
continues to be the healthiest in the region.
	   The lowered ratings for financial strength, and also for debt in
some cases, ``reflect asset quality problems arising from the East
Asian financial crisis.''
	   Despite the Singapore economy's many strengths, weaker domestic,
regional and possibly global demand suggests economic growth will
not regain its former pace anytime soon, the agency said.
	   The Singapore economy is still vulnerable to external shocks,
particularly from neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia, the agency
said.
	   ``Problem loans will likely accumulate over the medium term,
although at a slower pace,'' Moody's said.
	   Yet it also praised the sound management and oversight of
Singapore's banking industry.
	   ``The country's banks are strictly regulated and conservatively
managed. Most loans are secured and although collateral values have
fallen, the legal system allows for speedy enforcement of claims,''
the agency said.
	   The planned acquisition of Hong Kong's Kwong On Bank Ltd.,
announced Wednesday, should improve average asset quality and
earnings for Development Bank of Singapore, but reduce its capital
ratios in the absence of a new capital issue, Moody's said.
	   The agency said it has confirmed the long-term foreign currency
deposit rating of DBS at AA2, reflecting its majority government
ownership and importance to Singapore as the flagship of the
banking system and its largest bank.
	   However, its bank financial strength rating was downgraded to
C-plus from B-plus, reflecting its increased risk profile.
	   The financial strength rating for Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
Ltd. was cut from B-plus to B; and its long-term foreign currency
deposit rating to AA3 from AA2.
	   ``The downgrade reflects the increased risks to OCBC's
historically strong asset quality caused by its larger regional
exposure,'' said Moody's. Among Singapore banks, OCBC has the
highest regional exposure, 20 percent of its total loans. And 16
percent of its loans are in Malaysia.
	   Moody's downgraded the financial strength rating for the United
Overseas Bank Ltd. from B-plus to B. It has emerged from the first
phase of the crisis as Singapore's strongest bank, but has
substantial operations in Malaysia, Moody's said.
	   The financial strength rating for Overseas Union Bank was cut
from C-plus to C, reflecting its ``relatively lower capital levels
and its weaker earnings, which raise its vulnerability to the risky
operating environment over the medium term,'' Moody's said.
	   For Singapore's smallest domestic bank, the upcoming merger

Moody's said its financial strength rating remained at C. But the
banks' long-term foreign currency deposit ratings were downgraded
to A2 from A1.

Asian Games bring little immediate benefit to Thai airline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's national air carrier has not
reaped much immediate revenue from the Asian Games, but an airline
official said Friday he hoped foreigners who flew in for the event
would return ``once they realize how cheap it is here.''
	   Bhisit Kuslasayanon, an executive vice president of Thai Airways
International, said the regional economic crisis blasted hopes the
dlrs 5 million in sponsorship the airline contributed to the
regional sporting event might boost arrivals from other Asian
nations.
	   But the few thousand fans who did make the trip, ``will go back
and spread the news that things aren't that bad (here)'' and return
to Thailand, Bhisit said.
	   The airline is also hoping to get some return on the money it
spent advertising the Games by continuing its sporting theme. Thai
Airways will be an official carrier for the Sydney Olympics in
2000.
	   By then, ``perhaps more people traveling to Sydney from Europe
will stop here on the way,'' he said.

Muslims, pro-Beijing politicians protest against U.S. in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Local Muslims and members of a pro-Beijing
political party staged separate demonstrations in Hong Kong on
Friday to protest the recent U.S. military air strikes on Iraq.
	   About 200 Muslims chanting ``down with U.S.A.,'' demonstrated in
front of the territory's largest mosque in the tourist and
commercial district of Tsim Sha Tsui.
	   They said the bombing was an affront to Muslims around the
world.
	   Separately, about 20 members of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong, including several lawmakers and city
council members, staged a 15-minute march from a downtown park to
the U.S. Consulate.
	   They accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of bombing innocent
Iraqi civilians to divert attention from the impending impeachment
hearing involving his sexual affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``Against U.S. killing of innocent people,'' the protesters
chanted in front of the consulate under heavy police surveillance.
	   A protester presented Robert Laing, the consulate's information
services director, with a petition along with a pillow which had a
pink piece of paper on top of it displaying the words: ``Bill, no
war for Monica.''
	   ``We never believe the use of force is the best means to solve
international crisis,'' said lawmaker Tsang Yok-sing.
	   Late Thursday night, a man hurled a bottle and a rock into the
consulate compound, police said. No injuries were reported.
	   Security around the consulate was apparently stepped up Friday.

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with new information.
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's relations with the United States and the
West may be seriously damaged by the U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping
out years of progress since the end of the Cold War, top military
leaders warned Friday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders across the political
spectrum have denounced the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq,
demanding an immediate halt to the campaign.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Friday it had recalled Russia's
ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came one
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled to
protest the attacks.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, was to consider
calls Friday for Russia to unilaterally break U.N. sanctions
against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad, a long-time Soviet and
Russian friend.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Russian navy was putting some units on alert because of the
Iraq crisis, but there had been no deployment of ships, officials
said. The move appeared purely symbolic. The Russian military is
not considered an effective force after years of neglect and poor
funding.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday the U.S. and
British strikes ``flagrantly violated the norms of the
international law and openly ignored the world community's efforts
to settle the situation.''
	   Sergeyev, the country's highest-ranking officer, said Moscow's
relations with NATO were threatened. ``How can we talk about
cooperation and partnership with the alliance now, when Russia's
opinion is openly ignored,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin is under opposition pressure to curb ties with the West
at a time when he has lost much of his political clout because of
health problems and his failure to handle the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Communist and other nationalist politicians have been demanding
an end to Moscow's close ties with the West and NATO.
	   While Yeltsin is not likely to alter his pro-Western policy
radically, he is angry about not being informed by Washington about
the attack in advance.
	   The Anglo-American attack on Iraq was criticized by some other
ex-Soviet republics. President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia said
the United States had no justification for the attacks, while
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan called for an end to the campaign.

Second weightlifter tests positive for doping at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Olympic Council of Asia president &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Kuwaiti has become the second
weightlifter to test positive for banned drugs at the Asian Games,
officials said Friday.
	   Jaber Al-Ajmi has been disqualified after testing positive for
nandrolone, a banned anabolic steroid, the Olympic Council of Asia
said in a statement.
	   ``I hope we don't have any more in future,'' said OCA president
Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, who also is Kuwaiti.
	   But, he added, ``I am very happy that there have been only two
cases, not important cases, not involving champions.''
	   At the last games in Hiroshima, Japan, four years ago, ``we had
11 cases with 11 medals, and we had to change all the results,'' he
said.
	   Chinese were the main culprits in 1994. This time, Chinese
officials said, extensive tests were carried out before the games
to make sure the athletes were clean.
	   In all, in 1994, 15 athletes out of 700 tested were found to
have used banned substances, said Dr. Rueangsak Siriphol, chairman
of the games' medical control subcommittee.
	   Al-Ajmi was tested at random Dec. 14 after finishing 10th in the
over 105-kilogram division. He placed 10th with a total lift of 270
kilograms, well behind the 427.5 of winner Kim Tae-hyun of South
Korea.
	   Both samples from his urine test were found positive for
nandrolone, the council said.
	   It said Al-Ajmi still was subject to sanctions to be taken by
the International Weightlifting Federation.
	   Earlier, Jordanian weightlifter Ayed Khawaldeh tested positive
for the banned substance triamterene, the council said. Triamterene
is a diuretic, used to help lose weight, allowing a competitor to
compete in lower weight categories. Diuretics can also be used to
mask the use of other drugs.
	   The sheikh said weightlifters still need more education against
doping.
	   ``I hope the international federation will take serious
action,'' he said. ``This is the second case with weightlifters.
They must try to solve the problem. Otherwise it will be very bad
for the weightlifters.''
	   On Wednesday, Dr. Rueangsak said about 800 athletes would have
been tested by the time competition ends Sunday. More than 6,000
athletes from 41 countries are competing in 36 sports.
	   Several athletes were thrown off their national teams before the
games began as a result of advance testing. Those announced
publicly included four South Korean gymnasts, a South Korean
swimmer and a Japanese billiards player.

Police say 11 dead in Siberian bus explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bus exploded in central Siberia, killing at
least 11 people, police investigating the incident said Friday.
	   Police did not know how many people were on the bus, but had
confirmed there were no survivors, according to the Interfax News
Agency.
	   Investigators speculate that a faulty fuel cylinder in the bus
caused the explosion, which occurred as it passed a gas station in
Kiselyovsk, about 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) east of Moscow.
	   Still, police are still searching for possible evidence of a
criminal act, and offered a 50,000 ruble (dlrs 2,300) reward for
significant evidence, the report said.

Georgian government warns Abkhazians against attack on civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia accused leaders of the breakaway
province of Abkhazia on Friday of planning to use force against
ethnic Georgian civilians and threatened to respond with military
acion.
	   ``The Georgian authorities will not allow another bloody
crackdown on the civilian population,'' the government said in a
statement released to the media.
	   It accused the separatist authorities of concentrating troops
near Georgian-populated villages in Abkhazia's Ghali region in a
bid to drive their residents out of the lush Black Sea province.
	   The Georgian interior and security ministries said they had put
their forces on alert near Abkhazia, ordering them to intervene and
protect civilians in case of Abkhazian attack.
	   Abkhazian authorities have acknowledged sending additional
forces to the Georgian-populated areas, saying the move is intended
to fight ``Georgian terrorist groups.'' Pro-Georgian militants have
often attacked Abkhazian separatist forces in the province.
	   Abkhazia drove out Georgian government troops during its
1992-1993 war for independence and has run its own affairs since
then, balking at return of more than 300,000 ethnic Georgian
refugees.
	   The province has remained restive, plagued by frequent clashes
despite the presence of Russian peacekeepers who have monitored a
truce since 1994.
	   Several tens of thousands refugees have returned to the province
despite Abkhazian resistance, but were forced to flee again in May
when Abkhazian forces attacked their villages. Some came back when
the fighting ended, and about 10,000 ethnic Georgians are now
living in the province.

South Korea bans funding for human cloning research

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea banned funding for
research into human cloning Friday, but admitted it can not stop
``maverick doctors'' from forging ahead with the controversial
procedure.
	   The move came after a medical team at Seoul's Kyonghee
University announced earlier this week that it had successfully
cloned a human embryo in its initial stage of development.
	   The announcement caught the government off guard and sparked
protest rallies. In downtown Seoul, 20 civic activists shook signs
on Friday and demanded a ban on human cloning research.
	   One sign carried by a demonstrator depicted a row of identical
mug shots and asked: ``Which one is the real Me?''
	   ``We were not given any prior information about'' the experiment
by the Kyonghee University doctors, said Kim Ho-sung, an official
at the Science and Technology Ministry. ``Our position is firm and
clear: There will be no funding for any such research.''
	   But Kim added the government planned no legal action against the
scientists.
	   ``There will always be maverick scientists. We cannot do
anything to stop them,'' he said. ``They will be few in number and
you do not burn down the whole house to kill a few fleas.''
	   At the National Assembly, legislators prepared to pass a new law
next month banning research on human cloning except for research on
cancer or other diseases.
	   ``The law will not punish anybody but will have a strong warning
effect on the few scientists who are interested in cloning
research,'' said Rep. Rhee Shang-hi, who spearheaded the
legislation.
	   But civic organizations charged the legislation would do nothing
to stop human cloning research because it does not call for
penalties and provides no clear dividing line between cloning
research and similar scientific work.
	   ``We must stop scientists seeking commercial benefits and cheap
heroism, like those at Kyonghee University,'' 20 civic groups said
in a joint statement.
	   Dr. Lee Bo-yeon, a professor at the fertility clinic of Kyonghee
University Hospital, said he conducted the experiment to help
infertile patients and said cloning human embryos should be
encouraged to create replacement organs.
	   But he said he would not conduct further experiments until legal
and ethical disputes were resolved.
	   Lee's team replaced the nucleus of a woman's egg with the
nucleus of one of her body cells, transferring her DNA to the egg.
	   The team then cultivated the egg until it grew into four cells,
an early embryonic stage.
	   American cloning experts said it was the first time they knew of
that human DNA had been transferred from a body cell into a human
egg, with the egg then developing into embryonic cells. Body cells,
as opposed to eggs or sperm, contain the full complement of a
person's DNA.
	   But they added the experiment was stopped too early to determine
whether it would grow into a viable embryo, much less a human
fetus.
	   Others, including the Scottish scientists who created Dolly the
sheep, the world's first cloned animal, even doubted Lee's claims,
noting the South Korean team has yet to present its evidence to
scientific journals.

Ito, Darsha win 200 sprints

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito zeroed in on a U.S.
dlrs 100,000 bonus when he romped to a third sprint gold medal at
the Asian Games on Friday.
	   Ito, who outclassed the field in the 100-meter event and clocked
a 10.00 time in the semifinal, was again much too good for his
Asian rivals in the 200.
	   Sri Lanka's Damayanthi Darsha, taking responsibility for her
nation after Susantika Jayasinghe's controversial exit, also
secured a double when she won the women's 200 to add to her earlier
400 victory.
	   But the manner of Ito's victory in both individual events, plus
his clinical anchor leg in the 4x100 relay, has made him the
undisputed star of the track here. His efforts leave him well
placed to run away with the U.S. dlrs 100,000 being offered to the
games' MVP by the Olympic Council of Asia.
	   Ito was well clear at the bend and had the race to himself down
the stretch, finishing in 20.25 seconds, outside his Asian record
of 20.16.
	   ``The most important thing was to win the gold,'' Ito said.
``The record will be broken by somebody one day but the medal will
never be taken away.''
	   Han Chaoming of China was a distant second in 20.75 while Sugath
Tillekeratne of Sri Lanka was third in 20.83.
	   Darsha, running her first 200s at a meet since 1995, made a
great late surge to beat Asian record holder and games' 100
champion Li Xuemei of China.
	   A Sri Lankan official said Darsha would receive a car of her
choice and more than U.S. dlrs 10,000 for her double gold.
	   She got away well at the start but Li had a slender edge going
through the bend. Li held her advantage to the 180-meter mark
before Darsha fought past.
	   Darsha crossed the line in 22.48 seconds, ahead of Li in 22.53
and Yan Jiankui of China in 23.15.
	   Her win gave Sri Lanka a third gold for the games, its best
result ever, and she tipped a future showdown with world silver
medalist Jayasinghe. Jayasinghe, under a drugs cloud, pulled out
after the 100 semifinals here, citing injury.
	   ``We will have some close competition,'' Darsha, 23, said. ``I
didn't expect to win this because I didn't train for it _ I just
wanted to do my best.''
	   Indonesia's Supriati Sutono gave her country its first gold at
the track with a courageous 5,000-meter victory, before she was
carried away on a stretcher.
	   Sutono found a late push to get past India's Sunita Rani but
seemed to stop dead a meter from the finish. Her momentum carried
her to the gold in 15:54.46 with Rani second in 15:54.47. Michiko
Shimizu of Japan was third in 15:56.36.
	   Sutono and Rani collapsed on the track after the race.
	   China's Wang Yinghang overcame two warnings and overtook
favorite Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final kilometer to
win the men's 50-kilometer walk.
	   Wang collapsed after crossing the finish line in 3 hours, 59
minutes, 26 seconds, a second ahead of Korepanov, who was eighth in
the event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   Sanutkkao Sakchai of Thailand led through the opening 20
kilometers at a furious pace, stretching the field before quitting
at 34 kilometers.
	   Wang said he got the two warnings _ for lifting both feet at the
same time _ because he tried to keep up with the Thai.
	   ``Anyway, I never lost confidence in my strength and stamina,''
said Wang. ``Without these two warnings, I would have won the title
more easily.''
	   Japan's national record holder Fumio Imamura took the bronze.

Ukrainian opposition leader freed on bail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko,
detained on charges of money-laundering, was freed from a Swiss
jail Friday after posting bail of four million Swiss francs (dlrs 3
million).
	   Investigating judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet said Lazarenko had
agreed to stay in contact with Geneva authorities as one of the
conditions for his release.
	   From Geneva, Lazarenko went to the northern city of Zurich to be
interviewed by district attorney Dieter Jann, who is conducting his
own investigations into the case.
	   Geneva judicial authorities charged Lazarenko Dec. 4 in
connection with a ``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   Lazarenko, 45, has admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but
claims he can prove it has no criminal connections.
	   Lazarenko maintains the Ukrainian government want to discredit
him and his centrist Hromada party in advance of presidential
elections in October 1999.
	   Ukrainian authorities maintain Lazarenko used his time as the
nation's Prime Minister from 1996 to 1997 to siphon off huge
profits from the distribution of natural gas in the former Soviet
republic.
	   The country has filed 20 separate requests for legal assistance
to Switzerland. The Swiss have handed over some bank documents and
frozen an undisclosed amount of money in accounts.
	   Under the decentralized Swiss system, each canton (state) is
responsible for its own legal investigations.

GM to increase stake in Japanese automaker Isuzu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ U.S. auto giant General Motors Corp. will increase
its stake in its Japanese affiliate, Isuzu Motors Ltd., to 49
percent from the current 37.5 percent, the two companies announced
Friday.
	   GM will expand its interest in Isuzu from March 2, with Isuzu
issuing 232.5 million new shares to the American company for 52.55
billion yen (dlrs 456 million), company officials said at a press
conference in Tokyo.
	   The automakers said they will broaden their cooperation in the
commercial vehicles field by giving Isuzu full responsibility to
develop trucks and other commercial vehicles for the entire GM
group.
	   ``This agreement will further leverage Isuzu's strong position
in the commercial vehicles segment to ensure that Isuzu plays an
even more important role in GM's global commercial vehicle
development and integration process,'' the companies said in a
joint release.
	   Isuzu is one of the world's top truck makers, and produced more
than 100,000 trucks last year.
	   In September, GM announced it would increase its stake in
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. to 10 percent.
	   Friday's announcement comes amid a wave of consolidation in the
global auto industry which has forced carmakers to bolster existing
tie-ups and seek new alliances.
	   Earlier this week, German magazine Der Spiegel reported that
DaimlerChrysler is considering taking a stake in Japan's Nissan
Motor Co.

Hong Kong share prices close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for a
second consecutive session Friday, boosted by overnight gains on
Wall Street.
	   The blue chip Hang Seng Index rose 142.92 points, or 1.4
percent, to close at 10,226.23. On Thursday, the index had gained
143.92 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 4.13 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
529 million), up from Thursday's 2.96 billion Hong Kong dollars 379
million).
	   Traders said share prices rose in reaction to Thursday's gains
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.22
points.
	   They said U.S. air strikes on Iraq and an impending presidential
impeachment vote against President Clinton had little impact on the
market.
	   After the market closed, Hong Kong's leading banks announced a
cut in their prime lending rate _ the interest on loans to their
best customers _ by a quarter percentage point to 9.00 percent.
	   Interest rates cuts tend to boost stock prices because it means
lower borrowing costs for companies.
	   Among property stocks, Cheung Kong rose 1.25 Hong Kong dollars
to 55.75, and Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 50 cents to 58.00.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings rose 4.00 dollars to
194.00, and Hang Seng Bank rose 75 cents to 70.50.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.00 dollar to 54.75, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 60 cents to 36.10.

Stepping up warning, defense minister warns Iraq not to attack

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister said Friday.
	   The minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, was more direct in his warning
than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who on Thursday, the
first day of U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, would only say that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not threatened to attack Israel
in retaliation for the U.S. bombings, and Mordechai told Israel
radio there has been no change in the military's assessment that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel were slim.
	   However, Israel army radio quoted a military source as saying
that Iraq has Sukhoi Su-27 warplanes with enough range to reach
Israel and that Israel has mobilized all reserves in its
anti-aircraft force.
	   Israel's military intelligence analysts believe Saddam might
fire missiles at Israel only if he were desperate or facing death.
	   Mordechai said Israel would like to see the American-British
operation achieve its goals, but that Israel has ``no interest,
directly or indirectly,'' in taking part in the fighting.
	   However, Israel ``would take whatever measures are required
against anyone who would, heaven forbid, dare to hit us,''
Mordechai told the radio.
	   During the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel.
Giving in to American pressure, Israel did not retaliate against
Iraq. The United States was concerned that an Israeli counterstrike
would threaten the stability of an Arab coalition backing the 1991
assault on Iraq.
	   Dan Shomron, who was Israel's armed forces chief of staff during
the Gulf War, played down the possibility of Iraqi missiles falling
on Israel now. He said Iraq would have to assemble launchers in its
western desert area, closest to Israel, and he doubted whether Iraq
had the ability now.
	   Mordechai said American-made Patriot anti-missile batteries have
been deployed as a precaution. He said the plan was to deploy the
batteries as soon as there was an American strike against Iraq. He
said more American equipment is on the way here.
	   The commander of Israel's anti-aircraft units, Brig. Gen. Ariel
Fishben, said improvements have been made in the Patriot system
since the Gulf War, when its success in bringing down incoming
Iraqi Scud missiles was limited.
	   The Israeli military recommended that Israelis check their gas
masks, renew outdated models, stock up on plastic sheeting and tape
to seal off a room in their houses, if necessary. In 1991, Israelis
spent many hours in sealed rooms, wearing gas masks, during the
Iraqi missile attacks.
	   About 25,000 Israelis have traded in their old gas masks for new
ones after the army opened 65 distribution centers around the
country Thursday, the army said.
	   Protective kits distributed to Israeli citizens include gas
masks, automatic atropine needle injectors to counter nerve gas and
powder to treat chemical burns. There are special tents for infants
and gas masks with plastic extensions for men with beards.

Russian minister skips meeting with NATO defense ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia expressed its displeasure with
the American and British bombing of Iraq by ordering its defense
minister to skip Friday's scheduled meeting with NATO, sending only
an ambassador instead.
	   The move came as Moscow recalled its ambassadors from the United
States and Britain for consultation as Russia denounced the air
raids on Iraq, conducted, the Americans say, because the government
of President Saddam Hussein has refused to cooperate fully with
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``Russia cannot pretend nothing happened,'' said Sergei Kislyak,
Russia's ambassador to NATO.
	   ``We understand NATO is not participating in this action, but
two of the big countries of the alliance area organizing the
operation,'' he told reporters.
	   Part of the second day of the NATO defense ministers two-day,
year-end meeting is usually set aside for a meeting of the
Russia-NATO Joint Permanent Council, a new body created in 1996 in
the wake of plans to enlarge NATO.
	   On Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin ordered Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev to stay home.
	   The meeting went ahead anyway. Defense ministers from Germany,
Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Canada and Norway attended, along with
lower-ranking officials from other NATO countries, and Kislyak.
	   The Russian ambassador said Moscow wants to see how the bombing
of Iraq will affect the new strategic concept being developed in
NATO, and if the attacks on Iraq will create a precedent.

Philippines president arrives for state visit in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Philippines President Joseph Estrada
arrived in Bangkok on Friday for a two-day state visit in which he
will sign bilateral agreements on fighting crime and boosting
tourism.
	   Fresh from conferring with his regional counterparts at the
summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Hanoi,
Estrada touched down at Don Muang International Airport in Bangkok
with a 160-member delegation in tow.
	   He was greeted at the airport by Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan, and Leslie Gatan, charge d'affaires of the Philippine
embassy in Bangkok.
	   ``Thailand is one of our closest counterparts in ASEAN,'' Gatan
said. ``The benefits of this trip will be both political and
economic.''
	   This is Estrada's first visit to Thailand as president. The
former film star was elected to the Philippine's highest office
earlier this year.
	   Thailand and the Philippines are the most democratized of the
ASEAN nations. They frequently voice similar views as far as
advocating more openness and freedom among member nations,
providing a counterbalance to some of the more authoritarian
governments in the grouping.
	   ASEAN's other members are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore and Vietnam.
	   After reviewing an honor guard of Thai Air Force soldiers,
Estrada was whisked by motorcade to the Oriental Hotel to prepare
for an audience with Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen
Sirikit at Chitrlada Palace.
	   Immediately after, Estrada is scheduled to meet with Thailand's
Prime Minister, Chuan Leekpai, at Government House, the executive
office building, where he will sign the memorandums of
understanding on cooperation in law enforcement and tourism.
	   The two leaders are also planning to discuss regional issues,
such as the dispute over the Spratly Islands and encouraging more
bilateral investment from the two countries' private sectors.
	   Fifty-six Filipino businessmen are part of Estrada's delegation.
	   Thai companies have invested in the real estate,
telecommunications, transportation and banking sectors of the
Philippines.
	   Through September of this year, trade between the two countries
totaled dlrs 1.024 billion, with Thailand running a slight surplus.
	   With a regional economic crisis chilling the interest of foreign
investors, the two leaders hope they can convince their native
entrepreneurs to kick start growth in each other's countries
through investments.
	   Estrada is scheduled to take attend the basketball finals at the
Asian Games, being hosted by Bangkok, on Saturday. He was hoping to
root on his home country's team, but unfortunately the Filipino
squad fell to the Chinese on Friday by a score of 82-73.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and sets the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   But as a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday had set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers were evacuated by
bus to the Jordanian capital Amman, a U.N. official told The
Associated Press. U.N. executives had hoped to keep the workers _
who monitor food aid for Iraqis _ in place, but apparently reversed
the decision after the Thursday night bombardment.
	   CNN said that U.N. workers spent most of the night huddled under
a staircase listening to explosions and shattering glass from U.S.
strikes near their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Some 28 U.N. humanitarian workers deemed ``essential'' remained
in Baghdad. The U.N. official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   To protest the strikes, Iraq's ally Russia on Friday recalled
its ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came a
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled.

	   The 282-164 vote was a major victory for the governing coalition
of parties linked to the Solidarity movement that toppled communism
in 1989 over Kwasniewski, a former communist.
	   It came with a price, though. An opposition group mostly
representing farmers, the Polish Peasant's Party, joined the
Solidarity-led coalition in mustering the 60 percent majority
needed.
	   To gain the Polish Peasant's Party support, the coalition agreed
to make relatively minor changes in the law. Amending the law will
require a few more months of parliament activity.
	   Passed by parliament on Sept. 22, the bill would create an
Institute of National Remembrance to collect communist files from
1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes.
	   Besides making files available to victims, the institute would
have power to launch investigations to establish those responsible
for persecution or political murders.
	   Polish Peasant's Party leaders insisted that the head of the
institute be elected by a 60 percent majority in the Sejm, instead
of the simple majority required in the current version of the bill.
	   Opening the files of the dreaded secret police would be a
significant move toward confronting Poland's bitterly divided past.
During the communist era, the secret police used informers to
monitor virtually all aspects of daily life and routinely cracked
down on people suspected of anti-government activism.
	   The governing Solidarity-led coalition has roots in the union
movement that eventually grew into a political force that brought
down the communist regime almost a decade ago.
	   But the first post-communist governments, led by Solidarity,
focused on economic reforms without taking any steps toward
uncovering abuses of the past. A leftist government followed, and
the new bill on secret police files was drafted and approved after
the Solidarity-led coalition replaced it in elections last year.
	   Kwasniewski vetoed the bill, saying it would give too much power
to the institute managing the files. He also said all Poles, not
only victims of totalitarian regimes, should be allowed to see
their records.
	   Former communist officials, including some in the secret police,
say the files are incomplete and full of misinformation, which
would cause chaos in the form of false accusations and witch hunts.
	   Solidarity figures, including former President Lech Walesa, say
the past must be confronted and dealt with, even if that means
people including some in top government posts get victimized.

	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand,
blessed by good winds and good weather, lifted off Friday morning
on the latest effort to circle the globe in a balloon.
	   This was Branson's fifth try to be the first person to make the
round-the-world balloon voyage. He wore a silver jump suit for the
occasion.
	   The liftoff of the ICO Global Challenge from a Moroccan air
force base was delayed by nearly two hours.
	   Entertainers from throughout this North African kingdom were on
hand for the event, singing, dancing and playing traditional drums,
as if to help see the huge balloon into the heavens.
	   The trip is expected to take from eight to 18 days, and, with
continued favorable winds, could take about 10 days, the group has
said.
	   Moroccan helicopters were escorting the balloon through Moroccan
airspace.

Judge seizes Credit Lyonnais documents from Bank of France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A judge investigating losses at state-owned Credit
Lyonnais has seized documents relating to the troubled bank from
the Bank of France, a spokesman for the central bank said Friday.
	   The judge ``came to the bank Thursday and requested a certain
number of documents relating to Credit Lyonnais from 1990 through
1994,'' said the Bank of France spokesman on customary anonymity.
	   Credit Lyonnais lost 21 billion francs (dlrs 3.7 billion)
between 1992 and 1994 and a state bailout package approved earlier
this year by the European Commission cost French taxpayers over 100
billion francs (dlrs 17.9 billion).
	   Jean-Yves Haberer, Credit Lyonnais chairman from 1988 through
1993, is under investigation for presentation of false financial
accounts and information.
	   The Bank of France spokesman said the investigating judge did
not discuss the matter with Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude
Trichet.
	   The Bank of France has regulatory authority over French banks
through its banking commission.

Mexico says further oil cuts discussed but dropped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia
discussed cutting oil production by a further two million barrels a
day but failed to reach agreement, Mexico's oil minister said
Friday.
	   The minister, Luis Tellez, said that in talks here Thursday, he
and his oil and energy colleagues from those two countries
discussed a proposal under which OPEC members would bear the burden
of cutting output by 1.5 million b/d and non-OPEC members would
account for the remaining 0.5 million b/d.
	   Tellez said Mexico would be willing to cut production further
given a firm commitment to cut from OPEC members, and also given
the right market conditions to do so.
	   In the meeting Thursday the delegations agreed to maintain
reduced output through 1999.
	   The meeting followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from
other countries. All were trying to find a way to boost oil prices.
	   Crude prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have hovered this year around 12-year lows, costing
oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue.
	   The statement said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed
their commitment to reductions agreed in June 1998.
	   Speaking Friday, Mexico's Tellez said Iranian compliance and the
baseline of production that Iran was using to cut from remained an
issue. He said that Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi was planning to
visit Iran in the near future to convince the country to adhere to
the 3.6 million b/d baseline that Iran agreed to in March.
	   Tellez also said that Naimi had asked another OPEC minister to
visit Iran for the same purpose. He would not specify which oil
minister Naimi had asked, but said that this visit may already have
taken place.

	   Branson secured permission from 97 countries for overflights and
had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea, said
Mike Johnson, a spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company supporting the trip.
	   The crew on Thursday expressed confidence it could stay out of
the way of the U.S. missile strike zone on Iraq, heading northward
over Turkey.
	   The tycoon of the Virgin group said he planned to enter the
United States near San Francisco. ``We're going to go under the
bridge,'' he joked Thursday, referring to the Golden Gate.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   Johnson said the crew was more confident this time because of
the better technology used to build the balloon, including a Kevlar
canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for
bulletproof vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Germany remembers gypsy victims of Holocaust
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's upper house of parliament held a
service Friday to commemorate Gypsy victims of the Holocaust.
	   ``The murdered people are only really dead if no one remembers
them anymore,'' said Hesse state Gov. Hans Eichel, president of the
Bundesrat, or upper house, where the states are represented.
	   On Dec. 16, 1942, Nazi SS chief Heinrich Himmler ordered the
deportation of all Gypsies, also known as Roma and Sinti, in
Germany and Austria to the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland.
	   Of the roughly 1 million Roma living in Europe at the time of
World War II, historians estimate the Nazis and their allies killed
between 25 and 50 percent, including 21,000 at Auschwitz.
	   Before representatives of the Central Council of German Sinti
and Roma, Eichel said the annual memorial is necessary for Germany
and will remain so.

Athens court ruled them illegal on the grounds that they would have
disrupted pre-Christmas travel.
	   The workers had scheduled four-hour work stoppages on Friday and
Saturday, demanding the immediate hiring of staff to cover
increased demands in smaller, regional airports around the country.
	   ``We will postpone the work stoppages for now, and will meet at
a later date to decide on further action,'' said Yiannis Loverdos,
the president of the telecommunications workers' union.
	   Under the court ruling, the unions have been banned from calling
another strike with the same demands until Jan. 10.
	   The walk-outs would have come just before a similar strike
called for Dec. 21-23 by the civil aviation union, a blanket
organization covering most airport workers. The action could affect
both domestic and international flights.

Russian minister skips meeting with NATO defense ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia expressed its displeasure with
the American and British bombing of Iraq by ordering its defense
minister to skip Friday's scheduled meeting with NATO, sending only
an ambassador instead.
	   The move came as Moscow recalled its ambassadors from the United
States and Britain for consultation. Russia denounced the recent
air raids against Iraq conducted by Britain and the United States.
	   ``Russia cannot pretend nothing happened,'' said Sergei Kislyak,
Russia's ambassador to NATO. ``We understand NATO is not
participating in this action, but two of the big countries of the
alliance area organizing the operation.''
	   Part of the second day of the NATO defense ministers two-day,
year-end meeting is usually set aside for a meeting of the
Russia-NATO Joint Permanent Council, a new body created in 1996 in
the wake of plans to enlarge NATO.
	   On Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin ordered Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev to stay home.
	   Defense ministers from Germany, Denmark, Greece, Turkey, Canada
and Norway attended, along with lower-ranking officials from other
NATO countries, and Kislyak.
	   The Russian ambassador said Moscow wants to see how the bombing
of Iraq will affect the new strategic concept being developed in
NATO, and if the attacks on Iraq will create a precedent.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and sets the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   But as a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday had set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers were evacuated by
bus to the Jordanian capital Amman, a U.N. official told The
Associated Press. U.N. executives had hoped to keep the workers _
who monitor food aid for Iraqis _ in place, but apparently reversed
the decision after the Thursday night bombardment.
	   CNN said that U.N. workers spent most of the night huddled under
a staircase listening to explosions and shattering glass from U.S.
strikes near their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Some 28 U.N. humanitarian workers deemed ``essential'' remained
in Baghdad. The U.N. official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   To protest the strikes, Russia on Friday recalled its ambassador
to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came a day after the
Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito zeroed in on a U.S.
dlrs 100,000 bonus when he romped to a third sprint gold medal at
the Asian Games on Friday.
	   Ito, who outclassed the field in the 100-meter event and clocked
a 10.00 time in the semifinal, was again much too fast for his
Asian rivals in the 200.
	   Sri Lanka's Damayanthi Darsha, taking responsibility for her
nation after Susantika Jayasinghe's controversial exit, also
secured a double when she won the women's 200 to add to her earlier
400 victory.
	   A courageous run by Supriati Sutono, who was carried off the
track on a stretcher, gave Indonesia its first games track and
field gold since 1962.
	   But the manner of Ito's victory in both individual events, plus
his clinical anchor leg in the 4x100 relay, has made him the
undisputed star of the track.
	   His efforts leave him well placed to run away with the U.S. dlrs
100,000 being offered to the games' MVP by the Olympic Council of
Asia.
	   Ito was well clear at the bend and had the race to himself down
the stretch, finishing in 20.25 seconds, outside his Asian record
of 20.16.
	   ``The most important thing was to win the gold,'' Ito said.
``The record will be broken by somebody one day but the medal will
never be taken away.''
	   Han Chaoming of China was a distant second in 20.75 while Sugath
Tillekeratne of Sri Lanka was third in 20.83.
	   Darsha, running her first 200s at a meet since 1995, made a
great late surge to beat Asian record holder and games' 100
champion Li Xuemei of China.
	   A Sri Lankan official said Darsha would receive a car of her
choice and more than U.S. dlrs 10,000 for her double gold.
	   She got away well at the start but Li had a slender edge going
through the bend. Li held her advantage to the 180-meter mark
before Darsha fought past.
	   Darsha crossed the line in 22.48 seconds, ahead of Li in 22.53
and Yan Jiankui of China in 23.15.
	   Her win gave Sri Lanka a third gold for the games, its best
result ever, and she tipped a future showdown with world silver
medalist Jayasinghe. Jayasinghe, under a drugs cloud, pulled out
after the 100 semifinals here, citing injury.
	   ``We will have some close competition,'' Darsha, 23, said. ``I
didn't expect to win this because I didn't train for it _ I just
wanted to do my best.''
	   Sutono found a late push to get past India's Sunita Rani but
seemed to stop dead a meter from the finish in a 5,000 race run in
sapping heat. Her momentum carried her to the gold in 15:54.46 with
Rani second in 15:54.47. Michiko Shimizu of Japan was third in
15:56.36.
	   The previous Indonesian to win track gold at the games was
Mohammad Sarengat, who had the 100 and 110 hurdles double in 1962
and watched Friday's race.
	   ``We didn't expect she would beat the Indian but she fought,
fought, fought,'' Sarengat said.
	   South Korean Lee Jin-taek jumped 2.27 meters on his third
attempt to take the men's high jump gold ahead of China's Zhou
Zhongge (2.23).
	   Uzbekistan had a 1-2 finish in the decathlon as Oleg
Veretelnikov beat 1994 winner Ramil Ganiev to the gold with 8,278
points to 7,857. Toru Yasui of Japan had the bronze at 7,612.
	   China's Wang Yinghang overcame two warnings and overtook
favorite Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final kilometer to
win the men's 50-kilometer walk.
	   Wang collapsed after crossing the finish line in 3 hours, 59
minutes, 26 seconds, a second ahead of Korepanov, who was eighth in
the event at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   Wang said he got the two warnings _ for lifting both feet at the
same time _ because he tried to keep up with the pace early on.
	   ``Anyway, I never lost confidence in my strength and stamina,''
said Wang. ``Without these two warnings, I would have won the title
more easily.''
	   Japan's national record holder Fumio Imamura took the bronze.

Mexico says further oil cuts discussed but dropped
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia
discussed cutting oil production by two million barrels a day but
failed to reach an agreement, Mexico's oil minister said Friday.
	   Luis Tellez said he discussed with his colleagues from Venezuela
and Saudi Arabia a proposal under which OPEC members would bear the
burden of cutting output by 1.5 million barrels a day and non-OPEC
members would account for the remaining 0.5 million barrels a day.
But the ministers failed to finalize the proposal.
	   The meeting followed similar gatherings of oil ministers from
other countries. All were trying to find a way to boost oil prices.
	   Crude prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have hovered this year around 12-year lows, costing
oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenue.
	   The statement said Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela reaffirmed
their commitment to reductions agreed in June 1998.
	   Speaking Friday, Mexico's Tellez said Iranian compliance
remained an issue. He said that Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi was
planning to visit Iran in the near future to convince the country
to adhere to the 3.6 million barrel a day baseline that Iran agreed
to in March.
	   Tellez also said that Naimi had asked another OPEC minister to
visit Iran for the same purpose. He would not specify which oil
minister Naimi had asked, but said that this visit may already have
taken place.

Zimbabwe officers disciplined, troop morale down in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Five senior army officers have been
court marshaled for indiscipline and inciting mutiny among
Zimbabwean troops fighting in the Congo, a newspaper reported
Friday.
	   One of the officers, a battalion commander, allegedly refused to
obey orders during active service, the Zimbabwe Independent
reported.
	   There was no immediate response from the Defense Ministry in
Harare and calls to the army's chief spokesman in Harare were not
returned.
	   The Independent said another of the five, identified as a Maj.
Tuhwe, was cashiered from the service for inciting disaffection,
fear, alarm and despondency among troops serving in the Congo.
	   It said military intelligence bugged his home telephone and
heard him say in a call from the front that ``people are dying,
corpses are in plastic bags full of worms and soldiers are dying en
masse.''
	   Last month, the same newspaper reported reinforcements of
military police were sent to Congo after morale among Zimbabwe's
8,000 troops plummeted.
	   The military in Harare denied that report but has done little to
counter other reports that Zimbabwean forces were bogged down in
the eastern Congo during heavy tropical rains.
	   The Defense Ministry has said its casualties in fighting since
Saturday for the strategic rebel-held town of Kabalo, 1,200
kilometers (740 miles) east of Kinshasa consisted of the deaths of
two officers aboard a helicopter gunship that crashed Sunday.
	   Zimbabwe said the gunship crashed with a mechanical failure but
Congolese rebels claimed they shot it down, along with a Zimbabwean
jet fighter, and killed 47 Zimbabwean soldiers.
	   Zimbabwe and an alliance of forces from Angola, Namibia and Chad
are supporting embattled Congolese President Laurent Kabila in the
rebellion that began Aug. 2.
	   Zimbabwe has acknowledged nine combat deaths and 17 Zimbabweans
captured in the Congo.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Dense fog canceled play for a second
straight day in the third and decisive cricket Test between
Pakistan and Zimbabwe in Faisalabad on Friday.
	   Misty conditions and thick fog denied play on the first day
Thursday. On Friday foggy conditions continued and the umpires
canceled play.
	   ``The light is even poorer then what we witnessed on the first
day,'' Pakistani umpire Salim Badar said.
	   The weather forecast is not encouraging for the remaining three
days of the match with more fog expected.
	   ``It's quite foggy out there and I doubt if there will be any
play in this Test match,'' Badar said.
	   Zimbabwe leads the three-match series 1-0 after winning the
first Test by seven wickets. The second Test was a draw, in large
part because of the reduced overs as a result of poor visibility
and fog.

Russian delegation leaves for Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A delegation of Russian government officials flew
to Iran to discuss economic issues and the situation in Iraq, a
news report said Friday.
	   The group of high-ranking officials from the ministries of
finance, economics, and foreign affairs left Thursday night and
will return Dec. 22, the Interfax news agency said. It was led by a
foreign policy aide to President Boris Yeltsin.
	   The trip ``was planned and continues the regular dialogue
between Moscow and Tehran,'' Interfax said, citing unidentified
government sources.
	   The two sides will discuss trade and economic cooperation as
well as the status of the Caspian Sea. Iran is pushing for greater
access to what many believe are massive oil reserves beneath the
central Caspian.
	   Russia and Iran have signed a contract worth more than dlrs 500
million to build a nuclear reactor in Iran, which both sides insist
will only be used for generating power.
	   Iran has become a key market for Russian weapons, and trade
between the two countries reached dlrs 550 million last year,
Russian leaders have said.
	   Russia and Iran will also hold talks on Iraq, where the United
States and Great Britain launched airstrikes for a second day
Friday.

Japan trade minister calls for widespread deregulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan needs deregulation in a wide range of
industries to foster the entreprenurial activity needed to pull the
country out of its worst recession in decades, Japan's trade
minister said Friday.
	   Trade Minister Kaoru Yosano told reporters that Japan's ``Big
Bang'' financial liberalization measures should be accompanied by
deregulation in other industries such as energy, medical care, and
communications.
	   ``In terms of market structure, an environment has to be
developed which allows for the smooth entry and exit of
companies,'' he said.
	   To raise Japan's low company start-up rate, the government must
offer financial support to entrepreneurs, Yosano said.
	   Companies, in turn, can increase productivity by streamlining
their operations and cutting back on ``white-collar
over-employment,'' he said.
	   Japan's record-high jobless rate, currently 4.3 percent, will
inevitably rise in the process, but jobs created in new industries
will eventually counteract the trend, Yosano said.
	   Ultimately, Yosano said, economic recovery will depend on
cooperation between the government and the private sector.
	   ``Ensuring true affluence for the people of Japan, as well as
the successful conversion to a domestic demand-led economy, will
require an integrated effort through public-private alliance.''

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean navy ships and planes
chased and sank a North Korean speedboat in a gun battle Friday and
began a sea and air search for its suspected mother ship.
	   The body of a North Korean in a wet suit was recovered shortly
after the sinking of the vessel, described as a low-slung,
high-speed boat used to land or pick up spies.
	   ``We're now involved in reconnaissance operations to pursue the
mother ship, which is believed to be outside South Korean
territorial waters,'' Lt. Gen. Chung Young-jin said.
	   The office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had earlier described
the sunken ship as a mini-submarine of a type commonly used by
North Korea for espionage missions.
	   But Chung, commander of the Joint Chiefs' Operations
Headquarters, told a news conference it was a speedboat capable of
carrying up to eight people.
	   The craft was first spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as
it approached Yosu, a small port 320 kilometers (200 miles) south
of Seoul on the tip of the Korean Peninsula, he said.
	   The boat then fled southeast for about 100 kilometers (62
miles), pursued for nearly six hours by South Korean navy ships and
air force planes, Chung said.
	   Finally hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped
by a South Korean transport plane, the fleeing boat opened fire at
the pursuing ships and was quickly sunk by return fire, Chung said.
	   ``We fired several warning shots, but the enemy craft continued
to flee and fired at us. Therefore, we attacked and sank it,'' said
Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman.
	   About two hours later, South Korean troops recovered the body of
the North Korean. Chung said four men had been sighted on the boat,
and Navy frogmen were searching for more bodies.
	   There were no South Korean casualties.
	   ``The speedboat is believed to have been dispatched to
infiltrate agents into the South, pick up agents stationed in the
South, or establish secret, espionage-related drop-off points,''
Chung said.
	   He said it was believed to have been launched by a mother ship
weighing 70 to 100 tons, sailing out of the port of Nampo on North
Korea's west coast.
	   On shore, South Korean soldiers and police were put on high
alert, increasing security checks for possible infiltrators from
the boat, officials said.
	   Chief presidential spokesman Park Jie-won praised the swift
military action and urged North Korea to stop armed provocations to
promote peace on the peninsula.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J.
Crowley called the intrusion a ``very serious matter.''
	   North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up
spies along South Korea's long coastline, officials said. Several
have been detected in recent years.
	   In June, a 70-ton Yugo-class North Korean submarine was found in
South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller and
periscope tangled in a fishing net.
	   South Koreans later cut through the hatch with welding torches
and found nine bodies, all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact.
Seoul officials said the sub was on a spy mission.
	   The latest incident comes as the United States is trying to
defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site.
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection.
	   North Korea claims that the facility under construction at
Keumjang-ri north of the country's capital, Pyongyang, is for
civilian use, but U.S. officials suspect it to be nuclear-related.
	   North Korea's military has denounced the U.S. demand for
inspection as ``a declaration of war.''
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,200 Indonesian students on
Friday staged anti-government rallies as troops blocked roads near
the presidential palace and other strategic sites in the wake of a
clash between protesters and security officers.
	   Extra police were also deployed near the U.S. Embassy amid fears
of demonstrations in the predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian
country against the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq.
	   Twenty activists from an Islamic student group rallied against
the bombing outside the Jakarta headquarters of the United Nations.
	   Separately, several hundred students marched from a campus of
the state-run University of Indonesia toward Parliament. They
chanted anti-military slogans and some carried bamboo staves.
	   Other groups of pro-democracy protesters drove through the city
in buses and gathered at a park and a main intersection.
	   On Thursday, at least 4,000 students singing ``revolution until
we die'' attempted to storm the Parliament building. Hundreds were
injured when police and soldiers stopped them with plastic bullets,
batons and tear gas.
	   The huge street battle came just hours after Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie warned that the protests could lead to the
breakup of the sprawling nation, the world's fourth most populous
country.
	   On Friday, Habibie repeated his warning and urged Indonesians to
exercise restraint.
	   ``We still see many cruel actions,'' the official Antara news
agency quoted him as saying at the state palace. ``We still see how
differences in opinion could lead to conflict involving the
masses.''
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic turmoil in
decades and has been plagued by political uncertainty as well.
Habibie took over in May from authoritarian President Suharto, who
was dislodged by riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Yet students have kept up their protests since Suharto's ouster,
demanding that Habibie force the powerful military out of politics
and put his predecessor and onetime mentor on trial for corruption.
	   Nine students were killed Nov. 13 in clashes with security
forces during a government assembly that met to plan an overhaul of
Suharto's rigid political system. Students said the reforms did not
go far enough.
	   Habibie has allowed political parties to form and has scheduled
Parliamentary elections next year. He also has ordered an
investigation into Suharto's wealth.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Friday dealt a blow to
Allan Boesak, denying a motion to dismiss the embezzlement case
charges against the former top African National Congress official.
	   Judge John Foxcroft dismissed five of 32 counts but ordered the
trial to continue Feb. 8 on the rest of the charges. Boesak is
accused of stealing more than 1 million rand (dlrs 300,000 at the
time) from an anti-apartheid organization he headed.
	   Boesak's lawyers had asked Foxcroft to throw out the entire
case, saying it had collapsed after a key witness recanted.
	   Last month, Boesak's former bookkeeper Freddie Steenkamp
admitted he lied under oath due to a personal grudge when he
testified against his ex-boss. Steenkamp, already serving six years
in jail, was the state's key witness.
	   Boesak said he was not disappointed by the judgment and was
looking forward to clearing his name when the trial resumes and the
defense can put forward its case.
	   ``I am just glad that this part is over and I am looking forward
to finishing it as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   The courtroom was packed with Boesak's family and supporters who
cheered and sang as he left after the ruling. Boesak appeared
relaxed and smiled and hugged his wife and daughter, who have been
present for most of the trial.
	   A former minister who once headed the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches, Boesak is accused of embezzling the money from the
Foundation for Peace and Justice charity.
	   Donations came from pop singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other individuals and
groups.
	   Foxcroft ruled that there was not enough evidence to support the
counts involving a donation by the Coca-Cola Foundation, a
children's charity and three by the Church of Norway. But he said
potential proof remained for the other 27 counts.
	   Boesak played a prominent role in the anti-apartheid struggle
that ended in the country's first all-race elections in 1994.

	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand,
blessed by good winds and good weather, lifted off Friday morning,
hoping to steer the world's largest balloon around the globe.
	   The 12-ton, 200-foot-high ICO Global Challenge, under escort of
Moroccan helicopters, climbed 600 feet a minute through a cloudless
sky after being cut loose from a Moroccan air force base.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said shortly before liftoff, delayed by two hours. ``After
that we can start to relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   This was Branson's fifth try to be the first person to make the
round-the-world balloon voyage.
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip which could last from eight days
to nearly three weeks.
	   However, the U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the
task, Branson said.
	   ``This flight around the world would have taken 9 and a half
days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told reporters.
	   ``Now, we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 days.''
	   The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds to
take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over
Saudi Arabia.
	   The balloon was expected to leave Moroccan territory later today
for neighboring Algeria.
	   Branson secured permission from 97 countries for overflights and
had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea, said
Mike Johnson, a spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone
company supporting the trip.
	   The tycoon of the Virgin group said he planned to enter the
United States near San Francisco. ``We're going to go under the
bridge,'' he joked Thursday, referring to the Golden Gate.
	   Entertainers from throughout this North African kingdom were on
hand for the event, singing, dancing and playing traditional drums,
as if to help see the huge balloon into the heavens.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   Johnson said the crew was more confident this time because of
the better technology used to build the balloon, including a Kevlar
canopy over the crew's pressurized capsule. Kevlar is used for
bulletproof vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

	   DAET, Philippines (AP) _ A twin-engine plane crashed into a
mountain in bad weather, killing the pilot and an American engineer
on board, police said Friday.
	   Police Superintendent Rogelio Granada said villagers found the
six-seater Beechcraft 95 half buried in mud late Thursday in
Mabini, a mountain village on the outskirts of Daet town in
Camarines del Norte province.
	   Granada said the villagers began searching for the plane after
seeing it plunge into a mountain a day earlier. He said the pilot
may have lost his way in the heavy rain and strong winds.
	   Granada said villagers found the decapitated remains of two
people, including the Filipino pilot and his passenger, who was
later identified by U.S. embassy authorities in Manila as Mark
Matrigali of Florida. No other details were immediately available.
	   Other identification documents were lost or stolen by local
villagers, Granada added.
	   Police in Daet earlier said Matrigali was from Melbourne,
Australia, but this was later denied by the Australian embassy in
Manila.
	   Daet is about 220 kilometers (137 miles) east of Manila.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The body of a prominent Serbian
official was found early Friday, just hours he was kidnapped,
apparently by Kosovo Albanian guerrillas, Serb sources reported.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, the district mayor of Kosovo Polje,
a town just 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was found by the province's main east-west road, the
Serb-run Media Center said.
	   The report did not say who found the body but cited the Serb
official's family who witnessed Bojanic's abduction last night from
his home in a nearby village by five masked rebels in guerrilla
uniform.
	   Although the circumstances of the death remained unclear and
there was no independent confirmation of the report, it came just
hours after Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the
killing of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash this weekend.
	   On Thursday, Serb police launched a strong crackdown on a
suspected rebel-controlled village, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters and capturing 34 in a day-long battle.
	   Serb authorities said they raided the village of Glodjane in
search of gunmen who slaughtered six young Serbs, including four
teen-agers, on Monday in a bar in Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
west of Pristina.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern district of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and police officers wearing
flak jackets blocked a bridge leading to the Kapesnica district.
Police snipers looked down from surrounding rooftops.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended higher Friday on
the back of overnight gains on Wall Street despite continuing U.S.
military strikes on Iraq.
	   Japanese stock prices rose for a third straight day. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 14,194.29
points, up 67.30 points, or 0.48 percent, from Thursday.
	   Investors in Japanese stocks were cheered by the gain in the
U.S. market Thursday amid a second wave of U.S. and British missile
attacks against Iraq, traders said. That signaled receding fears
about possible fallout in the form of damage to the global economy,
they said.
	   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 85.22 points,
or 1.0 percent, to 8,875.82, reaching its peak in the last minutes
of trading.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 115.20 yen in late
afternoon, up 0.90 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below
its late New York level of 116.13 yen overnight.
	   Singapore share prices closed sharply higher as investors
shurgged off air strikes on Iraq. The Straits Times Index rose
39.77 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,405.96.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher for a second consecutive
session, boosted by overnight gains on Wall Street.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of
blue chip, rose 142.92 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at
10,226.23. On Thursday, the index had gained 143.92 points.
	   After the market closed, Hong Kong's leading banks announced a
cut in their prime lending rate _ the interest on loans to their
best customers _ by a quarter percentage point to 9.00 percent.
	   Interest rates cuts tend to boost stock prices because it means
lower borrowing costs for companies.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed mixed. The market's key Weighted
Stock Price Index rose 13.98 points, or 0.21 percent, to 6,636.66.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with brokers
saying strength in the tourism and transport sectors sparked the
local market into action. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose
27.69 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,022.08.
	   MANILA: Philippine share prices closed slightly higher. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 8.06 points, or 0.4
percent, to 1,886.30.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher as investors did
some buying before heading off for their Christmas vacations. The
All Ordinaries Index rose 9.3 percent, or 0.33 percent, to 2,749.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The Korea
Composite Stock Price Index fell 4.04 points, or 0.76 percent, to
524.85.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher. The
benchmark Composite Index rose 7.63 points, or 1.4 percent, to
550.41.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The
Composite Index fell 1.622, or 0.3 percent, to 403.962.
	   BANGKOK: Share prices closed higher in thin trading. The SET
Index rose 3.27 points, or 0.9 percent, to 341.92.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group handed over weapons Friday
to an international commission _ and challenged its enemies in the
Irish Republican Army to do the same.
	   Under a police escort, representatives of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force carried an unknown number of illegal firearms, grenades and
detonators from the outlawed group's power base of Portadown, 30
miles (50 kms) west of Belfast, to the east Belfast headquarters of
the commission led by Canada's former senior soldier, Gen. John de
Chastelain.
	   They were the first weapons to be received by de Chastelain's
commission since the April peace accord gave him the job of
negotiating the gradual disarmament of Northern Ireland's rival
underground armies by mid-2000.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has come down with the flu
at the start of the busy Christmas season and canceled his
audiences Friday, the Vatican said.
	   The Vatican described the pontiff's illness as a mild case of
influenza.
	   The illness struck the frail 78-year-old pope at the start of
the busy holiday period, when he has made few concessions for his
age and health.
	   The pope is scheduled to celebrate midnight Mass Christmas eve
and deliver his annual holiday message on Christmas day.
	   Other appointments include a scheduled meeting with school
children and their families Sunday to bless Nativity scenes and an
annual address Tuesday to the College of Cardinals on the state of
the church.
	   In the only change in recent years, he no longer celebrates a
public Mass Christmas Day.
	   Otherwise, although weakened by a long list of ailments, the
pope has kept up a crowded schedule and his foreign travels.
	   His next planned trip is to Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri, Jan.
22-28.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish legislators voted Friday to
override President Aleksander Kwasniewski's veto of a bill that
would allow victims of communist-era repression to see their secret
police files.
	   Kwasniewski's lawyer said later the president would sign the
measure on Friday afternoon.
	   Legislators in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament, stood
and applauded after the 282-164 vote that overturned the
president's Dec. 12 veto.
	   The vote was a major victory for the governing coalition of
parties linked to the Solidarity movement that toppled communism in
1989 over Kwasniewski, a former communist.

	   The move came more than four years after the British and Irish

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The body of a prominent Serbian
official was found early Friday, just hours after he was kidnapped,
apparently by Kosovo Albanian guerrillas, Serb sources reported.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, the district mayor of Kosovo Polje,
a town just 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was found by the province's main east-west road, the
Serb-run Media Center said.
	   The report did not say who found the body but cited the Serb
official's family who witnessed Bojanic's abduction Thursday night
from his home in a nearby village by five masked rebels in
guerrilla uniforms.
	   Although the circumstances of the death remained unclear and
there was no independent confirmation of the report, it came just
hours after Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the
killing of 36 guerrilla fighters in a border clash this weekend.
	   On Thursday, Serb police launched a strong crackdown on a
suspected rebel-controlled village, reportedly killing two ethnic
Albanian fighters and capturing 34 in a day-long battle.
	   Serb authorities said they raided the village of Glodjane in
search of gunmen who slaughtered six young Serbs, including four
teen-agers, on Monday in a bar in Pec, 75 kilometers (45 miles)
west of Pristina.
	   Police also sealed off a northwestern district of Pec as part of
the sweep. An armored personnel carrier and police officers wearing
flak jackets blocked a bridge leading to the Kapesnica district.
Police snipers looked down from surrounding rooftops.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ About 1,200 Indonesian students on
Friday staged anti-government rallies as troops blocked roads near
the presidential palace and other strategic sites in the wake of a
clash between protesters and security officers.
	   Extra police were also deployed near the U.S. Embassy amid fears
of demonstrations in the predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian
country against the U.S. missile strikes on Iraq.
	   Twenty activists from an Islamic student group rallied against
the bombing outside the Jakarta headquarters of the United Nations.
	   Separately, several hundred students marched from a campus of
the state-run University of Indonesia toward Parliament. They
chanted anti-military slogans and some carried bamboo staves.
	   Other groups of pro-democracy protesters drove through the city
in buses and gathered at a park and a main intersection.
	   On Thursday, at least 4,000 students singing ``revolution until
we die'' attempted to storm the Parliament building. Hundreds were
injured when police and soldiers stopped them with plastic bullets,
batons and tear gas.
	   The huge street battle came just hours after Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie warned that the protests could lead to the
breakup of the sprawling nation, the world's fourth most populous
country.
	   On Friday, Habibie repeated his warning and urged Indonesians to
exercise restraint.
	   ``We still see many cruel actions,'' the official Antara news
agency quoted him as saying at the state palace. ``We still see how
differences in opinion could lead to conflict involving the
masses.''
	   Indonesia is grappling with its worst economic turmoil in
decades and has been plagued by political uncertainty as well.
Habibie took over in May from authoritarian President Suharto, who
was dislodged by riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Yet students have kept up their protests since Suharto's ouster,
demanding that Habibie force the powerful military out of politics
and put his predecessor and onetime mentor on trial for corruption.
	   Nine students were killed Nov. 13 in clashes with security
forces during a government assembly that met to plan an overhaul of
Suharto's rigid political system. Students said the reforms did not
go far enough.
	   Habibie has allowed political parties to form and has scheduled
Parliamentary elections next year. He also has ordered an
investigation into Suharto's wealth.

Ito wins third sprint gold; second doping case reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with track golds, doping case; will be updated with
later events &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito once again was the
fastest on foot Friday, winning his third Asian Games gold medal,
while Chinese did their speeding on water, rowing off with five
golds.
	   A second doping case was disclosed, another weightlifter, but
the president of the games' governing body found a bright side in
that no medalists had been found cheating.
	   And with the Chinese far ahead in the overall gold standings,
any victory over them was a cause for celebration.
	   Those with bragging rights Friday included Sri Lanka's
Damayanthi Darsha, who edged ahead of Asian record holder Li Xuemei
of China in the women's 200 meters, and the Japanese women's
basketball team, 93-69 winners over a bigger Chinese team in the
gold medal game.
	   Ito also beat a Chinese in the men's 200, but he was far from
the underdog. He already had established himself as Asia's fastest
man by winning the 100 and anchoring Japan's victorious 400-meter
relay quartet, and by running a 10-flat in the 100 semifinals.
	   His winning time, 20.25 to the 20.75 of China's Han Chaoming,
was slower than his Asian record of 20.126. But, he said, ``the
record will be broken by somebody one day but the medal will never
be taken away.''
	   His triumphs have made him one of the favorites to collect the
U.S. dlrs 100,000 being offered to the games' MVP by the Olympic
Council of Asia.
	   Supriati Sutono, who was carried off the track on a stretcher
after edging India's Sunita Rani by .01 second in the women's
5,000, gave Indonesia its first games track and field gold since
1962.
	   Darsha's victory gave Sri Lanka its third gold, the country's
best result at any Asian Games, and was her own second, following
triumph in the 400.
	   She won in 22.48 seconds, with Li second in 22.53.
	   South Korean Lee Jin-taek won the men's high jump, and
Uzbekistan had a 1-2 finish in the decathlon as Oleg Veretelnikov
beat 1994 winner Ramil Ganiev.
	   China's Wang Yinghang overcame two warnings and overtook
favorite Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final kilometer to
win the men's 50-kilometer walk.
	   By late afternoon, China had boosted its gold total here to 109,
well ahead of South Korea's 62. Japan had 50.
	   Meanwhile, the Olympic Council of Asia announced that
weightlifter Jaber Al-Ajmi, the 10th place finisher in the over
105-kilogram division, had tested positive for nandrolone, a banned
anabolic steroid. The International Weightlifting Federation was to
decide his punishment.
	   But OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, who also is Kuwaiti,
said he was ``happy that there have been only two cases, not
important cases, not involving champions.''
	   In the last games, in 1994 in Hiroshima, Japan, 15 positive
tests were reported, and 11 of them involved medalists, he noted.
	   While the Japanese women beat China for one basketball gold, the
Chinese men foiled the Philippines' all-out campaign to climb back
to the top of Asian basketball by fielding a team of professional
stars. The Chinese beat the Filipinos 82-73 in a semifinal.
	   For the gold, they will play South Korea, a 101-64 winner over
Kazakstan.
	   In rowing, China swept all five of the day's golds, and coach
Gao Hongyin said, ``Now we are on the right track to clean sweep
the Asiad rowing gold medals for the third time.''
	   In the last games in 1994, China won 11 of 12 rowing golds. They
had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   The Chinese were stung by failures at the rowing World
Championships in September, and called a special training camp
before the Asian Games. Gao said the rowers had advice in training
from track coach Ma Junren, whose ``Ma's army'' of women distance
runners set world records in the early 1990s.
	   Because of a dispute with national officials, none of Ma's
runners is in the Asian Games, but Ma went to the rowers' training
camp.
	   The Chinese gained still another gold when Li Fang and Chen Li
beat South Koreans Cho Yoon-jeong and Park Sung-hee 6-2, 7-6 (7-2)
in women's doubles tennis.
	   But South Korea's Yoon Yong-il won the men's singles gold,
beating Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.
	   The South Koreans also beat China 45-44 for the men's saber team
gold in fencing competition.

Spain to move some Basque prisoners closer to home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain said Friday it will move 21 Basque
separatist inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their
home region, a move seen as a gesture to the armed Basque group
ETA.
	   The announcement by the Interior Ministry came exactly three
months after ETA began observing an open-ended ceasefire in its
30-year battle for an independent homeland.
	   Since then, the government has been under pressure from both
hardline and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream
Socialist opposition party, to make a significant gesture to ETA on
its long-standing demand that separatist prisoners be transferred
to the Basque country, or at least closer to it.
	   In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners
to the Basque country itself. Officials insisted this was for
humanitarian reasons only.
	   The government keeps more than 500 ETA prisoners scattered
around the country to avoid their plotting behind bars.
	   The interior ministry said 21 will be moved to jails in the
south of the mainland from prisons in the Canary Islands off the
coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands in the Mediterranean, or
from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves on the northern coast of
Morocco.
	   The ministry said the transfers would begin immediately. It
named the prisoners but did not list their crimes.
	   In November, Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said he had
authorized exploratory talks with parties close to ETA to determine
whether the group was prepared to renounce violence for good.
	   Aznar insists that the peace process cannot advance in earnest
without a permanent end to the violence. And even so, he says the
government is only willing to discuss prisoner transfers and other
issues involving ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated
demand of independence.
	   The group, whose name means Basque Homeland and Freedom, has
killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for a separate homeland in
the Basque country, an area which straddles parts of northern Spain
and southern France.

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INSERTS new 4th graf with Kremlin saying diplomatic ties with
Washington and London won't be broken, INSERTS new 13th and 14th
grafs with Yeltsin comment &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's relations with the United States and the
West may be seriously damaged by the U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping
out years of progress since the end of the Cold War, top military
leaders warned Friday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders across the political
spectrum have denounced the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq,
demanding an immediate halt to the campaign.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Friday it had recalled Russia's
ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came one
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled to
protest the attacks.
	   The Kremlin said diplomatic relations with Washington and London
would not be broken.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, was to consider
calls Friday for Russia to unilaterally break U.N. sanctions
against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad, a long-time Soviet and
Russian friend.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' he was quoted as saying by the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The Russian navy was putting some units on alert because of the
Iraq crisis, but there had been no deployment of ships, officials
said. The move appeared purely symbolic. The Russian military is
not considered an effective force after years of neglect and poor
funding.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday the U.S. and
British strikes ``flagrantly violated the norms of the
international law and openly ignored the world community's efforts
to settle the situation.''
	   Sergeyev, the country's highest-ranking officer, said Moscow's
relations with NATO were threatened. ``How can we talk about
cooperation and partnership with the alliance now, when Russia's
opinion is openly ignored,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin is under opposition pressure to curb ties with the West
at a time when he has lost much of his political clout because of
health problems and his failure to handle the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Communist and other nationalist politicians have been demanding
an end to Moscow's close ties with the West and NATO.
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman said Friday the president did not want
to damage ties with the West, but Russia could not accept the
attack on Iraq.
	   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towrds confrontation (with the West), but we should call
things by their name. The military strikes are unacceptable and
should be stopped,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a
Kremlin press briefing.
	   While Yeltsin is not likely to alter his pro-Western policy
radically, he is angry about not being informed by Washington about
the attack in advance.
	   The Anglo-American attack on Iraq was criticized by some other
ex-Soviet republics. President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia said
the United States had no justification for the attacks, while
Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan called for an end to the campaign.

Russian man holds three people hostage in demand of frozen deposit

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A gunman demanding money from his frozen bank
account held three employees hostage at a bank in downtown Moscow
on Friday, but he gave up after talking to police, a news report
said.
	   The man, identified as 39-year-old Alexander Shreiber, took the
hostages at a branch of the Russian Credit Bank to demand money
from his bank account, which was frozen after Russia's financial
crisis hit in August, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Police managed to free the hostages after negotiating for more
than an hour with Shreiber, who was armed with a pistol. He
eventually surrendered.
	   Thousands of depositors saw their bank accounts frozen when
Russia's banks were hit by the country's latest financial crisis.
Some people have chained themselves inside banks or threatened
suicide in attempts to free up their accounts.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab governments and newspapers fiercely
criticized the U.S. air strikes on Baghdad on Friday as security
officials readied for expected anti-American demonstrations outside
mosques after the weekly Muslim prayers.
	   Throughout the Arab world, the message was that the unleashing
of missiles at the heart of Baghdad would do more harm to the Iraqi
people than to President Saddam Hussein.
	   Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura said the U.S.
strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of Iraq's people,
``particularly its children and civilians.''
	   ``We ... condemn and denounce this attack and call on the
international community to condemn and halt it immediately,'' he
said in a speech to the Parliament.
	   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, expressed his ``great concern over the military action
against Iraq and its repercussions on the Iraqi people,'' the
Emirates news agency reported late Thursday.
	   It also quoted a government spokesman as saying: ``The terrible
operation we have seen on television ... is beyond comprehension
and is unacceptable.'' The spokesman's name was not given.
	   In Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, security officials readied for
protests over the U.S. and British attacks outside mosques or
American embassies. On Thursday, protests against the attacks
erupted in Cairo, the Lebanese capital Beirut and the Gaza Strip.
	   The Egyptian-based Arab League called an emergency meeting
Sunday to discuss the situation in Iraq.
	   Its secretary-general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, on Thursday blamed
the attack on last week's report by U.N. chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler, saying he ``intended to provoke Iraq and not be
neutral'' in assessing Iraq's weapons programs.
	   In Lebanon, Ghassan Tweini, publisher of the leading daily
An-Nahar, urged a summit of the Arab world's leaders to demand a
halt to attacks on Iraq. He wrote that the attacks were misguided
in trying to oust Saddam.
	   ``Leave it to the Iraqis, not the Americans, not the Turks nor
the Kurds nor the Israelis ... to decide the fate of the Iraqi
regime and Saddam Hussein,'' Tweini wrote in his paper's Friday
edition.
	   The Beirut newspaper As-Safir also said that the American
attacks would give Saddam ``a new lease on life.''
	   On Thursday, the attacks on Iraq were condemned by Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss and the world's largest Muslim group, the
52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Most Iraqi opposition parties joined in the criticism of the
attacks.
	   The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose
invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the following year's Gulf War and
eight years of trade sanctions on Iraq.
	   Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister and
deputy prime minister, told the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm the current
crisis was between Iraqi and the United Nations.
	   ``We are not part of it, and we have nothing to do with it
whatsoever,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, wrote
Friday that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ``will be hanging naked from
street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the U.S. attacks end.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said
the government would take all necessary measures to protect against
an attack by Iraq in response to the American air strikes.
	   But he told Israel radio he considered such an attack unlikely.
Iraqi fired about 40 missiles at Israel during the 1991 Gulf War,
but it has made no threat in the current crises to fire on the
Jewish state.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The body of a prominent Serbian
official was found early Friday, just hours after he was kidnapped,
apparently by Kosovo Albanian guerrillas, Serb sources reported.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, the district mayor of Kosovo Polje,
a town just 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was found by the province's main east-west road, the
Serb-run Media Center said.
	   The report did not say who found the body but cited the Serb
official's family who witnessed Bojanic's abduction Thursday night
from his home in a nearby village by five masked rebels in
guerrilla uniform.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) Italy's Mediaset company is close to reaching
an agreement for a joint venture with the Germany company Kirch
Media Group, Mediaset's chairman Fedele Confalonieri said Friday.
	   Mediaset and Kirch have been involved in month-long negotiations
to create a media joint venture, which would house each company's
25 percent stake in Spanish TV station Telecinco and Kirch's SAT1.
	   There is also speculation that Mediaset would contribute one of
its three television stations, most likely Rete 4, although the
company has denied any plans to cede the station.
	   ``We are at a good point in the negotiations in Germany,''
Confalonieri said.
	   Mediaset is part of the Fininvest Group, a company controlled by
former Premier Silvio Berlusconi.

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ At least 1,000 protesters on Friday
demanded independence in the disputed territory of East Timor ahead
of a planned visit by a special envoy from the United Nations.
	   The U.N. diplomat, Jamsheed Marker, met in the nearby island of
Bali with Indonesian military commanders who oversee East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony that was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.
	   Marker was expected to fly to Dili, East Timor's capital, on
Saturday in a visit that has heightened fears that demonstrations
timed for his arrival could degenerate into riots.
	   Pro-independence activists who gathered outside the local
Parliament in Dili ignored an appeal from East Timor's Nobel
laureate, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo, to stay off the
streets.
	   A harsh critic of Indonesian policy, Belo urged demonstrators to
work for change through dialogue and refrain from disrupting
Christmas celebrations as well as Ramadan, the Islamic fasting
month which begins Sunday.
	   East Timor is predominately Roman Catholic, while some 90
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim.
	   ``How can you fight for (your) aspirations by parading all over
the city, an act which will only be disadvantageous to you?'' the
official Antara news agency quoted Belo as saying on Thursday.
	   ``The best way to fight for your aspirations is to sit down and
have a dialogue,'' said Belo, a co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace
prize for his efforts to solve the long-running conflict in his
homeland.
	   Some angry protesters waved separatist rebel flags and
threatened to vandalize the Parliament building, which had been
left vacant by government officials. But there were also
conciliatory speeches.
	   ``In order to get independence, we have to hold a peaceful
dialogue,'' demonstrator Matias Guviar told the crowd of students
and townspeople.
	   Long-running talks between Indonesia and Portugal and chaired by
Marker were revitalized earlier this year when Jakarta offered to
grant autonomy to East Timor.
	   In exchange, Indonesia wants international recognition of its
sovereignty over the half-island territory of 800,000 people.
	   However, sporadic fighting between separatist guerrillas and the
Indonesian military persists and many independence activists want a
total withdrawal of Indonesian troops.
	   On Thursday, more than 1,000 pro-independence protesters also
rallied outside East Timor's local Parliament as Marker held talks
with a guerrilla commander in a Jakarta prison.
	   The Antara agency quoted the rebel leader, Xanana Gusmao, as
saying he would agree to Indonesia's autonomy plan as long as a
referendum on independence was held after 10 years.
	   Marker visited East Timor last July and was heavily guarded by
Indonesian troops when he held talks with local community leaders
at a remote airport.
	   During a visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot and
killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a Dili
hotel where the envoy was staying.

Closed door meeting to commence probe; Reno reviewing allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Meeting scheduled to begin 1700 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ As allegations of bribery pile up faster
than Utah snow, Olympic officials were ready to begin a formal
investigation into the awarding of the 2002 Winter Games.
	   In a closed meeting room at the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's
headquarters, the five-member SLOC Ethics Committee met Thursday to
discuss the allegations.
	   ``The world needs to hear anything that we wouldn't be proud of
from us and they need to hear it from us first,'' Utah Gov. Mike
Leavitt said. ``And they need to hear it from us soon.''
	   Likely to be on the agenda was a dlrs 400,000 scholarship whose
13 beneficiaries included six relatives of IOC officials; why those
scholarships were not reflected on tax documents; and dlrs 28,000
in free medical service provided to three IOC members.
	   The payments appear to violate IOC rules limiting the value of
gifts to members to dlrs 150.
	   Meanwhile, Salt Lake City Mayor Deedee Corradini, a member of
SLOC's board, admitted Thursday that the son of an IOC member from
Swaziland was given an internship in city government.
	   And on the same day, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said that
her office also is reviewing the allegations.
	   Such reviews fall far short of a formal investigation, which
would be undertaken by the local U.S. Attorney. Steven Sorenson,
chief deputy to U.S. Attorney for Utah Paul Warner, would not
discuss the matter Thursday.
	   The IOC is also investigating the allegations, which have
snowballed into the biggest bribery scandal in the 104-year history
of the Olympic Games.
	   ``At this point, we're hearing lots of alleged details and all
we have now are a lot of questions and no answers,'' SLOC
spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said of the pending SLOC investigation.
``We welcome any and all scrutiny to the bid process. It's what
we've said all along, and the sooner the better.''
	   In fact, Salt Lake Olympic officials have steadfastly resisted
scrutiny, refusing to reveal their budgets, arguing their efforts
have been funded with private money.
	   The questioned scholarship program, according to the SLOC, was
initiated after Salt Lake lost the bid for the 1998 Winter Games in
1991. No new grants were given after the 1995 vote awarding the
2002 Games, although payments on previous scholarships were made as
recently as October.
	   Early reports identified most of the beneficiaries of SLOC's
largess as African IOC members.
	   In a copyright story Friday, The Salt Lake Tribune identified
Republic of Congo IOC member Jean-Claude Ganga as one of three
African members who received free medical care from Intermountain
Health Care. He was treated for a strain of hepatitis, the paper
said.
	   IHC went on to become the health care provider for the 2002
Winter Games, but did not receive any payments and will not use the
Olympic logo in advertising, said spokesman Daron Cowley.
	   Ganga became president of the African National Olympic Committee
Association in 1989, the same year that Rene Essomba, a surgeon and
IOC member from Cameroon, became the African organization's
secretary general.
	   Essomba's daughter, Sonia, has been the only scholarship
recipient that SLOC has confirmed, although SLOC president Frank
Joklik said most were from African nations. Essomba attended
American University in Washington, D.C.
	   The Associated Press has identified Suhel Attarabulsi, son of
Libyan IOC member Bashir Attarabulsi, as a second IOC relative who
may have received scholarship money. He applied to attend Brigham
Young University in 1995. On his application, the address he listed
was the Salt Lake Bid Committee offices.
	   A spokesman for BYU said Attarabulsi attended English classes
there, but did not receive credit for them. He is now enrolled at
Utah Valley State College, but did not return phone messages
Thursday.
	   His father, an IOC member since 1977, was a past vice president
of the African National Olympic Committee.
	   But tax records between 1991 and 1997 _ which provide the only
peek into the bid committee's privately funded, dlrs 13 million
pursuit of the Games _ specifically said that Olympic organizers
did not have a scholarship program.
	   SLOC spokesman Frank Zang told The Tribune on Thursday that the
committee considered the scholarship program part of its core
expenses, even though there was a line item specifically for
scholarship programs.
	   Zang said the scholarship payments, contributed from 1995 until
two months ago, are probably in a category titled ``Other.'' Before
that, they were listed as National Olympic Committee expenses.
	   Sen. John Valentine, one of the state's leading tax attorneys,
said, while he is not familiar with the specific bid committee tax
returns, if the money was for scholarships, ``They didn't do it
right.''
	   ``The instructions are pretty explicit,'' he said. ``You should
check `yes' if giving a scholarship, rather than consolidating
charitable expenses under your core function.''
	   Mayor Corradini _ a former member of the bid committee _ said
the son of IOC member David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland was
given a city government internship for one year in 1993-94.
	   Corradini spokesman Ken Connaughton said the intern, Sibu
Sibandze, worked for the city's policy and budget division for dlrs
6 an hour while attending the University of Utah, but there was no
evidence the internship was tied to the Olympic bid.
	   Roger Black, director of the management services division where
Sibandze worked, said he did not learn the intern was a relative of
an IOC member until after Sibandze was hired.
	   Sibandze's father, an IOC member since 1984, is a leading member
of the African sports community and an influential businessman.

China sharpens condemnation of U.S. for air strikes against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with commentary from People's Daily

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China criticized the United States on Friday for
launching air strikes against Iraq, calling the bombing a case of
``power politics'' that set a dangerous precedent.
	   Washington circumvented the U.N. Security Council and ignored
diplomatic norms when it acted alone in attacking Iraq, ``creating
a dangerous and odious precedent that shocked the entire world,''
the ruling Communist Party's leading newspaper, People's Daily,
said in a commentary.
	   The editorial dismissed a report by Richard Butler, the U.N.'s
chief arms inspector for Iraq, as nothing but ``an excuse'' for the
U.S. strikes.
	   China has accused Butler of withholding information showing
Iraqi progress in dismantling its nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons in a report he gave to the Security Council.
	   ``There was no legitimate reason for the U.S. military action
against Iraq,'' the People's Daily said.
	   Killing civilians and using force to try to topple another
government was ``a typical example of hegemonism and power
politics,'' it added.
	   People's Daily editorials reflect the views of the senior
leadership.
	   The newspaper editorial repeated the government's call for an
immediate stop to the strikes and a resumption of diplomacy to try
to resolve the weapons inspection crisis.

Stepping up warning, defense minister warns Iraq not to attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian protests &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister said Friday.
	   The minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, was more direct in his warning
than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who on Thursday, the
first day of U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, would only say that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not threatened to attack Israel
in retaliation for the U.S. bombings, and Mordechai told Israel
radio there has been no change in the military's assessment that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel were slim.
	   However, Israel army radio quoted a military source as saying
that Iraq has Sukhoi Su-27 warplanes with enough range to reach
Israel and that Israel has mobilized all reserves in its
anti-aircraft force.
	   Israel's military intelligence analysts believe Saddam might
fire missiles at Israel only if he were desperate or facing death.
	   Mordechai said Israel would like to see the American-British
operation achieve its goals, but that Israel has ``no interest,
directly or indirectly,'' in taking part in the fighting.
	   However, Israel ``would take whatever measures are required
against anyone who would, heaven forbid, dare to hit us,''
Mordechai told the radio.
	   Palestinians marched against the action in
Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank.
	   ``Death to America, Israel and Britain,'' shouted thousands of
the marchers in Nablus.
	   They also shouted slogans against the recent Palestinian-U.S.
rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they
saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.''

Japanese beat China for women's basketball gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with gold medal game; adds byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A speedy, sharp-passing Japanese team
broke open the game in the second half Friday, beating a bigger
Chinese squad 93-69 for the Asian Games women's basketball gold
medal.
	   The Chinese helped by committing 26 fouls to Japan's eight.
While each side had 29 field goals, Japan picked up 32 points from
39 free throws. China made 6 of 8 from the line, and three of its
players fouled out, all in the last few minutes.
	   Japan led 40-36 at halftime, briefly lost the lead, and then
surged ahead, reaching 74-60 with slightly more than 5 minutes
left.
	   Mutsuko Nagata led the winners' scoring with 23, while Chisako
Shimada had 20, including 11 of 15 free throws. Jiang Xu had 17 for
China.
	   While not making as many fast breaks as in previous games, the
Japanese still relied on speed and pinpoint passing to get inside
the Chinese defense.
	   Despite a slight height and weight advantage, China generally
shot from outside in the first half.
	   ``In the second period, we could run because we had stamina and
our footwork is good,'' said Japan's head coach Nakagawa Funikazu.
	   Japan's Kahori Kawakami was injured in the previous meeting with
China here and didn't play Friday.
	   ``I wanted to compensate for her and play my best,'' said
teammate Shimada.
	   In their first game, on Dec. 14, Japan overcame a 47-41 halftime
deficit and won 85-97.
	   In Friday's bronze medal game, Jung Sun-min scored 34 points to
pace South Korea to a 92-76 victory over Taiwan.
	   Jung, a 1.85-meter forward, hit on 14 of 17 from the field in
leading South Korea to a 52-33 lead at the half. Taiwan was plagued
by 35 percent shooting throughout the game. South Korea had 67
percent.
	   South Korea also had four other players in double figures, with
Kim Ji-yeon adding 16 and Yoo Young-joo getting 14.

Ukrainian parliament condemns attacks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament on Friday condemned
the U.S. and British strikes on Iraq, saying the use of force has
caused numerous civilian casualties.
	   The attacks against Iraq were made without U.N. approval even
though their purpose was to force compliance with United Nations'
demands, the Verkhovna Rada noted in a resolution.
	   The Rada called on the parliaments of U.N. member countries to
condemn the use of force.
	   The Rada condemnation followed that of Ukraine's Foreign
Ministry, which on Thursday called on the U.N. Security Council to
intervene to avoid a more serious military conflict.
	   The ministry warned that further military action may cause
``unpredictable consequences in the region and the entire world.''

Arabs criticize U.S. attacks, fearing more harm to Iraqis

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab governments and newspapers fiercely
criticized the U.S. airstrikes on Baghdad Friday as security
officials readied for expected anti-American demonstrations outside
mosques after the weekly Muslim prayers.
	   Throughout the Arab world, the message was that the unleashing
of missiles at the heart of Baghdad would do more harm to the Iraqi
people than to President Saddam Hussein.
	   Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura said the U.S.
strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of Iraq's people,
``particularly its children and civilians.''
	   ``We ... condemn and denounce this attack and call on the
international community to condemn and halt it immediately,'' he
said in a speech to the Parliament.
	   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, expressed his ``great concern over the military action
against Iraq and its repercussions on the Iraqi people,'' the
Emirates news agency reported late Thursday.
	   It also quoted a government spokesman as saying: ``The terrible
operation we have seen on television ... is beyond comprehension
and is unacceptable.'' The spokesman's name was not given.
	   In Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon, security officials readied for
protests over the U.S. and British attacks outside mosques or
American embassies. On Thursday, protests against the attacks
erupted in Cairo, the Lebanese capital Beirut and the Gaza Strip.
	   The Egyptian-based Arab League called an emergency meeting
Sunday to discuss the situation in Iraq.
	   Its secretary-general, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, on Thursday blamed
the attack on last week's report by U.N. chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler, saying he ``intended to provoke Iraq and not be
neutral'' in assessing Iraq's weapons programs.
	   In Lebanon, Ghassan Tweini, publisher of the leading daily
An-Nahar, urged a summit of the Arab world's leaders to demand a
halt to attacks on Iraq. He wrote that the attacks were misguided
in trying to oust Saddam.
	   ``Leave it to the Iraqis, not the Americans, not the Turks nor
the Kurds nor the Israelis ... to decide the fate of the Iraqi
regime and Saddam Hussein,'' Tweini wrote in his paper's Friday
edition.
	   The Beirut newspaper As-Safir also said that the American
attacks would give Saddam ``a new lease on life.''
	   On Thursday, the attacks on Iraq were condemned by Lebanese
Prime Minister Salim Hoss and the world's largest Muslim group, the
52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference based in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Most Iraqi opposition parties joined in the criticism of the
attacks.
	   The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose
invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the following year's Gulf War and
eight years of trade sanctions on Iraq.
	   Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister and
deputy prime minister, told the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm the current
crisis was between Iraqi and the United Nations.
	   ``We are not part of it, and we have nothing to do with it
whatsoever,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, wrote
Friday that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ``will be hanging naked from
street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the U.S. attacks end.

Cambodian who imported Taiwan waste arrested as one feared dead

<TEXT>
	   SIHANOUKVILLE, Cambodia (AP) _ The owner of a Cambodian company
that imported suspected toxic waste from Taiwan has been arrested,
government officials said on Friday, as doctors feared the
mysterious death of a port worker may be related to the refuse.
	   Prime Minister Hun Sen, who is in China visiting Cambodian King
Sihanouk, has said the waste must be sent back to Taiwan, but
Taiwan has refused to take it back.
	   The waste, resembling blocks of concrete and dirt, has been
dumped less than 100 meters (333 feet) from a village of 30
families about 10 kilometers outside the port city of
Sihanoukville, 185 kilometers (115 miles) southwest of Phnom Penh.
	   Empty hundred kilogram (220 pound) bags with markings indicating
they were from Taiwan lie next to the waste. Some bags were labeled
barium chloride.
	   Doctors at Sihanoukville Hospital said two port workers had been
admitted to the hospital on Wednesday and one had died. They did
not know what killed the port worker and have no concrete evidence
he handled the waste.
	   Pich Sovan, the port worker who died, came to the hospital
complaining of abdominal pain and shortness of breath. He went into
shock soon after and died seven or eight hours later, doctors said.
	   ``We examined him and couldn't find anything about heart disease
or lung disease,'' said Dr. Or Sophanary, chief surgeon. ``We could
not find anything about toxicology because we don't have that
equipment here.''
	   The second patient, Chhun Ravuth, also had abdominal pain and
diarrhea. The Ministry of Health wants him sent to Phnom Penh for
examination.
	   Ket Sal, a 37-year-old woman from the village near where the
waste has been dumped, said her husband had suffered diarrhea and
exhaustion after looked through the area for empty sacks he could
use to store rice.
	   Kim Sorn, a 50-year-old villager, said the waste was trucked in
about two weeks ago. It was dumped behind the district police
station, and the truck drivers gave policemen 30 packs of
cigarettes each and warned the villagers not to use water from the
area, he said.
	   Interior Minister Sar Kheng said after a Cabinet meeting in
Phnom Penh that Muk Vuthy, president of the importing company, had
been detained on Friday.
	   ``Whoever was involved in this must be hold responsible and I
don't care who,'' Sar Kheng said.
	   Environment Minister Mok Mareth blamed port officials in
Sihanoukville, customs officials and at least one government
official, whom he said were responsible.
	   ``We have the signature of the person who signed for the waste
to be brought in, but I can not reveal who that person is. He is an
official in the government,'' Mok Mareth said.

Stepping up warning, defense minister warns Iraq not to attack

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister said Friday.
	   The minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, was more direct in his warning
than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who on Thursday, the
first day of U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, would only say that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not threatened to attack Israel
in retaliation for the U.S. bombings, and Mordechai told Israel
radio there has been no change in the military's assessment that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel were slim.
	   However, Israel army radio quoted a military source as saying
that Iraq has Sukhoi Su-27 warplanes with enough range to reach
Israel and that Israel has mobilized all reserves in its
anti-aircraft force.
	   Israel's military intelligence analysts believe Saddam might
fire missiles at Israel only if he were desperate or facing death.
	   Mordechai said Israel would like to see the American-British
operation achieve its goals, but that Israel has ``no interest,
directly or indirectly,'' in taking part in the fighting.
	   However, Israel ``would take whatever measures are required
against anyone who would, heaven forbid, dare to hit us,''
Mordechai told the radio.
	   Palestinians marched against the action in
Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank.
	   ``Death to America, Israel and Britain,'' shouted thousands of
the marchers in Nablus.
	   They also shouted slogans against the recent Palestinian-U.S.
rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they
saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.''

Ukraine's oil and gas production down slightly this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's oil and natural gas production
has dropped slightly this year in comparison to 1997, officials
said Friday.
	   The country extracted 16.4 billion cubic meters (574 billion
cubic feet) of gas and 3.6 million metric tons (3.96 million tons)
of oil by Dec. 1, down 0.6 percent and 5.6 percent respectively
from the same period last year, the State Oil and Gas Committee
said.
	   Total production figures are expected to reach 18 billion cubic
meters (630 billion cubic feet) of gas and 4 million tons (4.4
million short tons) of oil by the end of 1998, the committee said.
	   Ukraine's demand for oil and gas is far above its domestic
output, and the country imports from Russia and the former Soviet
republics of Central Asia.

Protestant paramilitary group hands in weaponry, challenges IRA to

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group handed over weapons Friday
to an international commission _ and challenged its enemies in the
Irish Republican Army to do the same.
	   Under a police escort, representatives of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force carried a cache of illegal firearms, grenades and detonators
from the outlawed group's power base of Portadown, 30 miles (50
kms) west of Belfast, to the east Belfast headquarters of the
commission led by Canada's former senior soldier, Gen. John de
Chastelain.
	   They were the first weapons to be received by de Chastelain
since April's peace accord gave him the job of negotiating the
gradual disarmament of Northern Ireland's rival underground armies
by mid-2000.
	   The commission allowed TV cameras to record the destruction of
the weapons: nine submachine guns, rifles, shotguns and revolvers,
about 350 rounds of ammunition, two grenades, and six detonators.
Workers chopped off the barrels of the guns with power saws.
	   The move came more than four years after the British and Irish
governments first called for outlawed armed groups to start
disarming as a sign that their cease-fires and commitment to peace
negotiations were genuine.
	   ``It's clearly very welcome,'' said Alastair Campbell, the
spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair in London.
	   The peace accord envisioned that armed groups with politicians
involved in the negotiations _ the Irish Republican Army on the
Catholic side, and the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force on the Protestant side _ would be first to disarm.
But those groups have all balked.
	   Since their foundation in 1996, the Loyalist Volunteers had
shunned politics and dedicated themselves to wrecking the truce
being observed by the UDA and UVF. They killed more than a dozen
Catholics at random, and opposed the agreement on the grounds it
conceded too much to IRA supporters.
	   Then they called a surprise cease-fire in May, and in recent
months had said they would start disarming if the IRA reciprocated
the gesture.
	   In a brief statement, a Loyalist Volunteer Force spokesman said
the group expected the IRA to hand in 10 times as much weaponry in
coming weeks, otherwise the LVF would not repeat its gesture. The
IRA is by far the best armed of the paramilitary groups, with many
tons of weaponry smuggled from Libya in the mid-1980s.
	   The IRA and its allied Sinn Fein party dismissed in advance any
disarmament by the Loyalist Volunteers as a cynical stunt that
wouldn't influence their policy.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ South Korea's Yoon Yong-il, backed by
another group of boisterous fans from his country, defeated Japan's
Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 in Friday's Asian Games men's
tennis singles finals.
	   It was the South Koreans' second tennis gold here, but China
spoiled their bid for a third in the women's doubles, where Li Fang
and Hen Li beat Cho Yoon-jeong and Park Sung-hee 6-2, 7-6 (7-2).
	   The high-spirited Korean supporters waved flags and bursting
into chants whenever Iwabuchi couldn't return one of Yoon's shots.
	   After the two split the first two sets, Yoon jumped to a 3-0
lead in the third and stayed in control with aggressive tennis.
	   ``I am very happy as this was an unexpected result. From now, I
will dedicate myself to placing myself in the world ranking,'' said
Yoon, who was just 314th in the final ATP Tour rankings for the
year.
	   Iwabuchi said a leg injury before the games did not affect his
play.
	   ``I feel that I played better than I did in the team
competition, but I felt very tired,'' he added.
	   Earlier, the Koreans had won the men's team event, also over
Japan.
	   Men's singles bronze medals went to Indians Srinath Prahlad and
Mahesh Bhupathi, the semifinal losers.
	   In the women's doubles final the Chinese team dominated at the
start, advancing to the net and volleying, taking the opening set
in less than 30 minutes.
	   The Koreans were more defensive, with only one player at the
net, but forced the second set into a tie-break before yielding.
	   Japan's Rika Hiraki and Nana Miyagi and China's Yi Jing-qian and
Li Li received the women's doubles bronzes.
	   In Thursday's women's singles final, Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki
beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-4, 6-2.
	   Thai brothers Paradorn and Narathorn Srichaphan won the men's
doubles, and Iwabuchi and Miyagi won the mixed doubles for Japan.

New chief moves quickly to revamp Australian resources company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Paul Anderson, the new American
chief executive of Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co., on
Friday unveiled a flurry of new initiatives and asset sales aimed
at restoring strong earnings growth.
	   BHP's net profit for the fiscal first-half plummeted 45 percent
in the wake of falling commodity prices and demand.
	   Anderson warned that market conditions for the global minerals
and energy company are likely to remain tough in 1999.
	   ``Market conditions are unlikely to improve during calendar 1999
and, therefore, emphasis on reducing costs will need to continue,''
Anderson said.
	   Profit for the first-half ended Nov. 30 fell to U.S. dlrs 270
million from dlrs 491 million a year ago.
	   Lower commodity prices wiped more than dlrs 279 million from
earnings, while reduced sales cost the company dlrs 84 million.
That was partly offset by dlrs 207 million in cost cuts, and a dlrs
62 million profit on asset sales which were previously announced.
	   The profit fall was in line with market expectations and BHP's
shares rose as the market took heart from the cost cuts, asset
sales and a new initiative to wind up BHP's complicated
shareholding in anti-takeover vehicle Beswick Pty. Ltd.
	   Anderson took up the reins of the struggling resources company
barely three weeks ago, but has already moved to make good on his
promise to push ahead with assets sales, announcing on Friday dlrs
720 million worth of a new sales.
	   BHP has sold its manganese business to U.K.-based Billiton PLC
for around dlrs 404 million.
	   The company has also jettisoned a portfolio of power assets,
which have been snapped up for dlrs 310 million by Anderson's
previous employer, Duke Energy Corp.
	   BHP is targeting dlrs 1.2 billion worth of asset sales a year
for the next several years, and Anderson told reporters that the
pace of the asset review is set to accelerate.
	   Anderson also moved to revamp the corporate structure of the
mining and minerals businesses, and said more restructuring will be
announced later.

Hong Kong banks cut interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong banking cartel that sets
commercial interest rates in the territory cut its savings deposit
rate Friday by a quarter percentage point to 4.25 percent, the
fourth such cut in four months.
	   The widely-anticipated decision by the Hong Kong Association of
Banks was followed by matching changes in the prime lending rates
at several big commercial banks.
	   Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp., Standard Chartered Bank,
Hang Seng Bank and Bank of China all lowered lending rates for
their most trusted clients to 9.00 percent from 9.25 percent,
effective Monday.
	   David Carse, deputy chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,
the territory's de facto central bank, told reporters the latest
round of cuts could also help banks reduce the danger of growing
problem loans because ``it helps with the cash flow of their
customers.''
	   He added that the rate reduction shows that local banks are
trying to strike a balance between their own profitability and
customer needs.
	   On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings of

	   The Hong Kong economy shrank by 7 percent in the third quarter

1998. Economists say a rebound is unlikely until the second half of
next year.

	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand
lifted off Friday morning in the world's largest balloon, hoping to
steer it on a landmark round-the-world trip.
	   Blessed by good winds and perfect weather, the 12-ton,
200-foot-high (61-meter-high) ICO Global Challenge, under escort of
Moroccan helicopters, climbed 600 feet (183 meters) a minute
through a cloudless sky after being cut loose from a Moroccan air
force base.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said shortly before liftoff, delayed by two hours. ``After
that we can start to relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   The team was expected to leave Moroccan territory later Friday
for neighboring Algeria.
	   ``When (the balloon) gets to 28,000 feet (8,535 meters), it
enters the jet stream and really takes off,'' said Mike Johnson, a
spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone company supporting the
trip.
	   The balloon is expected to reach a cruising speed of 150-200 mph
(240-320 kph), he said.
	   This was Branson's fifth try to be the first person to make the
round-the-world balloon voyage.
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip which could last from eight days
to nearly three weeks.
	   The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task,
Branson said.
	   ``This flight around the world would have taken 9 and a half
days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told reporters.
	   ``Now, we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 days.''
	   The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds to
take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over
Saudi Arabia.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea,
said
	   The tycoon of the Virgin group said he planned to enter the
United States near San Francisco. ``We're going to go under the
bridge,'' he joked Thursday, referring to the Golden Gate.

Philippine shares close slightly higher, peso gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing exchange rate

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine shares closed slightly
higher in mixed trading on Friday as some investors hunted for
bargains while others took profits, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed up 8.06
points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,886.30 for a second session in a row
of modest gains. Declines, however, outnumbered advances 57 to 40,
while 31 issues were unchanged.
	   Dealers said the main index broke the key level of 1,900 points
about a hour into the session.
	   ``The market was fairly strong when the index was heading
towards 1,900 points,'' said Jose Ricardo Garcia, vice president
for Diversified Securities Inc.
	   ``But the resistance level proved to be a tough one because
profit-taking soon followed after the index broke that level,''
Garcia said.
	   The U.S.-led air strike against Iraq had little impact on the
market, said Garcia, adding further attacks on Iraq were widely
anticipated.
	   The Philippine peso closed higher against the U.S. dollar
Friday, with the second round of U.S.-led air strikes on Iraq
having no impact on trading, dealers said.
	   Dollar demand remained slack and moderate dollar inflows entered
the market from foreign portfolio managers paying for recent
purchases in the local equities market.
	   At the close, the dollar averaged 39.352 pesos on the Philippine
Dealing System, down from Thursday's average of 39.510 pesos.
	   ``The market chose to ignore the latest attack on Iraq,'' a
trader with a foreign bank said.
	   Demand for dollars remained muted while some dollar inflows were
registered from foreign portfolio managers making last-minute,
short-term investments in the local equities market prior to the
Christmas break.
	   Traders said some further dollar inflows are expected from stock
market and foreign direct investors. Remittances from Filipinos
working overseas are believed to have been exhausted.

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg
of Germany proved she was just as skilled in the speed events as
the technical, winning a women's World Cup downhill on Friday, her
first career victory in the dicispline.
	   Gerg, whose previous best downhill result was second place in
Val d'Isere over a year ago, shot down the icy hard 2,500-meter
(8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours course in 1 minute, 41.13 seconds.
	   The 1997 overall World Cup champion Pernilla Wiberg, still
seeking her first victory of the season, settled for second,
crossing in 1:41.55.
	   Italy's Bibiana Perez was the day's other surprise, the Italian
finishing third behind Gerg in 1:41.63, for her first career
downhill podium.
	   Overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of four races this
season including back-to-back victories in Val d'Isere last week,
placed fourth in 1:41.92.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Local Muslims and members of a pro-Beijing
political party staged separate demonstrations in Hong Kong on
Friday to protest the recent U.S. military air strikes on Iraq.
	   Meanwhile, police said they found a ``suspicious object'' in the
U.S. consulate compound Friday and cordoned off the area.
	   Police firearms experts were sent to the consulate to
investigate, said a police spokesman, speaking on the customary
condition of anonymity. He declined to give further details.
	   This followed an attack Thursday night, when an unidentified man
hurled a bottle and a rock into the compound. No injuries were
reported.
	   Security near the consulate was visibly heavier on Friday.
	   Earlier, about 200 Muslims, chanting ``Down with U.S.A.,''
demonstrated in front of the territory's largest mosque in the
tourist and commercial district of Tsim Sha Tsui.
	   They said the bombing was an affront to Muslims around the
world.
	   Separately, about 20 members of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong, including several lawmakers and city
council members, staged a 15-minute march from a downtown park to
the U.S. Consulate.
	   They accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of bombing innocent
Iraqi civilians to divert attention from the impending impeachment
hearing involving his sexual affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``Against U.S. killing of innocent people,'' the protesters
chanted in front of the consulate under heavy police surveillance.
	   A protester presented Robert Laing, the consulate's information
services director, with a petition along with a pillow which had a
pink piece of paper on top of it displaying the words: ``Bill, no
war for Monica.''
	   ``We never believe the use of force is the best means to solve
international crisis,'' said lawmaker Tsang Yok-sing.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and set the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   But as a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   Iraqi newspapers urged the public to rally behind President
Saddam Hussein.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' Babil newspaper said in large red
letters on its front page.
	   Below the slogan was a drawing of Saddam dressed in a
traditional white Arab robe atop a white horse hurling a spear at a
black, hissing snake.
	   The newspaper urged Iraqis to ``show their readiness for
sacrifice and their readiness to face the evil aggressors.''
	   In an apparent effort to incite the public to rise up against
Saddam, U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets over southern Iraq on
Thursday, an Information Ministry official said.
	   He said the leaflets were designed to ``arouse the people'' but
gave no further details.
	   The largely Shiite Muslim south rebelled against Saddam
following the 1991 Gulf War, but the uprising was suppressed by
Iraqi forces.
	   Saudi armored units briefly moved close to the Iraqi border
Thursday, apparently on a surveillance mission, the Iraqi official
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers were evacuated by
bus to the Jordanian capital Amman, a U.N. official told The
Associated Press. U.N. executives had hoped to keep the workers _
who monitor food aid for Iraqis _ in place, but apparently reversed
the decision after the Thursday night bombardment.
	   CNN said that U.N. workers spent most of the night huddled under
a staircase listening to explosions and shattering glass from U.S.
strikes near their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Some 28 U.N. humanitarian workers deemed ``essential'' remained
in Baghdad. The U.N. official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   To protest the strikes, Iraq's ally Russia on Friday recalled
its ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came a
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled.
	   The Pentagon said more than 200 missiles hit 50 sensitive sites
in the first attack, including Saddam's military intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks for special security
guards who protect weapons sites.
	   An assessment of the damage from the second round of attack
wasn't immediately available.
	   There was also no word on casualties from the bombardment late
Thursday and Friday, ending about 4 a.m. (0100 gmt)
	   At least three explosions were heard in this city of 5 million,
the result of incoming missiles or bombs. Loud reports also were
created by anti-aircraft guns firing at the unseen enemy.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said earlier that at least
25 people were killed and 75 were injured before the latest round
of bombings.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there have been no
American casualties.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals would find it hard to cope with
the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a
Baghdad hospital damaged by explosions.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq for
its alleged obstruction of the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of the illegal weapons,
the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Clinton said ``it would have been a disaster'' if the United
States had allowed Saddam to defy UNSCOM without any penalty.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops and 22 warships _ including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles _ in the Gulf as well as 210
aircraft. The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   The United States has said the strikes, which will last several
days, are aimed at military installations in a bid to degrade
Saddam's ability to harm U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
the real U.S. aim is to topple Saddam. ``I don't think it is a
question of those weapons,'' he said on CNN.
	   The strikes have divided the 15-member Security Council, with
Russia, China and Kenya supporting Iraq's demand for a cease-fire.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow would insist on
dismissal of UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler, whose negative report
about Iraq triggered the U.S.-British action.
	   In the report Tuesday, Butler said Iraq had reneged on its Nov.
14 pledge to cooperate with his inspectors. He cited Iraq's refusal
to allow entry into five sites, including an office of Iraq's
ruling Baath Party.
	   Butler defended his report and dismissed as ``utterly wrong''
any suggestion that it was timed to help Clinton deflect attention
from impeachment proceedings over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address
on Thursday, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to
face'' but ``depending on a long technological arm.''

Australia angry at Japan's new rice tariffs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer on Friday lashed out at Japan's decision to impose massive
tariffs on rice imports, even though the tariffs fell short of the
1,200 percent levy feared by Australia.
	   Japan plans to impose a tariff on imported rice of Australian
dollars 4.85 (U.S. dlrs 3) a kilo (2.2 pounds) from April next
year, which equals a duty of 400 to 600 percent.
	   The duty will not affect Australia's existing sales to Japan,
which are worth Australian dollars 72 million (U.S. dlrs 44.6
million) a year, but will choke off any growth in the market for
Australian farmers.
	   Fischer, a long time critic of Japan's severe restrictions on
foreign rice, again hinted at retaliatory action and long term
damage to Japan if it continued to protect its farmers.
	   ``I'm very angry at this decision and the lack of leadership it
represents with Japan, the second largest economy in the world,
going down this particular pathway,'' he told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   ``(If it's) good enough that they seek to export their four
wheel drives to Australia and elsewhere and expect no more than a
five per cent tariff in that regard, here they are in fact laying
down a shocking example.''
	   Fischer last week ordered the Japanese Ambassador be called in
to be told of Australia's concern about the rice tariff, and has
held talks with U.S. officials about joint action over the tariff.
	   Japan insists that its action is legal under World Trade
Organization rules.
	   The National Farmers' Federation said the rice tariff was a
major blow to international efforts to free up world trade in
agriculture at next year's world trade talks.
	   ``The decision sends an unfortunate signal to the rest of the
world at a time when momentum is building for further trade
liberalization in agriculture,'' president Ian Donges said.
	   Donges said Japan was a nation built on free trade, and a
reversion to trade protectionism could only harm efforts to drag
the Japanese economy out of recession.
	   ``Japan should reflect carefully where its own interests lie.
	   ``The reality is that world trade and more open markets are the
most powerful engine of economic growth and Japan itself has a
powerful motive for maintaining cooperative trade relations to lift
its economy out of recession.''

U.S. fighter pilots carry out bombing raids on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Overcoming last-minute jitters,
U.S. fighter pilots completed a second round of bombing missions
over Iraq on Friday and most said they believed they hit their
intended targets.
	   ``I was a bit nervous when I entered Iraqi airspace,'' said Lt.
Will Powers, who pilots an FA-18. ``But after dropping a 1,000
pound bomb on an Iraqi military bunker, I felt more confident.''
	   Powers, 29, an Arizona native, was among pilots who returned
late Thursday and early Friday from bombing missions over Iraq. The
U.S. Navy barred reporters from filing their stories until the last
jet returned safely to the carrier Enterprise at about 6:30 a.m.
(0330 gmt).
	   Powers' jet fired high speed anti-radiation missiles during the
latest strike, which began after midnight Thursday.
	   He said an ``Iraqi surface-to-air defense encampment kept firing
at us, but we were flying at a very high and safe altitude.''
	   Cmdr. Mike Shoemaker, 38, of Miami, Florida, an executive
officer for one of the fighter squadrons, said the air action was
``very exciting but very challenging.''
	   Shoemaker, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, said that his pilots
``learned lots'' from the air strikes but added: ``We still have to
be very alert.''
	   He was strike leader for some 13 warplanes, including four F-16s
flown from Kuwait.
	   Dozens of aircraft roared off the deck of the carrier starting
about 5:30 p.m. (1430 gmt) Thursday to carry out the second round
of bombing. Further assaults came later Thursday and Friday
morning, and more attacks were expected Friday night.
	   Officers on the carrier refuse to identify targets for security
reasons, and troops aboard the carrier were on highest alert.
	   Fighter pilots told reporters that they had to overcome a series
of technical obstacles in carrying out their mission.
	   ``It is very difficult out there,'' said Lt. Chris Claflin, 32,
an FA-18 pilot from Miami, Florida.
	   ``You have to watch out for accompanying aircraft to see you
don't crash into them and ... you are looking down in the night
vision screen for bombing targets below, which are sometimes hidden
under sand, and then you have the enemy shooting at you,'' he said.
	   ``You have a couple of minutes to shoot at the target at such
high speeds, which can make things very difficult.''
	   Lt. Cmdr. Scott Fisher of San Diego California, who has been
flying fighter jets for 10 years, said he dropped a 2,300 pound
bomb on one target in Iraq.
	   ``It showed up a big explosion on my screen. I know I definitely
hit the target,'' said Fisher an F-14 fighter pilot, who added that
for good luck he always looks at pictures of his wife and children
before he zooms off the carrier deck.

Russian minister skips meeting with NATO defense ministers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with further details, quotes, Ukraine &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Russia expressed its displeasure with
the American and British bombing of Iraq by ordering its defense
minister to skip Friday's scheduled meeting with NATO, sending only
an ambassador instead.
	   The move came as Moscow recalled its ambassadors from the United
States and Britain for consultation and denounced the air raids on
Iraq, conducted, the Americans say, because the government of
President Saddam Hussein has refused to cooperate fully with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   ``Russia cannot pretend nothing happened,'' Sergei Kislyak,
Russia's ambassador to NATO, told reporters after the meeting.
	   ``We understand NATO is not participating in this action, but
two of the big countries of the alliance area organizing the
operation.''
	   Part of the second day of the NATO defense ministers two-day,
year-end meeting is usually set aside for a meeting of the
Russia-NATO Joint Permanent Council, a new body created in 1996 in
the wake of plans to enlarge NATO.
	   On Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin ordered Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev to stay home.
	   The meeting went ahead anyway. According to a source who
attended the session, speaking on condition of anonymity, Kislyak
read out a statement from Sergeyev telling the ministers he was not
coming - and that they knew why - but also affirming he is
committed to the NATO-Russia relationship.
	   Defense ministers from Germany, Denmark, Greece, Turkey, the
Netherlands, Canada and Norway attended, along with lower-ranking
officials from other NATO countries, and Kislyak.
	   ``Even in moments in which we disagree, we are determined to
continue our cooperation,'' said NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana. ``The PJC will continue to be a pole of stability.''
	   Allied defense ministers made clear to Russia that Iraq is not
the responsibility of NATO, and that though certain of the allies
may be involved, they are not involved because of their position in
NATO. Nonetheless, the issue did take up a substantial part of the
meeting.
	   What the Russians heard was not the NATO position on Iraq, but a
series of national positions, a NATO official said, speaking
anonymously.
	   ``There was an enormous amount of commonality,'' he said. ``They
all stressed that they held Iraq as the party responsible. All
ministers stressed the danger that an unfettered Saddam Hussein
poses.''
	   Nonetheless, the Russians are concerned about what such action
means for the future. As U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
stressed at last week's NATO foreign ministers meeting, the threat
from weapons of mass destruction can originate from far beyond
NATO's borders.
	   The alliance's strategic concept, the military and political
principles which guide the alliance's mission, is now being revised
for presentation to the next NATO summit in Washington in April.
New threats being addressed in that concept include regional
conflicts, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction of a kind Iraq
is believed trying to produce.
	   The Russians fear, Kislyak said, that the bombing of Iraq may
represent a precedent for new kinds of NATO action outside its
traditional territory.
	   The NATO ministers also met with Gen. Olexander Kuzmuk,
Ukraine's defense minister, as part of regular meetings of the new
NATO-Ukraine Commission.
	   Ukraine's Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned the airstrikes
on Iraq and called on the U.N. Security Council to stop it.
	   Kuzmuk said, however, that this action should not harm his
country's budding relationship with NATO.
	   ``Today, there are no grounds to say it will negatively
influence our cooperation with NATO,'' Kuzmuk said.

Philippine president criticizes justice secretary for filing tax
</HEADLINE>
case

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
on Friday criticized his own justice secretary for filing a tax
evasion case against business tycoon Lucio Tan without having
coordinated the move with the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas ``should have coordinated with
the BIR people so that the case will be strong,'' Estrada told
reporters aboard a plane while on his way to visit Thailand from
Vietnam.
	   Estrada was on a state visit to Vietnam after attending the
summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Hanoi.
	   A transcript of the interview was distributed to reporters in
Manila.
	   ``The BIR is involved here. It's the BIR which will be the
complainant, not the DOJ. So that goes to show that the Justice
Secretary committed a big blunder,'' Estrada said.
	   The Department of Justice charged Tan, his flagship company,
Fortune Tobacco Corp., and nine dummy companies of defrauding the
government of 25.6 billion pesos (dlrs 656 million) in taxes
between 1990 and 1992.
	   Tan, one of wealthiest men in the Philippines and a supporter of
Estrada during in the May 11 presidential election, has denied the
allegation. He claimed the tax cases were brought against him for
not supporting former President Fidel Ramos' candidacy in 1992.
	   Tan also has interests in brewing and banking and is chairman
and chief stockholder of ailing Philippine Airlines.
	   When the justice department filed the charges early this month,
Estrada said the charges show that ``nobody is above the law''
under his administration.
	   ``If there is evidence, nothing can stop the charges, so nobody
is exempted,'' Estrada said.
	   Asked whether he has lost confidence in Cuevas, Estrada said:
``Not necessarily. I will study that matter.''
	   Cuevas refused to comment directly on Estrada's statement that
he made a blunder, but he said, ``We will abide by the decision of
the president on the Tan case.''
	   The Bureau of Internal Revenue has changed its view of the Tan
case since Estrada's election.
	   Revenue chief Beethoven Rualo was quoted by a local newspaper as
saying the case against Tan would not succeed because the evidence
``will not stand up to the scrutiny of the court.''
	   Rualo, who took office after Estrada assumed the presidency on
June 30, reversed his predecessor's position that there was
voluminous evidence supporting the government's charges against
Tan.
	   Following Rualo's statement, Estrada's spokesman, Jerry Barican,
said that considering the revenue agency's new assessment of the
case, the government will not spend money ``in a complicated tax
case like this ... knowing fully well that at the end of the day
the evidence it has on hand may not be sufficient.''
	   Tan's lawyer, Estelito Mendoza, claimed the tax evasion charges
were filed without the approval of the head of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue, a requirement under the country's tax law.
	   The BIR had already charged Tan with tax evasion in 1993. But
that case did not proceed because Tan, in a series of appeals that
reached the Supreme Court, managed to get the charges suspended
pending an investigation by the justice department.

Philippines scraps budget allocation for payment to Swiss customs
</HEADLINE>
firm

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government has decided
not to allocate funds to pay a Swiss customs surveillance firm
which President Joseph Estrada claims has failed to curb smuggling,
a senior official said Friday.
	   Estrada last month also said the Societe Generale de
Surveillance also has failed to transfer know-how to Filipinos
since operating more than 10 years ago.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said a bilateral
congressional budget committee reached a ``consensus'' late
Thursday not the allocate the money in the 1999 budget.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu last month said the contract
with SGS, which began operating in the late 1980s under former
President Corazon Aquino, was supposed to expire in October but was
extended to 1999 by the previous administration of Estrada's
predecessor, Fidel Ramos.
	   Estrada said he was surprised by the extension ``considering
that the service has been bad and smuggling continued.''
	   ``We will review the contract to see if we still need its
services,'' he said last month.
	   Espiritu said the contract with SGS included transfer of
technology or know-how, which has not been accomplished despite
over a decade of operation.
	   He said the government owes SGS about 5 billion pesos (dlrs
125.6 million) in service fees, including 1 billion (dlrs 25.3
million) for 1998 alone.
	   Espiritu also said that SGS services should have been phased out
after the Philippines shifted from customs taxation based on home
consumption value to transaction value.
	   Estrada and Espiritu did not cite specific cases of smuggling.
Customs and SGS officials were unavailable for comment.
	   The Geneva-based company is the world's largest inspection
services group. It supervises customs and other import-export
services for many other countries.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and set the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   But as a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light since Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   Iraqi newspapers urged the public to rally behind President
Saddam Hussein.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' Babil newspaper said in large red
letters on its front page.
	   Below the slogan was a drawing of Saddam dressed in a
traditional white Arab robe atop a white horse hurling a spear at a
black, hissing snake.
	   The newspaper urged Iraqis to ``show their readiness for
sacrifice and their readiness to face the evil aggressors.''
	   In an apparent effort to incite the public to rise up against
Saddam, U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets over southern Iraq on
Thursday, an Information Ministry official said.
	   He said the leaflets were designed to ``arouse the people'' but
gave no further details.
	   The largely Shiite Muslim south rebelled against Saddam
following the 1991 Gulf War, but the uprising was suppressed by
Iraqi forces.
	   Saudi armored units briefly moved close to the Iraqi border
Thursday, apparently on a surveillance mission, the Iraqi official
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise missiles.
British Tornado jets also participated in the operation, named
``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers were evacuated by
bus to the Jordanian capital Amman, a U.N. official told The
Associated Press. U.N. executives had hoped to keep the workers _
who monitor food aid for Iraqis _ in place, but apparently reversed
the decision after the Thursday night bombardment.
	   CNN said that U.N. workers spent most of the night huddled under
a staircase listening to explosions and shattering glass from U.S.
strikes near their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Some 28 U.N. humanitarian workers deemed ``essential'' remained
in Baghdad. The U.N. official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   To protest the strikes, Iraq's ally Russia on Friday recalled
its ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came a
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled.
	   The Pentagon said more than 200 missiles hit 50 sensitive sites
in the first attack, including Saddam's military intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks for special security
guards who protect weapons sites.
	   An assessment of the damage from the second round of attack
wasn't immediately available.
	   There was also no word on casualties from the bombardment late
Thursday and Friday, ending about 4 a.m. (0100 GMT)
	   At least three explosions were heard in this city of 5 million,
the result of incoming missiles or bombs. Loud reports also were
created by anti-aircraft guns firing at the unseen enemy.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said earlier that at least
25 people were killed and 75 were injured before the latest round
of bombings.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there have been no
American casualties.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals would find it hard to cope with
the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a
Baghdad hospital damaged by explosions.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq
for its alleged obstruction of the U.N. Special Commission, which
is responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of the illegal weapons,
the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Clinton said ``it would have been a disaster'' if the United
States had allowed Saddam to defy UNSCOM without any penalty.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops and 22 warships _ including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles _ in the Gulf as well as 210
aircraft. The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   The United States has said the strikes are aimed at military
installations in a bid to degrade Saddam's ability to harm U.S.
interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
the real U.S. aim is to topple Saddam. ``I don't think it is a
question of those weapons,'' he said on CNN.
	   The strikes have divided the 15-member Security Council, with
Russia, China and Kenya supporting Iraq's demand for a cease-fire.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow would insist on
dismissal of UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler, whose negative report
about Iraq triggered the U.S.-British action.

Taiwan's provincial government fades into history
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The provincial government of Taiwan that
was maintained by the ruling Nationalist party to give the
appearance that they were the rulers of mainland China will be
disbanded all but in name on Saturday.
	   The 70 deputies of the provincial assembly bid farewell to each
other after convening an emotional last meeting on Friday.
	   James Soong, the powerful Taiwan governor, did not attend the
meeting. He will officially step down Saturday after completing a
four-year term as the first popularly elected governor.
	   After the Nationalists fled to Taiwan from mainland China in
1949, they retained the provincial government as a symbol that the
island was still a province of China.
	   But the Nationalists' claim to governing all of China has since
been dropped, and the provincial government has been criticized as
an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy whose functions widely overlap
those of the central government.
	   The decision to trim down the provincial government in late 1996
triggered a rift between Soong and President Lee Teng-hui. Soong
has attacked the decision as a plot by rivals to destroy his power
base.
	   Soong is widely expected to run for president in 2000 against
the party's favorite frontrunner, Vice President Lien Chan. A
recent Gallup Poll showed Soong well ahead of Lien in popularity.
	   At a meeting Thursday, President Lee told Soong that party
members must show compromise to help with the government's overall
development.
	   Soong did not disclose his future career plans, nor did he say
whether he would accept an offer by Lee to appoint him as an
adviser, an honorary position for retirees.
	   On Monday, State Minister Chao Shou-po will replace Soong as
governor to oversee the downsizing of the provincial government,
whose 10,000 employees will retire or be reassigned to other
government offices.

Police holding leader of party after he criticized Museveni
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police were holding a businessman and
founder of an opposition political party on unspecified charges
Friday after he publicly criticized President Yoweri Museveni, a
police spokesman said.
	   Spokesman John Ngobi said Chapaa Karuhanga, the head of the
National Democratic Forum, which he founded three years ago, was
being questioned by police and that details about possible charges
were not available.
	   Karuhanga, 45, was arrested Thursday after he told a party rally
that Museveni was worse than his predecessors, Milton Obote and Idi
Amin Dada.
	   ``Amin and Obote were dictators, but Museveni is both a dictator
and corrupt,'' Karuhanga was quoted as telling the tri-weekly
Crusader newspaper last week.
	   Obote, now in exile in Zambia, was president from 1963 until his
overthrow by Amin in 1971. He was president again from 1981 to
1985.
	   Amin ruled Uganda from 1971 until he was ousted by combined
Ugandan-Tanzanian forces in 1979. During his eight years in power,
at least 400,000 people were killed by his security police.
	   Museveni fought a successful five-year guerrilla war against
Obote's government and has ruled Uganda since 1986. He was elected
president in May 1996.
	   After coming to power, Museveni and his National Resistance
Movement suspended the election-related activities of political
parties and refused to recognize any parties formed after 1986.
	   Parties formed before 1986 can exist, but they cannot hold
rallies or carry out political activities.
	   Several members of Museveni's government, including his brother,
Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, who was his special military adviser, have
been forced to resign following publication of a parliamentary
report on high-level corruption.
	   Also on Thursday, police raided the offices of the Crusader
newspaper and took editor George Lugalambi and reporter Meddie
Musisi in for questioning.
	   Deputy editor Sarah Mirembe said police also took files and
adminsitrative information.

U.S. fighter pilots carry out bombing raids on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS ENTERPRISE (AP) _ Overcoming last-minute jitters,
U.S. fighter pilots completed a second round of bombing missions
over Iraq on Friday and most said they believed they hit their
intended targets.
	   ``I was a bit nervous when I entered Iraqi airspace,'' said Lt.
Will Powers, who pilots an FA-18. ``But after dropping a 1,000
pound bomb on an Iraqi military bunker, I felt more confident.''
	   Powers, 29, an Arizona native, was among pilots who returned
late Thursday and early Friday from bombing missions over Iraq. The
U.S. Navy barred reporters from filing their stories until the last
jet returned safely to the carrier Enterprise at about 6:30 a.m.
(0330 GMT).
	   Powers' jet fired high speed anti-radiation missiles during the
latest strike, which began after midnight Thursday.
	   He said an ``Iraqi surface-to-air defense encampment kept firing
at us, but we were flying at a very high and safe altitude.''
	   Cmdr. Mike Shoemaker, 38, of Miami, Florida, an executive
officer for one of the fighter squadrons, said the air action was
``very exciting but very challenging.''
	   Shoemaker, a veteran of the 1991 Gulf War, said that his pilots
``learned lots'' from the air strikes but added, ``We still have to
be very alert.''
	   He was strike leader for some 13 warplanes, including four F-16s
flown from Kuwait.
	   Dozens of aircraft roared off the deck of the carrier starting
at about 5:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) Thursday to carry out the second
round of bombing. Further assaults came later Thursday and Friday
morning, and more attacks were expected Friday night.
	   Officers on the carrier refuse to identify targets for security
reasons, and troops aboard the carrier were on highest alert.
	   Fighter pilots told reporters that the mission was difficult.
	   ``It is very difficult out there,'' said Lt. Chris Claflin, 32,
an FA-18 pilot from Miami, Florida.
	   ``You have to watch out for accompanying aircraft to see you
don't crash into them and ... you are looking down in the night
vision screen for bombing targets below, which are sometimes hidden
under sand, and then you have the enemy shooting at you,'' he said.
	   ``You have a couple of minutes to shoot at the target at such
high speeds, which can make things very difficult.''
	   Lt. Cmdr. Scott Fisher of San Diego California, who has been
flying fighter jets for 10 years, said he dropped a 2,300 pound
(1,000 kilo) bomb on one target in Iraq.
	   ``It showed up a big explosion on my screen. I know I definitely
hit the target,'' said Fisher an F-14 fighter pilot, who added that
for good luck he always looks at pictures of his wife and children
before he takes off from the carrier deck.

German doctors stage strike to protest income cap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German doctors shut their doors Friday in a
nationwide day of protest against a new law capping their incomes.
	   Germany's main medical association called on 110,000 doctors
with private practices to strike and use the day to inform patients
about their complaints instead. Only emergency treatment was being
assured.
	   It was the first major protest against a project by Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's 7-week-old center-left government, which wants
to bolster Germany's generous welfare state but also cut its cost.
	   Some 4,000 doctors rallied in Bonn as the upper house of
parliament met to pass the new law. Wider figures on strike
participation were not immediately available.
	   Health Minister Andrea Fischer accused the doctors of sowing
panic. They can't expect ``an unlimited guarantee of above-average
wealth,'' she told the Cologne newspaper Express.
	   Doctors charge the income cap, coupled with a cut in the budget
for medicine, means patients won't be assured of full care and may
be deprived of advances in science.
	   But the strike has been controversial among doctors, with some
arguing it was too drastic a step.
	   Karsten Vilmar, head of the German Medical Association,
triggered outrage last week by claiming that lower incomes for
doctors meant patients would die sooner. He has since apologized
for the remark.
	   The new law limits the rise in the fees that the federally
regulated health insurance system will pay doctors to 1.2 billion
marks (dlrs 720 million) next year, or about 3 percent.
	   Fischer said that reflects the expected average increase in
wages in other fields. ``I believe this is justified,'' she said in
parliament.
	   At the same time, the new law lowers the amounts that insured
patients pay out of their own pocket for prescription drugs.

British newsman's drug possession case goes to Malaysian high court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - A British journalist charged with
trafficking 65 grams of heroin had his case transferred to
Malaysia's high court, a news report said Friday.
	   David Anthony Chell, 55, of Stoke-on Trent was arrested at Bayan
Lepas Airport in the northern state of Penang as he was about to
board a flight to Perth, Australia, the New Straits Times reported.
	   Chell has been charged under the Southeast Asian nation's
Dangerous Drugs Act, which carries the mandatory death sentence for
those found guilty.
	   Airport personnel allegedly found heroin-filled condoms on him,
the paper said. He reportedly committed the offense on October 7.
	   Magistrate Roslan Hamid said Chell's case would be heard at the
high court at a date to be decided later.

South Korean Cabinet official resigns after criticizing government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean Cabinet member resigned
on Friday, two days after he criticized a government effort to
restructure the country's debt-ridden industrial conglomerates.
	   President Kim Dae-jung will appoint a successor to Information
and Communications Minister Bae Soon-hoon as early as Saturday, the
presidential office said. It released no further details.
	   On Wednesday, Bae told industry leaders that he was disappointed
by a government-initiated agreement under which the Daewoo
conglomerate was to swap its electronics subsidiary with the auto
subsidiary of Samsung Group.
	   It was widely seen as an unusual move for a Cabinet minister to
make such criticisms public. The remarks were aimed at a
controversial deal considered to be the a centerpiece of President
Kim's efforts to force South Korea's conglomerates to streamline
their bloated operations.
	   Kim has said such restructuring is crucial to boosting foreign
confidence in the country's battered economy.
	   But thousands of Daewoo Electronics and Samsung Motors workers
have held daily protest rallies for the past week, demanding that
the government cancel the swap deal. They fear the swap will result
in massive layoffs.
	   Bae, who served as chairman of Daewoo Electronics Co. before his
Cabinet appointment in March, said the company can survive on its
own and that the swap deal was ill-conceived.
	   Under the accord, Samsung Motors will be absorbed by Daewoo
Motors, the nation's No. 2 carmaker, while Daewoo Electronics will
be merged into Samsung's home appliance arm, the nation's largest.

Ito wins third sprint gold; second doping case reported
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Ito 200 record to 20.16, 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito once again was the
fastest on foot Friday, winning his third Asian Games gold medal,
while Chinese did their speeding on water, rowing off with five
golds.
	   A second doping case was disclosed, another weightlifter, but
the president of the games' governing body found a bright side in
that no medalists had been found cheating.
	   And with the Chinese far ahead in the overall gold standings,
any victory over them was a cause for celebration.
	   Those with bragging rights Friday included Sri Lanka's
Damayanthi Darsha, who edged ahead of Asian record holder Li Xuemei
of China in the women's 200 meters, and the Japanese women's
basketball team, 93-69 winners over a bigger Chinese team in the
gold medal game.
	   Ito also beat a Chinese in the men's 200, but he was far from
the underdog. He already had established himself as Asia's fastest
man by winning the 100 and anchoring Japan's victorious 400-meter
relay quartet, and by running a 10-flat in the 100 semifinals.
	   His winning time, 20.25 to the 20.75 of China's Han Chaoming,
was slower than his Asian record of 20.16. But, he said, ``the
record will be broken by somebody one day but the medal will never
be taken away.''
	   His triumphs have made him one of the favorites to collect the
U.S. dlrs 100,000 being offered to the games' MVP by the Olympic
Council of Asia.
	   Supriati Sutono, who was carried off the track on a stretcher
after edging India's Sunita Rani by .01 second in the women's
5,000, gave Indonesia its first games track and field gold since
1962.
	   Darsha's victory gave Sri Lanka its third gold, the country's
best result at any Asian Games, and was her own second, following
triumph in the 400.
	   She won in 22.48 seconds, with Li second in 22.53.
	   South Korean Lee Jin-taek won the men's high jump, and
Uzbekistan had a 1-2 finish in the decathlon as Oleg Veretelnikov
beat 1994 winner Ramil Ganiev.
	   China's Wang Yinghang overcame two warnings and overtook
favorite Sergey Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final kilometer to
win the men's 50-kilometer walk.
	   By late afternoon, China had boosted its gold total here to 109,
well ahead of South Korea's 62. Japan had 50.
	   Meanwhile, the Olympic Council of Asia announced that
weightlifter Jaber Al-Ajmi, the 10th place finisher in the over
105-kilogram division, had tested positive for nandrolone, a banned
anabolic steroid. The International Weightlifting Federation was to
decide his punishment.
	   But OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, who also is Kuwaiti,
said he was ``happy that there have been only two cases, not
important cases, not involving champions.''
	   In the last games, in 1994 in Hiroshima, Japan, 15 positive
tests were reported, and 11 of them involved medalists, he noted.
	   While the Japanese women beat China for one basketball gold, the
Chinese men foiled the Philippines' all-out campaign to climb back
to the top of Asian basketball by fielding a team of professional
stars. The Chinese beat the Filipinos 82-73 in a semifinal.
	   For the gold, they will play South Korea, a 101-64 winner over
Kazakstan.
	   In rowing, China swept all five of the day's golds, and coach
Gao Hongyin said, ``Now we are on the right track to clean sweep
the Asiad rowing gold medals for the third time.''
	   In the last games in 1994, China won 11 of 12 rowing golds. They
had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   The Chinese were stung by failures at the rowing World
Championships in September, and called a special training camp
before the Asian Games. Gao said the rowers had advice in training
from track coach Ma Junren, whose ``Ma's army'' of women distance
runners set world records in the early 1990s.
	   Because of a dispute with national officials, none of Ma's
runners is in the Asian Games, but Ma went to the rowers' training
camp.
	   The Chinese gained still another gold when Li Fang and Chen Li
beat South Koreans Cho Yoon-jeong and Park Sung-hee 6-2, 7-6 (7-2)
in women's doubles tennis.
	   But South Korea's Yoon Yong-il won the men's singles gold,
beating Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.
	   The South Koreans also beat China 45-44 for the men's saber team
gold in fencing competition.

Sutono wins first gold in 36 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Tiny Indonesian army sergeant Supriati
Sutono came down off a remote mountain in West Java to win the
country's first Asian Games track and field gold medal in 36 years
Friday.
	   Her courageous victory in the women's 5,000 meters was watched
by Mohammad Sarengat, who won the previous track gold medals in the
100 and 110 hurdles at the 1962 games.
	   He was as surprised as the runner herself, who has spent most of
the past year training alone in the mountains, following the lead
of great runners the world over who opt for altitude.
	   ``We didn't expect she would beat the Indian but she fought,
fought, fought,'' Sarengat said after Sutono staged an amazing
finish to beat favorite Sunita Rani.
	   Sutono looked beaten with 50 meters to run as the Indian pulled
away to a five-meter lead. But finding a last burst she flashed
past, only to stop prematurely a step before the line.
	   ``I felt very tired in the last few meters,'' Sutono said. ``So
I dived to make sure.''
	   Her momentum carried her across the line .01 seconds ahead of
her rival and she had to be carried from the track on a stretcher.
	   The medal was Indonesia's sixth at the games but team chief
Mochammad Hindarto said it was the most important.
	   ``It means more for Indonesian sport because it's in track and
field and we haven't had one for 36 years,'' said Hindarto.
	   ``It was a surprise to me. I had breakfast with her this morning
and told her she only had to break her national record.''
	   Sutono's time of 15:54.46 was 15 seconds inside her best.
	   She broke into tears as she dedicated her win to her husband,
her country and her army commander at the south Bandung academy
where she is based.
	   ``I didn't believe I could win this race,'' she said. ``I
thought if I could stay near the front with the others until the
last 200 or 100 meters then that would be enough.''
	   In the end she got much more.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ After chasing and then sinking a North
Korean speedboat in a gun battle Friday, South Korean navy ships
and planes began a sea and air search for the doomed boat's mother
ship.
	   The body of a North Korean in a wet suit was recovered shortly
after the sinking of the vessel, described as a low-slung,
high-speed boat used to land or pick up spies.
	   ``We're now involved in reconnaissance operations to pursue the
mother ship, which is believed to be outside South Korean
territorial waters,'' Lt. Gen. Chung Young-jin said.
	   The office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had earlier described
the sunken ship as a mini-submarine of a type commonly used by
North Korea for espionage missions.
	   But Chung, commander of the Joint Chiefs' Operations
Headquarters, told a news conference it was a speedboat capable of
carrying up to eight people.
	   The craft was first spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as
it approached Yosu, a small port 320 kilometers (200 miles) south
of Seoul on the tip of the Korean Peninsula, he said.
	   The boat then fled southeast for about 100 kilometers (62
miles), pursued for nearly six hours by South Korean navy ships and
air force planes, Chung said.
	   Finally hemmed in and illuminated by nearly 100 flares dropped
by a South Korean transport plane, the fleeing boat opened fire at
the pursuing ships and was quickly sunk by return fire, Chung said.
	   ``We fired several warning shots, but the enemy craft continued
to flee and fired at us. Therefore, we attacked and sank it,'' said
Col. Hwang Dong-kyu, a Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman.
	   About two hours later, South Korean troops recovered the body of
the North Korean. Chung said four men had been sighted on the boat,
and Navy frogmen were searching for more bodies.
	   There were no South Korean casualties.
	   ``The speedboat is believed to have been dispatched to
infiltrate agents into the South, pick up agents stationed in the
South, or establish secret, espionage-related drop-off points,''
Chung said.
	   He said it was believed to have been launched by a mother ship
weighing 70 to 100 tons, sailing out of the port of Nampo on North
Korea's west coast.
	   On shore, South Korean soldiers and police were put on high
alert, increasing security checks for possible infiltrators from
the boat, officials said.
	   Chief presidential spokesman Park Jie-won praised the swift
military action.
	   The National Security Council convened later Friday and decided
to demand an apology from North Korea and warn of ``stern
measures'' against further provocations, Defense Minister Chon
Yong-taek said.
	   ``Probably, the North's military and other hardliners are trying
to raise tension because they fear the South's policy of
reconciliation towards the North may erode their stance within the
communist regime,'' Chon told reporters at a news conference.
	   In Washington, U.S. National Security Council spokesman P.J.
Crowley called the intrusion a ``very serious matter.''
	   North Korea routinely uses submarines to drop off or pick up
spies along South Korea's long coastline, officials said. Several
have been detected in recent years.
	   In June, a 70-ton Yugo-class North Korean submarine was found in
South Korean waters off the east coast with its propeller and
periscope tangled in a fishing net.
	   South Koreans later cut through the hatch with welding torches
and found nine bodies, all shot dead in an apparent suicide pact.
Seoul officials said the sub was on a spy mission.
	   The latest incident comes as the United States is trying to
defuse tension over a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons site.
North Korea has rejected a U.S. demand for its inspection.
	   North Korea claims that the facility under construction at
Keumjang-ri north of the country's capital, Pyongyang, is for
civilian use, but U.S. officials suspect it to be nuclear-related.
	   North Korea's military has denounced the U.S. demand for
inspection as ``a declaration of war.''
	   About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a
mutual defense treaty.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They are still technically at war,
because the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace
treaty.

Makers of faked documentary fined record millions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British production company found to have faked
an award-winning documentary about drug-running from Colombia was
fined a record 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.2 million) Friday.
	   In imposing the fine on Carlton Communications, the Independent
Television Commission said the film represented ``a wholesale
breach of trust between program-makers and viewers.''
	   After the authenticity of ``The Connection'' was challenged, an
independent panel of lawyers and TV producers determined its
producers had faked locations and paid actors to portray drug
couriers.
	   The panel noted, for example, that a man interviewed with his
face covered and described as the financial controller of the Cali
Cartel was an actor _ as were the ``mule'' and another key
character.
	   It also said one interview that was purported to take place in a
jungle hideout with a drug baron actually was filmed in the hotel
room of producer Marc de Beaufort.
	   The panel concluded that only de Beaufort, a cameraman and a
researcher could have known of most of the fakery.
	   De Beaufort called the conclusion about the actors
``untenable,'' and blamed his researcher, Adriana Quintana, for the
``alleged fakery.''
	   The investigation was launched after The Guardian newspaper
questioned the documentary's authenticity in a series of articles
in May.
	   The fine imposed on Carlton Communications is four times the
only previous financial sanction levied by the television
commission, which penalized a morning show for giving products
undue prominence.
	   Parts of ``The Connection'' aired in the United States in June
1997 on the CBS news program ``60 Minutes,'' which issued a rare
on-air apology to viewers earlier this month.

	   IN THE GULF OF ALASKA _ Mountainous waves pounded the fishing
vessel La Conte mercilessly, breaking her up and forcing her
five-man crew to leap into the 38-degree Fahrenheit (3 C) sea. One
by one, three U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crews flew into the maw
of an arctic storm with hurricane-force winds to attempt a rescue.
It was a mission that will be talked about for years in the
remotest Coast Guard air bases and academy classrooms. And when it
was over, five men would receive the Distinguished Flying Cross,
America's highest peacetime honor. Theirs is a tale of struggle and
courage in the face of nature's remorseless power, but it is also a
saga of wild, untamed Alaska, beginning with a mysterious discovery
in a bear's den on a remote island.
	   Storm Gods And Heroes, by AP National Writer Todd Lewan, is
moving Sunday, Dec. 20, as a narrative serial in five parts
intended for use from Sunday, Dec. 20, through Thursday, Dec. 24,
or thereafter. Each part is accompanied by a box, slugged
Heroes-Story So Far, explaining the format and summarizing parts of
the story.
	   Each segment of the story has a cliffhanger ending. The five
parts are moving together on World Service circuits to help
subscribers in planning. The first story, is 2,500 words; the
succeeding stories range from 1,100 to 1,200 words in length. An
editor's note included at the end of each part explains that the
story is based on extensive interviews with the rescue crews,
surviving fishermen and other participants, as well as on a
523-page record of the Coast Guard's inquest into the affair.
	   The serial is illustrated with AP Photos NY350-354 and Graphics:

Survey shows that 63 percent of those polled have bribed police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A poll published Friday in the
government-owned newspaper indicated that 63 percent of those
questioned have bribed police at one time or another.
	   The 1,511 Ugandans polled by CIET International, an
anti-corruption organization, listed the police and the judiciary
as the most corrupt bodies in Uganda.
	   The report was circulated to district administration and police
officials attending a week-long management seminar and was
published in the daily New Vision.
	   The report was done for the Inspectorate General of Government.
	   The third most corrupt institution was said to be the
government's tax-collecting arm, the Uganda Revenue Authority.
	   President Yoweri Museveni's government has been rocked by
scandal since parliament issued a report earlier this month on the
extent of high-level government.
	   His brother and former military security adviser, Maj. Gen.
Salim Saleh, and the head of Uganda's sweeping privatization
program were forced to resign.

Ecevit to give up mandate to form government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Bulent Ecevit, a center-left political
veteran, said Friday he is giving up his attempts to form a new
government.
	   Ecevit, seeking to form Turkey's fifth goverment since 1995, has
been unable to put together a coalition or attract enough support
for a minority government.
	   The latest rejection came Friday when Deniz Baykal, another
center-left politician, refused to give outside support for a
minority government under Ecevit's Democratic Left Party and
insisted that his own party be included in the government.
	   Baykal said Ecevit will return the mandate to the president on
Monday. He was designated Dec. 2 following the government's
collapse on corruption charges.
	   On Thursday, former Premier Tansu Ciller made clear that her
center-right True Path Party would not support an Ecevit government
and offered to try her hand in forming a government.
	   Ecevit sought to exclude the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, the
largest bloc in the legislature. Virtue is the successor of another
Islamic party that was banned earlier this year for increasing the
profile of Islam in this officially secular country.

Thousands flee fighting, police fire on Brazzaville looters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LOUIS OKAMBA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Automatic weapons fire
rattled through a neighborhood of Brazzaville for a second day
Friday morning while refugees fled fighting between the army and a
rogue militia group.
	   Police fired on looters taking advantage of the disorder in the
south Brazzaville suburb of BaKongo, and civilians were fleeing the
area, witnesses said.
	   The capital was without electricity and telephone services were
limited to the center of the city. Many people in other parts of
the city were taking refuge in their homes.
	   Casualties were reported by civilians fleeing the area, although
the numbers were unclear.
	   Meanwhile, the United Nations' refugee agency counted 8,500
emigres who had escaped the turmoil in Republic of Congo in recent
weeks to border villages near the town of Luozi in neighboring
Congo, the former Zaire, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said in
Geneva.
	   Other aid groups have estimated that 10,000 refugees have
crossed the river border to Congo.
	   ``The group has adequate food at present but is in urgent need
of medical assistance,'' Janowski said. Several children reportedly
died from lack of care after crossing into Congo. UNHCR began
distributing medical kits to health posts in the vicinity and soap
to area villages. Food and basic necessities will be given to the
most vulnerable members of the group.
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered
ambushes, were pushed back from the suburbs south of Brazzaville, a
military officer said Thursday.
	   Hundreds of people panicked in downtown Brazzaville, believing
the Ninjas had launched an all-out attack.
	   Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president Pascal Lissouba,
fled Republic of Congo after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his
``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan government troops _
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year. Since then,
the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign
against Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including the Cobras. Many of his former militia fighters,
though, have joined the army.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, sending
troops to help Sassou-Nguesso defeat Lissouba. Many Angolan
soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola joined the civil war because Lissouba was believed to be
sending aid to the rebel group UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola which has been
fighting the Angolan government for two decades.
	   The Republic of Congo government has said that UNITA is now
supporting the Ninjas.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days. The Iraqi
capital came under missile attack hours before dawn, capping a
barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. But as a new day
dawned, the tension of the night was less evident and early risers
were seen going about their normal business. Iraqi newspapers urged
the public to rally behind President Saddam Hussein. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The rubble of Iraqi targets and the future of
the Clinton presidency dominated the landscape Friday as U.S.
military forces prepared for more attacks on Saddam Hussein's
arsenal while President Bill Clinton faced likely impeachment in
the House. The House planned to spend most of Friday debating
impeachment of the president while at the Pentagon and the White
House, bomb damage assessments rolled in from the sustained air
campaign against Iraq. Clinton said the impeachment drama in the
House would not deter him from completing his mission in Iraq.
House Republican leaders, he said, ``will have to decide how to do
their job. That's not for me to comment on.'' (US-IRAQ)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's relations with the United States and the
West may be seriously damaged by the U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping
out years of progress since the end of the Cold War, top military
leaders warned Friday. President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders
across the political spectrum have denounced the U.S. and British
attacks on Iraq, demanding an immediate halt to the campaign. The
Foreign Ministry said Friday it had recalled Russia's ambassador to
Britain for urgent consultations. The move came one day after the
Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled to protest the
attacks. (RUSSIA-IRAQ)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's most
ruthless Protestant paramilitary group handed over weapons Friday
to an international commission _ and challenged its enemies in the
Irish Republican Army to do the same. Under a police escort,
representatives of the Loyalist Volunteer Force carried a cache of
illegal firearms, grenades and detonators from the outlawed group's
power base of Portadown, 30 miles (50 kms) west of Belfast, to the
east Belfast headquarters of the commission led by Canada's former
senior soldier, Gen. John de Chastelain. (NIRELAND-DISARMAMENT)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean navy ships and planes
chased and sank a North Korean speedboat in a gun battle Friday and
began a sea and air search for its suspected mother ship. The body
of a North Korean in a wet suit was recovered shortly after the
sinking of the vessel, described as a low-slung, high-speed boat
used to land or pick up spies. (KOREAS-INFILTRATION)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets ended higher Friday on
the back of overnight gains on Wall Street despite continuing U.S.
military strikes on Iraq. Japanese stock prices rose for a third
straight day. The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 14,194.29 points, up 67.30 points, or 0.48 percent, from
Thursday. Investors in Japanese stocks were cheered by the gain in
the U.S. market Thursday amid a second wave of U.S. and British
missile attacks against Iraq, traders said. That signaled receding
fears about possible fallout in the form of damage to the global
economy, they said. (ASIAN-MARKETS)
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Moody's Investor Service said Friday it has
lowered financial strength ratings for Singapore's four biggest
banks, citing a deterioration in asset quality due to the Asian
economic crisis. Still, the ratings agency said Singapore's banking
system continues to be the healthiest in the region. The lowered
ratings for financial strength, and also for debt in some cases,
``reflect asset quality problems arising from the East Asian
financial crisis.'' (SINGAPORE-BANK RATINGS)
	   COVINGTON, Kentucky (AP) _ Toyota expects to be running a
worldwide parts distribution network from a new, dlrs 85 million
center in northern Kentucky in three years. Toyota executives said
Thursday the center will be the automaker's biggest parts
distribution operation in the world and will be the core of a
distribution system in this country and overseas. Toyota needs the
parts center because of its increasing auto sales in the United
States, said Bob Bennett, a group vice president with Toyota Motor
Sales USA Inc. (US-TOYOTA-PARTS CENTER)
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Tim
Fischer on Friday lashed out at Japan's decision to impose massive
tariffs on rice imports, even though the tariffs fell short of the
1,200 percent levy feared by Australia. Japan plans to impose a
tariff on imported rice of Australian dollars 4.85 (U.S. dlrs 3) a
kilo (2.2 pounds) from April next year, which equals a duty of 400
to 600 percent. The duty will not affect Australia's existing sales
to Japan, which are worth Australian dollars 72 million (U.S. dlrs
44.6 million) a year, but will choke off any growth in the market
for Australian farmers. (AUSTRALIA-JAPAN-RICE)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan needs deregulation in a wide range of
industries to foster the entreprenurial activity needed to pull the
country out of its worst recession in decades, Japan's trade
minister said Friday. Trade Minister Kaoru Yosano told reporters
that Japan's ``Big Bang'' financial liberalization measures should
be accompanied by deregulation in other industries such as energy,
medical care, and communications. (JAPAN-TRADE CHIEF)

Spanish government criticized for broader U.S. use of bases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government is under fire for granting
U.S. military forces broader access to Spanish air bases, although
it insists no American aircraft have used these facilities as
launchpads to bomb Iraq.
	   Under a deal signed November 14 and due to last three months,
Spain raised from 15 to 35 the number of aerial refueling planes
that can be deployed at any one time at the Moron and Rota bases in
southern Spain.
	   Spokesmen at the foreign and defense ministries explained Friday
that under an earlier, 1988 agreement setting terms for U.S. use of
the bases, the United States has to request permission each time it
wants to land a plane there.
	   But with the November arrangement, the Americans only have to
notify the Spaniards, rather than ask for permission.
	   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, in Parliament Thursday to explain
the government's support of U.S. air strikes against Iraq, insisted
that no U.S. planes have used Spanish bases to attack Iraq.
	   But the opposition Socialist party still accused Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar of giving the United States ``a blank check'' to
use the bases however it saw fit.
	   Not even Gen. Francisco Franco did this during 40 years of
dictatorship, Socialist foreign affairs spokesman Rafael Estrella
said.
	   For decades the United States and Spain shared four air bases on
Spanish soil. In the 1980s, when the socialists ruled in Spain,
Madrid declined to extend the arrangement and the Americans
transferred forces to Italy and Turkey.
	   The 1988 accord made the bases strictly Spanish and set terms
for U.S. use of them.

Britain shows videos of attacks on military targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British jets have flown three missions against air
defenses, airfields and Republican Guard installations in Iraq
without losing any aircraft, Defense Secretary George Robertson
said Friday.
	   ``We have yet to complete our full battle damage assessment but
initial assessment is that the raids have gone very well,'' he said
at a press briefing.
	   ``There is still much to do before we can be satisfied that
Saddam's capabilities to develop weapons of mass destruction has
been damaged to the extent necessary.
	   ``We will carry on with military action along with the U.S.
until we are satisfied that Saddam's military machine has been
suitably damaged,'' he said.
	   Journalists were shown videos taken by the attacking Tornados.
The targets seen exploding were described as a radar missile site,
a hardened aircraft shelter at the Tallil air base at the Tallil
air base in southwestern Iraq and an aircraft hangar,
	   Robertson said one objective of the attacks was to stop Iraq's
development of pilotless aircraft.
	   Britain part in the U.S.-led air campaign is begin carried out
by 12 Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers based in Kuwait.

Polish legislators override presidential veto on secret files bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statements from Kwasniewski, Solidarity leader in
grafs 2,5, and 8 &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish legislators voted Friday to
override President Aleksander Kwasniewski's veto of a bill that
would allow victims of communist-era repression to see their secret
police files.
	   Kwasniewski said afterward he would sign the measure later
Friday, even though he still believed it was a ``bad law.''
	   Legislators in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament, stood
and applauded after the 282-164 vote that overturned the
president's Dec. 12 veto.
	   It was a major victory over Kwasniewski, a former communist, by
the governing coalition of parties linked to the Solidarity
movement that toppled communism in 1989.
	   Jacek Rybicki, a senior Solidarity leader in parliament, said
the new law meant progress in ``closing the door behind communist
Poland.'' He said the override showed that Kwasniewski lacked the
support to veto at will.
	   But it came with a price. An opposition group mostly
representing farmers, the Polish Peasant's Party, joined the
Solidarity-led coalition in mustering the 60 percent majority
needed.
	   To gain the Polish Peasant's Party support, the coalition agreed
to make relatively minor changes in the law. Amending the law will
require a few more months of parliament activity.
	   ``I have not changed my opinion _ this is a bad law,''
Kwasniewski said. ``It is good that it will never function in the
present shape.''
	   Passed by parliament on Sept. 22, the bill would create an
Institute of National Remembrance to collect communist files from
1944-89, as well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes.
	   Besides making files available to victims, the institute would
have power to launch investigations to establish those responsible
for persecution or political murders.
	   Polish Peasant's Party leaders insisted that the head of the
institute be elected by a 60 percent majority in the Sejm, instead
of the simple majority required in the current version of the bill.
	   Opening the files of the dreaded secret police would be a
significant move toward confronting Poland's bitterly divided past.
During the communist era, the secret police used informers to
monitor virtually all aspects of daily life and routinely cracked
down on people suspected of anti-government activism.
	   The governing Solidarity-led coalition has roots in the union
movement that brought down the communist regime almost a decade
ago.
	   But the first post-communist governments, led by Solidarity,
focused on economic reforms without taking steps toward uncovering
abuses of the past. A leftist government followed until the
Solidarity-led coalition gained power in elections last year.
	   In vetoing the bill, Kwasniewski said it would give too much
power to the institute managing the files. He also said all Poles,
not only victims of totalitarian regimes, should be allowed to see
their records.
	   Former communist officials say the files are incomplete and full
of misinformation, which would cause chaos in the form of false
accusations and witch hunts.
	   Solidarity figures, including former President Lech Walesa, say
the past must be confronted, even if that means people including
some in top government posts get victimized.

German held hostage by Moldovan gang freed.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) _ A German businessman held hostage for
three weeks by kidnappers who demanded dlrs 100,000 for his release
has been freed, police said Friday.
	   Police in the former Soviet republic identified the man as
Werner Feiner. He was seized as he arrived at the airport in the
Moldovan capital in late November, said Col. Anatol Tincul, deputy
head of the police section that fights organized crime.
	   Feiner's home town or the nature of his business were not
immediately made public.
	   He was freed after two arrested suspects led police to the
apartment he was being held in, said police.
	   Police said Feiner was moved to various apartments during his
capture and once was taken to a forest and a rope was put around
his neck. His kidnappers threatened they would hang him, he
allegedly told police.
	   Feiner told his kidnappers, who did not speak German, he would
raise the dlrs 100,000 they were demanding, and he was allowed to
call Germany. However, he called the German embassy in Chisinau and
summoned help.
	   Police staged a handover of the ransom on Thursday in the Codru
hotel in downtown Chisinau and arrested two men. No further
information was available while the investigation is underway,
Tincul said.
	   Feiner is in Moldova helping police with their investigation.

British environment minister discusses Polish cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland and Britain signed an agreement
Friday that detailed their cooperation on environmental issues as
part of Poland's campaign to join the European Union.
	   Britain earlier agreed to be Poland's primary partner in helping
it devise environmental policies and regulations in line with EU
requirements.
	   ``I express my strong wish to assist Poland in their application
to the European Union, so that in a few years Poland can become a
full and important member of the EU,'' British Environment Minister
Michael Meacher said after the signing.
	   The so-called ``twinning'' program linking Poland and Britain on
environmental matters is part of the process of EU integration.
Poland is one of a handful of former Soviet bloc countries seeking
EU membership early next century.
	   Britain will help Poland apply for funds from the EU's Phare
program, which helps prepare central and east European countries
for EU membership, and develop policies in specific categories such
as waste management, environmental education and policy
enforcement, Meacher said.
	   ``We want to give real assistance in training for project
preparation to help Poland get a large part of Phare funds,'' he
said, adding that dlrs 585 million would be available for
environmental projects in coming years.
	   Meacher praised Poland's steps so far in meeting EU standards
for urban waste water treatment and control of coal mine emissions,
as well as its desulfurization projects in the south.
	   ``I have been impressed by the actions Poland has already taken
to prepare for early entry,'' he said.

Schroeder's first tax cut approved by parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament cleared the way Friday for a tax
cut for low earners, the first step in Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's center-left agenda.
	   The vote in the upper house, dominated by Schroeder's Social
Democrats, kicked off the government's project to cut high German
income taxes by 15 billion marks (dlrs 9 billion) over the next
four years.
	   Speaking for the Social Democrats, Hamburg mayor Ortwin Runde
rejected calls from business leaders for greater tax relief, saying
it would force budget cuts for local governments.
	   The chamber, which represents Germany's states, also passed an
increase in government payments to families with children.
	   Later Friday, the chamber was due to overturn cuts in sick pay
and retirement benefits made by the previous government of Helmut
Kohl. Also expected to pass was a health care reform that triggered
a nationwide doctors' strike Friday.
	   All measures fulfill campaign promises by Schroeder, who won
September elections and formed a government alliance with the
environmentalist Greens. The lower house passed the laws earlier
this month.
	   Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine wants to present the rest of
the tax reform package, including a rise in energy taxes, early
next year.
	   Friday's measure cuts the lowest individual income tax bracket
to 23.9 percent from 25.9 percent on Jan. 1, which the government
says will shave 1,700 marks (dlrs 1,020) off the average wage
earner's tax bill next year. A cut in the top tax rate is planned
later.

South African gets life membership of European Tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Two-time U.S. Open champion and
three-time World Match Play titlist, Ernie Els was handed life
membership of the PGA European Tour on Friday.
	   The South African, who will be playing in several European Tour
events next year as well as on the U.S. Tour, has four European
victories among his 25 triumphs as a pro.
	   ``I am thrilled to be given this accolade, especially as it
comes from my peers,'' Els said. ``My two U.S. Open wins must rate
as the high point of my career so far but I am now looking forward
to 1999 when I will be playing a number of European Tour events.''
	   Els won the U.S. Opens at Oakmont in 1994 and at Congressional
in '97. Each time he just edged Colin Montgomerie, Europe's leading
money earner for the past six years.
	   The South African won the Match Play title at Wentworth in '94,
'95 and '96 and is the only player to win it three times in a row.
	   During 1994, he also tied the European Tour record of 12 birdies
in a single round when he carded a 61 at the Dubai Desert Classic.

Searchers find 27th body, no others believed buried
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Search crews pulled out the body of a 4-month-old
boy Friday from the rubble of a collapsed apartment building,
raising the death toll to 27.
	   Rome's chief firefighter, Luigi Abate, said he believed no one
else was buried under the rubble.
	   The building, in the middle-class Portuense neighborhood, a
district about 6 kilometers (3 1/2 miles) from central Piazza
Venezia, collapsed during the night Wednesday.
	   The only survivors, a couple in their 50s, were found 12 hours
later. The man suffered leg fractures and the woman underwent
surgery for internal injuries.
	   Investigators suspect the building was structurally weak or the
ground beneath it shifted.

Cache of weapons found in Liberia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Refugees returning from exile to a
village in rural northern Liberia discovered a cache of heavy
weapons buried beneath one of their houses, military officials said
Friday.
	   The weapons were found under a burned-out house in the village
of Zorzor, near the border with Guinea and about 250 kilometers
(125 miles) north of the capital, Monrovia, a military officer said
on condition of anonymity.
	   It was not known who had hidden the weapons, although the area
was formerly used as a base by several rebel groups during the
country's 1989-96 war.
	   Many residents of the town have begun returning in recent months
from Guinea, where they took refuge during the fighting and the
early days of the peace agreement that followed.
	   President Charles Taylor has accused several of his former
rivals of planning uprisings against the government.
	   In September, a shooting between government soldiers and
supporters of former warlord Roosevelt Johnson resulted in Johnson
being shuttled from the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia to Nigeria, where
he has been detained by authorities.

Police arrest two men trying to sell thousands of fake dollars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested two men in southern Russia who
were trying to sell dlrs 19,600 in counterfeited money, a news
report said Friday.
	   The money _ all fake dlrs 100 bills _ was seized at a small
market in the city of Stavropol, about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles)
south of Moscow, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Police have begun criminal proceedings against the two men, who
were identified as residents of Russia's breakaway region of
Chechnya, the report said.
	   With the ruble unstable, many Russians keep their savings in
U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies. Officials have said
Russia has more American cash in circulation than any other country
outside the United States.
	   Partly in response to the massive demand for dollars,
counterfeiters in Russia have become highly skilled. A stash of
fake dlrs 100 bills seized by police earlier this year were so
close to the real thing that they could pass the
anti-counterfeiting machines used in Russia's currency exchange
offices.

Taiwanese rebounds to win gold in 9-ball pool
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Taiwan's Chao Fong-pang fought back
from a 9-4 deficit to beat Japan's Kunihiko Takahashi 15-11 Friday
for the gold medal in the Asian Games' 9-ball pool competition.
	   ``I told myself that I must not loose faith and I must win, and
here I am,'' the 20-year-old Chao said after he won the decisive
frame.
	   Takahashi, a professional, appeared to have the upper hand with
his early 9-4 lead.
	   But Chao, keeping cool, fought back to level at 9-9 and then
took charge of the match.
	   Chao's compatriot Yang Ching-shun won the bronze by trouncing
Thailand's Surathep Poochalam 11-1.
	   Pool was one of the cue sports making their debut at the current
Asian Games.

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's relations with the United States and the
West may be seriously damaged by the U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping
out years of progress since the end of the Cold War, top military
leaders warned Friday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders across the political
spectrum have denounced the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq,
demanding an immediate halt to the campaign.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Friday it had recalled Russia's
ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came one
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled to
protest the attacks.
	   The Kremlin said diplomatic relations with Washington and London
would not be broken.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, was to consider
calls Friday for Russia to unilaterally break U.N. sanctions
against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad, a long-time Soviet and
Russian friend.
	   However, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov cautioned that
``unilateral action is not a solution to the situation around
Iraq,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov met with Iraq's
ambassador, and ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky was expected
to visit the Iraqi embassy later Friday, before embarking on a
visit to Baghdad, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as
saying.
	   Ivashov warned that the U.S. military might be using the attacks
as a model for a nuclear strike, the Interfax reported.
	   ``Cruise missiles being used in this operation can carry both
conventional and nuclear weapons,'' Ivashov said, according to
Interfax.
	   ``The danger ... is that using the experience gained during the
operation against Iraq, the United States is working on a possible
large-scale action involving the use of force against any
country.''

Gandhi: Congress wants to form government on its own
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos DEL101-102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Main opposition leader Sonia Gandhi said
Friday her Congress party would like to give India a stable,
unified government after years of fractious coalitions.
	   ``While we welcome the support of like-minded parties, we would
like to make it clear that we must aim to provide a stable
government of our own,'' local news agencies quoted her as saying
at the opening of a party conference.
	   ``We know what good governance is,'' said Gandhi, whose Congress
led India for most of its 51 years of independence. ``People are
tired of the fractious coalition and coming together of forces
solely with the craving for power.''
	   Plagued by scandal, the Congress lost power in 1989 elections
and India has been led for much of the past decade by coalitions
that are often accused of indecisiveness and infighting.
	   No party has the numbers to govern alone in the current
parliament. The centrist Congress's arch-rival, the conservative
Bharatiya Janata Party, heads a 19-party governing coalition.

Belfast parties strike deal on forming new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with LVF surrendering some weapons, incorporating
BC-NIreland-Disarmament &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Overcoming months of stalemate,
Northern Ireland's rival politicians agreed early Friday on the
shape of the new coalition government envisioned in April's peace
accord.
	   As importantly, the eight parties that support the accord also
announced agreement on the six areas where the future Belfast
administration would shape policy in conjunction with the
neighboring Irish Republic, which won independence from Britain in
1922.
	   Within hours, Northern Ireland's most ruthless Protestant
paramilitary group handed over weapons to an international
commission _ and challenged its enemies in the Irish Republican
Army to do the same. Because the IRA refuses to do so, the
Protestant leader of Northern Ireland's largest party has opposed
any role in the new government for the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   Under a police escort, representatives of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force carried a cache of illegal firearms, grenades and detonators
from the outlawed group's power base of Portadown, 30 miles (50
kms) west of Belfast, to the east Belfast headquarters of the
commission led by Canada's former senior soldier, Gen. John de
Chastelain.
	   It was the first time any paramilitary group had surrendered
weapons to de Chastelain since April's peace accord, which also
mapped the new political structures.
	   The breakthrough on organizing Northern Ireland's new government
came after 18 straight hours of negotiations at Stormont
Parliamentary Buildings in east Belfast, would-be headquarters for
the administration made up of the province's British Protestants
and Irish Catholics. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, breaking
off from monitoring the U.S.-British bombardment of Iraq, phoned
several key leaders late Thursday.
	   ``I welcome this important breakthrough and congratulate the
Northern Ireland leaders and the Irish Republic on reaching a
genuine accommodation of mutual benefit to north and south,'' said
Mo Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland.
	   Mowlam would see many of her responsibilities handed over to
local politicians next year _ if they can overcome still-bigger
obstacles to form the government now detailed on paper.
	   Trimble, as leader of the biggest party, the Ulster Unionists,
would lead the administration, which should have been formed in
October.
	   According to Friday's agreed text the cabinet-style
administration will have 10 departments, four more than the current
British government system, which has directly ruled Northern
Ireland since 1972.
	   The departments _ five to be headed by Protestants and five by
Catholics _ will be agriculture and rural development; environment;
regional development; social development; education; higher and
further education, training and employment; enterprise, trade and
investment; culture, arts and leisure; health, social services and
public safety, and finance and personnel.
	   The six areas of formal cooperation with the Irish government
are to be: cross-border waterways, food safety, trade and business
development, European Union funding, marine matters, and promotion
of the Gaelic language and Ulster-Scots dialect.
	   Friday's agreement also specified six general areas _
agriculture, education, environment, health, tourism and transport
_ where the two parts of Ireland would cooperate more informally.
The north's Catholic politicians hope this agenda will help achieve
their long-term goal of unification.

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg
of Germany won her first career World Cup downhill on Friday,
beating Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg by more than four-tenths of a
second.
	   Gerg, whose previous best downhill result was second place in
Val d'Isere over a year ago, shot down the icy hard 2,500-meter
(8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours course in 1 minute, 41.13 seconds.
	   Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion but still seeking
her first victory this season, settled for second, crossing in
1:41.55.
	   Italy's Bibiana Perez was the day's other surprise, finishing
third behind Gerg in 1:41.63 for her first career downhill podium.
	   Overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of four races this
season including consecutive victories in Val d'Isere last week,
placed fourth in 1:41.92.

Darsha does a double

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Running in spikes that didn't fit,
sprinter Damayanthi Darsha won her second gold Friday at the Asian
Games.
	   For Sri Lanka, that meant its biggest ever gold medal haul at
the games. For her, she hopes, it will bring enough prize money to
build her family a house.
	   The 23-year-old's sparkling form has helped rescue what
otherwise threatened to be a gloomy week for Sri Lanka after star
sprinter Susantika Jayasinghe withdrew, citing injury.
	   Whereas Jayasinghe went home to criticism about her decision to
pull out, Darsha looks destined for a heroine's welcome. She has
already been promised a car of her choice and at least dlrs 10,000
in prize money, Sri Lankan sports officials said.
	   Darsha stormed from behind to edge out China's Li Xuemei at the
line Friday in the 200 meters.
	   ``I heard her breathing behind me but there was nothing I could
do,'' Li said, describing how Darsha powered past her for gold.
	   Darsha, who also won the 400, is the only Sri Lankan woman to
win gold at an Asian Games. Her two triumphs and a win by Sugath
Tillekeratne in the men's 400 gave Sri Lanka a total of three
golds, the most it has ever taken at an Asian Games, Sri Lankan
sports officials said.
	   And all this from a country that lacks the resources enjoyed by
the region's sporting powerhouses like China and Japan.
	   Sri Lanka has just one synthetic running track, in the capital,
Colombo, and ``we train on grass tracks,'' Darsha said in an
interview.
	   Because spikes aren't sold in Sri Lanka, she had to make do in
the 400 with a pair that were half a size too big, and with another
pair half a size too small in the 200, she said.
	   After track events end Saturday, Darsha plans to go shopping in
Bangkok ``to buy some spikes.''
	   While she hasn't decided what car she'll choose, she plans to
use her prize money to move her mother, father, sister and brother
out of a house she has rented for them in Colombo.
	   ``I want to build a house for my family,'' she said. ``They
don't have anywhere permanent.''
	   In sports, her goal is to run the 400 in under 50 seconds next
year to set herself up for the 2000 Olympics. ``I have to get
through that barrier,'' she said.
	   Darsha, who normally specializes in the 400, said she did not
train for the 200 because Jayasinghe, the world silver medalist,
was meant to run. But following her victory, she plans to talk to
her coach about maybe making it one of her regular events, even
though that is Jayasinghe's turf.
	   ``We will have some close competition,'' Darsha said.

Exxon proceeding with petrochemical plant in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. oil giant Exxon Corp. said Friday it was
proceeding with plans to start up a dlrs 2 billion petrochemical
plant in Singapore despite the Asian economic crisis and an
impending merger with Mobil Corp.
	   Exxon Chemical Singapore, a local division of Exxon, was
scheduled to begin operations at its largest project in the
Asia-Pacific region in the fourth quarter of 2000, the company said
in a statement.
	   The complex features a 800,000 metric tons (880,000 short tons)
per year steam cracker facility that will produce mainly ethylene
and propylene. Three additional facilities will produce other
petrochemical derivatives.
	   Ethylene and propylene are widely used to make plastic packages,
containers and films, detergents, cosmetics and paints.
	   The entire complex will occupy about 100 hectares (247 acres) on
Singapore's Jurong Island, and will be the company's largest ever
built from scratch.
	   The announcement adds weight to industry speculation that Mobil
will likely shelve its plans for a cracker facility if the
Exxon-Mobil deal goes ahead. Both Mobil and Exxon announced in 1997
that each planned to build a cracker facility in Singapore.
	   ``We are building the foundation for future growth,'' Exxon
Chemical's managing director, Warwick Bisley, was quoted as saying
by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The project will add 500 permanent jobs in Singapore, and
construction of the large project will employ tens of thousands
over the next two years, said the company statement.
	   Singapore has two existing ethylene plants with a combined
capacity of approximately one million tons (1.1 million short tons)
per year operated by the Petrochemical Corp. of Singapore.

Nissan Motor to slash domestic production, consider plant closures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second-largest automaker,
said Friday it plans to slash domestic production capacity by about
15 percent over the next five years and may close some of plants.
	   Nissan executive vice president Kosei Minami told reporters his
company will cut annual output capacity to 1.7 million vehicles
from the current 2 million vehicles by 2003 to cope with sluggish
demand in its home market.
	   As a result, the company might have to close some of the Nissan
group's eight plants, Minami said. He did not specify which plants
could be shuttered.
	   The scaling down of its operations comes as just the latest blow
to the troubled automaker.
	   Last month, Nissan said it expects to lose 30 billion yen (dlrs
260 million) for the current fiscal year ending next March at the
group level, which includes the parent company and its
subsidiaries.
	   In 1999, Nissan projects its domestic production will stay
little changed at 1.56 million units next year after weak sales in
recession-stricken Japan pushed output down by 10 percent this year
to 1.55 million units.
	   The company's global auto production was forecast to total 2.60
million units in 1999, compared with 2.56 million in 1998 _ an 8.6
percent drop.
	   Nissan said it expects its domestic auto sales next year will
improve by a modest 4.7 percent on the year to 950,000 units. This
year, it projects a 13 percent slide in domestic sales to 907,000
units.
	   Exports were forecast to tumble 13.6 percent next year to
610,000 vehicles, after rising 2 percent to 706,000 this year,
Nissan said.
	   The fall in exports will likely be offset partly by an increase
in overseas production.
	   Nissan expects its output overseas will rise 3 percent to 1.04
million units in 1999, after shrinking 6.2 percent this year to
1.01 million.

	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg
of Germany proved she was just as skilled in the speed events as
the technical, winning a women's World Cup downhill on Friday, her
first career victory in the dicsipline.
	   Gerg, whose previous best downhill result was second place in
Val d'Isere over a year ago, tamed the icy, treacherous 2,500-meter
(8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours course in 1 minute, 41.13 seconds, to
collect her seventh career World Cup victory.
	   The 1997 overall World Cup champion Pernilla Wiberg, still
seeking her first victory of the season, settled for second,
crossing in 1:41.55.
	   Italy's Bibiana Perez was the day's other surprise, the Italian
finishing third behind Gerg in 1:41.63, for her first career
downhill podium.
	   Overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of four races this
season including back-to-back victories in Val d'Isere last week,
placed fourth in 1:41.92.
	   The reigning World Cup combined champion, Gerg will begin the
defense of her crown on Saturday in the second downhill of the
weekend, which, with Sunday's slalom, will count towards the
combined.
	   Third in the overall last season behind teammates Katja
Seizinger and Martina Ertl, Gerg said this year she hopes to
improve to second or even first.
	   But first she'll have to battle a dominant Meissnitzer, fifth in
the overall last year but whose four victories this season have
vaulted her to the top of the standings, where she sits with 675
points, a whopping 277 clear of her nearest rival Ertl.
	   Gerg's victory lifted her to fifth from ninth in the standings,
but the German still lags 375 points behind Meissnitzer.
	   Meissnitzer excels in the same events as Gerg, and has a pair of
giant slalom and Super-G races as well as two other podium finishes
this season, while the German has just one other top-three result
this year, a super-G in Lake Louise.
	   Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the season opening
back-to-back downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, and posted the
fastest time in Thursday's training, finished back in 14th, 2.11
behind.
	   Goetschl had showed signs of struggling in Friday's training
session, however, where she finished back in 15th.
	   France's Regine Cavagnoud, third in a super-G in Val d'Isere
last week, finished fifth, .93 back, followed by compatriot
Florence Masnada, sixth in 1:42.20.
	   American Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, finished 19th, 2.81
adrift, while Kathleen Monahan of Aspen, Colorado, was 22nd, 3.02
off the pace.

Russian parliament approves tax reduction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Friday approved a Cabinet
proposal to lower two crucial taxes, hoping to aid ailing
industries badly hit by the economic crisis.
	   The move is a big risk for the government, which desperately
needs money to pay its obligations now that the financial crisis
has left it practically broke.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, tentatively approved a
government bill that would cut the value-added tax from the present
20 percent to 15 percent in March.
	   The bill, approved on the first reading, calls for further
reduction of the VAT to 10 percent in 2000. The house didn't
immediately set a date for final approval of the bill.
	   The VAT is currently one of Russia's key sources of tax income,
and international lenders like the International Monetary Fund have
harshly criticized the government's wish to reduce the tax.
	   Lawmakers also approved the government's proposal to lower
Russia's profit tax from 35 percent to 30 percent.
	   The government-proposed package of 19 tax bills also includes
revised personal income-tax tables that take into account the
ruble's recent fall in value.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet hopes that the bills
will help streamline Russia's unwieldy tax system, provide
conditions for economic revival and encourage tax dodgers to pay
what they owe.
	   But critics warn that tax cuts will only further slash
government revenues for 1999, which are already expected to be far
too inadequate to cover the country's expenditures.
	   Making matters worse, the 1999 budget draft factors in foreign
loans that may not be extended and prescribes sharply reduced
payments on foreign debt, even though debtors have not yet agreed
to rescheduling.
	   The draft budget allocates only 100 billion rubles (dlrs 4.8
billion) to pay off foreign debts, which will total dlrs 17.5
billion next year.
	   The document has already been sent to parliament and is expected
to come up for debate next week.
	   The International Monetary Fund has urged Russia to approve a
realistic budget and specifically warned that it is less likely to
give more aid if Russia includes loans that haven't been agreed
upon in the budget.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian ruble continued its steady slide on
Friday, trading at 20.75 a dollar compared to 20.7 the previous
day. Before the crisis hit in August, the ruble was trading at
about 6 to the dollar.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the U.S. dollar _ a target most
experts consider unrealistic. The ruble has already plummeted below
22 to the dollar in street trading, and is not expected to stop its
drop any time soon.

South Korea topples Asian rugby giant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Underdog South Korea showed opportunism
and a concrete defense to rally from 10 points down Friday and
defeat Asian rugby giant Japan 21-17 for the Asian Games rugby
union gold medal.
	   Taiwan beat Sri Lanka 38-20 for the bronze.
	   Jubilant South Korean officials said the pair of rugby gold
medals their team has won here _ they defeated Japan in the sevens
last week _ marked a new era in Asian rugby, ending traditional
Japanese dominance.
	   ``This is the biggest victory we have ever had,'' said Ko
Byung-kyo, a director of the Korean Rugby Football Union. ``I think
that this is the beginning of a new era. This is a team of great
motivation.''
	   Japan's coach, Seiji Hirao, called his team's defeat
``unfortunate'' and blamed its inability to win a gold medal on
numerous injuries.
	   ``We made a lot of mistakes in the end,'' Hirao said. ``The
Koreans put on good pressure and they had good fighting spirit on
their team.''
	   Japan took the lead in the 4th minute on a try, with a score of
passes veering back and forth until scrum half Katsuji Ohara edged
over the left corner flag.
	   Fly half Keiji Hirose converted for 7-0.
	   The Koreans drew even in the 16th minute when right flanker Woo
Ae-il broke loose and sprinted 40 meters across the Japanese try
line. Fly half Kim Jae-sung converted.
	   But 11 minutes later, Kim kicked wide on a 30-meter penalty that
would have put Korea ahead.
	   Hirose did not make the same mistake with a penalty chip near
the end of the half and put Japan ahead 10-7.
	   In the second half, the Japanese widened their lead in the 5th
minute when right wing Tsutomo Matsuda scooped up a loose ball and
made a wide, hooking run 25 meters around the Korean defense for a
try.
	   Hirose's conversion made it 17-7.
	   The Koreans drove the ball within five meters of a try several
times, only to give up possession.
	   But in the 29th minute they finally got one across with Lim
Sung-soo, and Kim converted, bringing the team back within striking
range at 17-14.
	   Four minutes later, center Yoo Min-fuk, who was instrumental in
many drives, carried to about 13 meters before being submerged by
Japanese.
	   Woo came up with the ball and broke through for his second try.
Kim made the conversion for a 21-17 lead.
	   The Japanese poured on pressure, but for 20 minutes and well
into extra time they crashed into a rock-hard Korean defensive wall
within meters of scoring.
	   After watching his team's poor showing Hirao said he would be
making a number of changes to his side before next year's rugby
World Cup.
	   Ko, meanwhile, was calculating his team's chance of overcoming
the Netherlands in a qualifier in the sport's most prestigious
tournament.

	   --
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A rare independent lawmaker is to head a
new opposition party to challenge President Robert Mugabe's ruling
party as the nation's economic woes mount.
	   Margaret Dongo, a former guerrilla fighter in the war that led
to independence in 1980, formally launches the Zimbabwe Union of
Democrats, the nation's 10th opposition group, on Saturday.
	   Dongo, who was expelled from the ruling party for her outspoken
criticism of corruption and economic mismanagement in Mugabe's
government, assembled a team of political and human rights
activists and academics as founders of the party, the organizers
said.
	   The party's manifesto said its political agenda was for ``good
governance, democracy, respect for the rule of law and the
equitable distribution of resources,'' all principles Dongo argues
have been abandoned by Mugabe and his ``old guard'' of political
leaders.
	   It also sought to unify opposition groups to mount a meaningful
challenge to Mugabe's party in parliamentary elections in 2000 and
presidential elections the following year.
	   Mugabe's party has 147 seats in the 150-seat Harare Parliament.
Two seats are held by a small party whose leader is appealing a
prison term for plotting to assassinate Mugabe in 1995.
	   Dongo won her parliamentary seat in 1995 after the High Court
ruled her ruling party opponent rigged the voting to win.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Police are investigating how
six of their own, newly delivered BMW patrol cars crashed after a
formal handover ceremony.
	   A car leading a convoy of 50 vehicles braked Thursday and caused
a chain reaction collision, police said.
	   The vehicles were bought by the Gauteng Province legislature
from BMW SA for 7.5 million rand (dlrs 1.3 million).
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ The World Health Organization
warned Friday that 280 million Africans are at risk from an upsurge
of meningococcal meningitis.
	   Dr. Lindsay Martinez of the Geneva-based U.N. agency estimated
that 7 million doses of vaccine against illness were needed to
contain an expected upsurge in the disease. Current stocks sand at
6 million, he said.
	   The meningitis belts stretches from Senegal in West Africa to
Mozambique in the southeast.
	   ``We must be prepared for the number of cases there to increase
dramatically in the near future,'' Martinez said.
	   Travelers in the area should be vaccinated, said Dr. Andrew
Jamieson of the British Airways travel clinic here.
	   The disease is highly contagious, and some carriers show no
symptoms, which include fever, headache, neck stiffness and an
aversion to bright light. A rash and haemorrhage may also occur.
	   Without treatment, the disease could be fatal.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Police were holding a businessman and
founder of an opposition political party on unspecified charges
Friday after he publicly criticized President Yoweri Museveni, a
police spokesman said.
	   Spokesman John Ngobi said Chapaa Karuhanga, the head of the
National Democratic Forum, which he founded three years ago, was
being questioned by police and that details about possible charges
were not available.
	   Karuhanga, 45, was arrested Thursday after he told a party rally
that Museveni was worse than his predecessors, Milton Obote and Idi
Amin Dada.
	   ``Amin and Obote were dictators, but Museveni is both a dictator
and corrupt,'' Karuhanga was quoted as telling the tri-weekly
Crusader newspaper last week.
	   Obote, now in exile in Zambia, was president from 1963 until his
overthrow by Amin in 1971. He was president again from 1981 to
1985.
	   Amin ruled Uganda from 1971 until he was ousted by combined
Ugandan-Tanzanian forces in 1979. During his eight years in power,
at least 400,000 people were killed by his security police.
	   Museveni fought a successful five-year guerrilla war against
Obote's government and has ruled Uganda since 1986. He was elected
president in May 1996.
	   Several members of Museveni's government, including his brother,
Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, who was his special military adviser, have
been forced to resign following publication of a parliamentary
report on high-level corruption.
	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A poll published Friday in the
government-owned newspaper indicated that 63 percent of those
questioned have bribed police at one time or another.
	   The 1,511 Ugandans polled by CIET International, an
anti-corruption organization, listed the police and the judiciary
as the most corrupt bodies in Uganda.
	   The report was circulated to district administration and police
officials attending a week-long management seminar and was
published in the daily New Vision.
	   The report was done for the Inspectorate General of Government.
	   The third most corrupt institution was said to be the
government's tax-collecting arm, the Uganda Revenue Authority.
	   President Yoweri Museveni's government has been rocked by
scandal since parliament issued a report earlier this month on the
extent of high-level government.
	   His brother and former military security adviser, Maj. Gen.
Salim Saleh, and the head of Uganda's sweeping privatization
program were forced to resign.
	   --
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Refugees returning from exile to a
village in rural northern Liberia discovered a cache of heavy
weapons buried beneath one of their houses, military officials said
Friday.
	   The weapons were found under a burned-out house in the village
of Zorzor, near the border with Guinea and about 250 kilometers
(125 miles) north of the capital, Monrovia, a military officer said
on condition of anonymity.
	   It was not known who had hidden the weapons, although the area
was formerly used as a base by several rebel groups during the
country's 1989-96 war.
	   Many residents of the town have begun returning in recent months
from Guinea, where they took refuge during the fighting and the
early days of the peace agreement that followed.
	   President Charles Taylor has accused several of his former
rivals of planning uprisings against the government.
	   In September, a shooting between government soldiers and
supporters of former warlord Roosevelt Johnson resulted in Johnson
being shuttled from the U.S. Embassy in Monrovia to Nigeria, where
he has been detained by authorities.

Iran suspends flights in Abadan because of U.S. strikes on Iraq

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran suspended all flights to and from the
city of Abadan in the southwest of the country because of the air
strikes in Iraq, state-run Tehran television reported Friday.
	   The broadcast said that ``flights have been suspended for five
days because of U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq and the airport's
proximity to the Iraqi border.''
	   The decision came after a stray missile from Thursday's attacks
landed on the city of Khorramshahr in Iran's southern Khuzestan
province. No one was injured.
	   Abadan, the capital of oil-rich Khuzestan, is about 25
kilometers (12.5 miles) from Khorramshahr. Abadan airport is midway
between the two cities.
	   Khorramshahr is about 40 kilometers (25 kilometers) east of the
Iraqi city of Basra, a large port city with major oil facilities.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II has come down with the flu
at the start of the busy Christmas season and canceled his
audiences Friday, the Vatican said.
	   The Vatican described the pontiff's illness as a mild case of
influenza.
	   Papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said John Paul had a
slight fever, around 38 degrees Celsius (100 F).
	   Among activities canceled were meetings with the Catholic
patriarch of Iraq and a representative of the Arab League.
	   The illness struck the frail 78-year-old pope at the start of
the busy holiday period, when he has made few concessions for his
age and health.
	   The pope is scheduled to celebrate midnight Mass Christmas eve
and deliver his annual holiday message on Christmas day.
	   Appointments include an annual address Tuesday to the College of
Cardinals on the state of the church.
	   In the only change in recent years, John Paul no longer
celebrates a public Mass Christmas Day.
	   Otherwise, although weakened by a long list of ailments, the
pope has kept up a crowded schedule and his foreign travels.
	   His next planned trip is to Mexico and St. Louis, Missouri, Jan.
22-28.

	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Lasse Kjus captured his
second consecutive World Cup downhill victory as he beat favored
Austrians Werner Franz and Hermann Maier in Friday's speed race at
Val Gardena.
	   The 27-year-old Norwegian skier had a faultless run down the icy
Saslong course as he clocked an unbeatable time of two minutes,
2.18 seconds over the 3,495-meter distance.
	   It was the eighth World Cup career win and the second in seven
days for Kjus, who had captured the first downhill race of the
season at Val D'Isere, France, last Saturday.
	   Franz finished 0.91 seconds behind the winner.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by 1.10
seconds.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion,
placed fourth ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Friday's race was the first of back-to-back downhills in this
north Italian valley. It made up for the season opener in Whistler
Mountain, Canada, canceled by bad weather earlier this month.
	   The original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the season, is
scheduled Saturday.

Man executed for murder, woman beaten for 'immoral corruption' in
</HEADLINE>
Afghan capital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The sports stadium in the beleaguered
Afghan capital was packed with spectators Friday, who watched as
Abdul Qayyum shot and killed the man who robbed and murdered his
brother.
	   Saeed Naqibullah was found guilty of robbing and killing Abdul
Hai, said Taliban officials at the public execution. In keeping
with the Taliban's brand of Islamic law the relative of a murder
victim is allowed to carry out the death penalty.
	   Before the public execution a woman in an all-enveloping burqa
was brought to the center of the field and a young Taliban soldier
with a whip beat her 100 times.
	   The charge, said the Taliban police, was ``immoral corruption.''
The woman whose name was given only as Shahemah apparently
confessed to the crime, which was not detailed.
	   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan ruled by the Taliban army it is
illegal for a woman to fraternize with a man other than a close
relative. The punishment is a public beating.
	   Since taking over Kabul in 1996 the Taliban has imposed a strict
Islamic regime and announced dozens of edicts, most of them
directed at women.
	   Women are not allowed to work, go to school or travel outside
their home unaccompanied. They must wear the all-enveloping burqa
and more devout followers of the Taliban paint their first story
windows black to stop prying eyes from seeing women inside.
	   After the public beating the woman was taken from the stadium.
It wasn't immediately known if she would be freed.

Nazi-era slave labor protesters removed from I.G. Farben office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Police removed a German lawmaker and
10 other protesters from the offices of I.G. Farben during one of
several demonstrations planned Friday against companies that
employed slave labor during the Nazi era.
	   The protesters occupied the Frankfurt offices for about 90
minutes before they were removed and brought to a police station
for identity checks, said police spokesman Manfred Fuellhardt. No
arrests were made.
	   Police said Carsten Huebner, a member of Germany's Bundestag,
the lower house of parliament, was among the protesters. Huebner
belongs to the Party of Democratic Socialism, the successors to the
East German communists.
	   The protests were led by a Duesseldorf-based group, ``Never
Again,'' which demands I.G. Farben be shut down and payments made
to former slave laborers.
	   I.G. Farben, once the world's largest chemical concern, used
inmates from the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland to run a
plant that supplied Adolf Hitler's army with synthetic rubber
products.
	   A subsidiary produced the Zyklon-B gas used for killing
concentration camp inmates during the war.
	   I.G. Farben was ordered into liquidation by the victorious
Allies and its assets were divided in 1953 among Hoechst, BASF,
Bayer chemical companies and other firms.
	   The company no longer produces anything, but maintains an office
in Frankfurt and continues to exist largely as a trust to handle
claims and lawsuits from the Nazi era.
	   ``Never Again'' also planned demonstrations in the Germany
cities of Marburg and Braunschweig Friday, targeting Volkswagen and
other companies that employed slave labor during the Nazi era.
	   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has promised to help set up
an industry-wide fund to settle back-wage claims from World War
II-era slave laborers, but no details have yet been announced of
how much would be paid and how claims would be administered.
	   Among those who have signaled participation in the fund are the
heads of Allianz insurance company, Dresdner and Deutsche banks,
Volkswagen, BMW, Siemens, Krupp, Degussa and BASF.

Wife of Malaysia's jailed former No. 2 leader plans to register
</HEADLINE>
group

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - The wife of sacked Malaysian
deputy leader Anwar Ibrahim plans to register a pro-reformist group
called the Social Justice Movement as a non-government
organization, the group said Friday.
	   Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, who took over the reform movement after
her husband was fired and jailed in September, will submit the
registration application on Saturday, the Social Justice Movement
said in a statement.
	   The statement did not say why it will seek registration as a
non-governmental organization instead of as a political opposition
party.
	   Anwar, the Southeast Asian nation's ex-deputy prime minister,
currently faces abuse of power charges and will be tried separately
for allegedly having engaged in illegal sex acts.
	   He has denied all the allegations against him, saying they were
cooked up to eliminate the challenge he posed to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   Following his dismissal by Mahathir and before his arrest, Anwar
led a series of mass rallies which called for political reforms and
his former mentor's resignation.

Schroeder's first tax cut approved by parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with all further laws passed. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Doctor Strike &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament cleared the way Friday for a tax
cut for low earners, the first step in Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's center-left agenda.
	   The vote in the upper house, which is dominated by Schroeder's
Social Democrats, kicked off the government's project to cut high
German income taxes by 15 billion marks (dlrs 9 billion) over the
next four years.
	   Speaking for the Social Democrats, Hamburg mayor Ortwin Runde
rejected calls from business leaders for greater tax relief, saying
it would force budget cuts for local governments.
	   The chamber, which represents Germany's states, also overturned
cuts in sick pay and retirement benefits made by the previous
government of Helmut Kohl, and an increase in government payments
to families with children.
	   The measures fulfill campaign promises by Schroeder, who won
September elections and formed a government alliance with the
environmentalist Greens. The lower house passed the laws earlier
this month.
	   Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine wants to present the rest of
the tax reform package, including a rise in energy taxes, early
next year.
	   Friday's measure cuts the lowest individual income tax bracket
to 23.9 percent from 25.9 percent on Jan. 1, which the government
says will shave 1,700 marks (dlrs 1,020) off the average wage
earner's tax bill next year. A cut in the top tax rate is planned
later.
	   Also passed was a health care reform that triggered a nationwide
doctors' strike Friday.

FA denies new cash-for-votes allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English Football Association on Friday
confirmed that it is paying former striker Peter Withe to coach the
Thailand national team, but denied the deal was connected with
England's 2006 World Cup bid.
	   Three days after reports suggested that the English Football
Association had promised 3.2 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) to its
Welsh equivalent to gain a vote for chairman Keith Wiseman in a
FIFA/UEFA election, the tabloid Daily Mirror said that Withe was
paid by the FA in a bid to buy Thailand's support in the race to
2006.
	   ``His salary is being funded by the English FA from a 10 million
pound (dlrs 16.7 million) cash reserve set aside for the 2006 World
Cup campaign,'' said the Mirror, which pointed out that Thailand
had a member on FIFA's World Cup Committee.
	   The FA admits that it is paying Withe but maintains that there's
nothing sinister.
	   ``It's nothing to do with any kind of cash-for-votes. That's
nonsense,'' spokesman Steve Double said. ``He's effectively
employed by us and he's, for want of a better word, on loan to
Thailand as part of our international development program to help
other countries.
	   ``We're also helping countries like Lesotho and Malawi and they
don't have members on the FIFA World Cup committee.''
	   David Davies, the FA's executive director, who temporarily took
over as chief executive after Graham Kelly resigned over the Welsh
FA payment, said Thailand approached the FA for help in improving
the standard of its national team.
	   ``We give aid in the form of resources, kit and coaches to a
number of countries in Africa and the Far East. Thailand is
receiving coaching support in the form of Peter Withe.''
	   A former Birmingham City, Wolves and Aston Villa player, Withe
scored Villa's winning goal in the 1982 Champions Cup final victory
over Bayern Munich.
	   The former striker was regarded as a hero in Thailand after
guiding the team to the semifinal of th Asian Games before it lost
3-0 to Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand
lifted off Friday morning in the world's largest balloon, hoping to
steer it on a landmark round-the-world trip.
	   Blessed by good winds and perfect weather, the 12-ton,
200-foot-high (61-meter-high) ICO Global Challenge, under escort of
Moroccan helicopters, climbed 600 feet (183 meters) a minute
through a cloudless sky after being cut loose from a Moroccan air
force base.
	   The balloon is expected to reach a cruising speed of 150-200 mph
(240-320 kph) once it enters the jet stream, said Mike Johnson, a
spokesman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone company supporting the
trip.
	   ``When (the balloon) gets to 28,000 feet (8,535 meters), it
enters the jet stream and really takes off,'' he said, adding that
it should leave Moroccan territory later Friday, heading into
Algeria.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said shortly before liftoff, delayed by two hours. ``After
that we can start to relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   This was Branson's fifth try to be the first person to make the
round-the-world balloon voyage.
	   ``I am nervous at the launch of all balloon flights,'' Fossett
ahead of the liftoff. ``Once we get to altitude and we know what
our problems are, if any, then it will be very relaxed.''
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip, estimating it could last from
eight days to nearly three weeks.

 &UR; China to put third and most prominent dissident on trial
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES throughout with third dissident to be put on
trial.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Escalating a concerted crackdown on a would-be
opposition political party, China announced a court date for the
group's most prominent leader on Friday, a day after putting two
other leading organizers on trial.
	   Court officials telephoned Xu Wenli's wife to notify her that
his trial for alleged subversion will open on Monday, she said.
That left her with a little more than two days to prepare a
defense.
	   The call was the first confirmation He Xintong received of the
charges Xu would face since being arrested at the start of the
crackdown 19 days ago. Xu, 55, faces possible life imprisonment if
the harshest aspects of the subversion law are applied.
	   By getting Xu sentenced to a long prison term, Communist Party
leaders would remove one of the most active and potent members of
the China Democracy Party and the fractured dissident community.
	   Underscoring the ruling party's determination to keep its
49-year monopoly on power, President Jiang Zemin vowed Friday never
to copy Western political systems.
	   ``The system must not be shaken, weakened, or discarded at any
time,'' Jiang said in a speech to celebrate 20 years of successful
economic reforms that was broadcast nationwide.
	   More than 30 members of the China Democracy Party have been
arrested or questioned since the latest and most aggressive
crackdown on the group began Nov. 30.
	   Judges in two cities held trials Thursday for party organizers
Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai on the same charges Xu faces. Although
no verdicts were announced after the 2 1/2-hour trials, conviction
is almost a certainty in high-profile dissident prosecutions.
	   Since Wang announced the China Democracy Party in June,
dissidents in 14 provinces and cities tried to comply with laws on
registrations but have been rebuffed each time.
	   Xu played a prominent role in the influential Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has
played the role of elder adviser to dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November after another leading dissident bowed out and organized
the group's branch in Beijing and Tianjin. He also called for party
members to begin organizing a nationwide congress.

Russia, Croatia sign deals on arms trade, defense cooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After failing to prevent U.S. and British attacks
against Iraq, Russia will concentrate even more on developments in
the Balkans, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told visiting
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Friday, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Moscow staunchly opposes possible NATO airstrikes against
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, to punish its
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. Russia has been a
traditional ally of Serbs, with whom it shares the Orthodox
Christian religion.
	   ``One should have a keener eye on the situation in the Balkans
in light of the events that concern Iraq,'' ITAR-Tass quoted
Primakov as saying.
	   Tudjman was making his first visit to to Russia since he came to
power in 1991 and led his country to independence from the former
Yugoslavia. The trip resulted in the signing of agreements on arms
trade and defense cooperation, as well as communications,
crime-fighting, trade, cultural cooperation and disaster
prevention, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Trade between Russia and Croatia totaled dlrs 620 million in
1997 and dlrs 402.9 million in the first eight months of this year,
said Nadan Vidosevic, the head of Croatia's Chamber of Economy, who
accompanied Tudjman to Moscow.
	   Tudjman praised Russia's role in international affairs.
	   ``We live in a world where the role of Russia as a superpower is
getting more conspicuous,'' Tudjman told Primakov, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia is desperately trying to maintain its influence in world
affairs, despite the decline of its military and its severe
economic troubles.
	   Tudjman was expected to meet with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin later on Friday. The two were to sign an agreement on
friendship and cooperation aimed at boosting relations.

Much-criticized Kenya police force celebrates 100th anniversary

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The much-criticized Kenya police marked
the 100th anniversary Friday of its founding by British colonial
authorities, but few people accepted the invitation to attend the
celebrations.
	   About 1,000 watched a parade through downtown Nairobi of
policemen wearing uniforms dating from 1914 to the present and then
attended a ceremony in Uhuru Park.
	   The celebration was held less than a week after a police officer
attached to the presidential guard shot dead a mini-van driver for
no apparent reason and seriously wounded his conductor, who later
died.
	   He was later charged with murder.
	   Two senior police officials last week apologized for police
excesses over the years and asked the public to forgive the many
atrocities committed by police, ranging from harassment and
demanding bribes to torture and extra-judicial killings.
	   During Friday's ceremony, religious leaders prayed that the
police force stop being brutal and corrupt and commit itself to
service for all as it moves into its second centenary.
	   ``I will pray that those elements that have let down this force
will change,'' prayed Rev. Dennis White of the Nairobi Pentecostal
Church.
	   Last week police chaplain Reserve Supt. Mike Harries called for
forgiveness but urged Kenyans to remember that the police work
against great odds and are underfunded and underpaid.
	   ``Even me, I feel the relationship between the public and the
police officer is not good,'' said Sophie Rejatim, the wife of a
policeman attending the ceremony.
	   It is not uncommon for those seeking police assistance to have
to go to police stations to fetch police because all vehicles are
broken down or they have run out of gas.
	   Victims of armed robbery and assault often wait hours for police
to show up, and many off-duty police officers have been implicated
in robberies, either through renting their service weapons to gangs
or direct participation.
	   As in most other African nations, police in Kenya routinely beat
back crowds with bullwhips and clubs and routinely beat confessions
out of petty thieves.
	   ``There is a tendency to fear the policemen. They must be the
people that we have to rely on, but you find that to some extent,
we simply fear them,'' said Dominic Mutiso, who took time off from
work to attend the ceremony. ``If you see a policeman somewhere,
you run away.''

EU fisheries ministers agree on catch quotas for 1999

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union fisheries ministers on
Friday agreed on new catch quotas for 1999 following all-night
negotiations, carefully walking a tightrope between the demands of
their fishermen and the increasing need to protect dwindling
stocks.
	   Many of the EU's executive Commission demands for sizable cuts
of up to 40 percent in the quotas to protect stocks were respected
but the powerful fisheries nations were also able to soften the
blow for their fishermen in several sectors.
	   The brokering between the conservation and economic issues
produced ``a reasonable and responsible balance,'' said Lord Sewel,
Scottish Office minister.
	   ``The member states are taking more and more the scientific
research into account,'' said EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma
Bonino.
	   The 15 fisheries ministers reached unanimous agreement on about
100 different quotas for various types of fish in waters around the
EU. Only Italy abstained when ministers voted early Friday.
	   The ministers adapted some 30 of the quota proposals and even
then, the changes were mostly minimal, EU Commission officials
said.
	   Overall, no catch decreased by more than 40 percent and most
were well within that limit. Some catches of saithe were cut by 31
percent, North Sea whiting by 27 percent, and North Sea haddock by
23 percent.
	   Fishermen though also realized some cuts were tough but
necessary. ``This was a successful exercise, against a background
of very extreme proposals,'' Barrie Deas, chief executive of
Britain's National Federation of Fishermen's Organizations, said.
	   ``The problem, 8th graf.

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Mindful of the recent blossoming in
relations with the United States, Palestinian authorities moved
Friday to contain protests against the bombing of Iraq.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   The airstrikes began late Wednesday night after a United Nations
report concluded that Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors
seeking to contain its weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   The Nablus protesters shouted slogans against the recent
Palestinian-U.S. rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in
the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter
approach.
	   Most protesters belonged to militant Islamic groups, but some
belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement.
	   Palestinian police stopped the marchers from heading toward an
Israeli-controlled area of the West Bank, where the protesters had
hoped to confront Israeli troops.
	   The Palestinian Authority is anxious to be seen as abiding by
the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords with Israel.
	   President Bill Clinton visited Israel and the Palestinian areas
earlier this week to try and break the deadlock in the accords.
	   Palestinians, especially pleased by his hints of approval of
Palestinian statehood, want to sustain the newly-friendly ties.
	   Israel was to have withdrawn from West Bank territory Friday as
part of the Wye accords. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he would miss the deadline and not move until he saw
Palestinians were containing anti-Israel violence.
	   Any anger Palestinians on the street might have felt by the
missed deadline was swallowed up by the pro-Iraq protests.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a U.S. flag. Palestinian security briefly
detained an Associated Press writer for photographing the
flag-burning, and released him on condition that he not take
pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, the marchers threw stones at Israeli
troops guarding the entrance to the city, just south of Jerusalem.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Five
protesters were injured.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down a TV station in Ramallah that had been
broadcasting pro-Iraqi interviews.
	   In Bet Douku, a village near Ramallah, over a thousand people
joined the funeral procession Friday for a youth killed by Israeli
troops during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday.
	   Mohammed Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a
green sheet.
	   ``With body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' they chanted.
``With body and soul, we will redeem you, Iraq!''
	   Some women chanted an address to his mother: ``Don't be upset,
all children are your children!''
	   His mother, Delilah, sat on the floor of her house, surrounded
women from village.
	   A friend stroked her forehead as she sobbed, ``My beloved
Mohammed.''

Protester dies in unclear circumstances, opposition blames police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ An anti-government activist waging a
hunger strike was found dead on Friday, and other opposition
supporters claimed he had been killed by police.
	   Nugzar Lezhava's body was found in the yard of a house where he
and several dozen others were on hunger strike to protest arrests
of their colleagues the previous day. The activists are followers
of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's former president, who died
mysteriously in 1994.
	   Gamsakhurdia's widow, Manana Archadze-Gamsakhurdia, said Lezhava
had been killed by police who broke into the house overnight to
drive out protesters.
	   A local prosecutor denied the claim and speculated that Lezhava
had died after falling from the roof of the building where he was
hiding from police, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Other participants in the hunger strike said police had brutally
beaten them.
	   Gamsakhurdia's widow and several hundred other opposition
activists held an unauthorized rally in downtown Tbilisi on
Thursday, and were briefly detained by police. Participants in the
rally said they were protesting their poor treatment by the
government.
	   Gamsakhurdia's supporters claim the government of President
Eduard Shevardnadze is illegal. They staged a failed mutiny against
Shevardnadze at a military garrison in October.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Hundreds of angry Muslims poured out of
mosques Friday and burned American flags to protest the bombing of
Iraq.
	   ``Resist fascist American attacks on Iraq,'' chanted a group of
300 Islamic extremists who set the stars-and-stripes ablaze in
downtown Dhaka after Friday's prayers.
	   Two more protests were held in the same area with demonstrators
shouting anti-American slogans and expressing support for Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.
	   Bangladesh's liberal government, which has close relations with
the United States, was reserved in comments on the attacks.
	   ``We are observing the situation in Iraq and we will see what
the U.N. Security Council does,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Mustafizur Rahman said in a telephone interview.
	   Bangladesh is a predominantly Muslim nation.

Malaysia's exports for first ten months of year exceed total for
</HEADLINE>
1997

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia's exports for the first
ten months of this year amount to 236.91 billion ringgit (dlrs
59.23 billion), exceeding the value of exports for all of 1997,
state-run media said Friday.
	   Exports last year totaled 220.89 billion ringgit (dlrs 55.22
billion).
	   Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said
the jump in exports came despite the negative impact on the
Southeast Asian nation's manufacturers from the regional financial
crisis, Bernama news agency said.
	   Strong export growth has helped turn around Malaysia's trade
balance numbers, allowing it to post a 44.53 billion ringgit (dlrs
11.13 billion) surplus for the first ten months of this year, the
report said.
	   That compares to a 45 million ringgit (dlrs 11 million) deficit
for all of 1997, it said.

Spain upbeat on Basque peace, to move some ETA prisoners closer to
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with comments by Aznar
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government said Friday it was upbeat
about the Basque peace process three months into a ceasefire by the
separatist group ETA and announced a concession on a long-standing
ETA demand.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar repeated a call for ETA to
transform its open-ended truce into a definitive one ending a
30-year pro-independence campaign that has claimed nearly 800
lives.
	   ``It is the cornerstone on which we can build the process of
normalization,'' Aznar said, reading from a statement.
	   In November Aznar said he had authorized preliminary talks with
ETA to determine whether it was prepared to renounce violence
permanently.
	   Last week government spokesman Josep Pique confirmed there had
been official contact with ETA but he insisted it was ``not
significant'' and did not elaborate on it. And although the
ceasefire has held, in recent weeks posters have appeared in Basque
cities threatening lawmakers of Aznar's center-right Popular Party.
	   Still, Aznar insisted Friday that the peace process was on
track. ``The government is in a position to conclude that there is
still the possibility that the current situation of an open-ended
ceasefire can be consolidated,'' he said.
	   Aznar did not elaborate or take questions from reporters.
	   In an apparent effort to advance the process, the Interior
Ministry said earlier Friday that 21 ETA inmates will be moved from
far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region.
	   ETA has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held
in Spanish jails be transferred to the Basque country itself, or at
least closer to it. The government keeps them scattered around
Spain to avoid their plotting behind bars.
	   The ministry said 21 ETA inmates will be transferred from the
Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands
in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves
on the northern coast of Morocco. They will be sent to jails in the
south of mainland Spain starting right away.
	   Since ETA started observing its ceasefire on September 18, Aznar
had been under pressure from both hard-line and moderate Basque
nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party,
to keep the peace process alive by making a significant gesture on
the prisoner issue.
	   In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners
to the Basque country itself but this was criticized as
insufficient.
	   Aznar insists that the ball is now in ETA's court, saying the
peace process cannot advance in earnest without a permanent end to
separatist violence.
	   And even so, he and other officials have said the government is
willing to discuss only prisoner transfers and other issues
involving ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated demand of
independence.
	   In his statement Friday Aznar also announced that when
parliament reconvenes after the holidays he will submit a bill
calling for the government to pay damages to victims of Basque
separatist violence.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Speeding toward the city's distinctive
needle-shaped communications tower in his green Chrysler New
Yorker, the driver turned up a radio news bulletin about the air
strikes on neighboring Iraq.
	   Even before the report was over, he flicked off the radio and
slipped in a compact disc of Arabic love songs.
	   ``I've heard enough,'' said Mohammed al-Salik, an exporter who
spent the 1991 Gulf War as a refugee in Saudi Arabia. ``It's
Saddam's problem, not ours anymore.''
	   Kuwait prospers while Iraq is pummeled.
	   Few scars remain in Kuwait's capital from battles nearly eight
years ago when U.S.-led forces ended Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's
occupation. The rebuilding and oil-fueled economic rebound also
have appeared to wipe away fears of Saddam.
	   For many people at the former epicenter of the Gulf crisis, the
attacks on Iraq seem curiously far away _ even though American
warships can be seen from the nicely groomed beaches and Chinook
helicopters fly over the city ferrying crew and supplies to the
flotilla.
	   The United States arranged for some diplomats and their
dependents to leave Kuwait. It also pledged to evacuate any of the
estimated 8,000 Americans in the country who wish to leave, reports
said.
	   British Tornado warplanes based in Kuwait joined the attack wave
that ended early Friday, British military officials said.
	   Kuwait's Cabinet, led by Crown Prince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, held an emergency session Thursday to make contingency
plans if unrest or attacks spill over from Iraq.
	   The National Guard was placed on high alert, and all military
personnel were ordered to report to their units.
	   But most Kuwaitis found little reason to worry. They shopped and
rested in preparation for the dawn-to-dusk fasts during the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan, which begins in the next several days.
	   The bombing raids in Iraq were just a conversation point and a
chance for some to quietly gloat over another Western backlash
against Saddam.
	   ``I'm sure Saddam never thought that invading our country would
have him cowering from air strikes all these years later,'' said
Khalid Tawfiq, an engineering student. ``He is the worst enemy of
his own people.''
	   Others, however, marveled at Saddam's resiliency and wondered if
he could again resurrect plans to conquer Kuwait.
	   ``As long as Saddam is still there, there's always reason for us
to worry. I can say I will not be content until he is gone. But, as
you see, he stays and stays,'' noted Ali al-Tayyib.
	   He was taking an early-morning walk toward a beach side
promenade dotted with American-style restaurants such as the
hamburger chain Fudrucker's. Faded graffiti on a wall praises the
U.S. president who led the Gulf War coalition: ``Thanks for Bush.''
	   Yet Saddam's survival and his frequent showdowns with the West
open a social divide in Kuwait.
	   Kuwaitis seem generally to favor the U.S.-led action as the way
to rid the region of an aggressive and unpredictable regime. But
the many Muslim immigrants and laborers in Kuwait see different
elements at play: Iraqis as victims of anti-Islamic forces.
	   Karamat Ali, who emigrated from Pakistan 22 years ago, frets
over difference between the opulent Kuwait and the
sanctions-battered Iraq.
	   ``How can they let these people suffer? Doesn't America know
what it is doing to Iraq? No Muslim should stand for this,'' said
Ali, watching his sons practice cricket in a seaside park.
``Someday the tables will be turned. America will be punished for
what it is doing to Iraq.''

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Mindful of the recent blossoming in
relations with the United States, Palestinian authorities moved
Friday to contain protests against the bombing of Iraq.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   The airstrikes began late Wednesday night after a United Nations
report concluded that Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors
seeking to contain its weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   The Nablus protesters shouted slogans against the recent
Palestinian-U.S. rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in
the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter
approach.
	   Most protesters belonged to militant Islamic groups, but some
belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement.
	   Palestinian police stopped the marchers from heading toward an
Israeli-controlled area of the West Bank, where the protesters had
hoped to confront Israeli troops.
	   The Palestinian Authority is anxious to be seen as abiding by
the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords with Israel.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Israel and the Palestinian
areas earlier this week to try to break the deadlock in the
accords.
	   Palestinians, especially pleased by his hints of approval of
Palestinian statehood, want to sustain the newly-friendly ties.
	   Israel was to have withdrawn from West Bank territory Friday as
part of the Wye accords. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he would miss the deadline and not move until he saw
Palestinians were containing anti-Israel violence.
	   Any anger Palestinians on the street might have felt by the
missed deadline was swallowed up by the pro-Iraq protests.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, Clinton was
greeted rapturously _ several hundred marchers shouted ``Death to
Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a U.S. flag. Palestinian security briefly
detained an Associated Press writer for photographing the
flag-burning, and released him on condition that he not take
pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, the marchers threw stones at Israeli
troops guarding the entrance to the city, just south of Jerusalem.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Five
protesters were injured.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down a TV station in Ramallah that had been
broadcasting pro-Iraqi interviews.
	   In Bet Douku, a village near Ramallah, over a thousand people
joined the funeral procession Friday for a youth killed by Israeli
troops during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday.
	   Mohammed Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a
green sheet.
	   ``With body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' they chanted.
``With body and soul, we will redeem you, Iraq!''
	   Some women chanted an address to his mother: ``Don't be upset,
all children are your children!''
	   His mother, Delilah, sat on the floor of her house, surrounded
women from village.
	   A friend stroked her forehead as she sobbed, ``My beloved
Mohammed.''

Spain upbeat on Basque peace, to move some ETA prisoners closer to

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to correct category code
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with comments by Aznar
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government said Friday it was upbeat
about the Basque peace process three months into a ceasefire by the
separatist group ETA and announced a concession on a long-standing
ETA demand.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar repeated a call for ETA to
transform its open-ended truce into a definitive one ending a
30-year pro-independence campaign that has claimed nearly 800
lives.
	   ``It is the cornerstone on which we can build the process of
normalization,'' Aznar said, reading from a statement.
	   In November Aznar said he had authorized preliminary talks with
ETA to determine whether it was prepared to renounce violence
permanently.
	   Last week government spokesman Josep Pique confirmed there had
been official contact with ETA but he insisted it was ``not
significant'' and did not elaborate on it. And although the
ceasefire has held, in recent weeks posters have appeared in Basque
cities threatening lawmakers of Aznar's center-right Popular Party.
	   Still, Aznar insisted Friday that the peace process was on
track. ``The government is in a position to conclude that there is
still the possibility that the current situation of an open-ended
ceasefire can be consolidated,'' he said.
	   Aznar did not elaborate or take questions from reporters.
	   In an apparent effort to advance the process, the Interior
Ministry said earlier Friday that 21 ETA inmates will be moved from
far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region.
	   ETA has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held
in Spanish jails be transferred to the Basque country itself, or at
least closer to it. The government keeps them scattered around
Spain to avoid their plotting behind bars.
	   The ministry said 21 ETA inmates will be transferred from the
Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands
in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves
on the northern coast of Morocco. They will be sent to jails in the
south of mainland Spain starting right away.
	   Since ETA started observing its ceasefire on September 18, Aznar
had been under pressure from both hard-line and moderate Basque
nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party,
to keep the peace process alive by making a significant gesture on
the prisoner issue.
	   In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners
to the Basque country itself but this was criticized as
insufficient.
	   Aznar insists that the ball is now in ETA's court, saying the
peace process cannot advance in earnest without a permanent end to
separatist violence.
	   And even so, he and other officials have said the government is
willing to discuss only prisoner transfers and other issues
involving ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated demand of
independence.
	   In his statement Friday Aznar also announced that when
parliament reconvenes after the holidays he will submit a bill
calling for the government to pay damages to victims of Basque
separatist violence.

	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Lasse Kjus captured his
second consecutive World Cup downhill victory this season as he
beat favored Austrians Werner Franz and Hermann Maier in Friday's
speed race at Val Gardena.
	   His second triumph in seven days vaulted the 27-year-old
Norwegian skier atop the World Cup overall standings, with 413
points, ahead of Austrian Stephan Eberharter.
	   Kjus, a World Cup overall champion in 1996 and a silver medalist
in the Olympic downhill at Nagano this year, had a faultless run
down the icy Saslong course as he clocked an unbeatable time of two
minutes, 2.18 seconds over the 3,495-meter distance.
	   It was the eighth World Cup career win _ the fourth in downhill
_ for Kjus, who had captured the first speed race of the season at
Val D'Isere, France, last Saturday.
	   Franz finished 0.91 seconds behind the winner.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by 1.10
seconds.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion,
placed fourth ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Other top finishers included Austrian Andreas Schifferer (6th),
Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn (7th) and Hans Kanuss and Pietro Vitalini,
who were tied for eighth place, 2.02 seconds behind the winner.
	   The race was marred by two bad spills.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line, escaped
unhurt and still placed 13th.
	   French late starter David Pretot crashed against safety fences
in the upper part of the course and was taken away on a toboggan.
	   Organizers said Pretot possibly twisted his right knee and that
he was going to undergo medical examinations later in the day.
	   Kjus, an all-around skier who can pocket World Cup points in all
disciplines of Alpine skiing, said he won a grueling race ``on an
icy track, with a lot of big jumps.''
	   ``When you jump too long you lose time, and you certainly feel
them in the legs after a run like this. I am overjoyed with my
second downhill victory,'' the Norwegian said.
	   Friday's race was the first of back-to-back downhills in this
north Italian valley. It made up for the season opener in Whistler
Mountain, Canada, canceled by bad weather earlier this month.
	   The original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the season, is
scheduled Saturday.

South Korea topples Asian rugby giant Japan 21-17 for gold

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Underdog South Korea showed opportunism
and a concrete defense to rally from 10 points down Friday and
defeat Asian rugby giant Japan 21-17 for the Asian Games rugby
union gold medal.
	   Taiwan beat Sri Lanka 38-20 for the bronze.
	   Jubilant South Korean officials said the pair of rugby gold
medals their team has won here _ they defeated Japan in the sevens
last week _ marked a new era in Asian rugby, ending traditional
Japanese dominance.
	   ``This is the biggest victory we have ever had, said Ko
Byung-kyo, a director of the Korean Rugby Football Union. ``I think
that this is the beginning of a new era. This is a team of great
motivation.''
	   Japan's coach, Seiji Hirao, called his team's defeat
``unfortunate'' and blamed its inability to win a gold medal on
numerous injuries.
	   ``We made a lot of mistakes in the end,'' Hirao said. ``The
Koreans put on good pressure and they had good fighting spirit on
their team.''
	   Japan took the lead in the 4th minute on a try, with a score of
passes veering back and forth until scrum half Katsuji Ohara edged
over the left corner flag.
	   Fly half Keiji Hirose converted for 7-0.
	   The Koreans drew even in the 16th minute when right flanker Woo
Tae-il broke loose and sprinted 40 meters across the Japanese try
line. Fly half Kim Jae-sung converted.
	   But 11 minutes later, Kim kicked wide on a 30-meter penalty that
would have put Korea ahead. Hirose didn't make the same mistake
with a penalty chip near the end of the half and put Japan ahead,
10-7.
	   In the second half, the Japanese widened their lead in the 5th
minute when right wing Tsutomo Matsuda scooped up a loose ball and
made a wide, hooking run 25 meters around the Korean defense for a
try. Hirose's conversion made it 17-7.
	   The Koreans drove the ball within five meters of a try several
times, only to give up possession. But in the 29th minute they
finally got one across with Lim Sung-soo, and Kim converted,
bringing the team back within striking range at 17-14.
	   Four minutes later, center Yoo Min-suk, who was instrumental in
many drives, carried to about 13 meters before being submerged by
Japanese.
	   Woo came up with the ball and broke through for his second try.
Kim made the conversion for a 21-17 lead.
	   The Japanese poured on pressure, but for 20 minutes and well
into extra time they crashed into a rock-hard Korean defensive wall
within meters of scoring.
	   After watching his team's poor showing Hirao said he would be
making a number of changes to his side before next year's rugby
World Cup.
	   Ko, meanwhile, was calculating his team's chance of overcoming
the Netherlands in a qualifier in the sport's most prestigious
tournament.
	   In the bronze decider, Lin Yi-te, Wen Kuang-liang, Chen
Chia-hsin and Wu Chih-Hsien scored tries for Taiwan. Kuo Shan-pen
converted three and kicked four penalty goals.
	   I. Bandaranayake scored Sri Lanka's sole try. Nalaka Weerakkody
kicked five penalty goals for the balance.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and set the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   The two days of attacks have targeted dozens of sites, including
the headquarters of the military intelligence and security police
and factories that were monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, Iraqi
officials said.
	   As a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less evident
and early risers were seen going about their normal business.
Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but worried
motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their tanks
were full.
	   Iraqi newspapers Friday called on people to rally behind
President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' the Babil newspaper said in large
red letters above the name of the newspaper.
	   Below the slogan was a drawing of Saddam dressed in a
traditional white Arab robe hurling a spear at a large, black
hissing snake. The picture showed Saddam atop a white horse and
took up about a third of the front page.
	   The newspaper urged Iraqis to ``show their readiness for
sacrifice and their readiness to face the evil aggressors.''
	   Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath Party, headlined
its anti-American editorial ``Operation Monica.''
	   In an apparent effort to incite the public to rise up against
Saddam, U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets over southern Iraq on
Thursday, an Information Ministry official said.
	   He said the leaflets were designed to ``arouse the people'' but
gave no further details.
	   The largely Shiite Muslim south rebelled against Saddam
following the 1991 Gulf War, but the uprising was suppressed by
Iraqi forces.
	   Saudi armored units briefly moved close to the Iraqi border
Thursday, apparently on a surveillance mission, the Iraqi official
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday had set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   The Thursday attack targeted several factories that were
monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the Nida heavy
machinery factory, some 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Baghdad,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said.
	   The U.N. teams have cameras and chemical sensors at a number of
sites in Iraq to ensure that the equipment is not used for the
clandestine manufacture of chemical or biological weapons or
long-range missile parts.
	   Friday's early morning attack damaged several buildings in
Baghdad, including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy
College of Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Mindful of the recent blossoming in
relations with the United States, Palestinian authorities moved
Friday to contain protests against the bombing of Iraq.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   The airstrikes began late Wednesday night after a United Nations
report concluded that Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors
seeking to contain its weapons-of-mass-destruction capability.
	   The Nablus protesters shouted slogans against the recent
Palestinian-U.S. rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in
the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter
approach.
	   Most protesters belonged to militant Islamic groups, but some
belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement.
	   Palestinian police stopped the marchers from heading toward an
Israeli-controlled area of the West Bank, where the protesters had
hoped to confront Israeli troops.
	   The Palestinian Authority is anxious to be seen as abiding by
the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords with Israel.
	   President Bill Clinton visited Israel and the Palestinian areas
earlier this week to try and break the deadlock in the accords.
	   Palestinians, especially pleased by his hints of approval of
Palestinian statehood, want to sustain the newly-friendly ties.
	   Israel was to have withdrawn from West Bank territory Friday as
part of the Wye accords. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he would miss the deadline and not move until he saw
Palestinians were containing anti-Israel violence.
	   Any anger Palestinians on the street might have felt by the
missed deadline was swallowed up by the pro-Iraq protests.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a U.S. flag. Palestinian security briefly
detained an Associated Press writer for photographing the
flag-burning, and released him on condition that he not take
pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, the marchers threw stones at Israeli
troops guarding the entrance to the city, just south of Jerusalem.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Fifteen
protesters were injured.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down two local TV stations and a radio in
Ramallah.
	   Both TV stations broadcast test signals saying they were closed
``until further notice'' and on the radio station's frequency,
there was only instrumental music.
	   There was no official explanation for the shutdown, but Al Watan
TV station had broadcast pro-Iraqi interviews; Al Nasr TV had
broadcast nationalist music; and The Voice of Peace had devoted its
broadcasts on Thursday to a popular nationalist Iraqi singer.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab governments and newspapers fiercely
criticized the U.S. air strikes on Baghdad Friday as thousands of
protesters in Arab capitals shouted angry slogans against the
United States.
	   The message from officials and editorials was that unleashing
missiles at the heart of Baghdad would do more harm to the Iraqi
people than to President Saddam Hussein.
	   On Arab streets, demonstrators condemned the attacks as an
attempt by U.S. President Bill Clinton to squirm out of the scandal
over his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read a sign
waved during a protest at Cairo's al-Azhar mosque, one of the most
famous in the Arab world.
	   Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura said the U.S.
strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of Iraq's people,
``particularly its children and civilians.''
	   ``We ... condemn and denounce this attack and call on the
international community to condemn and halt it immediately,'' he
said in a speech to the Parliament.
	   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, expressed his ``great concern over the military action
against Iraq and its repercussions on the Iraqi people,'' the
Emirates news agency reported late Thursday.
	   It also quoted a government spokesman as saying: ``The terrible
operation we have seen on television ... is beyond comprehension
and is unacceptable.''
	   In the Egyptian capital Cairo, hundreds of worshipers gathered
at the al-Azhar mosque to shout demands for Arabs to defend Iraq
against the American onslaught.
	   ``Leaders of the country, let us go to holy war,'' the
protesters chanted. The crowd of demonstrators briefly broke
through a cordon of scores of police surrounding the mosque before
being shoved back onto the Al-Azhar grounds.
	   Sheik Mohamed Tantawi, leader of Al-Azhar, also urged solidarity
with the Iraqis in his sermon. ``Stand by the Iraqi people or we
will be hit by God's damnation,'' he preached.
	   Inside the mosque, there were shouts urging attacks on American
interests and belittling comments about Clinton's motive for the
repeated missile strikes on Iraq.
	   ``Iraq is suffering because of an American whore and a big baby
boy,'' said Mohammed Hassan, 20, a medical student.
	   Similar protests were staged in the capitals of Lebanon, Jordan
and Yemen, where 15,000 people people marched through the streets
of San`a shouting, ``America is the enemy of the Muslims.''
	   In countries closely allied to the United States _ such as Egypt
and Jordan _ authorities brought out massive security forces to
prevent demonstrations from turning violent.
	   About 300 police ringed a demonstration of 30-40 people at a
mosque near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. In the Jordanian capital
Amman, about 500 demonstrators were surrounded by an equal number
of police.
	   At Amman's University of Jordan mosque, the protesters called
for an Arab revolt against the United States.
	   ``Saddam ... if you want commandos we are ready'' and ``Syria,
Jordan, Iraq _ revolt and make Clinton go to hell'' were among
slogans chanted.
	   In non-Arab Iran, demonstrators at Tehran's Palestine Square
called for international intervention to stop ``the massacre of
innocent people'' in Iraq _ traditionally an enemy of the Iranians.
	   In Lebanon's capital Beirut, about 2,500 people staged a sit-in
outside U.N. headquarters. The protesters waved Iraqi flags and
shouted, ``Beloved Iraq, strike Tel Aviv,'' the Israeli coastal
city.
	   Ghassan Tweini, publisher of the Lebanon's leading daily
An-Nahar, urged a summit of Arab leaders to demand a halt to
attacks on Iraq. He wrote that the attacks were misguided in trying
to oust Saddam.
	   ``Leave it to the Iraqis, not the Americans, not the Turks nor
the Kurds nor the Israelis ... to decide the fate of the Iraqi
regime,'' Tweini wrote in his paper's Friday edition.
	   The Beirut newspaper As-Safir also said that the American
attacks would give Saddam ``a new lease on life.''
	   Most Iraqi opposition parties joined in the criticism of the
attacks.
	   The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose
invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the following year's Gulf War and
eight years of trade sanctions on Iraq.
	   Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister and
deputy prime minister, told the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm the current
crisis was between Iraqi and the United Nations.
	   ``We have nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, wrote
Friday that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ``will be hanging naked from
street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the U.S. attacks end.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai life insurance company will pay
dlrs 25,000 to the family of Rizvi Fulile Zain, Sri Lanka's
swimming team manager, who suffered a fatal heart attack at the

	   It said a check for dlrs 25,000 would be presented Saturday to
the leader of Sri Lanka's delegation at the games.
	   Fulile Zain died Monday.
	   ``Everybody was saddened by the sudden passing of the manager,
and the president of the Olympic Council of Asia, Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, has sent a letter of condolence to the Sri
Lankan Olympic Committee,'' said Santiparb Tejevanija, chairman of
the organizing subcommittee.

Imelda Marcos snubs Philippine Senate hearing on husband's wealth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine first lady Imelda
Marcos snubbed a Senate hearing Friday on claims that her husband
entrusted his fortune to former business associates who now refuse
to return it.
	   Senator Aquilino Pimentel, chairman of the Senate Blue Ribbon
Committee, issued a subpoena to compel Mrs. Marcos to appear at the
resumption of the hearing on Monday.
	   Senator Raul Roco, chairman of the Senate committee on banks,
which called for the hearing, said Mrs. Marcos must show respect to
the chamber by appearing at the hearing, but that she could not be
forced to talk.
	   The widow of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos claimed earlier
this month that her family owns much of the country and plans to
sue her husband's former ``cronies'' who have refused to turn over
the wealth he entrusted to them.
	   The suit would try to recover at least 500 billion pesos (dlrs
12.65 billion) in equity in more than 100 top Philippine
corporations where Marcos' associates allegedly served as his front
men.
	   Mrs. Marcos claims her family had controlling interests in such
blue chip concerns as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.,
the biggest telecommunications carrier in the country which is
partially owned by Hong Kong-based First Pacific.
	   She also said her family is the rightful owner of a large stake
in San Miguel Corp., the largest food and beverage conglomerate in
the nation.
	   Other companies targeted by Marcos include United Coconut
Planters Bank, Allied Bank and Asia Brewery.
	   ``We practically own everything in the Philippines,'' Mrs.
Marcos was quoted as saying by the Philippine Daily Inquirer, which
ran a series of reports on her claims.
	   One of her lawyers, Rudolfo Jimenez, said Mrs. Marcos should not
be forced to appear at the hearing because she could incriminate
herself.
	   ``I am trying to prevent the possibility of a fishing
expedition, to fish for evidence that has never been there,''
Jimenez said.
	   During Friday's hearing, Inquirer reporter Christine Herrera
gave copies of her taped interviews with Mrs. Marcos.
	   Roco said the tapes would establish that Mrs. Marcos indeed made
the claims.
	   ``Her problem is she talked already. You cannot thereafter claim
these are confidential after you blurted out to all and sundry,''
he said.
	   Ms. Herrera also showed a transcript of her interview with Mrs.
Marcos in which the former first lady said that a senior member of
the President Joseph Estrada's Cabinet, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora, held shares for the Marcos family in Security Bank, which
has been sequestered by the government.
	   Zamora, however, said her claim was ``completely untrue.''
	   Reacting to the transcript, Mrs. Marcos said in a statement that
the Inquirer was ``taking things out of context.''
	   ``Comments made in levity are distorted and reported as gospel
truth. Besides, Ronnie Zamora has nothing to do with Security Bank.
He is a dear friend with impeccable credentials,'' Mrs. Marcos.
	   Some officials have expressed disbelief about her ``fantastic''
claims, but Roco indicated he had an open mind.
	   ``Why should I not listen to a first lady who says she wants to
tell the truth?'' he said.
	   The government has accused the Marcoses of illegally enriching
themselves during his 20-year rule.
	   But Mrs. Marcos claims her husband was already a wealthy lawyer
even before he was elected president in 1965 by having traded gold
and secretly helped raise money for the Philippine government.
	   The government has put claims on Marcos' wealth, including about
dlrs 570 million in his Swiss deposits now held in an escrow
account in a Philippine bank.
	   The Swiss accounts are also being claimed by 9,539 Filipinos who
won a class action suit for human rights violations against the
Marcos estate and were awarded dlrs 2 billion in damages.
	   Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986 and died in exile
in Hawaii three years later. He had denied any wrongdoing.

After two years, Rwandans separated by war united with mother

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Consolee Mukarushegura left no stone
unturned in the two-year search for her children lost in Congo. On
Friday, she cried out when the two recognized her in a crowded
airport terminal in Kigali.
	   ``I can't explain how I feel,'' Mukarushegura said, holding back
tears. ``I didn't know if they were alive. They didn't know if I
was alive.''
	   The 39-year-old mother lost Jean-Pierre, 12, and Jean-Paul, 10,
in 1996 when Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels attacked the refugee
camp in which she was living with hundreds of thousands of other
Rwandan Hutus in what was then eastern Zaire.
	   The camps were used by former Hutu soldiers and militiamen _ who
fled Rwanda fearing reprisals for the 1994 massacre of more than
500,000 people _ to regroup and launch attacks against Rwanda's new
Tutsi-led government.
	   Mukarushegura was among 1 million Hutu civilians used by the
Hutu fighters as human shields against the rebel attack.
	   ``Jean-Pierre and Jean-Paul fled the firing, and I stayed
behind,'' she said. ``I came back to Rwanda with my other two
children and have been looking for them ever since.''
	   At first, the Red Cross, which facilitated the reunion, told
Mukarushegura it could not help because it did not know where to
look for her children.
	   The British charity, Save the Children, said it couldn't carry
out a search in Congo because of deteriorating security.
	   And in August, another civil war erupted in Congo. This time,
Rwandan-backed ethnic Congolese Tutsis and disaffected Congolese
soldiers accused President Laurent Kabila of misrule, ethnic
warmongering and recruiting Rwandan Hutu fighters.
	   ``I knew I had to do it on my own,'' Mukarushegura said.
	   In May, a friend of hers returned to Rwanda with news that her
two sons had been seen in Walikale, a small trading town in the
northeastern Masisi forest.
	   Mukarushegura sent a letter to Walikale with a trader and soon
got the confirmation.
	   Jean-Pierre and Jean-Paul said they had been living with a
Congolese family in Walikale until last week, when they brought
them to a Belgian Roman Catholic priest in Goma, on the border with
Rwanda.
	   The priest handed the boys over to the Red Cross mission.
	   On Friday they boarded a plane to Kigali where Mukarushegura was
waiting.
	   Since 1996, when more than 1 million Hutus returned to Rwanda,
the Red Cross says it has reunited more than 700 children who had
gotten separated from their parents during the massive return.
	   A total of 28,993 unaccompanied children have been registered in
Rwanda alone. The Red Cross says it has reunited 25,154 of them
with their families, sometimes using photos of the young ones who
could not remember their home.
	   A single mother, Mukarushegura said she lost her husband in a
1994 killing. She said her salary from working at a Kigali hotel
will not be enough to send children to school.
	   ``But we're together,'' she said.

China picks up second Asian Games gold in wushu
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Wu Gang won China's second Asian Games
gold Friday in the ancient martial art of wushu, proving himself
the most skilled with a spear, sword and bare fists.
	   Wu won the men's changquan combined competition, in which wushu
experts perform set martial arts routines before judges who look
for control, grace and other skills in awarding points.
	   Wu scored 9.48 with a sword in the short weapon category, 9.5
with a spear in the long weapon discipline and 9.56 in bare-handed
changquan for a combined total of 28.54.
	   Mark-Robert Rosales of the Philippines performed with a cudgel
in long weapon and a broadsword in short weapon and scored a total
27.78 points. That tied him for silver with Oh Poh-Soon of
Malaysia, who used sword and spear and also scored 27.78 points.
	   China had already won gold Thursday through Lang Rongbiao in the
men's nanquan style of wushu.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and set the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   The two days of attacks have targeted dozens of sites, including
the headquarters of the military intelligence and security police
and factories that were monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, Iraqi
officials said.
	   As a new day dawned, the tension of the night was less evident
and early risers were seen going about their normal business.
Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim Sabbath, but worried
motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their tanks
were full.
	   Iraqi newspapers Friday called on people to rally behind
President Saddam Hussein.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' the Babil newspaper said in large
red letters above the name of the newspaper.
	   Below the slogan was a drawing of Saddam dressed in a
traditional white Arab robe hurling a spear at a large, black
hissing snake. The picture showed Saddam atop a white horse and
took up about a third of the front page.
	   The newspaper urged Iraqis to ``show their readiness for
sacrifice and their readiness to face the evil aggressors.''
	   Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath Party, headlined
its anti-American editorial ``Operation Monica.''
	   In an apparent effort to incite the public to rise up against
Saddam, U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets over southern Iraq on
Thursday, an Information Ministry official said.
	   He said the leaflets were designed to ``arouse the people'' but
gave no further details.
	   The largely Shiite Muslim south rebelled against Saddam
following the 1991 Gulf War, but the uprising was suppressed by
Iraqi forces.
	   Saudi armored units briefly moved close to the Iraqi border
Thursday, apparently on a surveillance mission, the Iraqi official
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday had set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   The Thursday attack targeted several factories that were
monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the Nida heavy
machinery factory, some 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Baghdad,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said.
	   The U.N. teams have cameras and chemical sensors at a number of
sites in Iraq to ensure that the equipment is not used for the
clandestine manufacture of chemical or biological weapons or
long-range missile parts.
	   Friday's early morning attack damaged several buildings in
Baghdad, including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy
College of Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.

Polish legislators override presidential veto on secret files bill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf with Kwasniewski signing bill &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish legislators voted Friday to
override President Aleksander Kwasniewski's veto of a bill that
would allow victims of communist-era repression to see their secret
police files.
	   Kwasniewski later signed the measure, but said he still believed
it was a ``bad law.''
	   Legislators in the Sejm, the lower chamber of parliament, stood
and applauded after the 282-164 vote that overturned the
president's Dec. 12 veto.
	   It was a major victory over Kwasniewski, a former communist, by
the governing coalition of parties linked to the Solidarity
movement that toppled communism in 1989.
	   Jacek Rybicki, a senior Solidarity leader in parliament, said
the new law meant progress in ``closing the door behind communist
Poland.'' He said the override showed that Kwasniewski lacked the
support to veto at will.
	   But it came with a price. An opposition group mostly
representing farmers, the Polish Peasant's Party, joined the
Solidarity-led coalition in mustering the 60 percent majority
needed.
	   To gain the Polish Peasant's Party support, the coalition agreed
to make relatively minor changes in the law. Amending the law will
require a few more months of parliament activity.
	   ``I have not changed my opinion _ this is a bad law,''
Kwasniewski said before signing it. ``It is good that it will never
function in the present shape.''

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab governments and newspapers fiercely
criticized the U.S. air strikes on Baghdad on Friday as thousands
of protesters in Arab capitals shouted angry slogans against the
United States.
	   The message from officials and editorials was that unleashing
missiles at the heart of Baghdad would do more harm to the Iraqi
people than to President Saddam Hussein.
	   On Arab streets, demonstrators condemned the attacks as an
attempt by U.S. President Bill Clinton to squirm out of the scandal
over his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read a sign
waved during a protest at Cairo's al-Azhar mosque, one of the most
famous in the Arab world.
	   Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura said the U.S.
strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of Iraq's people,
``particularly its children and civilians.''
	   ``We ... condemn and denounce this attack and call on the
international community to condemn and halt it immediately,'' he
said in a speech to the Parliament.
	   Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab
Emirates, expressed his ``great concern over the military action
against Iraq and its repercussions on the Iraqi people,'' the
Emirates news agency reported late Thursday.
	   It also quoted a government spokesman as saying: ``The terrible
operation we have seen on television ... is beyond comprehension
and is unacceptable.''
	   In the Egyptian capital Cairo, hundreds of worshipers gathered
at the al-Azhar mosque to shout demands for Arabs to defend Iraq
against the American onslaught.
	   ``Leaders of the country, let us go to holy war,'' the
protesters chanted. The crowd of demonstrators briefly broke
through a cordon of scores of police surrounding the mosque before
being shoved back onto the Al-Azhar grounds.
	   Sheik Mohamed Tantawi, leader of Al-Azhar, also urged solidarity
with the Iraqis in his sermon. ``Stand by the Iraqi people or we
will be hit by God's damnation,'' he preached.
	   Inside the mosque, there were shouts urging attacks on American
interests and belittling comments about Clinton's motive for the
repeated missile strikes on Iraq.
	   ``Iraq is suffering because of an American whore and a big baby
boy,'' said Mohammed Hassan, 20, a medical student.
	   Similar protests were staged in the capitals of Lebanon, Jordan
and Yemen, where 15,000 people people marched through the streets
of San`a shouting, ``America is the enemy of the Muslims.''
	   In countries closely allied to the United States _ such as Egypt
and Jordan _ authorities brought out massive security forces to
prevent demonstrations from turning violent.
	   About 300 police ringed a demonstration of 30-40 people at a
mosque near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. In the Jordanian capital
Amman, about 500 demonstrators were surrounded by an equal number
of police.
	   At Amman's University of Jordan mosque, the protesters called
for an Arab revolt against the United States.
	   ``Saddam ... if you want commandos, we are ready'' and ``Syria,
Jordan, Iraq _ revolt and make Clinton go to hell'' were among
slogans chanted.
	   In non-Arab Iran, demonstrators at Tehran's Palestine Square
called for international intervention to stop ``the massacre of
innocent people'' in Iraq _ traditionally an enemy of the Iranians.
	   In Lebanon's capital Beirut, about 2,500 people staged a sit-in
outside U.N. headquarters. The protesters waved Iraqi flags and
shouted, ``Beloved Iraq, strike Tel Aviv,'' the Israeli coastal
city.
	   Ghassan Tweini, publisher of the Lebanon's leading daily
An-Nahar, urged a summit of Arab leaders to demand a halt to
attacks on Iraq. He wrote that the attacks were misguided in trying
to oust Saddam.
	   ``Leave it to the Iraqis, not the Americans, not the Turks nor
the Kurds nor the Israelis ... to decide the fate of the Iraqi
regime,'' Tweini wrote in his paper's Friday edition.
	   The Beirut newspaper As-Safir also said that the American
attacks would give Saddam ``a new lease on life.''
	   Most Iraqi opposition parties joined in the criticism of the
attacks.
	   The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose
invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the following year's Gulf War and
eight years of trade sanctions on Iraq.
	   Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister and
deputy prime minister, told the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm the current
crisis was between Iraqi and the United Nations.
	   ``We have nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, wrote
Friday that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz ``will be hanging naked from
street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the U.S. attacks end.

Iranian wrestlers sweep three gold medals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Iran's wrestlers won three Asian Games
gold medals and a bronze in four freestyle divisions Friday.
	   ``No surprise, we are among the world's best wrestlers,'' said
coach Amir Reza Khadem. ``Iranians know how to wrestle since after
they were born. We will have a big celebration at home.''
	   Thirty Iranians chanted ``Iran, Iran,'' while banging on plastic
bottles and waving their national flag as Ali-Reza Rezaei won the
freestyle 130-kilogram division, Alibeza Heidari the 85-kilogram
and Amir Tavaclian the 69-kilogram. Mohammad Talaei won the bronze
for 58 kilograms.
	   North Korea's Ri Yong Sam grabbed the gold medal in the
58-kilogram division. The silver went to Mongolia's Oyunbeleg
Purevbaatar.
	   Uzbekistan's Georgiy Kaysinov in the 130-kilogram category and
Rasul Katinovasov at 85 kilograms were awarded silvers. The bronzes
were won respectively by G. Usukhbajar of Mongolia and Magomed
Kurugliyev of Kazakstan.
	   Syria's Ahmad al-Osta won the silver for the 69-kilogram, and
Japan's Ryusaburo Katsu the bronze.

Havel's condition improving, plans for meeting with premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The condition of President Vaclav
Havel improved Friday and he planned a Christmas meeting with
Premier Milos Zeman early next week.
	   Havel had been suffering from the flu since last weekend,
leading to concern about possible breathing complications.
	   A former chain smoker, Havel has been hospitalized five times
since December 1996, when a third of his lung and a cancerous tumor
were removed.
	   According the president's doctor, Ilja Kotik, Havel's
temperature had returned to normal by Friday and he was feeling
well again.
	   A report from Havel's office said the president planned a
Christmas meeting with Premier Milos Zeman on Monday morning, his
first public appearance since he took a break from duties earlier
this week.
	   According to the same report, doctors would decide early next
week whether the president and his wife, Dagmar, would travel on
several weeks of pre-planned vacation probably in the Mediterranean
region or northern Africa.

Gerg wins first career downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, CHANGES throughout, CORRECTS Goetschl as
combined champion NOTNOT Gerg &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg
of Germany proved she was just as skilled in the speed events as
the technical on Friday, winning her first career World Cup
downhill.
	   Gerg, whose previous best downhill result was second place in
Val d'Isere over a year ago, tamed the icy, treacherous 2,500-meter
(8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours in 1 minute, 41.13 seconds, to collect
her seventh career World Cup victory.
	   ``On a difficult, turny course like this one, it's clear that
technical skiers were at a strong advantage,'' said Gerg, who has
won seven races in as many years on the World Cup circuit. ``I like
this type of course.
	   ``But still, a course like this one is still very difficult for
technical skiers, for it can be hard to find the right line and
master your skis to avoid a fatal mistake.''
	   The 1997 overall World Cup champion Pernilla Wiberg, still
seeking her first victory of the season, settled for second,
crossing in 1:41.55.
	   Wiberg, who labored through an injury-plagued campaign last
season, was relieved with her second place.
	   ``This was so good for me,'' said Wiberg, who is aiming for a
second overall title. ``It was turny and icy, which I like.
	   ``I thought I might have a chance after the training runs, but
it's very easy to make a mistake on a course like this and lose
your line.''
	   Italy's Bibiana Perez was the day's other surprise, the Italian
finishing third behind Gerg in 1:41.63 for her first career
downhill podium.
	   Overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of four races this
season including back-to-back victories in Val d'Isere last week,
placed fourth in 1:41.92.
	   Third in the World Cup overall last season behind teammates
Katja Seizinger and Martina Ertl, Gerg said this year she hopes to
improve to second or even first.
	   But with double Olympic champion Seizinger out for the season
with bad knees, many others on the circuit have their eye on the
coveted overall title.
	   ``Certainly Katja's absence has placed a bit of pressure on the
rest of the team,'' said Gerg, after giving Germany its first win
of the season. ``Of course it's easier if we share the burden.
	   ``But this victory is very promising for the rest of the
season,'' said Gerg. ``It's a good omen.''
	   Meissnitzer, however, has had good omens of her own, and plenty
of them.
	   Fifth in the overall last year, Meissnitzer's four victories
this season have already vaulted her to the top of the standings
with 675 points, a whopping 277 clear of her nearest rival Ertl.
	   While Gerg's victory lifted her to fifth from ninth in the
standings, the German still lags 375 points behind Meissnitzer.
	   Meissnitzer excels in the same events as Gerg, and has a pair of
giant slalom and Super-G wins as well as two other podium finishes
this season, while the German has just one other top-three result
this year, a third in a super-G in Lake Louise, Canada.
	   Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the season opening
back-to-back downhills in Lake Louise and posted the fastest time
in Wednesday's training, finished back in 14th, 2.11 behind.
	   Goetschl had showed signs of struggling in Thursday's practice
session where she finished back in 15th.
	   The reigning World Cup combined champion, Goetschl will have a
double opportunity to make up for the lapse come Saturday's
downhill, which, with Sunday's slalom, will count towards the
combined.
	   Reigniting her career, France's Regine Cavagnoud, 28, is having
her best season since 1993, adding a fifth place finish to a third
in a super-G in Val d'Isere last week.
	   Cavagnoud, a nine-year veteran of the French ski team, finished
.93 back, ahead of compatriot Florence Masnada, sixth in 1:42.20.
	   American Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, finished 19th, 2.81
adrift, while Kathleen Monahan of Aspen, Colorado, was 22nd, 3.02
off the pace.

Rugova gets support for autonomy, but not independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Ibrahim Rugova received a human
rights prize Friday, but won little support from Czech officials
for an independent state for Kosovo Albanians, CTK news agency
reported.
	   Rugova, chairman of the Democratic League of Kosovo and the
unofficial leader of Kosovo Albanians, was invited by the People In
Need Foundation to receive the 1998 annual Homo Homini Award for
outstanding courage in defense of human rights.
	   He was scheduled to meet Thursday with President Vaclav Havel,
but the meeting was canceled because Havel was ill. Havel sent
Rugova a letter praising his ``non-violent approach to political
negotiations.''
	   ``A broad, cleverly applied autonomy can create conditions for
overcoming inter-ethnic tension,'' Havel said about the situation
in Kosovo. Excerpts of the letter were published in the media
Friday.
	   According to a CTK report Friday, Rugova sought support for an
independent state for Kosovo Albanians during his stay in Prague,
but found little sympathy. Kosovo is part of the Yugoslav republic
of Serbia.
	   Hundreds of people have died in clashes this year between Serb
forces and rebel ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   ``I think the solution is not in the creation of new ethnic
national states ... the solution is democracy,'' CTK quoted Jiri
Dienstbier as saying. He is former Czechoslovak foreign minister
and now a special rapporteur of the U.N. Commission for Human
Rights in the Balkans.

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Mindful of the recent blossoming in
relations with the United States, Palestinian authorities moved
Friday to contain protests against the bombing of Iraq.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   The airstrikes began late Wednesday night after a United Nations
report concluded that Iraq was not cooperating with inspectors
seeking to contain its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Nablus protesters shouted slogans against the recent
Palestinian-U.S. rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in
the air when they saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter
approach.
	   Most protesters belonged to militant Islamic groups, but some
belonged to Arafat's Fatah movement.
	   Palestinian police stopped the marchers from heading toward an
Israeli-controlled area of the West Bank, where the protesters had
hoped to confront Israeli troops.
	   The Palestinian Authority is anxious to be seen as abiding by
the U.S.-brokered Wye River accords with Israel.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Israel and the Palestinian
areas earlier this week to try and break the deadlock in the
accords.
	   Palestinians, especially pleased by his hints of approval of
Palestinian statehood, want to sustain the newly-friendly ties.
	   Israel was to have withdrawn from West Bank territory Friday as
part of the Wye accords. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said he would miss the deadline and not move until he saw
Palestinians were containing anti-Israel violence.
	   Any anger Palestinians on the street might have felt by the
missed deadline was swallowed up by the pro-Iraq protests.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, Clinton was
greeted rapturously _ several hundred marchers shouted ``Death to
Clinton.''
	   Protesters burned a U.S. flag. Palestinian security briefly
detained an Associated Press writer for photographing the
flag-burning, and released him on condition that he not take
pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, the marchers threw stones at Israeli
troops guarding the entrance to the city, just south of Jerusalem.
	   The troops responded with rubber bullets and tear gas. Fifteen
protesters were injured.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down two local TV stations and a radio in
Ramallah.
	   Both TV stations broadcast test signals saying they were closed
``until further notice'' and on the radio station's frequency,
there was only instrumental music.
	   There was no official explanation for the shutdown, but Al Watan
TV station had broadcast pro-Iraqi interviews; Al Nasr TV had
broadcast nationalist music; and The Voice of Peace had devoted its
broadcasts on Thursday to a popular nationalist Iraqi singer.

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's relations with the United States and the
West may be seriously damaged by the U.S. attack on Iraq, wiping
out years of progress since the end of the Cold War, top military
leaders warned Friday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin and Russian leaders across the political
spectrum have denounced the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq,
demanding an immediate halt to the campaign.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Friday it had recalled Russia's
ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came one
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled to
protest the attacks.
	   The Kremlin said diplomatic relations with Washington and London
would not be broken.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, was to consider
calls Friday for Russia to unilaterally break U.N. sanctions
against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad, a long-time Soviet and
Russian friend.
	   However, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov cautioned that
``unilateral action is not a solution to the situation around
Iraq,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as
saying.
	   Ivashov warned that the American military might be using the
attacks as a model for a nuclear strike, Interfax reported.
``Cruise missiles being used in this operation can carry both
conventional and nuclear weapons,'' he said.
	   The Russian navy was putting some units on alert because of the
Iraq crisis, but there had been no deployment of ships, officials
said. The move appeared purely symbolic. The Russian military is
not considered an effective force after years of neglect and poor
funding.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday the U.S. and
British strikes ``flagrantly violated the norms of the
international law and openly ignored the world community's efforts
to settle the situation.''
	   Sergeyev, the country's highest-ranking officer, said Moscow's
relations with NATO were threatened. ``How can we talk about
cooperation and partnership with the alliance now, when Russia's
opinion is openly ignored,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin is under opposition pressure to curb ties with the West
at a time when he has lost much of his political clout because of
health problems and his failure to handle the country's worst
economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   Communist and other nationalist politicians have been demanding
an end to Moscow's close ties with the West and NATO.
	   Yeltsin's press spokesman said Friday the president did not want
to damage ties with the West, but Russia could not accept the
attack on Iraq.
	   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towards confrontation (with the West), but we should call
things by their name. The military strikes are unacceptable and
should be stopped,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a
Kremlin press briefing.
	   While Yeltsin is not likely to alter his pro-Western policy
radically, he is angry about not being informed by Washington about
the attack in advance.
	   Ivanov had a telephone conversation with British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook on Friday to again stress Russia's demand for
an ``immediate termination of military action and a renewal of the
political settlement process,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
	   ``Repeated unilateral use of force may undermine the whole
system of international relations ... (and) lead to a slide back in
Russia's relations with Britain and the United States,'' the
statement said.

Gerg wins first career downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with backgroud, detail. Will be UPDATED with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg
of Germany won her first career World Cup downhill on Friday,
beating Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg by more than four-tenths of a
second.
	   Gerg, whose previous best downhill result was second place in
Val d'Isere over a year ago, completed the icy, treacherous
2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours course in 1 minute, 41.13
seconds, to collect her seventh career World Cup victory.
	   Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion and still seeking
her first victory of the season, settled for second, crossing in
1:41.55.
	   Italy's Bibiana Perez was the day's other surprise, finishing
third behind Gerg in 1:41.63, for her first career downhill podium.
	   Overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of four races this
season including consecutive victories in Val d'Isere last week,
placed fourth in 1:41.92.
	   Another downhill is scheduled for Saturday, which with Sunday's
slalom, will count towards the combined.
	   Gerg's victory lifted her from ninth to to fifth in the overall
standings, but remained 375 points behind Meissnitzer.
	   Meissnitzer excels in the same events as Gerg, and has a pair of
giant slalom and Super-G races as well as two other podium finishes
this season, while the German has just one other top-three result:
a super-G in Lake Louise.
	   Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the season opening
back-to-back downhills in Lake Louise, Canada, and posted the
fastest time in Thursday's training, finished 14th, 2.11 seconds
behind.
	   Goetschl had showed signs of struggling in Friday's training
session, however, where she finished 15th.
	   France's Regine Cavagnoud, third in a super-G in Val d'Isere
last week, finished fifth, .93 back, followed by compatriot
Florence Masnada, sixth in 1:42.20.

Brazil changes law to keep Mendes' killer in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The government will change a law
on Christmas pardons to keep a killer of rain forest defender Chico
Mendes in prison, a presidential spokesman said.
	   When President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the law in
November, he didn't realize it might benefit convicted killer Darly
Alves da Silva, spokesman Sergio Amaral said late Thursday.
	   Silva is serving a 19-year sentence for the 1988 shotgun slaying
of Mendes, an Amazon rubber tapper who gained worldwide recognition
for peacefully blocking tree-cuttings by loggers and ranchers.
	   Among those he opposed was Silva, a rancher in the western
Amazon town of Xapuri. Silva's son confessed to the shooting, and
Silva also was convicted for planning the murder.
	   Silva escaped from his rickety Amazon prison cell in 1993, after
serving three years of his sentence. He was recaptured in 1996 and
moved to the maximum-security Papuda prison in Brasilia, the
nation's capital.
	   The law benefits felons 60 or older who were sentenced to six
years or more and have served at least a third of their term. Silva
qualifies on all counts.
	   Justice Minister Renan Calheiros said in a published interview
there was ``no way'' Silva would be released.
	   ``He's a cold, calculating, cowardly killer,'' Calheiros was
quoted as saying in the newspaper O Estado de Sao Paulo. ``He was
no conditions to return to society.''

Pipe bomb damages synagogue in Cape Town

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ A pipe bomb early Friday exploded
at a synagogue here and caused some damage, but no injuries were
reported.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police said
they had not ruled out that the attack was in connection with the
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   ``We were expecting things like that to happen, on American and
British embassies, and buildings and things,'' said Superintendent
Nina Kirsten of the Cape Town police.
	   The bomb was thrown at the entrance to the 96-year-old synagogue
in the well-off suburb of Wynberg during the night. The explosion
damaged the facade, smashed windows and splintered a door, causing
about 30,000 rand (dlrs 5,000) in damage, Kirsten said.
	   The synagogue's rabbi, Rafi Wolff, deplored the attack and said
he planned a special service of thanksgiving because no one was
hurt. ``We'll stand together and become stronger,'' he said.
	   Politicians condemned the blast and vowed the bombers should be
caught. ``Heartless acts such as these can never be justified,''
said provincial Premier Gerald Morkel ``I unreservedly condemn
these acts in the strongest possible terms.''
	   Police have blamed previous pipe bomb attacks aimed at
businesses, police buildings and the homes of Muslim clerics on an
Islamic vigilante group called PAGAD, or People Against Gangsterism
and Drugs.
	   Earlier this year a bomb killed two people at a Planet Hollywood
restaurant in Cape Town's popular Waterfront area. Police linked
the blast to U.S. attacks on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan after
bombings at American embassies in Africa.

India to buy 10 more Russian fighter jets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ India will buy 10 Sukhoi-30MKI fighter jets from
Russia under a contract signed this week, a news report said
Friday.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov plans to
visit India on a three-day trip starting Sunday to sign more deals
on selling warplanes and other military cooperation, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   The value of the contract, signed Wednesday, was not disclosed.
But an earlier deal for 10 Sukhoi-30MKIs was reportedly worth about
dlrs 350 million.
	   The Soviet Union was India's chief arms supplier and Moscow
still supplies much of New Delhi's military equipment.
	   The purchase of the jets is part of an agreement concluded in
1996 under which India agreed to purchase at least 40 Russian
military jets before 2002, Russian media reports said.
	   India has already received eight Sukhoi-30K planes, and the
delivery of the Sukhoi-30MKIs is to begin in 2000, Interfax
reported.
	   Russia is also expected to upgrade 125 MiG-21s belonging to the
Indian air force, but is reportedly years behind schedule because
of financial and equipment problems.
	   Under a current military agreement, the two countries are
developing anti-tactical ballistic missile systems and upgrading
Russian T-72 tanks that India already has.
	   Russian military sales, which are usually made in dollars,
represent a valuable source of hard currency and jobs for the
financially struggling country.

Syrian journalist detained after meeting German hostages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Authorities arrested a journalist working
for a Berlin newspaper after he ventured into tribal territory to
interview four German hostages, Yemen officials said Friday.
	   They said Sadek Hamaiel, a Syrian national who works for the
Berliner Zeitung daily, was taken into custody Thursday as he
returned from a meeting with the hostages.
	   The Germans _ three women and one man _ were abducted Dec. 7 by
three gunmen from the Bani Dhabyan tribe and taken to Marib
province, 170 kilometers (105 miles) northeast of the capital,
San`a.
	   Hamaiel was escorted to the area by tribesmen close to the
kidnappers, the Yemen officials said.
	   The officials, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said Hamaiel was returning from the meeting in a car with several
tribesmen when police tried to stop their vehicle. That led to a
gun battle with the police in which one of the tribesmen was
injured and another fled, they said.
	   Hamaiel was arrested with two other tribesmen and charged with
traveling in tribal areas without government permission, they
added.
	   In June, three British Broadcasting Corp. television journalists
were detained for several days on a charge of filming without
government permission after spending a week with the Bani Dhabyan
tribe. The BCC journalists were acquitted by a Yemeni court.
	   The four German hostages have been identified by the Yemen Times
as Norbert Degen, Petra Penglista, Rozwita Adlung and Inge Brunner.
The names could not be confirmed with the German Embassy.
	   Tribesmen in Yemen often kidnap foreigners to use as leverage in
their demands for more public services. The hostages generally have
been freed unharmed.
	   The Bani Dhabyan are asking the government for more schools,
hospitals, telephone lines and roads in their poor province.

Number of Dutch AIDS deaths declines sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The number of people in the
Netherlands who died of AIDS declined sharply in 1997, continuing a
downward trend that began in 1995, the Dutch government announced
Friday.
	   The Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) credited cocktails of
drugs first prescribed in mid-1996 with dramatically reducing the
number of deaths.
	   Last year, 184 people died of AIDS, down from 327 in 1996.
	   Statistics gathered by the government's Health Care Inspectorate
also revealed a sharp drop in the number of new AIDS patients since
1996.
	   A total of 3,356 people have died of AIDS in the Netherlands
since the government began registering AIDS patients in 1982. The
worst year for fatalities was 1994, when 444 people died.

South Korea takes women's field hockey

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - South Korea scored a second half goal
by Oh Seung-shin to defeat India 2-1 in the final of women's field
hockey Friday at the Asian Games.
	   Pritam Thakran of India opened the scoring in the 28th minute
but Kim Myung-ok tied it 15 minutes later 1-1.
	   In the second half India had a chance to go ahead but could not
convert three times on short penalty corner shots as the South
Korean defense held.
	   Midway through the second half, Oh took advantage of a penalty
corner to score the winning goal. India was playing in its first
final since 1986 although the Indian men have been a power in field
hockey.
	   Sudershan Pathak, one of the Indian coaches, said that she was
pleased with the losers' performance especially after a 5-0 rout in
the opening round to South Korea.
	   ``It was hard luck that the girls lost today,'' Pathak said.
	   In the bronze medal game, China beat Japan 2-0.

Germany's Dresdner Bank to spin off its industrial holdings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Several days after Deutsche Bank said
it would spin off its industrial holdings in separate units a
spokesman for Germany's Dresdner Bank said that Dresdner was
considering doing the same.
	   A spokesman said the move would be taken partly for tax reasons,
without elaborating.
	   Analysts say Dresdner Bank may be in a hurry to copy Deutsche
Bank's move to spin off its holdings via limited partnerships, as
tax benefits for adopting such a partnership structure may soon be
abolished by the government.
	   It wasn't clear when the move would take place.
	   Dresdner Bank's industrial holdings stood at 26 billion marks
(dlrs 15.66 billion) at the end of 1997, and included a 10 percent
stake in insurer Allianz Versicherung worth 11 billion marks (dlrs
6.63 billion) and 5.5 billion marks (dlrs 3.31 billion) or a 10
percent stake, in Munich Reinsurance.
	   Dresdner also has a 5 percent stake of BMW worth 1.3 billion
marks (dlrs 783 million,) and a 20.9 percent stake worth 1.25
billion marks (dlrs 753 million) in Heidelberg Zement.
	   Investors and some politicians have long criticized the complex
industrial holdings of Germany's major banks, mostly acquired years
ago when they financed industrial expansion.
	   The move will result in increased transparency and improved
management of industrial holdings, bankers say.

Mexico says further oil cuts discussed but dropped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details, quotes, background, ADDS Byline
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia
discussed cutting oil production by a further two million barrels a
day but failed to reach agreement, Mexico's oil minister said
Friday.
	   The minister, Luis Tellez, also said that Iran's production of
300,000 additional barrels a day was creating problems for the
market.
	   ``There's certainly a problem with the Iranians,'' he said in an
interview Friday, a day after he concluded six hours of talks with
oil and energy colleagues from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
	   Tellez said the tripartite meeting of major oil producers
discussed the concept of cutting a further two million barrels a
day ``but there was no agreement to do this now.''
	   Under the proposal, OPEC members would bear the burden of
cutting output by 1.5 million barrels per day and non-OPEC members
would account for the remaining 500,000 barrels a day.
	   Tellez said Mexico would be willing to cut production further
given a firm commitment to cut from members of the 11-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and also given the
right market conditions to do so.
	   So far, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela have led an
initiative for cuts by producers that totaled 3.1 million barrels
per day. Analysts and some OPEC members say an additional 1.5
million barrels a day in reductions is needed to have an impact on
prices.
	   In the meeting Thursday, the delegates of Saudi Arabia, Mexico
and Venezuela agreed to maintain reduced output through 1999. The
meeting followed similar gatherings by oil ministers from other
countries to find a way to boost prices, which hit 12-year lows and
stripped oil-dependent nations billions of dollars in revenues.
	   Under Thursday's agreement, Saudi Arabia will maintain a cut of
725,000 barrels a day, Venezuela will produce 525,000 barrels less
and Mexico will produce 200,000 fewer barrels. It was an extension
to commitments to reductions reached in June.
	   No new cuts were decided. Instead, a joint statement said the
three nations will initiate efforts to bring other countries to
join in reducing output in the future.
	   A Saudi source said he was optimistic that efforts to alleviate
the pressure of high supplies on the market could succeed.
	   ``We are hopeful that this motion and spirit will not be impeded
for the sake of our individual and collective interests,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Prices have hit 12-year lows this year, stripping oil-dependent
nations billions of dollars in revenues.
	   Crude prices had risen Wednesday over the possibility of
airstrikes against Iraq. News from the oil ministers meeting
Thursday, plus the growing belief that oil production from Iraq
won't be disrupted, sent prices plunging dlrs 1.35 to dlrs 11.03 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. London Brent fell dlrs
1.27 a barrel to dlrs 10.09.
	   Mexico's Tellez said Friday that Iranian compliance and the
baseline of production that the country was using to cut from
remained an issue.
	   Iran, OPEC's No. 2 producer after Saudi Arabia, said publicly
and privately that its baseline was 3.6 million barrels a day but
Tehran is using a baseline of 3.9 million barrels a day, Tellez
said.
	   Tellez said he had been told by Iran's oil minister, Bijan
Namdar Zanganeh, that Tehran was using the 3.9 million barrels per
day baseline.
	   ``It's a major issue because that's an extra 300,000 barrels a
day,'' Tellez said.
	   He said that Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi was planning to visit
Iran in the near future to try and convince the country to adhere
to the 3.6 million barrels per day baseline that Iran agreed to in
March.
	   Tellez said compliance is voluntary. ``If Iran doesn't want to
comply, there's no way to force it,'' he added.
	   After Madrid, Naimi headed to Norway as part of the initiative
to urge other producers to cut output until the end of the year.
Norway has already cut its production by 100,000 barrels a day.

Miners' leader detained by police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police briefly detained Friday an
influential leader of Romania's miners, who has led his men on
violent rampages though the capital twice in the last decade.
	   Earlier this year, a court banned union leader Miron Cozma from
the capital for two years, after he was found guilty of disturbing
public order, following the miners' unrest in 1991, when at least
three people were killed and a prime minister was forced to resign.
	   Cozma has appealed the decision. He was detained Friday while
entering the industry ministry, where he and a group of miners were
to meet the minister to discuss possible mine closures.
	   The talks were canceled and police later released Cozma, said
Col. Dumitru Secrieru of the Bucharest police.
	   Also Friday, some 500 coal miners in western Romania's Jiu
Valley, where Cozma is union leader, went on strike for a second
day to protest feared job cuts.
	   The government has laid off tens of thousands of miners in the
last year and plans to close mines which are not profitable as part
of its market reforms in the coming months.

FA denies new cash-for-votes allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from Thai soccer official

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The English Football Association on Friday
confirmed that it is paying former striker Peter Withe to coach the
Thailand national team, but denied the deal was connected with
England's 2006 World Cup bid.
	   Yet, the Thais admitted they might support England's bid in
return for Withe's work with their national team.
	   Three days after reports suggested that the English Football
Association had promised 3.2 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) to its
Welsh equivalent to gain a vote for chairman Keith Wiseman in a
FIFA/UEFA election, the tabloid Daily Mirror said that Withe was
paid by the FA in a bid to buy Thailand's support in the race to
2006.
	   ``His salary is being funded by the English FA from a 10 million
pound (dlrs 16.7 million) cash reserve set aside for the 2006 World
Cup campaign,'' said the Mirror, which pointed out that Thailand
had a member on FIFA's World Cup Committee.
	   The FA admits that it is paying Withe but maintains that there's
nothing sinister.
	   ``It's nothing to do with any kind of cash-for-votes. That's
nonsense,'' spokesman Steve Double said. ``He's effectively
employed by us and he's, for want of a better word, on loan to
Thailand as part of our international development program to help
other countries.
	   ``We're also helping countries like Lesotho and Malawi and they
don't have members on the FIFA World Cup committee.''
	   David Davies, the FA's executive director, who temporarily took
over as chief executive after Graham Kelly resigned over the Welsh
FA payment, said Thailand approached the FA for help in improving
the standard of its national team.
	   ``We give aid in the form of resources, kit and coaches to a
number of countries in Africa and the Far East. Thailand is
receiving coaching support in the form of Peter Withe.''
	   A Thai soccer official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Thailand had made no commitment to support the English bid.
But he said there was a kind of an understanding that the English
were looking for support through helping the Thai program.
	   The association hasn't talked about who it would support for the
World Cup, the official said, but there was an understanding among
members that they might express a ``thank you'' to the English with
support for their bid.
	   A former Birmingham City, Wolves and Aston Villa player, Withe
scored Villa's winning goal in the 1982 Champions Cup final victory
over Bayern Munich.
	   The former striker was regarded as a hero in Thailand after
guiding the team to the semifinal of th Asian Games before it lost
3-0 to Kuwait.

Court recommends sentence reductions for anti-Basque 'dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
convicts

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court recommended Friday that a
former interior minister and his deputy, both serving 10-year jail
terms for their role in a 'dirty war' against Basque separatists,
have their sentences reduced by two-thirds.
	   It is up to the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to
accept or reject the recommendation.
	   After a four-hour hearing the court recommended similar
reductions for eight other people it had found guilty in the same
case in July and sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to 10
years.
	   The court denied leniency to two others whose sentences were
already reduced because of jail time served before the trial.
	   The former interior minister, Jose Barrionuevo, 56, and his
ex-chief of state security, Rafael Vera, 53, started serving their
sentences in September.
	   They were convicted of orchestrating the 1983 kidnapping of a
Basque businessman who was mistaken for a hitman of the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera served under then prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez, who has denied allegations that it was he who ordered the
creation of the GAL death squads.
	   The Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that there was insufficient
evidence to try him in the kidnapping case.

Japan endorses tariffs on imported rice, snubs trading partners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Cabinet officially endorsed a plan on
Friday to impose duties on foreign rice despite opposition from
major trading partners in a move designed to protect the country's
farmers from cheap imports.
	   A flat tariff of 351.17 yen (dlrs 3.05) per kilogram will be
introduced as of April 1, 1999, said Masaki Takamoto, a spokesman
for the Japanese agriculture ministry.
	   The import duty will be reduced to 341 yen (dlrs 2.96) per
kilogram the following year, the spokesman said.
	   ``It is the best choice for the interest of the nation,'' Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency.
	   The tariffs will help safeguard Japan's politically-influential
farmers, who have grown accustomed to rice prices which are among
the most expensive in the world.
	   But the decision seemed likely to upset the U.S. and other
trading partners anxious to expand sales in the lucrative Japanese
market at a time when Japan's global trade surplus has ballooned.
	   Earlier this week, U.S. Ambassador to Japan Thomas Foley warned
Japan against implementing high rice tariffs, saying it could
``cripple'' imports of U.S. rice to Japan.
	   Japan pledged to open its rice market to imports in a landmark
1993 trade agreement which committed it to set minimum access
levels and move toward a system of tariffication.
	   The so-called Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade obliged Japan to import four percent of its rice in 1995
and to gradually increase that amount to about eight percent by
2000.

China to put third and most prominent dissident on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with quotes from Xu's wife, details of
indictment, plans for Monday's trial; no pickup; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Escalating a concerted crackdown on a would-be
opposition political party, China announced a court date for the
group's most prominent leader on Friday, a day after putting two
other leading organizers on trial.
	   Court officials telephoned Xu Wenli's wife to notify her of his
trial on subversion charges Monday, she said. That left her with a
little more than two days to work with a court-appointed lawyer to
prepare a defense.
	   The call was the first confirmation He Xintong received of the
charges Xu faced since his arrest at the start of the crackdown 19
days ago.
	   Subversion is among the most serious accusations leveled against
dissidents, and Xu, 55, faces from 10 years to life imprisonment if
the harshest aspects of the law are applied.
	   ``There's no hope,'' said He Xintong. ``I told the court
official today there's no way this will be a fair trial.''
	   By sentencing Xu to a long prison term, Communist Party leaders
would remove one of the most active and potent members of the China
Democracy Party and the fractured dissident community at large.
	   Underscoring the ruling party's determination to keep its
49-year monopoly on power, President Jiang Zemin told a gathering
of 6,000 members of China's political elite Friday that China would
never copy Western political systems.
	   ``The system must not be shaken, weakened, or discarded at any
time,'' Jiang said in a speech to celebrate 20 years of successful
economic reforms that was broadcast nationwide.
	   More than 30 members of the China Democracy Party have been
arrested or questioned since the latest and most aggressive
crackdown on the group began Nov. 30.
	   Although the exact number of party supporters is not known,
dissidents have set up party branches in 14 provinces and cities
since June. Their attempts to register the group with authorities
have been rebuffed.
	   Xu began campaigning for change in the influential Democracy
Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of
them in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu
has played the role of elder adviser to dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin after he believed police pressure was intimidating some
leaders. He also called for party members to hold a nationwide
congress.
	   Xu's trial may be closely mirror the trials held Thursday for
Wang Youcai, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
democracy demonstrations, and Qin Yongmin, a Democracy Wall
colleague of Xu who edited an underground journal.
	   Although no verdicts were announced after the 2 1/2-hour trials
in separate cities, conviction is almost a certainty in
high-profile dissident prosecutions.
	   Like Wang's and Qin's trials, court officials are limiting
access by friends and family. Court officials gave Xu's wife a pass
at a meeting Friday afternoon, but later refused to issue them for
two Xu supporters and democracy party members, she said.
	   The indictment given to Xu's court-appointed attorney, Mo
Shaoping, is similar to those used in Qin's and Wang's trials.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported that the indictment accuses
Xu of a number of charges.
	   These include organizing the China Democracy Party, accepting
money from abroad, calling for independent trade unions and making
subversive statements in interviews with foreign media.
	   He Xintong plans to meet with the lawyer Saturday.

Gerg wins first career downhill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes, CHANGES throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Olympic slalom champion Hilde Gerg
of Germany won her first career World Cup downhill on Friday,
beating Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg by more than four-tenths of a
second.
	   Gerg, whose previous best downhill result was second place in
Val d'Isere over a year ago, completed the icy, treacherous
2,500-meter (8,202-foot) Piste de l'Ours course in 1 minute, 41.13
seconds, to collect her seventh career World Cup victory.
	   ``On a difficult, turny course like this one, it's clear that
technical skiers were at a strong advantage,'' said Gerg, who has
seven victories in as many years on the World Cup circuit. ``I like
this type of course.
	   ``But still, a course like this one is still very difficult for
technical skiers, for it can be hard to find the right line and
master your skis to avoid a fatal mistake.''
	   Wiberg, the 1997 overall World Cup champion and still seeking
her first victory of the season, settled for second, crossing in
1:41.55.
	   After laboring through an injury-plagued campaign last season,
Wiberg was relieved with her second place.
	   ``This was so good for me,'' said Wiberg, who is aiming for a
second overall title. ``It was turny and icy, which I like.
	   ``I thought I might have a chance after the training runs, but
it's very easy to make a mistake on a course like this and lose
your line.''
	   Italy's Bibiana Perez was the day's other surprise, finishing
third behind Gerg in 1:41.63, for her first career downhill podium.
	   Overall leader Alexandra Meissnitzer, winner of four races this
season including consecutive victories in Val d'Isere last week,
placed fourth in 1:41.92.
	   Gerg finished third in the overall standings last year behind
teammates Katja Seizinger and Martina Ertl, but with Seizinger out
for the season with a knee injury, others have their eye on the
coveted top prize.
	   ``Certainly Katja's absence has placed a bit of pressure on the
rest of the team,'' Gerg said after giving Germany its first
victory of the season. ``Of course it's easier if we share the
burden.
	   ``But this victory is very promising for the rest of the
season,'' said Gerg. ``It's a good omen.''
	   Meissnitzer, however, has had good omens of her own, and plenty
of them.
	   Fifth in the overall last year, Meissnitzer's four victories
this season already have vaulted her to the top of the standings
with 675 points, 277 clear of her nearest rival, Ertl.
	   While Gerg's victory lifted her from ninth to fifth in the
standings, the German remained 375 points behind Meissnitzer.
	   Meissnitzer excels in the same events as Gerg, and has a pair of
giant slalom and Super-G victories as well as two other podium
finishes this season, while the German has just one other top-three
result this year, a third in a super-G in Lake Louise, Canada.
	   Austria's Renate Goetschl, who won the season opening
consecutive downhills in Lake Louise and posted the fastest time in
Wednesday's training, finished 14th, 2.11 seconds behind.
	   Goetschl had showed signs of struggling in Thursday's practice
session, where she finished 15th.
	   Another downhill is scheduled for Saturday, which with Sunday's
slalom, will count towards the combined.
	   Reigniting her career, France's Regine Cavagnoud, 28, is having
her best season since 1993, adding a fifth place finish to a third
in a super-G in Val d'Isere last week.
	   Cavagnoud, a nine-year veteran of the French team, finished .93
back, ahead of compatriot Florence Masnada, sixth in 1:42.20.

Spain upbeat on Basque peace, to move some ETA prisoners closer to
</HEADLINE>
home &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to add Basque criticism of Aznar move &QL; 
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government said Friday it was upbeat
about the Basque peace process three months into a ceasefire by the
separatist group ETA, and announced a concession on a long-standing
ETA demand dealing with its members behind bars.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar repeated a call for ETA to
transform its open-ended truce into a definitive one ending a
30-year pro-independence campaign that has claimed nearly 800
lives.
	   ``It is the cornerstone on which we can build the process of
normalization,'' Aznar said, reading from a statement.
	   In November Aznar said he had authorized preliminary talks with
ETA to determine whether it was prepared to renounce violence
permanently.
	   Last week government spokesman Josep Pique confirmed there had
been official contact with ETA but he insisted it was ``not
significant'' and did not elaborate on it. And although the
ceasefire has held, in recent weeks posters have appeared in Basque
cities threatening lawmakers of Aznar's center-right Popular Party.
	   Still, Aznar insisted Friday that the peace process was on
track. ``The government is in a position to conclude that there is
still the possibility that the current situation of an open-ended
ceasefire can be consolidated,'' he said.
	   Aznar did not elaborate or take questions from reporters.
	   In an apparent effort to advance the process, the Interior
Ministry said earlier Friday that 21 ETA inmates will be moved from
far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region.
	   ETA has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held
in Spanish jails be transferred to the Basque country itself, or at
least closer to it. The government keeps them scattered around
Spain to avoid their plotting behind bars.
	   The ministry said 21 ETA inmates will be transferred from the
Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands
in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves
on the northern coast of Morocco. They will be sent to jails in the
south of mainland Spain starting right away.
	   Since ETA started observing its ceasefire on September 18, Aznar
had been under pressure from both hard-line and moderate Basque
nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party,
to keep the peace process alive by making a significant gesture on
the prisoner issue.
	   In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners
to the Basque country itself but this was criticized as
insufficient.
	   Two mainstream Basque parties said the new transfers were not
enough either and that Aznar needed to take much bolder action to
move the region toward peace.
	   ``If Aznar thinks that taking 21 prisoners out of a group of
more than 500 and transferring them to the south of the peninsula
is pulling off something big, he does not know what country or what
problem he is dealing with,'' said the leader of one of those
parties, Carlos Garaikoetxa of Eusko Alkartasuna.
	   Aznar insists that after his offer of talks, the ball is now in
ETA's court, saying the peace process cannot advance in earnest
without a permanent end to separatist violence.
	   And even so, he and other officials have said the government is
willing to discuss prisoner transfers and other issues involving
ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated demand of
independence.

Russian parliament approves tax reduction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with some tax hikes approved, 8th graf, inflation
figures in two new bottom grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament on Friday approved a Cabinet
proposal to lower two crucial taxes, hoping to aid ailing
industries badly hit by the economic crisis.
	   The move is a big risk for the government, which desperately
needs money to pay its obligations now that the financial crisis
has left it practically broke.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, tentatively approved a
government bill that would cut the value-added tax from the present
20 percent to 15 percent in March.
	   The bill, approved on the first reading, calls for further
reduction of the VAT to 10 percent in 2000. The house didn't
immediately set a date for final approval of the bill.
	   The VAT is one of Russia's key sources of tax income, and
international lenders like the International Monetary Fund have
harshly criticized the government's wish to reduce the tax.
	   Lawmakers also approved the government's proposal to lower
Russia's profit tax from 35 percent to 30 percent.
	   The government-proposed package of 19 tax bills also includes
revised personal income-tax tables that take into account the
ruble's fall in value since Russia's markets collapsed in August,
succumbing to global financial turmoil.
	   Some taxes are going to rise. The Duma on Friday also approved a
bill increasing sales tax on alcohol and gasoline.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet hopes the bills will
help streamline Russia's unwieldy tax system, provide conditions
for economic revival and encourage tax dodgers to pay what they
owe.
	   But critics warn that tax cuts will only further slash
government revenues for 1999, which are already expected to be far
too inadequate to cover the country's expenditures.
	   Making matters worse, the 1999 budget draft factors in foreign
loans that may not be extended and prescribes sharply reduced
payments on foreign debt, even though debtors have not yet agreed
to rescheduling.
	   The draft budget allocates only 100 billion rubles (dlrs 4.8
billion) to pay off foreign debts, which will total dlrs 17.5
billion next year.
	   The document has already been sent to parliament and is expected
to come up for debate next week.
	   The International Monetary Fund has urged Russia to approve a
realistic budget and specifically warned that it is less likely to
give more aid if Russia includes loans that haven't been agreed
upon in the budget.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian ruble continued its steady slide on
Friday, trading at 20.75 a dollar compared to 20.7 Thursday. Before
the crisis hit in August, the ruble was at about 6 to the dollar.
	   The draft budget envisages 30 percent inflation in 1999 and an
average ruble rate of 21.5 to the dollar _ a target most experts
consider unrealistic. The ruble has already plummeted below 22 to
the dollar in street trading, and is not expected to stop its drop
any time soon.
	   The ruble's fall has jacked up prices on imported goods, which
account for up to half of Russia's consumer market. The State
Statistics Committee said Friday that inflation in Russia has
reached 73.4 percent so far this year, after staying at less than 5
percent in seven-and-half months before the crisis.
	   If foreign lenders refuse loans, the government will be forced
to print a lot of new cash to pay its debts, stoking inflation.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Tens of thousands of German doctors shut
their offices Friday in a nationwide day of protest against a new
law capping their incomes.
	   At rallies in several cities, doctors and assistants handed out
pamphlets and hoisted signs warning of a decline in health care.
	   The strike was the first major protest against Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder's 7-week-old center-left government, which wants
to bolster Germany's generous welfare state but also cut its cost.
	   More than half of Germany's 110,000 doctors with private
practices took part in the one-day action, their national
association said. Emergency service was assured, though, it added.
	   Some 4,000 gathered at a civic center in Bonn to vent their
anger as the upper house of parliament passed the new law. About
5,000 doctors, aides and patients marched through central Munich,
one of several street protests.
	   Health Minister Andrea Fischer accused the doctors of sowing
panic. They can't expect ``an unlimited guarantee of above-average
wealth,'' she told the Cologne newspaper Express.
	   Doctors charge the income cap, coupled with a cut in the budget
for medicine, means patients won't be assured of full care and may
be deprived of advances in science.
	   But the strike has been controversial among doctors, with some
arguing it was too drastic a step.
	   Karsten Vilmar, head of the German Medical Association,
triggered outrage last week by claiming that lower incomes for
doctors meant patients would die sooner. He has since apologized
for the remark.
	   The new law limits the rise in the fees that the federally
regulated health insurance system will pay doctors to 1.2 billion
marks (dlrs 720 million) next year, a rise of about 1.5 percent.
	   Fischer said that reflects the expected average increase in
wages in other fields. ``I believe this is justified,'' she said in
parliament.
	   At the same time, the new law lowers the amounts that insured
patients pay out of their own pocket for prescription drugs.

Britain shows videos of attacks on military targets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Blair contacts with other leaders, criticism from
former prime minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British jets have flown three missions against air
defenses, airfields and Republican Guard installations in Iraq
without losing any aircraft, Defense Secretary George Robertson
said Friday.
	   ``We have yet to complete our full battle damage assessment but
initial assessment is that the raids have gone very well,'' he said
at a press briefing.
	   ``There is still much to do before we can be satisfied that
Saddam's capabilities to develop weapons of mass destruction has
been damaged to the extent necessary.
	   ``We will carry on with military action along with the U.S.
until we are satisfied that Saddam's military machine has been
suitably damaged,'' he said.
	   Journalists were shown videos taken by the attacking Tornados.
The targets seen exploding were described as a radar missile site,
a hardened aircraft shelter at the Tallil air base in southwestern
Iraq and an aircraft hangar,
	   Robertson said one objective of the attacks was to stop Iraq's
development of pilotless aircraft.
	   Britain part in the U.S.-led air campaign is begin carried out
by 12 Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers based in Kuwait.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair, seeking to firm up support for the
U.S.-British operation, had a round of telephone conversations with
leaders of several nations. His office said they included German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac,
Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema and Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak. Blair's office said he also planned to speak to Crown
Prince Abdullah, first deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia.
	   Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath on Friday criticized the
Iraqi bombing as having no clear purpose.
	   ``The whole setting of this enterprise has been so dubious,
especially when the President of the United States has his own
domestic problems,'' Heath said in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The military aims, heath said, ``have not been clearly defined
at all. If you ask what is the purpose there is no answer.''

Bangladesh confers citizenship to Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Bangladesh on Friday conferred honorary
citizenship to visiting Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, a Bengali, who
studied for a while near Dhaka before the Indian subcontinent was
divided.
	   ``You are one us,'' a smiling Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told
this year's winner of the Nobel Prize for economics as she handed
him a Bangladeshi passport at her official residence.
	   In response Sen said, ``I'm overwhelmed by the gesture.''
	   Sen's ancestors lived in a village in Manikganj near Dhaka,
Bangladesh's capital before the subcontinent was partitioned by
British colonial rulers in 1947.
	   As a child he studied at Dhaka's St. Gregory School, which has
planned a reception for him.
	   Hasina also presented Sen an album containing photographs of her
father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's first prime minister
who was slain in a military coup in 1975.
	   Sen lives in Britain, where he teaches at Trinity College in
Cambridge.

SilkAir crash investigator voices frustrations, considers desperate
</HEADLINE>
measure
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with details; ADDS byline.
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The chief investigator into the crash last year
of a SilkAir jetliner voiced frustration to families of the victims
on Friday over the difficulty of getting information about the
pilot, who has been the subject of intense speculation about a
possible suicide plot.
	   Oetarjo Diran, head of Indonesia's Aircraft Accident
Investigation Commission, also told the victims' relatives he would
proceed with a test that would destroy the flight data recording
tape in a desperate bid to gain clues about the cause of the
tragedy.
	   News reports earlier this year said the Singaporean pilot of the
plane, 41-year-old Capt. Tsu Way Ming, may have disabled the voice
and flight data recorders before intentionally downing the plane.
He reportedly had taken out a large life insurance policy shortly
before the plane mysteriously crashed.
	   ``We are not assuming a priori that it isn't suicide,'' Diran
said in a television program aired Friday in Singapore. ``But we
are looking in what way the human performance or the human
character in the air is contributing to the accident.''
	   Diran met privately in Singapore with relatives of some of the
104 dead passengers and crew members on Friday, one day before the
first anniversary of the Boeing 737-300 crash in Indonesia.
	   Although no major developments in the year-long investigation
were revealed, family members told The Associated Press that Diran
said he was having difficulty obtaining some information about the
pilot.
	   ``He's having trouble getting information out...of Singapore''
on possible human factors of the crash, said David Beevers, whose
pregnant wife died aboard the plane.
	   Aaron Ng, who lost his stewardess fiance, said Diran wouldn't
elaborate on whether he was facing resistance from Singapore
authorities or private companies.
	   SilkAir managing director Mak Swee Mah said in the Friday
television program that his airline has cooperated fully with the
investigation into the pilot.
	   But in his meeting with family members, Diran alluded to
difficulties in getting details about the pilot's insurance
coverage and other personal financial information.
	   ``We had expected that all the relevant parties here, especially
in Singapore, would have actually extended their full
cooperation,'' said Ng, adding that ``if there are
difficulties...surely there's something the Singapore authorities
can do to release something.''
	   Diran's team has interviewed 72 people so far while
investigating possible human factors in the crash, according to Ng,
who said they included colleagues, family, friends, and former
employers of the various crew members, most notably the pilot.
	   The failure of the two ``black boxes'' to record the final
minutes of cockpit conversation and airplane activity is also one
of the biggest puzzles of the crash.
	   The flight data recorder, which stopped six minutes before the
cockpit voice recorder also ceased recording, was badly damaged in
the crash.
	   Diran told the victims' families that he would put the flight
data recorder through a final test in Los Angeles that would strip
the tape's protective coating to reach the innermost data, a
process that would destroy it.
	   ``The important question we would like to know is, why did the
data recorders quit?'' Diran said earlier in the television report,
saying the recorders had been tested in Washington and in Paris in
attempts to reveal their hidden secrets.
	   Diran warned family members that discovering the cause of the
tragedy could be a long process, and his accident commission added
in a later statement that ``the investigation is likely to continue
well into next year.''
	   ``This work is progressing very slowly because of the high
degree of destruction to the aircraft and the lack of useful
information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders,''
added the statement.
	   SilkAir plans to fly about 300 relatives _ mostly Indonesians
and Singaporeans, but also other foreigners _ to Palembang, near
the site of the crash in Indonesia for a memorial service Saturday.

	   OSRBLIE, Slovakia (AP) _ Germany's Olympic gold medal quartet
won the first men's relay race of the biathlon World Cup season
Friday, with a powerful performance on the trail and perfect
shooting.
	   Ricco Gross, Peter Sendel, Sven Fischer and Frank Luck, who won
the gold medal at Nagano Olympics in February, again dominated the
4x7.5-kilometer race, beating Belarus and Norway.
	   The Germans trailed in sixth after Gross had fallen in the first
leg and dropped to the back of the field.
	   But they rallied to cover the course in one hour, 14 minutes,
2.7 seconds, beating Belarus by 23.6 second. Norway was third, 33.6
behind.
	   All top finishers shot without missing a target.

Angolan rebels broaden central highland offensive

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces shelled a second provincial
city Friday in an apparent attempt to prevent the army from sending
reinforcements to a neighboring province where fighting has been
focused over the past two weeks.
	   The attack on Malange, about 350 kilometers (200 miles) east of
the capital Luanda, took place during the night and into the
morning, private radio station Radio Eclesia reported.
	   Shells landed less than one kilometer (half a mile) from the
provincial governor's palace in the center of the city. Several
wounded people, apparently civilians, were arriving at the city
hospital, the radio said.
	   The attack came as government forces in Malange reportedly were
preparing to move 300 kilometers (186 miles) south to Bie province
to try to break a rebel siege of the government-held city of Kuito.
	   Battles have focused on Bie's capital Kuito since fighting
between the government and UNITA rebels restarted two weeks ago,
ending a four-year peace agreement in the southwest African
country.
	   There was sporadic shelling early Friday in Cunji, about seven
kilometers (four miles) outside Kuito, which lies 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, Radio Eclesia said.
	   Rebels reportedly shelled the airport, located in Kuito's
suburbs. The rebels have kept the airport under siege to choke the
government's air supply line.
	   Meanwhile, reports of several attacks in other parts of the
country apparently were an attempt by UNITA to disrupt army
strategy.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has a well-equipped army of some
30,000 men experienced in guerrilla warfare. The government has
about 100,000 troops.
	   In Benguela province, 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of
Luanda, unidentified gunmen ambushed a bus, killing 11 people and
wounding 10 others, state-controlled daily Jornal de Angola
reported Friday.
	   Other areas, including Luena in the east and Uige in the
northwest, also were said to be tense.
	   Kris Janowski, a Geneva spokesman for the United Nations' High
Commissioner for Refugees, said their staff had reported ``recent
attacks or military activity'' in those cities.
	   An estimated 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting
in the past two weeks, according to the UNHCR, making up a total of
500,000 displaced this year.
	   The U.N. World Food Program on Thursday flew 34 tons of food
into Luena, where there were some 30,000 displaced, adding to a
population of an estimated 100,000.
	   ``The security perimeter around the town is shrinking,'' WFP
spokeswoman Maria Flynn said in Luanda.
	   Both sides fought a two-decade civil war following the country's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   Several attempts at establishing a longlasting peace repeatedly
have failed, although neither side has yet acknowledged the
collapse of the latest one _ the 1994 U.N.-brokered Lusaka
protocol.

EU approves dlrs 155 million for Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission said
Friday it has approved 133 million European currency units (dlrs
155 million) in grants to fund economic and social projects in
Turkey.
	   The EU provides financial assistance for social and economic
projects in twelve Mediterranean countries involved in the
Euro-Mediterranean Partnership through the MEDA program. It has
allocated 236 million Ecu (dlrs 278 million) to Turkey over the
past two and a half years.
	   The money will be spent on five projects. Some 55 million Ecus
(dlrs 65 million) will go towards the improvement of sexual health
care, particularly for women, notably through information and
education programs and training for medical staff.
	   Another 51 million Ecus (dlrs 60 million) will be spent on
promoting employment in Turkey through vocational training and
apprenticeship schemes.
	   The rest of the money will fund the creation of three business
centers to provide support and advise to Turkish businesses, the
improvement of living conditions in two of the poorer districts of
Istanbul, and the development of a mechanical, electric and
electronic center to stimulate high-tech industry in Turkey.

Barclays announces fund for repaying Holocaust assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Barclays Bank on Friday announced the creation of
a fund for the repayment of assets in its French bank during World
War II not recovered by the rightful owners after the war.
	   The bank also said that any unclaimed money left in the fund,
which currently stands at 2 million pounds (dlrs 3.2 million),
would be donated to a French institution engaged in Holocaust
research.
	   The announcement followed Barclays' agreement Thursday to settle
its part of a class-action suit filed in the United States against
the bank's French operation during World War II and seven French
banks.
	   Barclays, the only one of the eight to settle, said it would pay
dlrs 3.6 million to Jews whose assets were seized from its French
branches during the war.
	   Barclays estimates it then had about 335 Jewish depositors at
those branches, which it will attempt to trace through
advertisements and other means.
	   The bank also agreed to make historic documents available
relating to how its branches operated in France during the Nazi
era.
	   ``We at Barclays remain committed to bringing to light all facts
relating to bank assets of victims of the Holocaust,'' said John
Varley, chief executive of Barclays' retail financial services
division.
	   ``An official state commission created in France has been
investigating the fate of wartime Jewish assets for some time, and
Barclays has actively assisted the commission in that investigation
and will continue to do so,'' he said. ``The fund created today is
one of many examples of Barclays' commitment to shedding light on
these issues.''
	   In August, Swiss banks agreed to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to
compensate tens of thousands of Jews whose assets were seized
during World War II.
	   Earlier this week, outgoing U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New
York was chosen to mediate a similar class-action lawsuit against
German and Austrian banks.
	   The World Jewish Congress said Thursday that it has entered into
discussions with Chase Manhattan Bank, which has acknowledged
seizing about 100 accounts held by Jews in its Paris branch during
World War II.

<TEXT>
	   LA PLAGNE, France (AP) _ Germany's Christoph Langen stormed to
his fifth successive World Cup bobsled win on Friday, easily
beating runner-up Pierre Lueders and breaking the course record in
the process.
	   Langen, the four-man Olympic champion, posted a total time of
1:57.94, .36 seconds ahead of Canada's Lueders, the two-man Olympic
champion in 1998.
	   With brakeman Thomas Platzer, Langen broke the record on the
track used for the 1992 Olympic Games with a first heat time of
58.68.
	   Italy's Fabrizio Tosini recorded his best ever World Cup finish,
taking third place.
	   Langen now stands on 142 points, ten points clear of Lueders,
with Reto Goetschi in third, with 120 points.
	   The World Cup event continues on Saturday with a four-man race.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's oil minister Friday said any
military activity in the Persian Gulf can affect petroleum prices,
but there is now such an oil glut that not even U.S.-British
bombings of Iraq have had an impact.
	   ``There is too much oil on the market to worry about Iraq,''
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters after meeting his
Norwegian counterpart, Marit Arnstad.
	   Oil prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have been at 12-year lows, costing exporting nations
billions of dollars in revenue. Saudi Arabia and Norway are the
world's two largest oil exporters.
	   Unlike Saudi Arabia, Norway is not a member of Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, although it has voluntarily cut its
production by about 3 percent to support OPEC's drive to reduce
supply and boost prices.
	   Naimi said he had not come to Norway to seek further cuts.
	   ``This is part of a continuous process of trying to understand
what is happening in the oil market,'' Naimi said.
	   He came to Oslo directly from talks on Thursday with Venezuela
and Mexico _ also major producers _ in Madrid.
	   Naimi said the Madrid meeting confirmed three main points: the
commitment to maintain current cuts until June, a desire to extend
cuts through next year, and a willingness to discuss further cuts
in response to market conditions.
	   The minister said the three nations reached a ``soft consensus''
on the need for cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters of up to 2
million barrels a day. He said there are already excess stocks of
150-250 million barrels.
	   Arnstad, the Norwegian oil minister, said Naimi had not asked
Norway for further cuts in production. Earlier this week, Arnstad
said Norway's production will already be about 400,000 barrels per
day below national budget projections for next year due to
voluntary cuts and delays in some new oil fields starting
production.
	   Norway currently produces about 3 million barrels of oil a day.

Report: 182 Russian army deserters in one region surrender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A total of 182 army deserters in just one southern
Siberian region have surrendered to military prosecutors under a
program that promised leniency for those who turned themselves in,
a news report said Friday.
	   About half of the deserters from the Altai region said severe
hazing in the army was at least partly responsible for their
decision to leave military service, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Another 30 deserters in the Altai region are still at large.
	   Nationwide, thousands of deserters have given themselves up to
military authorities under the ``Deserter Come Home'' program that
was launched in March.
	   In the first six months of the year, 6,187 deserters
surrendered. Their deadline for giving themselves up is on Dec. 24,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Desertion has become an increasingly grave problem for Russia's
military. Morale is low, conditions are frequently bleak and hazing
has caused numerous deaths.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - Malaysia's exports for the first
ten months of this year amounted to 236.91 billion ringgit (dlrs
59.23 billion), exceeding the value of exports for all of 1997,
state-run media said Friday.
	   Exports last year totaled 220.89 billion ringgit (dlrs 55.22
billion).
	   Minister of International Trade and Industry Rafidah Aziz said
the jump in exports came despite the negative impact on the
Southeast Asian nation's manufacturers from the regional financial
crisis, Bernama news agency said.
	   Strong export growth has helped turn around Malaysia's trade
balance numbers, allowing it to post a 44.53 billion ringgit (dlrs
11.13 billion) surplus for the first ten months of this year, the
report said.
	   That compares to a 45 million ringgit (dlrs 11 million) deficit
for all of 1997, it said.
	   Also Friday, Prime Minister Mahahtir Mohamad called on the
country's industrial sector to take necessary measures to spur an
economic recovery.
	   Mahathir urged business leaders to cut down on their dependence
on imports by replacing foreign-made components with
locally-manufactured products.

Kjus wins consecutive downhill race

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Lasse Kjus bruised Austria's
pride for a second time in seven days as he overpowered the ``Power
Team'' in the Austrians' favorite discipline of Alpine skiing, the
downhill.
	   The 27-year-old Norwegian, a former World Cup and Olympic
champion, beat Werner Franz and Hermann Maier by a wide margin in
Friday's speed race at Val Gardena for his his second World Cup
downhill victory this season.
	   The Austrians, who looked almost unbeatable in the initial World
Cup stages as they captured super-G, giant slalom and slalom races,
were winless in the event Austrian skiers and fans care most.
	   Kjus' consecutive downhill triumph vaulted the Norwegian skier
atop the World Cup overall standings, with 413 points, ahead of
Austrian Stephan Eberharter who was a distant 16th in the race.
	   Eberharter slipped to second place with 383 points. Maier
strangthened his fourth place pocketing 60 points and piling up a
total of 340 after nine races.
	   Kjus, a 1994 Olympic champion in the combined, World Cup overall
champion in 1996 and a silver medalist in the Olympic downhill at
Nagano this year, had a faultless run down the icy Saslong course
as he clocked an unbeatable time of two minutes, 2.18 seconds over
the 3,495-meter distance.
	   It was the eighth World Cup career win _ the fourth in downhill
_ for Kjus, who had captured the first speed race of the season at
Val D'Isere, France, last Saturday.
	   Franz finished 0.91 seconds behind the winner.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by 1.10
seconds.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion,
placed fourth ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Other top finishers included Austrian Andreas Schifferer (6th),
Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn (7th) and Hans Kanuss and Pietro Vitalini,
who were tied for eighth place, 2.02 seconds behind the winner.
	   Canada's Brian Stemmle was the top north American finisher in
10th place.
	   Audun Groenvold, a former ski jumper who's doing increasingly
well in Alpine skiing, placed 11th to complete the bright day for
the Norwegian colors.
	   The race was marred by two bad spills.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line, escaped
unhurt and still placed 13th in a tie with Austrian Hannes Trinkl.
	   French late starter David Pretot crashed against safety fences
in the upper part of the course and was taken away on a toboggan.
	   Organizers said Pretot possibly twisted his right knee and that
he was going to undergo medical examinations later in the day.
	   Kjus, an all-around skier who can pocket World Cup points in all
disciplines of Alpine skiing, said he won a grueling race ``on an
icy track, with a lot of big jumps.''
	   ``I was a bit scared before the start. I had a lot of respect
for the course and this helped me to stay concentrated throughout,'
Kajus added.
	   ``It was a good day for me. I made no mistakes and I won by a
big margin. I hope I can ski as well tomorrow ... but others have
the capacity to fight back,'' the winner said.
	   Friday's race was the first of back-to-back downhills in this
north Italian valley. It made up for the season opener in Whistler
Mountain, Canada, canceled by bad weather earlier this month.
	   The original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the season, is
scheduled for Saturday.

Police seeks information on a ``movie-like'' bank robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Police appealed Friday to eye witnesses
to help identify bank robbers who took 800,000 kuna (dlrs 129,000)
from the country's main bank.
	   In what bank clerks and clients present at the time described as
a movie-like robbery, two men dressed in black and wearing black
masks entered Zagrebacka Banka through the main entrance in broad
daylight on Thursday.
	   One of the robbers held the crowd down with a pistol, while the
other approached the bank's vault, which was open at the time, and
emptied it of its contents. No one was injured in the robbery.
	   The two escaped through the back door, where a third man was
waiting for them in a getaway car.
	   Police spokesman Josip Begovic told state-run news agency HINA
the robbery was ``bold,'' given it happened in the afternoon, when
the bank and the streets of the suburb where it is located are full
of people.
	   Zagrebacka Banka is offering 80,000 kuna (dlrs 13,000) for a
lead on the robbers, Begovic said.

Released U.N. aid worker recalls time in captivity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo 101-102 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ He was held in chains for nearly 11 months and
allowed just 15 minutes of dim light to eat his daily ration of
soup. But U.N. aid worker Vincent Cochetel survived with his humor
intact.
	   At a press conference Friday, Cochetel spoke of his ``huge, huge
satisfaction,'' that no ransom was paid for his release last
Saturday from a gang in southern Russia.
	   The 37-year-old French national was freed in a pre-dawn fire
fight between Russian security forces and his kidnappers on the
borders of the troubled province of Chechnya. Three of the
kidnappers were reported killed.
	   ``In the years I spent in the Caucasus, I saw many people
kidnapped,'' said Cochetel, head of the U.N. refugee agency's
office in the town of Vladikavkaz. ``Every ransom payment prolonged
the human trafficking.''
	   Cochetel was kidnapped last Jan. 29 by three armed men outside
his apartment. He spent the first three days and nights in the
trunk of a car and was moved to 10 different hiding places in
Chechnya.
	   Conditions of detention were depressingly similar:
	   Hygiene was primitive with one bucket of water for drinking and
washing and another bucket for a toilet. He was given one meal per
day _ usually soup and bread _ and lost 22 kilograms (44 pounds).
	   ``But it doesn't matter. I was too heavy before anyway,'' he
joked.
	   Doctors have said that Cochetel is in excellent shape given his
hardship. He hopes to be released from hospital soon.
	   At the press conference he looked thin but in otherwise good
health. Flanked by his wife, Florence, and U.N. officials, he
refused to take questions on the advice of psychologists.
	   ``I was chained throughout my captivity and still have the marks
of handcuffs on my wrists,'' he said, adding that he suffered
occasional violence.
	   ``I had 15 minutes of light per day _ either from a candle or a
lantern. They took this light away each time after I finished my
meal.''
	   The day of his release, he was dragged from bed at 3:30 a.m. and
driven to a location apparently pre-agreed between the kidnappers
and Russian negotiators.
	   As if in a ``bad film,'' he heard automatic gunfire and threw
himself out of the car and onto the ground, his arms still strapped
behind his back. Two men _ who subsequently turned out to be
Russian rescuers _ then dragged him to another vehicle and sped to
safety.
	   ``I'm very grateful for the Christmas present that fell from the
skies,'' Cochetel said.
	   U.N. officials said they were awaiting more details from the
Russians about the rescue operation. UNHCR operations chief John
Horekens said the agency knew of negotiations about Cochetel's
release but that something apparently went wrong at the last minute
so there was a shootout.
	   The United Nations had repeatedly pleaded with the Russians not
to use force because of the risk to Cochetel, Horekens said.
	   Just days before Cochetel was set free, four westerners were
beheaded by their kidnappers apparently because of a botched rescue
plan.

majority &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ About 54 percent of voters plan to
back the ruling African national Congress in next year's elections,
with the second-most popular party, which ruled during apartheid,
having only 9 percent support, according to a new poll.
	   The findings of the poll released Friday fall short of the ANC's
goal of winning a two-thirds majority, which would allow it to
independently pass legislation.
	   But the poll conducted by the Institute for Democracy in South
Africa and the Markinor polling firm showed backing for opposition
parties is scattered and minimal.
	   Nineteen percent of voters were undecided.
	   Support for the National Party, South Africa's apartheid-era
rulers, has dropped from 10 percent to 9 percent since September,
while the percentage of voters intending to back the Democratic
Party, which is headed by a white, dropped from 7 to 5 percent.
	   Support for the Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party support
increased by one point to 5 percent.
	   Support for five other parties amounted to a total of 7 percent.
	   The ANC had experienced a sharp drop in black allegiance, from
75 percent in 1994 to 45 percent last month, while white support
for the National Party dropped from 48 percent to 7 percent, the
poll showed.
	   The survey was conducted among 3,500 adults between Oct. 5 and
Nov. 11. The survey's margin of error was 1.65 percent.
	   President Nelson Mandela plans to retire after the elections,
which will be held mid-year, and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki is
likely to succeed him.

Ito wins third sprint gold; second doping case reported

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with boxing, rugby, other late medals &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan's Koji Ito once again was the
fastest on foot Friday, winning his third Asian Games gold medal,
while Chinese did their speeding on water, rowing off with five
golds.
	   A second doping case was disclosed, another weightlifter, but
the president of the games' governing body found a bright side in
that no medalists had been found cheating.
	   And with the Chinese far ahead in the overall gold standings,
any victory over them was a cause for celebration.
	   Those with bragging rights Friday included Sri Lanka's
Damayanthi Darsha, who edged ahead of Asian record holder Li Xuemei
of China in the women's 200 meters, and the Japanese women's
basketball team, 93-69 winners over a bigger Chinese team in the
gold medal game.
	   Still China's 11 golds for the day gave it 113 in all. Aside
from the rowers' big haul, the nation picked up three golds from
its native martial art of wushu, two in track and field and one in
tennis.
	   South Korea stood second with 64 after winning five Friday.
Japan was next with 50.
	   Host Thailand celebrated the completion of five victories in
five finals for its boxers, two of whom won Friday, including hero
Somluck Kamsing, also an Olympic gold medalist.
	   Uzbekistan and Kazakstan also won two boxing finals each.
	   That left Thailand with 20 gold medals, well ahead of its
original goal of 12, but just behind fourth-place Kazakstan's 21.
	   Iran boosted its total to nine by taking three golds in
freestyle wrestling.
	   Ito also beat a Chinese in the men's 200, but he was far from
the underdog. He already had established himself as Asia's fastest
man by winning the 100 and anchoring Japan's victorious 400-meter
relay quartet, and by running a 10-flat in the 100 semifinals.
	   His winning time, 20.25 to the 20.75 of China's Han Chaoming,
was slower than his Asian record of 20.16. But, he said, ``the
record will be broken by somebody one day but the medal will never
be taken away.''
	   His triumphs have made him one of the favorites to collect the
U.S. dlrs 100,000 being offered to the games' MVP by the Olympic
Council of Asia.
	   Supriati Sutono, who was carried off the track on a stretcher
after edging India's Sunita Rani by .01 second in the women's
5,000, gave Indonesia its first games track and field gold since
1962.
	   Darsha's victory gave Sri Lanka its third gold, the country's
best result at any Asian Games, and was her own second, following
triumph in the 400.
	   She won in 22.48 seconds, with Li second in 22.53.
	   South Korean Lee Jin-taek won the men's high jump, and
Uzbekistan had a 1-2 finish in the decathlon as Oleg Veretelnikov
beat 1994 winner Ramil Ganiev.
	   For China, Ren Ruiping won the women's triple jump, and Wang
Yinghang overcame two warnings and overtook favorite Sergey
Korepanov of Kazakstan in the final kilometer to win the men's
50-kilometer walk.
	   Meanwhile, the Olympic Council of Asia announced that
weightlifter Jaber Al-Ajmi, the 10th place finisher in the over
105-kilogram division, had tested positive for nandrolone, a banned
anabolic steroid. The International Weightlifting Federation was to
decide his punishment.
	   But OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah, who also is Kuwaiti,
said he was ``happy that there have been only two cases, not
important cases, not involving champions.''
	   In the last games, in 1994 in Hiroshima, Japan, 15 positive
tests were reported, and 11 of them involved medalists, he noted.
	   While the Japanese women beat China for one basketball gold, the
Chinese men foiled the Philippines' all-out campaign to climb back
to the top of Asian basketball by fielding a team of professional
stars. The Chinese beat the Filipinos 82-73 in a semifinal.
	   For the gold, they will play South Korea, a 101-64 winner over
Kazakstan.
	   In rowing, China swept all five of the day's golds, and coach
Gao Hongyin said, ``Now we are on the right track to clean sweep
the Asiad rowing gold medals for the third time.''
	   In the last games in 1994, China won 11 of 12 rowing golds. They
had swept all four in 1982 and all 12 in 1990.
	   The Chinese were stung by failures at the rowing World
Championships in September, and called a special training camp
before the Asian Games. Gao said the rowers had advice in training
from track coach Ma Junren, whose ``Ma's army'' of women distance
runners set world records in the early 1990s.
	   Because of a dispute with national officials, none of Ma's
runners is in the Asian Games, but Ma went to the rowers' training
camp.
	   The Chinese gained still another gold when Li Fang and Chen Li
beat South Koreans Cho Yoon-jeong and Park Sung-hee 6-2, 7-6 (7-2)
in women's doubles tennis.
	   But South Korea's Yoon Yong-il won the men's singles gold,
beating Japan's Satoshi Iwabuchi 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2.
	   South Korea beat India 2-1 for the women's field hockey gold on
Oh Seung-shin's second-half goal, and upset Asian rugby power Japan
2-17 for the rugby title.
	   The South Koreans also beat China 45-44 for the men's saber team
gold in fencing competition.
	   Taiwan's Chao Fong-pang fought back from a 9-4 deficit to beat
Japan's Kunihiko Takahashi 15-11 Friday for the gold medal in
9-ball pool competition.

Somluck wins title

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Olympic boxing gold medalist Somluck
Kamsing capped a successful Asian Games tournament for local
fighters when he took gold in the featherweight class Friday.
	   With an ecstatic hometown crowd cheering every step of the way,
all five Thai fighters who made the finals came out with gold
medals.
	   Uzbekistan, which had seven fighters fighting in the finals,
will return home with three gold, four silver and two bronzes,
	   Somluck, who brought the country its first ever Olympic gold
medal in Atlanta, won his beat Uzbekistan's Tulkunbav Turgunov 8-3.
	   Round one had both fighters coming on strong with Somluck using
his superior hand speed to counter the Turgunov's punches. In the
second round, the Uzbek fighter took the fight to Somluck but
became frustrated half way through the round when most of his
punches were answered by Somluck's straight rights and hooks.
	   Round five had the Uzbek fighter going all out charging Somluck,
trying to corner him but unable to do so as the Olympic champion
side stepped his way out of trouble and ended the fight with an
easy victory.
	   ``Thai fighters are moving up in the world. A number of them
have effectively adopted Cuban style of fighting, employing solid
footwork and throwing very high number of punches,'' said
Thailand's Cuban coach Juan Fontanilis.
	   ``I'm eyeing the gold medal at the next Olympic,'' said Somluck.
``I made a name for myself four years ago at the last Asian Games
and won an Olympic gold afterwards. I think I can repeat the
pattern,'' said Somluck.
	   Japan's Noribisa Tomimoto and Philippines' Eric Canoy received
the bronze.
	   Thailand's flyweight Pramuansak Phosuwan outboxed Indonesia's
Hermensen Ballo to win their final 11-3.
	   Pramuansak's hand speed proved too much for the Indonesian
fighter, who refused to let the huge crowd intimidate him with its
loud ``Thailand, Thailand'' chant.
	   Hermensen took the fight straight to the Thai fighter but was
unable to score effectively as Pramuansak's superior hand speeds
allow him to leashed his combination and drop back quickly.
	   In the last two rounds Pramuansak stuck to his game plan and
refused to be lured in to a toe-to-toe brawl with the Indonesian
fighter.
	   Pakistani's Haider-Ali Haider and South Korea Choi Jin-woo
received the bronze.
	   In the light-welterweight division, Uzbekistan's Miham
Mohamotkadir Abdullaev defeated Indonesia's Wellem Papilaya 17-2.
	   Papilaya started off the fight with lots of quick jabs which
kept Abdullaev at a distance. But his stick-and-move tactic didn't
last beyond the second round. The Uzbek's fighter had penetrated
Papilaya's lengthy jab and delivered a number of vicious
combinations of his own.
	   Thailand's Pongsak Hrianthuanthong and Mongolia Densmaa
Enkhsaikhan received the bronze.
	   In light-middleweight category, Kazakstan's southpaw Yermakhan
Ibraimov outboxed South Korea's Im Jung-bin 9-2.
	   The first round started off cautiously, with Im trying circle
Ibraimov to avoid his right jab. By halfway through the second
round, the Kazak fighter was able to cut off the ring and deliver
stiff uppercuts and hooks that stung the Korean.
	   Im came out strong in the beginning of the third round but could
not maintain the pace for more than 30 seconds when Ibraimov's
right hand found its target. By the end of the round, Ibraimov was
picking his shots almost at will.
	   Thailand's Komgrit Nanakon and Mongolia's Batmunkh Enkhbayar
took the bronze.
	   Uzbekistan's Sergey Mihaylov defeated South Korea's Lee
Seung-bae 9-5 in the light-heavyweight division.
	   Lee took a hard right to the head near the end of the second
that shook him but Mihaylov was unable to follow through as the
bell sounded.
	   India's Gurcharan Singh and Pakistan's Shaukat-ali Shaukat
received the bronze.
	   In the superheavy weight category, Kazakstan's Mukhtarkhan
Dildabekov defeated Iran's Mohammad-Reza Samadi when a trainer
threw in the towel at the end of the third round after a vicious
hook dropped the Iranian fighter to the canvas.
	   Uzbekistan's Lazizbek Zokirov and Pakistan's Shahid-Hussain
Shahid received the bronze.

China to put third and most prominent dissident on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to UPDATE with Xu meeting with defense
attorney; picks up 5th graf pvs `There's no ... ' &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Escalating a concerted crackdown on a would-be
opposition political party, China announced a court date for the
group's most prominent leader on Friday, a day after putting two
other leading organizers on trial.
	   Court officials telephoned Xu Wenli's wife to notify her of his
trial on subversion charges Monday, she said. The call was the
first confirmation He Xintong received of the charges Xu faced
since his arrest at the start of the crackdown 19 days ago.
	   Unlike his China Democracy Party colleagues Wang Youcai and Qin
Yongmin who were deprived of defense lawyers at their trials
Thursday, the court appointed Xu an attorney on Thursday, He said.
That gave them four days to prepare a defense.
	   But prosecution is usually tantamount to conviction for
high-profile dissidents, and subversion is among the most serious
charges used to stifle political dissent. Xu, 55, faces from 10
years to life imprisonment if the harshest aspects of the law are
applied.
	   ``There's no hope,'' said He Xintong. ``I told the court
official today there's no way this will be a fair trial.''
	   By sentencing Xu to a long prison term, Communist Party leaders
would remove one of the most active and potent members of the China
Democracy Party and the fractured dissident community at large.
	   Underscoring the ruling party's determination to keep its
49-year monopoly on power, President Jiang Zemin told a gathering
of 6,000 members of China's political elite Friday that China would
never copy Western political systems.
	   ``The system must not be shaken, weakened, or discarded at any
time,'' Jiang said in a speech to celebrate 20 years of successful
economic reforms that was broadcast nationwide.
	   More than 30 members of the China Democracy Party have been
arrested or questioned since the latest and most aggressive
crackdown on the group began Nov. 30.
	   Although the exact number of party supporters is not known,
dissidents have set up party branches in 14 provinces and cities
since June. Their attempts to register the group with authorities
have been rebuffed.
	   Xu began campaigning for change in the influential Democracy
Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of
them in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu
has played the role of elder adviser to dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin after he believed police pressure was intimidating some
leaders. He also called for party members to hold a nationwide
congress.
	   Xu's trial may be closely mirror the trials held Thursday for
Wang Youcai, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
democracy demonstrations, and Qin Yongmin, a Democracy Wall
colleague of Xu who edited an underground journal.
	   Although no verdicts were announced after the 2 1/2-hour trials
in separate cities, conviction is almost a certainty in
high-profile dissident prosecutions.
	   Like Wang's and Qin's trials, court officials are limiting
access by friends and family. Court officials gave Xu's wife a pass
at a meeting Friday afternoon, but later refused to issue them for
two Xu supporters and democracy party members, she said.
	   The indictment given to Xu's court-appointed attorney, Mo
Shaoping, is similar to those used in Qin's and Wang's trials.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported that the indictment accuses
Xu of a number of charges.
	   These include organizing the China Democracy Party, accepting
money from abroad, calling for independent trade unions and making
subversive statements in interviews with foreign media.
	   He Xintong plans to meet with the lawyer Saturday.

Russian government drops bankruptcy suit against main TV station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities dropped bankruptcy proceedings against
Russia's main television station on Friday, a day after the network
head asked President Boris Yeltsin for protection.
	   A government bankruptcy agency withdrew a suit it had filed with
the Moscow arbitration court against state-controlled ORT, or
Russian Public Television, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   No reason was given for dropping the proceedings, and it wasn't
clear whether Yeltsin's administration had interfered.
	   According to the business daily Kommersant, ORT owes up to dlrs
80 million to private creditors and the government.
	   ORT chief Igor Shabdurasulov appealed to Yeltsin for protection
Thursday, saying Communist politicians are using the company's
massive debts in a bid to take control over it.
	   Communists have long demanded the introduction of what they call
``people's councils'' to monitor and control television broadcasts.
TV executives and Russian liberals say the councils would
effectively be censors.
	   Shabdurasulov praised the decision to drop the lawsuit Friday,
calling it a victory of ``common sense,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   ORT, which reaches 98 percent of Russia's population, first drew
criticism from opposition leaders in 1996 for what they said was
unfair coverage of that year's presidential race. The station
focused heavily on Yeltsin's campaign, gave critical coverage to
his main opponent, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, and painted a
gloomy picture of Russia's future should Communists return to
power.

Italian Olympic Committee secretary-general probed in doping

scandal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The secretary-general of the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI), Raffaele Pagnozzi, has been formally notified he
is under investigation for his alleged role in a cycling doping
case.
	   Rome prosecutors are looking into whether Pagnozzi played a role
in hiding positive drug tests of a cyclist, the ANSA news agency
said Friday.
	   He has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Cycling was plunged into crisis this summer by a series of
arrests and investigations into doping in the Tour de France.
	   In Italy, a wide doping scandal has hit the soccer world,
prompting the resignation of the Italian Olympic Committee
president Mario Pescante and the closing of the country's
drug-testing laboratory.
	   Pagnozzi, also a former official with the national soccer
federation, received the formal notice of investigation on
Thursday, along with soccer federation President Luciano Nizzola.
	   Antonio Matarrese, Nizzola's predecessor and now a UEFA vice
president, was informed Wednesday that he is also being
investigated.

China sharpens condemnation of U.S. military strikes against Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 2nd graf pvs to UPDATE with Foreign
Ministry comment; picks up 4th graf pvs.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China criticized the United States Friday for
launching military strikes against Iraq, calling the bombing a case
of ``power politics'' that set a dangerous precedent.
	   Washington circumvented the U.N. Security Council and ignored
diplomatic norms when it acted alone in attacking Iraq, ``creating
a dangerous and odious precedent that shocked the entire world,''
the ruling Communist Party's leading newspaper, People's Daily,
said in a commentary.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao added to China's official
condemnation, expressing ``deep regret'' over the second day of
attacks by the U.S. and Britain.
	   In a statement carried by the official Xinhua News Agency, Zhu
renewed Beijing's demand for an immediate halt to the military
action.
	   People's Daily dismissed a report by Richard Butler, the U.N.'s
chief arms inspector for Iraq, as nothing but ``an excuse'' for the
U.S. strikes.
	   China has accused Butler of withholding information showing
Iraqi progress in dismantling its missiles and chemical and
biological weapons in a report he gave to the Security Council.
	   ``There was no legitimate reason for the U.S. military action
against Iraq,'' the People's Daily said.
	   Killing civilians and using force to try to topple another
government was ``a typical example of hegemonism and power
politics,'' it added.
	   People's Daily editorials reflect the views of senior
leadership.
	   The newspaper editorial repeated the government's call for an
immediate stop to the strikes and a resumption of diplomacy to try
to resolve the weapons inspection crisis.

Released U.N. aid worker recalls time in captivity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo GNV101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ He was held in chains for nearly 11 months and
allowed just 15 minutes of dim light to eat his daily ration of
soup. But U.N. aid worker Vincent Cochetel survived with his humor
intact.
	   At a press conference Friday, Cochetel spoke of his ``huge, huge
satisfaction,'' that no ransom was paid for his release last
Saturday from a gang in southern Russia.
	   The 37-year-old French national was freed in a pre-dawn fire
fight between Russian security forces and his kidnappers on the
borders of the troubled province of Chechnya. Three of the
kidnappers were reported killed.
	   ``In the years I spent in the Caucasus, I saw many people
kidnapped,'' said Cochetel, head of the U.N. refugee agency's
office in the town of Vladikavkaz. ``Every ransom payment prolonged
the human trafficking.''
	   Cochetel was kidnapped last Jan. 29 by three armed men outside
his apartment. He spent the first three days and nights in the
trunk of a car and was moved to 10 different hiding places in
Chechnya.
	   Conditions of detention were depressingly similar:
	   Hygiene was primitive with one bucket of water for drinking and
washing and another bucket for a toilet. He was given one meal per
day _ usually soup and bread _ and lost 22 kilograms (44 pounds).
	   ``But it doesn't matter. I was too heavy before anyway,'' he
joked.
	   Doctors have said that Cochetel is in excellent shape given his
hardship. He hopes to be released from hospital soon.
	   At the press conference he looked thin but in otherwise good
health. Flanked by his wife, Florence, and U.N. officials, he
refused to take questions on the advice of psychologists.
	   ``I was chained throughout my captivity and still have the marks
of handcuffs on my wrists,'' he said, adding that he suffered
occasional violence.
	   ``I had 15 minutes of light per day _ either from a candle or a
lantern. They took this light away each time after I finished my
meal.''
	   The day of his release, he was dragged from bed at 3:30 a.m. and
driven to a location apparently pre-agreed between the kidnappers
and Russian negotiators.
	   As if in a ``bad film,'' he heard automatic gunfire and threw
himself out of the car and onto the ground, his arms still strapped
behind his back. Two men _ who subsequently turned out to be
Russian rescuers _ then dragged him to another vehicle and sped to
safety.
	   ``I'm very grateful for the Christmas present that fell from the
skies,'' Cochetel said.
	   U.N. officials said they were awaiting more details from the
Russians about the rescue operation. UNHCR operations chief John
Horekens said the agency knew of negotiations about Cochetel's
release but that something apparently went wrong at the last minute
so there was a shootout.
	   The United Nations had repeatedly pleaded with the Russians not
to use force because of the risk to Cochetel, Horekens said.
	   Just days before Cochetel was set free, four westerners were
beheaded by their kidnappers apparently because of a botched rescue
plan.

Stepping up warning, defense minister warns Iraq not to attack

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister said Friday.
	   The minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, was more direct in his warning
than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who on Thursday, the
first day of U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, would only say that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not threatened to attack Israel
in retaliation for the U.S. bombings, and Mordechai told Israel
radio there has been no change in the military's assessment that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel were slim.
	   However, Israel army radio quoted a military source as saying
that Iraq has Sukhoi Su-27 warplanes with enough range to reach
Israel and that Israel has mobilized all reserves in its
anti-aircraft force.
	   Israel's military intelligence analysts believe Saddam might
fire missiles at Israel only if he were desperate or facing death.
	   Mordechai said Israel would like to see the American-British
operation achieve its goals, but that Israel has ``no interest,
directly or indirectly,'' in taking part in the fighting.
	   However, Israel ``would take whatever measures are required
against anyone who would, heaven forbid, dare to hit us,''
Mordechai told the radio.
	   Fearing an Iraqi attack, the Swedish travel agency Fritidsresor
pulled 336 people out of the Red Sea resort of Eilat on Friday.
Other foreign travel companies pulled some 700 travelers out of the
city on Thursday.
	   Palestinians marched against the action in
Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank and clashed with
Israeli soldiers in Bethlehem.
	   ``Death to America, Israel and Britain,'' shouted thousands of
the marchers in Nablus.
	   They also shouted slogans against the recent Palestinian-U.S.
rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they
saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters threw bottles and stones at Israeli soldiers
stationed at the city's border with Jerusalem. The troops responded
with rubber bullets and tear gas, slightly injuring 15
Palestinians.
	   During the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel.
Giving in to American pressure, Israel did not retaliate against
Iraq. The United States was concerned that an Israeli counterstrike
would threaten the stability of an Arab coalition backing the 1991
assault on Iraq.
	   Dan Shomron, who was Israel's armed forces chief of staff during
the Gulf War, played down the possibility of Iraqi missiles falling
on Israel now. He said Iraq would have to assemble launchers in its
western desert area, closest to Israel, and he doubted whether Iraq
had the ability now.
	   Mordechai said American-made Patriot anti-missile batteries have
been deployed as a precaution. He said the plan was to deploy the
batteries as soon as there was an American strike against Iraq. He
said more American equipment is on the way here.
	   The commander of Israel's anti-aircraft units, Brig. Gen. Ariel
Fishben, said improvements have been made in the Patriot system
since the Gulf War, when its success in bringing down incoming
Iraqi Scud missiles was limited.
	   The Israeli military recommended that Israelis check their gas
masks, renew outdated models, stock up on plastic sheeting and tape
to seal off a room in their houses, if necessary. In 1991, Israelis
spent many hours in sealed rooms, wearing gas masks, during the
Iraqi missile attacks.
	   About 25,000 Israelis have traded in their old gas masks for new
ones after the army opened 65 distribution centers around the
country Thursday, the army said. Israel radio reported that 83
percent of Israelis have gas masks.
	   Protective kits distributed to Israeli citizens include gas
masks, automatic atropine needle injectors to counter nerve gas and
powder to treat chemical burns. There are special tents for infants
and gas masks with plastic extensions for men with beards.

Germany's Dresdner Bank to spin off its industrial holdings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS time element, background on Deutsche Bank announcement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two days after Deutsche Bank said it
would spin off its industrial holdings into separate units,
Germany's Dresdner Bank said Friday that it was considering doing
the same.
	   A spokesman said the move would be taken partly for tax reasons,
without elaborating. It wasn't clear when the move would take
place.
	   Analysts say Dresdner Bank may be in a hurry to copy Deutsche
Bank's move to spin off its holdings via limited partnerships, as
tax benefits for adopting such a structure may soon be abolished by
the new center-left government.
	   On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank said it would fold its more than
dlrs 24 billion worth of industrial stocks _ including a 12 percent
stake in DaimlerChrysler _ into limited partnerships, which will be
run by a separate holding company.
	   The move would increase transparency and improve management of
the holdings, Deutsche Bank chairman Rolf Breuer said in making the
announcement.
	   Analysts have suggested Deutsche Bank may want to dispose of
some of its holdings to help finance its plans to take over a U.S.
bank, Bankers Trust, announced last month.
	   By creating limited partnerships, the banks can deal in the
holdings _ increase or decrease their stakes _ without paying tax
on the difference in the value of the stocks from the time they
were bought and the time they were sold.
	   Dresdner Bank's industrial holdings stood at dlrs 15.66 billion
at the end of 1997, and included a 10 percent stake in insurer
Allianz worth dlrs 6.63 billion and dlrs 3.31 billion or 10 percent
stake, in Munich Reinsurance.
	   Dresdner also has a 5 percent stake of BMW worth dlrs 783
million, and a 20.9 percent stake worth dlrs 753 million in
Heidelberg Zement.
	   Investors and some politicians have long criticized the complex
industrial holdings of Germany's major banks, mostly acquired years
ago when they financed industrial expansion.

China to put third and most prominent dissident on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES 2nd-4th grafs with appointment of defense attorney,
details.
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Escalating a concerted crackdown on a would-be
opposition political party, China announced a court date for the
group's most prominent leader on Friday, a day after putting two
other leading organizers on trial.
	   Court officials telephoned Xu Wenli's wife to notify her of his
trial on subversion charges Monday, she said. The call was the
first confirmation He Xintong received of the charges Xu faced
since his arrest at the start of the crackdown 19 days ago.
	   Unlike his China Democracy Party colleagues Wang Youcai and Qin
Yongmin, who were deprived of defense lawyers at separate trials on
Thursday, the court appointed Xu an attorney on Thursday, his wife
said. That gave them four days to prepare a defense.
	   But prosecution is usually tantamount to conviction for
high-profile dissidents, and subversion is among the most serious
charges used to stifle political dissent. Xu, 55, faces from 10
years to life imprisonment if the harshest aspects of the law are
applied.
	   ``There's no hope,'' said He Xintong. ``I told the court
official today there's no way this will be a fair trial.''
	   By sentencing Xu to a long prison term, Communist Party leaders
would remove one of the most active and potent members of the China
Democracy Party and the fractured dissident community at large.
	   Underscoring the ruling party's determination to keep its
49-year monopoly on power, President Jiang Zemin told a gathering
of 6,000 members of China's political elite Friday that China would
never copy Western political systems.
	   ``The system must not be shaken, weakened, or discarded at any
time,'' Jiang said in a speech to celebrate 20 years of successful
economic reforms that was broadcast nationwide.
	   More than 30 members of the China Democracy Party have been
arrested or questioned since the latest and most aggressive
crackdown on the group began Nov. 30.
	   Although the exact number of party supporters is not known,
dissidents have set up party branches in 14 provinces and cities
since June. Their attempts to register the group with authorities
have been rebuffed.
	   Xu began campaigning for change in the influential Democracy
Wall movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of
them in solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu
has played the role of elder adviser to dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin after he believed police pressure was intimidating some
leaders. He also called for party members to hold a nationwide
congress.
	   Xu's trial may be closely mirror the trials held Thursday for
Wang Youcai, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square
democracy demonstrations, and Qin Yongmin, a Democracy Wall
colleague of Xu who edited an underground journal.
	   Although no verdicts were announced after the 2 1/2-hour trials
in separate cities, they were widely viewed as likely to be
convicted.
	   Court officials have limited access to the suspects by friends
and family members. Court officials gave Xu's wife a pass at a
meeting Friday afternoon, but later refused to issue them for two
Xu supporters and democracy party members, she said.
	   The indictment handed over to Xu's court-appointed attorney, Mo
Shaoping, is similar to those used in Qin's and Wang's trials.
	   The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported that the indictment accuses
Xu of a number of charges.
	   These include organizing the China Democracy Party, accepting
money from abroad, calling for independent trade unions and making
subversive statements in interviews with foreign media.
	   He Xintong plans to meet with the lawyer on Saturday.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with China taking two more golds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ China took three Asian Games golds
Friday in the ancient martial art of wushu, with Wu Gang proving
himself the most skilled with a spear, sword and bare fists.
	   Wu won the men's changquan combined competition, in which wushu
experts perform set martial arts routines before judges who look
for control, grace and other skills in awarding points.
	   Wu scored 9.48 with a sword in the short weapon category, 9.5
with a spear in the long weapon discipline and 9.56 in bare-handed
changquan for a combined total of 28.54.
	   Mark-Robert Rosales of the Philippines performed with a cudgel
in long weapon and a broadsword in short weapon and scored a total
27.78 points. That tied him for silver with Oh Poh-Soon of
Malaysia, who used sword and spear and also scored 27.78 points.
	   China also picked up gold through Gao Jiamin in women's
taijiquan, or shadow-boxing, and through Liu Qinghua in women's
changquan combined. Liu scored 28.64 points, beating T. Nguyen-Thi
of Vietnam, who won silver with 28.01 points, and bronze medalist
Yuri Kaminiwa of Japan on 27.80.
	   China also took silver in taijiquan through Fan Xueping.
Indonesia's Jainab Jainab got bronze. China had gold Thursday
through Lang Rongbiao in the men's nanquan style of wushu.

Court recommends sentence reductions for anti-Basque 'dirty war'
</HEADLINE>
convicts &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to show court declining to explain ruling

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court recommended Friday that a
former interior minister and his deputy, both serving 10-year jail
terms for their role in a 'dirty war' against Basque separatists,
have their sentences reduced by two-thirds.
	   It is up to the government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar to
accept or reject the recommendation.
	   After a four-hour hearing the court recommended similar
reductions for eight other people it had found guilty in the same
case in July and sentenced to jail terms ranging from two to 10
years.
	   The court did not give a reason for its action on Friday.
	   The state news agency Efe quoted court sources as saying the
ruling would not be made public, but rather sent directly to the
Justice Ministry, which processes requests for pardons.
	   The court denied leniency to two others whose sentences were
already reduced because of jail time served before the trial.
	   The former interior minister, Jose Barrionuevo, 56, and his
ex-chief of state security, Rafael Vera, 53, started serving their
sentences in September.
	   They were convicted of orchestrating the 1983 kidnapping of a
Basque businessman who was mistaken for a hitman of the armed
separatist group ETA.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next five years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera served under then prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez, who has denied allegations that it was he who ordered the
creation of the GAL death squads.
	   The Supreme Court ruled in 1996 that there was insufficient
evidence to try him in the kidnapping case.

Compensation deadline for German WWII deserters extended
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany on Friday gave World War II
deserters and their families another year to apply for compensation
after making them wait for decades.
	   Parliament offered a one-time payment of 7,500 marks (dlrs
4,500) in May 1997 to men convicted by the Nazis for fleeing
Hitler's army, capping years of debate about whether they were
heroes or traitors.
	   Since then, 2,124 people have applied. The Finance Ministry said
it did not expect many more applications, but was extending the
original Dec. 31 deadline by a year.
	   ``Victims of Nazi military justice had to wait especially long
for rehabilitation and compensation,'' said Karl Diller, a senior
ministry official.
	   ``People who refused to take part in an illegal war of
aggression and therefore were wrongly branded as traitors should
under no circumstances be denied compensation by a short
deadline,'' he said.

France, skeptical of airstrikes, calls Butler report vague
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France said Friday that chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler's report, which triggered U.S. and British
airstrikes, was vague and ``raised many questions.''
	   ``Mr. Butler's report contains a number of vague statements,''
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said at a news
briefing. ``The report raises questions _ a good number of
questions.''
	   She did not specify which points France considered vague.
	   Gazeau-Secret also said France regretted not having had the
opportunity to review Butler's report before the United States and
Britain began airstrikes against Iraq early Thursday.
	   The Foreign Ministry's complaints, coming after French President
Jacques Chirac said Thursday that the U.S. military strikes against
Iraq would not solve the crisis, further emphasized France's
discomfort with the developments.
	   The French president, who spoke to President Clinton by phone
Thursday, said France would use its weight to try to end the
crisis.
	   And on Friday, Chirac told Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair
in a phone conversation they needed to find a solution to the Iraqi
crisis ``as soon as possible,'' presidential spokeswoman Catherine
Colonna said.
	   The Foreign Ministry criticism of the Butler's work came after
the left-leaning daily newspaper Liberation claimed Friday that the
chief U.N. weapons inspector had provoked the crisis with a
deliberately biased report.
	   Citing diplomatic sources at the United Nations, Liberation said
Butler had exaggerated a small number of Iraqi transgressions and
left out over 300 instances where they had fully complied with
weapons inspectors. The daily did not identify its sources by name.
	   Meanwhile, Butler on Thursday defended his report that Iraq did
not fully cooperate with U.N. monitors and said he had no intention
of quitting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow would insist on
Butler's dismissal.
	   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective, is utterly
false,'' Butler said.
	   In the past month, the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, has tested the promise Iraq made on Nov. 14,
under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, to resume full
cooperation with UNSCOM. Butler's report concluded Iraq had fallen
short of compliance.
	   The French Foreign Ministry also complained that Butler had
repeatedly evacuated U.N. monitors from Iraq without consulting the
Security Council.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Police clashed with Iraqi
protesters Friday outside the U.S. Embassy, using batons to break
up a demonstration against American airstrikes against Iraq.
	   At least two Iraqi demonstrators were injured as a march to hand
a petition to embassy staff degenerated into a series of scuffles
with police, Dutch television reported.
	   Angry demonstrators tore down crowd-control barriers and shoved
police as embassy staff watched from windows of the building in a
usually quiet tree-lined Hague avenue.
	   The embassy's press office could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   The 300 protesters eventually reformed into a peaceful column
and marched to a nearby park to continue their demonstration.

American skier tears knee ligament in spill

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ American downhiller Ehlias Louis was
declared out for the rest of the ski season with a tore cruciate
knee ligament following a spill during Friday's World Cup downhill
race in this north Italian valley.
	   Louis, 23, from Park City, Utah, was taken to the nearby
hospital of Bressanone (Brixen) for treatment.
	   Italian organizers said the American skier, a late starter with
No. 43 bib, tore the left knee ligament following a high speed fall
on the icy Saslong track.
	   The injury will prevent the young American from competing in the
1999 World Championships, scheduled in Vail, Colo., in February.
	   The race was marred by several spills.
	   Frenchman David Pretot twisted his right knee and was
hospitalized in Bolzano (Bozen) following a fall in the upper part
of the track.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line but still
placed 13th, unhurt.
	   Canadian Ed Podivinsky also suffered a season-ending injury when
he tore his left knee cruciate ligament during the opening day of
practice in Val Gardena Wednesday.

World's largest oil exporters, Saudi Arabia and Norway, discuss
</HEADLINE>
prices &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's oil minister Friday said any
military activity in the Gulf can affect petroleum prices, but
there is now such an oil glut that not even U.S.-British bombings
of Iraq have had an impact.
	   ``There is too much oil on the market to worry about Iraq,''
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters after meeting his
Norwegian counterpart, Marit Arnstad.
	   Oil prices, depressed by overproduction amid a global economic
crisis, have been at 12-year lows, costing exporting nations
billions of dollars in revenue. Saudi Arabia and Norway are the
world's two largest oil exporters.
	   Unlike Saudi Arabia, Norway is not a member of Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, although it has voluntarily cut its
production by about 3 percent to support OPEC's drive to reduce
supply and boost prices.
	   Naimi said he had not come to Norway to seek further cuts.
	   ``This is part of a continuous process of trying to understand
what is happening in the oil market,'' Naimi said.
	   He came to Oslo directly from talks on Thursday with Venezuela
and Mexico _ also major producers _ in Madrid.
	   Naimi said the Madrid meeting confirmed three main points: the
commitment to maintain current cuts until June, a desire to extend
cuts through next year, and a willingness to discuss further cuts
in response to market conditions.
	   The minister said the three nations reached a ``soft consensus''
on the need for cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters of up to 2
million barrels a day. He said there are already excess stocks of
150-250 million barrels.
	   Arnstad, the Norwegian oil minister, said Naimi had not asked
Norway for further cuts in production. Earlier this week, Arnstad
said Norway's production will already be about 400,000 barrels per
day below national budget projections for next year due to
voluntary cuts and delays in some new oil fields starting
production.
	   Norway currently produces about 3 million barrels of oil a day.

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with new material throughout, additional
analysis. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow denounced the United States on Friday with
the kind of rhetoric not seen since the Cold War, demanding an end
to attacks on Iraq and warning that relations with the West could
be badly damaged.
	   In a rare display of political consensus, President Boris
Yeltsin and his Communist and nationalist opponents harshly
criticized the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq with verbal
broadsides reminiscent of the Soviet era.
	   ``We condemn the United States, and nobody should doubt our
negative attitude,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday the U.S. and
British strikes ``flagrantly violated the norms of the
international law and openly ignored the world community's efforts
to settle the situation.'' Sergeyev said Moscow's relations with
NATO were threatened.
	   The Foreign Ministry called for a halt to the air attacks and a
U.N. Security Council meeting to restore peace in Baghdad, a
longtime Soviet and Russian friend.
	   The Iraq crisis underlines Moscow's loss of global influence and
the unhappiness of some Russian political leaders and officials
about close post-Soviet ties with the West. Russian officials are
furious that they can do little more than complain, recalling how
the Soviet Union might have been able to use its global muscle to
prevent such an attack.
	   But Russia is no longer a global power and even the most
vehement critics of the West admit privately that Moscow will do
little more than growl and indulge in half-hearted sabre rattling.
Russia, caught in its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, needs the West far too much.
	   The Kremlin, apparently concerned about the growing rhetoric at
a time when it is desperate for Western aid, was already toning
down some of the criticism. Presidential aides stressed there was
no question of breaking relations with the United States or Great
Britain even though Moscow recalled its ambassadors to protest the
airstrikes.
	   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towards confrontation (with the West), but we should call
things by their name. The military strikes are unacceptable and
should be stopped,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a
Kremlin press briefing.
	   Senior officials hastened to add that Russia still wants Western
food aid and new loans from the International Monetary Fund. None
of that is possible with the support of Washington.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, was to consider
calls Friday for Russia to unilaterally break U.N. sanctions
against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as
saying.
	   The Russian navy put some units on alert because of the Iraq
crisis, but there had been no deployment of ships, officials said.
The move appeared purely symbolic. The Russian military is not
considered an effective force after years of neglect and poor
funding.
	   Yeltsin is under opposition pressure to curb ties with the West
at a time when he has lost much of his political clout because of
health problems and his failure to handle the economic crisis.
Communist and other nationalist politicians have been demanding an
end to Moscow's close ties with the West and NATO.
	   Still, Yeltsin, who was mainly angry about not being informed
about the attack in advance, has staked his foreign policy on good
ties with the West and is not likely to change course.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) - Four people were killed, including a
Chinese woman, and 16 were injured in two separate traffic pileups
on a main Yugoslav highway Friday, police reported.
	   According to police, a dense fog on the Belgrade-Nis highway
caused two massive crashes: one involving 15 cars, and the other
involving nine vehicles.
	   In the first one, three Yugoslavs were killed and 12 were
injured. In the second, a Chinese woman identified as Van Mei Un,
27, was killed and four Yugoslavs were injured.
	   A Bulgarian truck driver was arrested on suspicion of causing
the first accident, police said.

<TEXT>
	   BEIT DOUKU, West Bank (AP) _ Anxious to avoid the image that
earned the Palestinians pariah status during the Gulf War,
authorities moved quickly Friday to contain anti-U.S.
demonstrations and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi
sentiments.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers
chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to America,
Death to Clinton, Death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity poles
during the Clinton visit.
	   Protesters found a few left-over plastic U.S. flags, and wrapped
them around their shoes in a sign of contempt.
	   Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press writer
for photographing the burning of a U.S. flag, and released him on
condition that he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.
	   The Palestinian leadership is anxious to curb the unmitigated
backing Palestinians gave Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _
stance that set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   Clinton's visited earlier this week _ to salvage peace accords
with Israel _ was visit was seen as tantamount to recognition of
Palestinian aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are
anxious to cultivate the new friendship.
	   The Palestinian Authority has issued a careful statement
regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction
capability.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down two TV stations and a radio station in
Ramallah and three TV stations in Bethlehem.
	   There was no official explanation for the shutdown, but the TV
stations had broadcast footage of the pro-Iraq demonstrations,
pro-Iraqi interviews and nationalist music. The Voice of Peace and
Love had devoted its broadcasts on Thursday to a popular
nationalist Iraqi singer.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they saw
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Beit Douku, a village near Ramallah, over a thousand people
joined the funeral procession for a youth killed by Israeli troops
during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday.
	   Mohammed Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a
green sheet.
	   ``With body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' they chanted.
``With body and soul, we will redeem you, Iraq!''

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Airport workers said Friday they will
press ahead with strike plans which threaten to seriously disrupt
pre-Christmas travel for thousands of people, defying a court order
which banned the action.
	   ``We don't want to create problems for the public, but we have
to safeguard workers' social rights,'' said Vassilis Vassos, a
spokesman for the civil aviation union.
	   The union had scheduled daily work stoppages between 6 a.m. and
10 a.m. and again between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Dec. 21-23. Workers
were demanding the immediate hiring of staff to cover increased
demands in regional airports.
	   After the action was declared illegal Friday, the 2,700-strong
union renewed its call for strikes but changed its demands in order
to circumvent the court ruling.
	   The workers are now protesting the merging of their pension
funds with weaker funds, and demanding talks with government
officials, Vassos said.
	   Separate work stoppages planned for Friday and Saturday by
telecommunications workers and airport ground crews were called off
after an Athens court also ruled them illegal.
	   Under the court decision, the unions have been banned from
calling another strike with the same demands until Jan. 10.
	   Disgruntled workers have held a series of strikes and protests
in recent months, including a 24-hour nationwide general strike
last Tuesday which paralyzed the country.
	   Protests have centered on the government's fiscal austerity
program designed to ensure Greece qualifies for joining the
European Union's single currency by 2001.

Russia still wants U.S. food aid despite differences over Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is continuing to seek U.S. food aid despite
harsh criticism of its attacks on Iraq, a senior Russian official
said Friday.
	   The government expects to finalize a Russian-U.S. agreement on
dlrs 625 million in food aid and loans by Dec. 25, Deputy Prime
Minister Gennady Kulik said, according to Russian news reports.
	   Kulik joined President Boris Yeltsin and other officials who
have strongly condemned the U.S and British strikes on Iraq this
week. Moscow recalled its ambassadors to Washington and London to
express its extreme displeasure.
	   The U.S. action is ``indeed the height of insolence and
impunity,'' Kulik said. However, he added, ``it doesn't mean that
we are breaking relations with the United States.''
	   Russia's poor grain harvest this year, coming on top of the
worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, has caused concern
that some Russians could go hungry this winter and prompted Moscow
to ask the United States and the European Union for food aid.
	   The final U.S. aid agreement has been postponed because of U.S.
demands for additional guarantees that the 3.1 million tons of food
reaches those who need it most. Past food aid deals have been mired
in corruption.
	   Earlier this week, Kulik accused the U.S. of stalling by posing
the new demands.

Extortionist demanding millions from German railway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An extortionist demanding 10 million
marks (dlrs 6 million) from the German railway may have already
carried out three attacks on trains, officials said Friday.
	   Federal agents were investigating whether three sabotage acts in
the past week on tracks near Berlin were connected to the extortion
attempt, rail officials said.
	   In the most serious incident, a cargo train carrying paper rolls
derailed early Friday near Anklam. No one was hurt. Earlier in the
week, rail workers discovered screws had been loosened on the same
line.
	   The railway said it had received four letters in the past week,
apparently from the same source, demanding money.

President signs `bad law' on communist files after veto overridden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with comments from prime minister; RECASTS &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ His veto overridden by celebrating
legislators, President Aleksander Kwasniewski on Friday signed what
he called a ``bad law'' that will finally allow victims of
communist-era repression to see their secret police files.
	   The 282-164 vote in the Sejm, the lower parliament chamber, to
override Kwasniewski's veto gave the governing Solidarity-led
coalition rooted in Poland's anti-communist movement a major
victory over the former communist elected president in 1995.
	   More importantly, it forces Poland to confront its communist
past after almost a decade of arguing over whether that would help
or harm the country.
	   ``I'm convinced that it was a vote for the future because you
cannot think about the future, organize it, without setting your
past in order,'' Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said. ``We ... have a
chance to make up for a lot harm.''
	   Few issues reveal the bitterness of Poland's divided history as
much as the question of how to deal with decades of abused human
rights under communism.
	   During the communist era, the secret police used informers to
monitor virtually all aspects of daily life and routinely cracked
down on people suspected of anti-government activism. Accusations
of who may have collaborated in the past continue to hound people
throughout society, including top government officials.
	   Passed by parliament on Sept. 22, the bill creates an Institute
of National Remembrance to collect communist files from 1944-89, as
well as documents of Stalinist and Nazi crimes.
	   Besides making files available to victims, the institute can
launch investigations to establish those responsible for
persecution or political murders.
	   Kwasniewski vetoed the bill Dec. 12, saying it would give too
much power to the institute managing the files. He also said all
Poles, not only victims of totalitarian regimes, should be allowed
to see their records.
	   Former communist officials say the files are incomplete and full
of misinformation, which would cause chaos in the form of false
accusations and witch hunts.
	   Solidarity figures, including former President Lech Walesa, say
the past must be confronted, even if that means government
officials and others get victimized.
	   Legislators of the governing coalition stood and applauded the
veto override, which came at a price. In order to muster the 60
percent majority needed, the coalition agreed changes demanded by
an opposition group mostly representing farmers, the Polish
Peasant's Party, in return for its support.
	   The smaller party wants the head of the institute elected by a
60 percent majority in the Sejm, instead of the simple majority
required in the bill.
	   Solidarity's partner in the governing coalition, the Freedom
Union, said it planned to propose other minor amendments to deal
with unspecified ``legal issues.'' The amendments will require a
few more months of parliament activity.
	   Kwasniewski sounded unconvinced.
	   ``I have not changed my opinion _ this is a bad law,'' he said
before signing it. ``It is good that it will never function in the
present shape.''
	   But Jacek Rybicki, a senior Solidarity leader in parliament,
said the new law meant progress in ``closing the door behind
communist Poland.''
	   Until Friday, years of debate and political maneuvering failed
to produce a credible way for Poland to open its communist files as
occurred in some other former Soviet bloc countries.
	   Poland's first attempt to open secret files was in 1992 by the
rightist government of Prime Minister Jan Olszewski. But after
lists of alleged secret agents were leaked, the government was
toppled on a no-confidence vote.

U.S., Swiss governments ready to sign accord to split drug money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) - The U.S. and Swiss governments were
signing in Washington Friday an agreement to split some dlrs 175
million from a drug dealers' money-laundering operation, Swiss
officials said.
	   The long-delayed signing is to be shared out 50-50 to mark the
cooperation between the two governments in the case, said a
spokesman for the Federal Office for Police Affairs. The signing
was delayed because of negotiations on how the Swiss federal and
cantonal (state) governments would divide Switzerland's half.
	   Authorities said the money stems from Swiss bank deposits made
in the 1970s by a Colombian, Sheila Miriam Arana de Nasser, from
drug trafficking.
	   Arana de Nasser was arrested in Switzerland in 1974 and
extradited to the United States the following year.
	   In 1996 she pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Miami to
charges she teamed with her husband to smuggle dlrs 755 million
worth of cocaine and marijuana into the United States.
	   She was sentenced to 12 years in jail and fined dlrs 4 million.
She agreed to forfeit the money her frozen Swiss bank account.
	   The amount has grown with interest from the dlrs 150 million
originally seized in 1974, when U.S. officials described it as the
largest amount of drug money ever confiscated.
	   Although her estranged husband, Julio Nasser David, also was
indicted, he has never been brought to trial. He is believed to be
in Colombia, which has no extradition treaty with the United
States.
	   Signing the accord were U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and
Swiss Ambassador Alfred Defago.

Police say 11 dead in Siberian bus explosion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with passengers reportedly coal miners, car
behind bus destroyed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bus exploded in central Siberia, killing at
least 11 people, police investigating the incident said Friday.
	   Police said there were no survivors, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Investigators speculate that a faulty fuel cylinder in the bus
caused Thursday's explosion, which occurred as the bus passed a gas
station in Kiselyovsk, about 3,000 kilometers (1,850 miles) east of
Moscow.
	   Still, police are still searching for possible evidence of a
criminal act, and offered a 50,000 ruble (dlrs 2,300) reward for
significant evidence, the report said.
	   The passengers were miners who worked at a nearby coal mine, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The blast also destroyed a passenger car that was following the
bus, ITAR-Tass said. The car's driver was thrown onto a snowdrift
that saved his life.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Mostly clear skies were reported this morning across Puerto Rico
and the Virgin Islands. There was no rain. The wind was from the
east at 10 to 20 mph.
	   Currently the weather pattern that exists in the northeastern
Caribbean is a dry one dominated by high pressure aloft located 400
miles northeast of the Leeward Islands. This dry regime will
undergo a slow change to a wet pattern starting late Saturday and
continuing into the middle of next week.
	   Tuesday and Wednesday of next week look like a certain bet for
rainy and breezy days as low pressure in the lower Caribbean moves
north to Puerto Rico on Wednesday and becomes nearly stationary
there.
	   The marine conditions will be deteriorating on the weekend into
early next week due to a developing storm in the Atlantic east of
Bermuda tonight and Saturday. A small craft advisory will most
likely go into effect for the Atlantic waters tonight and for the
Caribbean waters on Saturday.

 &UR; Young piano virtuoso gets his own baby grand
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Nobody said self-taught classical pianists
had it easy. But Jason Rodgers' path was especially hard _ he had
to search to find pianos to hone his talent, spending afternoons at
one school and evenings at another.
	   The days of walking and cadging rides are over. On Wednesday, a
piano was delivered to his family's house, a gift from a
philanthropist who once heard the 16-year-old boy play.
	   ``My baby's got his own piano,'' Jason's mother, Alice Eason,
teased as the dark mahogany Bellah baby grand arrived at their
rowhouse.
	   Once it was assembled, Jason stood back and just looked at it.
It was one of the few times in his life he had to be urged to play.
Finally, his mother and others talked him into it and he played
some Chopin.
	   Jason loved to play ever since he was a little boy. His mother
and grandmother, who both played gospel music at church, taught him
how. They'd show him a few chords and he'd take off improvising,
his mother remembered. Soon he began searching for new teachers,
and learning on his own.
	   Philanthropist Carole Haas heard Jason play a Rachmaninoff
prelude at a City Hall reception, recalling he ``just seemed to
glow as he played. He radiated.'' She said she knew instantly that
he deserved a piano an acquaintance had been looking to donate as a
tax write-off.
	   Now, along with study at Temple University's Esther Boyer
College of Music and a scholarship at Settlement Music School,
Jason can practice by just stepping into his living room.
	   ___ &QC;

Suspended Italian star still missing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Suspended for 11 games for pushing a
referee to the ground, Italian soccer star Paolo Di Canio failed to
return to Sheffield Wednesday in time for his scheduled recall to
action next week.
	   ``We still don't know where he is,'' Wednesday manager Danny
Wilson said Friday. ``All we know is that he is in Italy somewhere.
We have been unable to contact him and it's a very frustrating time
for all concerned.''
	   The former Lazio, Juventus and AC Milan forward was banned for
shoving referee Paul Alcock after being expelled against Arsenal
two months ago. Wednesday allowed him to return to Italy but wanted
him back last week well in time for him to prepare for his Dec. 26
return to action.
	   ``As days go by and the longer he stays away, it's becoming more
likely he will not figure in the game on Boxing Day,'' Wilson said.
	   ``I am very disappointed with him, but it's the chairman I feel
sorry for because he has bent over backwards for him. As a football
club we have shown tremendous loyalty and patience with him over
what has happened over the last few months, but that has not been
reciprocated.
	   ``We will have to wait and see whether we transfer list him,''
the Wednesday manager said. ``I don't really know what will
happen.''
	   Wednesday has already fined Di Canio three weeks wages because
of the incident and his late return. He also was fined 10,000
pounds (dlrs 16,700) by the Football Association with 12,000 (dlrs
20,000) costs so that the push has cost him some 107,000 pounds
(dlrs 179,000).

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Protesters through much of the Arab world
shouted slogans Friday against the United States over its strikes
on Iraq, urging revolt against America and labeling President Bill
Clinton a ``terrorist.''
	   Arab leaders and newspapers also harshly criticized the American
missile attacks, saying they would do more harm to the Iraqi people
than the regime of President Saddam Hussein.
	   Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura said the U.S.
strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of the 22 million
Iraqis.
	   ``We ... condemn and denounce this attack and call on the
international community to condemn and halt it immediately,'' he
said in a speech to the Parliament.
	   The mood on the Arab street was uglier. The angry shouts were
tinged with threats against American interests and cast the U.S.
air strikes as a war on Muslims.
	   Among the thousands of demonstrators, many condemned the attacks
as an attempt by U.S. Clinton to save himself from impeachment over
his sexual relations with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read a sign
waved during a protest at Cairo's Al-Azhar University mosque, one
of the main centers of scholarship in the Muslim world.
	   Criticism of the United States was repeated in sermons at Friday
Muslim prayers and protests in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, the United
Arab Emirates, Syria and the Palestinian territories as well as in
non-Arab Iran.
	   In Cairo, hundreds of worshipers gathered at the Al-Azhar mosque
to shout demands for Arabs to defend Iraq against the American
onslaught.
	   ``Leaders of the country, let us go to holy war,'' the
protesters chanted.
	   Sheik Mohammed Tantawi, head of Al-Azhar, urged solidarity with
Iraqis in his sermon. ``Stand by the Iraqi people, or we will be
hit by God's damnation,'' he preached.
	   Inside the mosque, one protester, Mohammed Abdrabbo, 27,
shouted, ``Attack American interests. Close the American Embassy.''
Others questioned Clinton's motive for the repeated missile strikes
on Iraq.
	   ``Iraq is suffering because of an American whore and a big baby
boy,'' said Mohammed Hassan, 20, a medical student.
	   In countries closely allied to the United States _ such as Egypt
and Jordan _ authorities brought out massive security forces to
prevent demonstrations from turning violent.
	   About 300 police ringed no more than 40 protesters at a mosque
near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. In Jordan, about 500 police
surrounded an equal number of demonstrators in Amman, and police
dispersed thousands of demonstrators in Irbid, 90 kilometers (55
miles) north of the capital.
	   At Amman's University of Jordan mosque, the protesters called
for an Arab revolt against the United States.
	   ``Saddam ... if you want commandos, we are ready'' and ``Syria,
Jordan, Iraq _ revolt and make Clinton go to hell'' were among
slogans chanted.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem _ where Clinton was greeted
enthusiastically just days ago _ hundreds of protesters chanted
``Death to Clinton.''
	   About 15,000 Muslims marched through the Yemeni capital of
San`a, and 2,500 people _ mostly students _ held a sit-in outside a
U.N. office in Lebanon's capital Beirut. Demonstrators in the
southern Lebanese city of Sidon shouted ``America is the enemy of
God'' and ``Clinton is the terrorist of the century.''
	   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir condemned the attacks in a
commentary by its editor-publisher, saying they would only increase
Saddam's power, giving him ``a new lease on life.''
	   In the past two days of attacks, the U.S. and British strikes
also have been criticized by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates,
Lebanon and the 52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference,
the world's largest Muslim group.
	   The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose
invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the Gulf War. Foreign Minister
Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah told the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm the
current crisis was strictly between Iraqi and the United Nations.
	   ``We have nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, wrote
that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife and ``will be
hanging naked from street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the
U.S. attacks end.

16 miners remain underground protesting unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Sixteen miners have remained
underground since Wednesday morning in a protest over unpaid wages,
management reported Friday.
	   The 16, strongly supported by about 230 co-workers on the
surface, want to receive the remainder of their October wages and
at least part of their November pay.
	   The employees of the Komag at the Bankov mine in eastern
Slovakia received only 2,000 crowns (55 dlrs) in October. The
miners do not all receive the same salary, but the money they
received is no more than half of a miner's monthly pay.
	   The 16 miners, who are representing the rest of their
colleagues, are demanding the remainder of their October pay, and
3,000 crowns (83 dlrs) from their November wages.
	   ``I totally understand them. No one can live on promises. Their
wages are the only source of finances for their living expenses,''
the mine's technical director, Vladimir Girman, told The Associated
Press on Friday. ``We quietly support the miners.''
	   Girman said Komag's management has been informing employees of
the mine's difficult financial situation for some time, and has
pushed the company's shareholders to try to settle the situation.
	   ``We have tried everything, but the shareholders did not react
until now. They started to act on these things very quickly now _
because the miners are underground _ to avoid any difficulties with
their health,'' Girman said.
	   The company is owned by VSZ Holding Kosice, a steel mill in
eastern Slovakia, and VUB bank of Bratislava. VSZ Holding is having
its own financial difficulties, which Girman said was one of the
reasons why the mine's financial problems have not been solved
sooner.
	   ``The rest of October's payments to the employees will be made
today. ... But the miners will stay underground until all of their
requirements are met. That could be on Monday,'' Girman said.
	   The miners get food and drinks from co-workers. Girman said the
management is in contact with the 16 miners, and all are doing
well.

6-7

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police briefly detained Friday an
influential leader of Romania's minors, who has led his men on
violent rampages though the capital twice in the last decade.
	   Earlier this year, a court banned union leader Mirror Comma from
the capital for two years, after he was found guilty of disturbing
public order during the minors' unrest in 1991, when at least three
people were killed and a prime minister was forced to resign.
	   Comma has appealed the decision. He was detained Friday while
entering the industry ministry, where he and a group of minors were
to meet the minister to discuss possible mine closures.
	   The talks were canceled and police later released Comma, said
Col. Secrieru of the Bucharest police.
	   Also Friday, some 500 coal miners in western Romania's Jiu
Valley, where Cozma is union leader, went on strike for a second
day to protest feared job cuts.
	   On Thursday, Industry Minister Radu Berceanu announced the
government will close unprofitable 29 mines as part of its market
reforms in the coming months. The move will leave some 3,000 miners
without jobs, but save the state some 30 percent in losses.
	   According to Berceanu, in 1998 the mining industry cost the
state 901 billion lei (dlrs 86 million) in unpaid debts.
	   In an unprecedented way of social protection Berceanu also said
the government will give the closed mines to former employees who
are interested in starting their own business.
	   Last year the government also laid off tens of thousands of
miners, with up to 20 months' salaries in severance pay. Miners
earn above Romania's monthly average of dls 120.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe's defense minister said Friday
his forces have killed more than 2,000 rebel fighters, including
white mercenaries, in the Congo war.
	   The claim by acting Defense Minister Sidney Sekeramayi could not
be independently confirmed.
	   He did not say how many whites had been killed nor specify their
nationalities, but called them ``mercenaries.''
	   Sekeramayi also told reporters 26 Zimbabwean soldiers have died
in Congo since mid-August, most in fighting over the strategic
eastern Congolese town of Kabalo that began last weekend. The
number is believed to be much higher.
	   Zimbabwe has deployed 8,000 soldiers to back embattled Congolese
President Laurent Kabila. Troops from Namibia, Angola and Chad are
also helping Kabila, while Rwanda and Uganda are backing the Congo
rebels.
	   Sekeramayi said heavy fighting was continuing Friday around
Kabalo.
	   He acknolwedged that a French-built Alouette helicpoter gunship
was shot down recently, with the loss of its pilot, a squadron
leader, and an army colonel commanding ground Zimbabwe troops from
the air.
	   Rebels have claimed they also shot down a Zimbabwe military
transport plane and a jet fighter.
	   Sekeramayi denied any other Zimbabwean war planes have been lost
since the rebellion against Kabila erupted Aug. 2, despite an
official announcement in Harare in September that a troop transport
plane crashed in southwestern Congo in bad weather with the loss of
its crew.
	   Sekeramayi also denied newspaper reports that five senior army
officers have been court-marshaled for indiscipline and inciting
mutiny among Zimbabwean troops in Congo.
	   The Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported Friday one of the
disciplined officers, a battalion commander, allegedly refused to
obey orders.
	   Another of the five, identified as a Maj. Tuhwe, was discharged
for inciting disaffection, fear, alarm and despondency among troops
serving in the Congo, The Independent reported.
	   It said military intelligence bugged his home telephone and
heard him say in a call from the front that ``people are dying,
corpses are in plastic bags full of worms and soldiers are dying en
masse.''

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with parliament urging Yeltsin to ignore
sanctions in grafs 11-12. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow denounced the United States on Friday with
the kind of rhetoric not seen since the Cold War, demanding an end
to attacks on Iraq and warning that relations with the West could
be badly damaged.
	   In a rare display of political consensus, President Boris
Yeltsin and his Communist and nationalist opponents harshly
criticized the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq with verbal
broadsides reminiscent of the Soviet era.
	   ``We condemn the United States, and nobody should doubt our
negative attitude,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday the U.S. and
British strikes ``flagrantly violated the norms of the
international law and openly ignored the world community's efforts
to settle the situation.'' Sergeyev said Moscow's relations with
NATO were threatened.
	   The Foreign Ministry called for a halt to the air attacks and a
U.N. Security Council meeting to restore peace in Baghdad, a
longtime Soviet and Russian friend.
	   The Iraq crisis underlines Moscow's loss of global influence and
the unhappiness of some Russian political leaders and officials
about close post-Soviet ties with the West. Russian officials are
furious that they can do little more than complain, recalling how
the Soviet Union might have been able to use its global muscle to
prevent such an attack.
	   But Russia is no longer a global power and even the most
vehement critics of the West admit privately that Moscow will do
little more than growl and indulge in half-hearted sabre rattling.
Russia, caught in its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, needs the West far too much.
	   The Kremlin, apparently concerned about the growing rhetoric at
a time when it is desperate for Western aid, was already toning
down some of the criticism. Presidential aides stressed there was
no question of breaking relations with the United States or Great
Britain even though Moscow recalled its ambassadors to protest the
airstrikes.
	   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towards confrontation (with the West), but we should call
things by their name. The military strikes are unacceptable and
should be stopped,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a
Kremlin press briefing.
	   Senior officials hastened to add that Russia still wants Western
food aid and new loans from the International Monetary Fund. None
of that is possible with the support of Washington.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, passed an
appeal to Yeltsin on Friday calling for Russia to unilaterally
break U.N. sanctions against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad.
	   Such a move is not binding on the government and Yeltsin is
unlikely to take any real action.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as
saying.
	   The Russian navy put some units on alert because of the Iraq
crisis, but there had been no deployment of ships, officials said.
The move appeared purely symbolic. The Russian military is not
considered an effective force after years of neglect and poor
funding.
	   Yeltsin is under opposition pressure to curb ties with the West
at a time when he has lost much of his political clout because of
health problems and his failure to handle the economic crisis.
Communist and other nationalist politicians have been demanding an
end to Moscow's close ties with the West and NATO.
	   Still, Yeltsin, who was mainly angry about not being informed
about the attack in advance, has staked his foreign policy on good
ties with the West and is not likely to change course.

Mexico says further oil cuts discussed but dropped

 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia tried
but failed to reach a deal cutting production by a further two
million barrels a day in a bid to boost sagging oil prices,
Mexico's oil minister said Friday.
	   But the minister, Luis Tellez, said the countries pledged to
maintain cuts they agreed to in June and would try to persuade
other oil producers, such as Iran, to join efforts to reduce global
production.
	   Tellez said that Iran, the second-largest OPEC exporter behind
Saudi Arabia, was producing 300,000 barrels per day more than the
limit it voluntarily agreed to in March, and that the extra
production was creating problems for the market.
	   Tellez said the tripartite meeting of oil and energy ministers
in Madrid on Thursday had considered the plan for cuts of two
million barrels a day, but ``there was no agreement to do this
now.''
	   Under the deal, the 11 members of OPEC would have borne the
burden of making production cuts totaling 1.5 million barrels a
day, while non-OPEC members would have cut the remaining 500,000
barrels a day.
	   Instead, the three countries agreed only to maintain through
1999 the reduced production they agreed to in June: Saudi Arabia
cut of 725,000 barrels a day from its baseline of 8.8 million
barrels per day, Venezuela 525,000 barrels from its 3.5 million
baseline and Mexico 200,000 from its 3.2 million baseline.
	   Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Venezuela have led an initiative for
cuts by producers that totaled 3.1 million barrels per day as of
June. Analysts and some OPEC members say an additional 1.5 million
barrels a day in reductions is needed to have an impact on prices,
which hit 12-year lows and stripped oil-dependent nations of
billions of dollars in revenues.
	   Tellez said that Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi was planning to
visit Iran in the near future to try to convince the country to
adhere to the 3.6 million barrels per day it agreed to in March.
	   ``There's certainly a problem with the Iranians,'' he said in an
interview Friday, a day after he concluded six hours of talks in
Madrid with oil and energy colleagues from Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela. But he added: ``If Iran doesn't want to comply, there's
no way to force it.''
	   Iran publicly has said it it is adhering to the 3.6 million
barrel-per-day baseline it adopted in March. But Tellez said he was
told by Iran's oil minister, Bijan Namdar Zanganey, that Tehran was
now using a baseline of 3.9 million barrels per day.
	   Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
	   Crude prices had risen Wednesday over the possibility of
airstrikes against Iraq. But news from the oil ministers meeting
Thursday, plus the growing belief that oil production from Iraq
won't be disrupted, sent prices plunging dlrs 1.35 to dlrs 11.03 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. London Brent fell dlrs
1.27 a barrel to dlrs 10.09.
	   After Madrid, Naimi headed to Norway as part of the initiative
to urge other producers to cut output until the end of the year.
Norway has already cut its production by 100,000 barrels a day.

Saddam Hussein urges Iraqis to resist US-British attacks

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday
he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in the current showdown with
U.S. and British military strikes.
	   Addressing the nation on television for the first time since the
air strikes began early Thursday, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue
your resistance and, by God's will, you will be victorious.
	   ``You are representing justice and all the great characteristics

	   Dressed in his fieldmarshal's uniform, the president spoke of
the U.S._British air strikes on Iraq that have killed at least 25
people and wounded another 75, according to Iraqi officials.
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag

Spain upbeat on Basque peace, to move some ETA prisoners closer to
</HEADLINE>
home &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government reporting ``significant contacts''
with hardline Basque nationalists &QL; 
 &UR; by DANIEL WOOLLS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government said Friday it was upbeat
about the Basque peace process three months into a ceasefire by the
separatist group ETA, and announced a concession on a long-standing
ETA demand dealing with its members behind bars.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar repeated a call for ETA to
transform its open-ended truce into a definitive one ending a
30-year pro-independence campaign that has claimed nearly 800
lives.
	   ``It is the cornerstone on which we can build the process of
normalization,'' Aznar said, reading from a statement.
	   Although ETA has yet to renounce violence, Aznar said: ``The
government is in a position to conclude that there is still the
possibility that the current situation of an open-ended ceasefire
can be consolidated.''
	   He did not elaborate or take questions from reporters.
	   But government spokesman Josep Pique disclosed later that
``significant contacts'' were at the root of Aznar's optimism.
Pique did not say if these contacts were with ETA itself or the
legal party seen as its political wing, Herri Batasuna.
	   In November Aznar said he had authorized preliminary talks with
ETA to determine whether it was prepared to renounce violence
permanently. Last week Pique said there had been official contact
with people close to ETA but insisted it was ``not significant.''
	   Pique also said that because of the new contacts, the government
will move 21 ETA inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to
their home region.
	   ETA has long demanded that the more than 500 ETA prisoners held
in Spanish jails be transferred to the Basque country itself, or at
least closer to it. The government keeps them scattered around
Spain to avoid their plotting behind bars.
	   The interior ministry said the 21 will be transferred from the
Canary Islands off the coast of West Africa, the Balearic islands
in the Mediterranean, or from Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish enclaves
on the northern coast of Morocco. They will be sent to jails in the
south of mainland Spain starting right away.
	   Since ETA started observing its ceasefire on September 18, Aznar
had been under pressure from both hard-line and moderate Basque
nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party,
to keep the peace process alive by making a significant gesture on
the prisoner issue.
	   In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners
to the Basque country itself but this was criticized as
insufficient.
	   Two mainstream Basque parties said the new transfers were not
enough either and that Aznar needed to take much bolder action to
move the region toward peace.
	   ``If Aznar thinks that taking 21 prisoners out of a group of
more than 500 and transferring them to the south of the peninsula
is pulling off something big, he does not know what country or what
problem he is dealing with,'' said the leader of one of those
parties, Carlos Garaikoetxa of Eusko Alkartasuna.
	   Aznar insists that after his offer of talks, the ball is now in
ETA's court, saying the peace process cannot advance in earnest
without a permanent end to separatist violence.
	   And even so, he and other officials have said the government is
willing to discuss prisoner transfers and other issues involving
ETA inmates, ruling out talks on ETA's stated demand of
independence.

Britain shows videos of attacks on military targets

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British jets have flown three missions against air
defenses, airfields and Republican Guard installations in Iraq
without losing any aircraft, Defense Secretary George Robertson
said Friday.
	   ``We have yet to complete our full battle damage assessment, but
initial assessment is that the raids have gone very well,''
Robertson said at a press briefing.
	   ``There is still much to do before we can be satisfied that
Saddam's capabilities to develop weapons of mass destruction has
been damaged to the extent necessary,'' he said. ``We will carry on
with military action along with the U.S. until we are satisfied
that Saddam's military machine has been suitably damaged.''
	   Journalists were shown videos taken by the attacking Tornados.
The targets seen exploding were described as a radar missile site,
a hardened aircraft shelter at the Tallil air base in southwestern
Iraq and an aircraft hangar.
	   Robertson said one objective of the attacks was to stop Iraq's
development of pilotless aircraft.
	   Britain's part in the U.S.-led air campaign is begin carried out
by 12 Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers based in Kuwait.
	   In Kuwait, a spokesman for the Royal Air Force, Group Capt.
Bryan Collins, told reporters that one Tornado had technical
difficulties Thursday night and returned to base without releasing
its bombs.
	   Those difficulties ``combined with rather heavy anti-aircraft
activity in that area limited the options that the crew had to try
to resolve the situation,'' he said.
	   Asked if bombing raids would continue after the start of
Ramadan, expected within the next several days, Collins said: ``I
believe Ramadan is of concern to our government.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair, seeking to firm up support for the
U.S.-British operation, had a round of telephone conversations with
leaders of several nations.
	   His office said they included German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak. Blair's office
said he also planned to speak to Crown Prince Abdullah, first
deputy prime minister of Saudi Arabia.
	   Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath on Friday criticized the
Iraqi bombing as having no clear purpose.
	   ``The whole setting of this enterprise has been so dubious,
especially when the president of the United States has his own
domestic problems,'' Heath said in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The military aims, Heath said, ``have not been clearly defined
at all. If you ask what is the purpose there is no answer.''

Saddam Hussein urges Iraqis to resist US-British attacks

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday
he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in the current showdown with
U.S. and British military strikes.
	   Addressing the nation on television for the first time since the
air strikes began early Thursday, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue
your resistance and, by God's will, you will be victorious.
	   ``You are representing justice and all the great characteristics
against injustice,'' Saddam said.
	   Dressed in his fieldmarshal's uniform, the president spoke of
the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq that have killed at least 25
people and wounded another 75, according to Iraqi officials.
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag
and you have proved again that you are heroic.''
	   ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the
name of God, strike them,'' he said.
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We
will not let evil triumph over virtue.''
	   The president paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air
defense troops, who have been firing anti-aircraft guns at the
cruise missiles raining on Baghdad.
	   ``Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. Shame will be their
fate, those followers of Satan and evil.''
	   He ended his five-minute speech with the words: ``Long live
great Iraq, the great Arab nation and Palestine, and doomed are our
enemies.''

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel will take all necessary measures against
Iraq should it ``dare'' to attack the Jewish state, the defense
minister said Friday.
	   The minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, was more direct in his warning
than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who on Thursday, the
first day of U.S. airstrikes against Iraq, would only say that
Israel reserved the right to defend itself.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has not threatened to attack Israel
in retaliation for the U.S. bombings, and Mordechai told Israel
radio there has been no change in the military's assessment that
chances of an Iraqi missile attack on Israel were slim.
	   However, Israel army radio quoted a military source as saying
that Iraq has Sukhoi Su-27 warplanes with enough range to reach
Israel and that Israel has mobilized all reserves in its
anti-aircraft force.
	   Israel's military intelligence analysts believe Saddam might
fire missiles at Israel only if he were desperate or facing death.
	   Mordechai said Israel would like to see the American-British
operation achieve its goals, but that Israel has ``no interest,
directly or indirectly,'' in taking part in the fighting.
	   However, Israel ``would take whatever measures are required
against anyone who would, heaven forbid, dare to hit us,''
Mordechai told the radio.
	   Fearing an Iraqi attack, the Swedish travel agency Fritidsresor
pulled 336 people out of the Red Sea resort of Eilat on Friday.
Other foreign travel companies pulled some 700 travelers out of the
city on Thursday.
	   Palestinians marched against the action in
Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank and clashed with
Israeli soldiers in Bethlehem.
	   ``Death to America, Israel and Britain,'' shouted thousands of
the marchers in Nablus.
	   They also shouted slogans against the recent Palestinian-U.S.
rapprochement. Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they
saw Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton was greeted rapturously _ several hundred
marchers shouted ``Death to Clinton.''
	   Protesters threw bottles and stones at Israeli soldiers
stationed at the city's border with Jerusalem. The troops responded
with rubber bullets and tear gas, slightly injuring 15
Palestinians.
	   During the 1991 Gulf war, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel.
Giving in to American pressure, Israel did not retaliate against
Iraq. The United States was concerned that an Israeli counterstrike
would threaten the stability of an Arab coalition backing the 1991
assault on Iraq.
	   Dan Shomron, who was Israel's armed forces chief of staff during
the Gulf War, played down the possibility of Iraqi missiles falling
on Israel now. He said Iraq would have to assemble launchers in its
western desert area, closest to Israel, and he doubted whether Iraq
had the ability now.
	   Mordechai said American-made Patriot anti-missile batteries have
been deployed as a precaution. He said the plan was to deploy the
batteries as soon as there was an American strike against Iraq. He
said more American equipment is on the way here.
	   The commander of Israel's anti-aircraft units, Brig. Gen. Ariel
Fishben, said improvements have been made in the Patriot system
since the Gulf War, when its success in bringing down incoming
Iraqi Scud missiles was limited.
	   The Israeli military recommended that Israelis check their gas
masks, renew outdated models, stock up on plastic sheeting and tape
to seal off a room in their houses, if necessary. In 1991, Israelis
spent many hours in sealed rooms, wearing gas masks, during the
Iraqi missile attacks.
	   About 25,000 Israelis have traded in their old gas masks for new
ones after the army opened 65 distribution centers around the
country Thursday, the army said. Israel radio reported that 83
percent of Israelis have gas masks.
	   Protective kits distributed to Israeli citizens include gas
masks, automatic atropine needle injectors to counter nerve gas and
powder to treat chemical burns. There are special tents for infants
and gas masks with plastic extensions for men with beards.

Slovenia adopts dlrs 4.3 billion budget for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia's parliament on Friday
adopted a budget for 1999, which at 960 billion Slovene tolars
(dlrs 4.3 billion), is four percent higher than the previous year.
	   The government predicts inflation will be about 6 percent and
gross domestic product should grow a real 4 percent.
	   The budget envisages revenues of 930.3 billion tolars and a
deficit of 29.7 billion tolars (dlrs 186 million), which the
government plans to cover by selling shares in some of the
state-own properties, like the oil company Petrol.
	   This was the first time since 1990, a year before the country
declared independence from the old Yugoslav federation, that the
budget was adopted in time. In previous years, the debate has been
delayed for up to six months, due to internal political quarrels.

Man charged with killing East German guard refuses to testify
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A man accused of shooting an East German border
guard while rescuing his family from communist East Germany in 1962
refused to testify at his trial Friday because he has lost faith in
the justice system, his lawyer said.
	   Rudolf Mueller, 67, is charged with murder in the shooting of a
20-year-old Reinhold Huhn just before his family's daring escape
through a tunnel under the Berlin Wall.
	   At the second session of his trial, which began Monday,
Mueller's lawyer said his client would refuse comment because
mitigating circumstances, including the political situation and the
fact that East German guards had shoot-to-kill orders, were not
being considered by the court.
	   Mueller had fled to West Berlin shortly before the Wall was
built in 1961, then dug a tunnel under it as part of his plan to go
back and bring his family out.
	   According to documents read in court, Mueller admitted during
pretrial questioning by prosecutors that he shot Huhn once after
Huhn raised his weapon and ordered him to stop.
	   Mueller, his wife, two sons and sister-in-law then escaped
through the 22-meter (72 foot) tunnel.
	   After reaching the West, Mueller turned in his weapon. He also
claimed that western intelligence agents hinted to him it would be
wise to keep quiet about the shooting, according to the documents.
	   West Berlin officials maintained at the time that Huhn had been
shot by a fellow East German guard trying to prevent the June 18,
1962, escape.
	   They refused to turn Mueller over to East Germany, which wanted
to try him for murder. But Berlin prosecutors reopened the case
after unification in 1990, based on new evidence unearthed in East
German secret police files.
	   Mueller's case has attracted wide attention as the first
Westerner to be tried since unification for killing an East German
border guard during an escape.
	   Hundreds of former East German border guards and officials have
been convicted on charges related to shooting those trying to flee
to the West. Nearly 1,000 people were killed trying to cross into
West Germany, according to the latest official count.
	   Mueller is free on 100,000 marks (dlrs 60,000) bail. The trial
continues Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Lasse Kjus bruised Austria's
pride for a second time in seven days as he overpowered the ``Power
Team'' in the Austrians' favorite discipline of Alpine skiing, the
downhill.
	   The 27-year-old Norwegian, a former World Cup and Olympic
champion, beat Werner Franz and Hermann Maier by a wide margin in
Friday's speed race at Val Gardena for his his second World Cup
downhill victory this season.
	   The Austrians, who looked almost unbeatable in the initial World
Cup stages as they captured super-G, giant slalom and slalom races,
were winless in the event Austrian skiers and fans care most.
	   Kjus' consecutive downhill triumph vaulted the Norwegian skier
atop the World Cup overall standings, with 413 points, ahead of
Austrian Stephan Eberharter who was a distant 16th in the race.
	   Eberharter slipped to second place with 383 points. Maier
strangthened his fourth place pocketing 60 points and piling up a
total of 340 after nine races.
	   Kjus, a 1994 Olympic champion in the combined, World Cup overall
champion in 1996 and a silver medalist in the Olympic downhill at
Nagano this year, had a faultless run down the icy Saslong course
as he clocked an unbeatable time of two minutes, 2.18 seconds over
the 3,495-meter distance.
	   ``My time today was amazing,'' said Kjus, who was the only skier
to go below 2:03.
	   It was the eighth World Cup career win _ the fourth in downhill
_ for Kjus, who had captured the first speed race of the season at
Val D'Isere, France, last Saturday.
	   Franz finished 0.91 seconds behind the winner.
	   Maier, the defending World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by 1.10
seconds.
	   Maier, nicknamed the ``Herminator,'' said he suffered from the
too many jumps.
	   ``I also made lots of mistakes at the bumps. Today's third place
is like a victory for me, because I lacked experience for doing any
better,'' he said.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion,
placed fourth ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Other top finishers included Austrian Andreas Schifferer (6th),
Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn (7th) and Hans Kanuss and Pietro Vitalini,
who were tied for eighth place, 2.02 seconds behind the winner.
	   Canada's Brian Stemmle was the top north American finisher in
10th place.
	   Audun Groenvold, a former ski jumper who's doing increasingly
well in Alpine skiing, placed 11th to complete the bright day for
the Norwegian colors.
	   The race was marred by three bad spills.
	   Young American downhiller Ehlias Louis, 23, of Park City, torn
the cruciate ligament of his left knee in a high-speed fall and was
declared out for the rest of the season, which includes the World
Championships in Vail, Colo., in February.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line, escaped
unhurt and still placed 13th in a tie with Austrian Hannes Trinkl.
	   French late starter David Pretot crashed against safety fences
in the upper part of the course and was taken away on a toboggan.
	   Organizers said Pretot possibly twisted his right knee.
	   Kjus, an all-around skier who can pocket World Cup points in all
disciplines of Alpine skiing, said he won a grueling race ``on an
icy track, with a lot of big jumps.''
	   ``I was a bit scared before the start. I had a lot of respect
for the course and this helped me to stay concentrated throughout,'
Kajus added.
	   ``It was a good day for me. I made no mistakes and I won by a
big margin. I hope I can ski as well tomorrow ... but others have
the capacity to fight back,'' the winner said.
	   Friday's race was the first of back-to-back downhills in this
north Italian valley. It made up for the season opener in Whistler
Mountain, Canada, canceled by bad weather earlier this month.
	   The original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the season, is
scheduled for Saturday.

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ About 70 people protesting the
airstrikes on Iraq threw stones, shoes and a bicycle at the U.S.
Embassy on Friday, breaking two of the downtown building's windows.
	   Two people were arrested in the melee, which started when the
group broke away from a rally of about 300 people and rushed toward
the embassy.
	   Police spokesman Flemming Steen Munch said the rally was
organized by a local Iraqi cultural association. One man was
arrested after throwing a cobblestone and another was arrested as
he carried a stone, Munch said.
	   Several of the demonstrators threw their own shoes at the
embassy, he said.

Russia's chief soccer coach dismissed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The head coach of Russia's soccer team was fired
Friday over Russia's embarrassing loss to Iceland in European
Championship qualifiers in October, news reports said.
	   Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet soccer team to a gold
medal in the 1988 Olympics, was named as Russia's chief coach in
July.
	   On Friday, the Russian Soccer Union board voted 14-0 to dismiss
him, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. His contract was to have
run until after the 2002 World Cup.
	   He was sacked ``in connection with the unsatisfactory
performances by (the Russian team) in qualifying games for the
European Championship,'' the Interfax news agency reported, citing
the soccer union.
	   Russia suffered a demoralizing loss to Iceland in a qualifier
for the 2000 European Championship. The Russian soccer team has not
qualified for the World Cup since 1990 or any major tournament
since the 1992 European Championship.
	   No replacement for Byshovets was named.
	   Byshovets was one of the Soviet Union's best soccer players in
the late 1960s and early 1970s. From 1963-73 he was a forward for
the Dinamo Kiev team.
	   He scored four goals in four matches at the 1970 World Cup, and
was named the tournament's fourth-best forward.
	   Russia's soccer union has been plagued by corruption, power
struggles and violence in recent years.

Saddam Hussein urges Iraqis to resist US-British attacks

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday
he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in his showdown with the
United States and Britain over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Addressing his country on television for the first time since
the U.S.-British airstrikes began early Thursday, Saddam told
Iraqis: ``Continue your resistance and, by God's will, you will be
victorious.
	   ``You are representing justice and all the great characteristics
against injustice,'' Saddam said.
	   Dressed in his fieldmarshal's uniform, the president spoke of
the strikes on Iraq that have killed at least 25 people and wounded
another 75, according to Iraqi officials.
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag
and you have proved again that you are heroic.''
	   ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the
name of God, strike them,'' he said.
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We
will not let evil triumph over virtue.''
	   The president paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air
defense troops, who have been firing anti-aircraft guns at the
cruise missiles raining on Baghdad.
	   ``Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. Shame will be their
fate, those followers of Satan and evil.''
	   He ended his five-minute speech with the words: ``Long live
great Iraq, the great Arab nation and Palestine, and doomed are our
enemies.''
	   The United States and Britain are trying to compel Iraq to
comply fully with U.N. resolutions requiring that Iraq submit to
inspections that verify that it has ended any attempts to build
weapons of mass destruction.

	   BEIT DOUKU, West Bank (AP) _ Anxious to avoid the image that
earned the Palestinians pariah status during the Gulf War,
authorities moved quickly Friday to contain anti-U.S.
demonstrations and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi
sentiments.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers
chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to America,
Death to Clinton, Death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity poles
during the Clinton visit.
	   Protesters found a few leftover plastic U.S. flags, and wrapped
them around their shoes in a sign of contempt.
	   Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press writer
for photographing the burning of a U.S. flag, and released him on
condition that he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.
	   The Palestinian leadership is anxious to curb the unmitigated
backing Palestinians gave Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _
stance that set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   Clinton's visit earlier this week _ to salvage peace accords
with Israel _ was seen as tantamount to recognition of Palestinian
aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are anxious to
cultivate the new friendship.
	   The Palestinian Authority has issued a careful statement
regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction
capability.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down two TV stations and a radio station in
Ramallah and three TV stations in Bethlehem.
	   There was no official explanation for the shutdown, but the TV
stations had broadcast footage of the pro-Iraq demonstrations,
pro-Iraqi interviews and nationalist music. The Voice of Peace and
Love had devoted its broadcasts on Thursday to a popular
nationalist Iraqi singer.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they saw
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Beit Douku, a village near Ramallah, over a thousand people
joined the funeral procession for a youth killed by Israeli troops
during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday.
	   Mohammed Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a
green sheet.
	   ``With body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' they chanted.
``With body and soul, we will redeem you, Iraq!''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and set the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   After two days of attacks, President Saddam Hussein called on
the Iraqi people in a television address to resist the American and
British onslaught and said his government would not ``compromise or
kneel.''
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag

	   ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the

kneel in the face of injustice. We will not let evil triumph over
virtue.''
	   Dozens of sites, including the headquarters of the military
intelligence and security police and factories that were monitored
by U.N. weapons inspectors, have been hit in the missile attacks,
Iraqi officials said.
	   As a new day dawned Friday, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   Iraqi newspapers Friday called on people to rally behind Saddam.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' the Babil newspaper said in large
red letters above the name of the newspaper.

	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand
sailed aloft Friday looking to guide their 200-foot-high (61-meter)
balloon on a landmark round-the-world voyage.
	   Good weather, a good wind and a cloudless sky augured well for
the travelers in their quest to become the first to circle the
globe in a balloon.
	   Some seven hours after liftoff at a Moroccan airforce base, the
12-ton ICO Global Challenge was cruising at 29,000 feet (8,840
meters) over the Atlas mountains, according to Jackie McQuillan,
spokeswoman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone company supporting
the trip.
	   ``They are very happy with how it's going so far, and nothing
has happened to make them think it won't be a successful flight,''
she said.
	   The balloon was expected to cross into eastern Algeria sometime
before dawn Saturday, she said.
	   Some 500 people, including Moroccan musicians and Berber
horsemen, gathered for the 0922 GMT liftoff, which went without a
hitch after a two-hour delay.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said shortly before liftoff. ``After that we can start to
relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip, estimating it could last from
eight days to nearly three weeks.
	   The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task,
Branson said.
	   ``This flight around the world would have taken 9 and a half
days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told reporters.
	   ``Now, we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 days.''
	   The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds to
take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over
Saudi Arabia.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   ``I am nervous at the launch of all balloon flights,'' Fossett
said ahead of the liftoff. ``Once we get to altitude and we know
what our problems are, if any, then it will be very relaxed.''
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   ICO Global spokesman Mike Johnson said the crew was more
confident this time because of the better technology used to build
the balloon, including a Kevlar canopy over the crew's pressurized
capsule. Kevlar is used for bulletproof vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Protesters through much of the Arab world
shouted slogans Friday against the United States over its strikes
on Iraq, urging attacks on America and labeling U.S. President Bill
Clinton a ``terrorist.''
	   Arab leaders and newspapers also harshly criticized the American
missile attacks, saying they would do more harm to the Iraqi people
than the regime of President Saddam Hussein.
	   Syrian Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Qaddoura said the U.S.
strikes ``increased the suffering and pain'' of the 22 million
Iraqis.
	   ``We ... condemn and denounce this attack and call on the
international community to condemn and halt it immediately,'' he
said in a speech to the Parliament.
	   The mood on the Arab street was uglier. The angry shouts were
tinged with threats against American interests and cast the U.S.
air strikes as a war on Muslims.
	   Among the thousands of demonstrators, many condemned the attacks
as an attempt by Clinton to save himself from impeachment over
charges that he improperly tried to cover up his affair with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read a sign
waved during a protest at Cairo's Al-Azhar University mosque, one
of the main centers of scholarship in the Muslim world.
	   Criticism of the United States was repeated in sermons at Friday
Muslim prayers and protests in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, the United
Arab Emirates, Syria and the Palestinian territories as well as in
non-Arab Iran.
	   In Cairo, hundreds of worshipers gathered at the Al-Azhar mosque
to shout demands for Arabs to defend Iraq against the American
onslaught.
	   ``Leaders of the country, let us go to holy war,'' the
protesters chanted.
	   Sheik Mohammed Tantawi, head of Al-Azhar, urged solidarity with
Iraqis in his sermon. ``Stand by the Iraqi people, or we will be
hit by God's damnation,'' he preached.
	   Inside the mosque, one protester, Mohammed Abdrabbo, 27,
shouted, ``Attack American interests. Close the American Embassy.''
Others questioned Clinton's motive for the repeated missile strikes
on Iraq.
	   ``Iraq is suffering because of an American whore and a big baby
boy,'' said Mohammed Hassan, 20, a medical student.
	   In countries closely allied to the United States _ such as Egypt
and Jordan _ authorities brought out massive security forces to
prevent demonstrations from turning violent.
	   About 300 police ringed no more than 40 protesters at a mosque
near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. In Jordan, about 500 police
surrounded an equal number of demonstrators in Amman, and police
dispersed thousands of demonstrators in Irbid, 90 kilometers (55
miles) north of the capital.
	   At Amman's University of Jordan mosque, the protesters called
for an Arab revolt against the United States.
	   ``Saddam ... if you want commandos, we are ready'' and ``Syria,
Jordan, Iraq _ revolt and make Clinton go to hell'' were among
slogans chanted.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem _ where Clinton was greeted
enthusiastically just days ago _ hundreds of protesters chanted
``Death to Clinton.''
	   About 15,000 Muslims marched through the Yemeni capital of
San`a, and 2,500 people _ mostly students _ held a sit-in outside a
U.N. office in Lebanon's capital Beirut. Demonstrators in the
southern Lebanese city of Sidon shouted ``America is the enemy of
God'' and ``Clinton is the terrorist of the century.''
	   The leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir condemned the attacks in a
commentary by its editor-publisher, saying they would only increase
Saddam's power, giving him ``a new lease on life.''
	   In the past two days of attacks, the U.S. and British strikes
also have been criticized by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates,
Lebanon and the 52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference,
the world's largest Muslim group.
	   The main exception to a united Arab front was Kuwait, whose
invasion by Iraq in 1990 led to the Gulf War. Foreign Minister
Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah told the daily Al-Rai Al-Amm the
current crisis was strictly between Iraqi and the United Nations.
	   ``We have nothing to do with it whatsoever,'' he was quoted as
saying.
	   Fouad al-Hashem, columnist for Al-Watan daily in Kuwait, wrote
that he hoped the bodies of Saddam, his sons and wife and ``will be
hanging naked from street lights all over Baghdad'' by the time the
U.S. attacks end.

Miners' leader detained by police

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Police briefly detained Friday an
influential leader of Romania's miners, who has led his men on
violent rampages though the capital twice in the last decade.
	   Earlier this year, a court banned union leader Miron Cozma from
the capital for two years, after he was found guilty of disturbing
public order during the miners' unrest in 1991, when at least three
people were killed and a prime minister was forced to resign.
	   Cozma has appealed the decision. He was detained Friday while
entering the industry ministry, where he and a group of miners were
to meet the minister to discuss possible mine closures.
	   The talks were canceled and police later released Cozma, said
Col. Secrieru of the Bucharest police.
	   Also Friday, some 500 coal miners in western Romania's Jiu
Valley, where Cozma is union leader, went on strike for a second
day to protest feared job cuts.
	   On Thursday, Industry Minister Radu Berceanu announced the
government will close 29 unprofitable mines as part of its market
reforms in the coming months. The move will leave some 3,000 miners
without jobs, but save the state some 30 percent in losses.
	   According to Berceanu, in 1998 the mining industry cost the
state 901 billion lei (dlrs 86 million) in unpaid debts.
	   In an unprecedented way of social protection, Berceanu also said
the government will give the closed mines to former employees who
are interested in starting their own business.
	   Last year the government also laid off tens of thousands of
miners, with up to 20 months' salaries in severance pay. Miners
earn above Romania's monthly average of dls 120.

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A politician who called President Yoweri
Museveni corrupt and a dictator was charged with sedition in a
magistrate's court Friday.
	   A newspaper editor was charged with spreading sectarianism for
publishing a story that claimed the government had distributed guns
to nomadic herders in western Uganda to defend against cattle
rustlers.
	   Both Chapaa Karuhanga, founder of the National Democratic Forum,
and George Lugalambi, editor of the tri-weekly Crusader, pleaded
innocent to the charges and were released on bail.
	   Both men were arrested Thursday.
	   The charge of sedition carries a maximum penalty of seven years
in prison upon conviction.
	   The maximum penalty for sectarianism was not immediately
available.
	   Karuhanga, 45, was arrested after telling a party rally and the
newspaper that Museveni was worse than his predecessors, Milton
Obote and Idi Amin Dada.
	   ``Amin and Obote were dictators, but Museveni is both a dictator
and corrupt,'' Karuhanga was quoted as telling the tri-weekly
Crusader newspaper last week.
	   Obote, now in exile in Zambia, was president from 1963 until his
overthrow by Amin in 1971. He was president again from 1981 to
1985.
	   Amin ruled Uganda from 1971 until he was ousted by combined
Ugandan-Tanzanian forces in 1979. During his eight years in power,
at least 400,000 people were killed by his security police.
	   Museveni fought a successful five-year guerrilla war against
Obote's government and has ruled Uganda since 1986. He was elected
president in May 1996.
	   After coming to power, Museveni and his National Resistance
Movement suspended the election-related activities of political
parties and refused to recognize any parties formed after 1986.
	   Parties formed before 1986 can exist, but they cannot hold
rallies or carry out political activities.
	   Several members of Museveni's government, including his brother,
Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, who was his special military adviser, have
been forced to resign following publication of a parliamentary
report on high-level corruption.
	   The Crusader story quoted several people expressing alarm over
the arming of the Hima herders, who are closely related to
Museveni's Nkore tribe, because it might lead to armed violence
like that in Somalia.
	   Lugalambi was instructed to give up his passport to police and
to report to them every two weeks.
	   Police raided the offices of the Crusader Thursday, arrested
Lugalambi and reporter Meddie Musisi and seized files and
administrative documents.
	   It was not clear whether Musisi was also charged or had been
released.

	   NAPLES, Italy (AP) _ Masked youths attacked the Naples soccer
team bus Friday at a highway tollbooth, smashing the windshield
with an iron beam. None of the players or officials on board was
injured.
	   Napoli, demoted this season to Serie B, was on its way to Lecce
to prepare for a match there Sunday.
	   Witnesses told police that the hooligans ran in front of the
bus, forcing it to stop, just after the driver had begun to pull
away after paying the toll. The attackers pelted the bus with
stones and then hurled the beam through the windshield, the Italian
news agaency ANSA reported.
	   The attackers fled in two cars, witnesses said. After
transferring to another bus, the team continued on its way to
Lecce, in southeast Italy.
	   Napoli has been heavily booed by its fans lately. Demoted from
Serie A at the end of the last season, with its proud days in the
1980s with Argentine star Diego Maradona a distant memory, the team
so far has a record of four wins, seven losses and three ties.

Swiss fund starts payments to Jewish victims of Holocaust in

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Swiss fund helping needy Holocaust
survivors have begun distributing aid payments to Ukrainian Jews
who suffered from Nazi persecution during World War II.
	   The president of the Swiss Fund for Needy Victims of the
Holocaust, Rolf Bloch, attended a ceremony in Kiev on Friday
marking the start of payments to about 3,200 Ukrainian Jews who are
eligible for the aid. The first payments of dlrs 400 each were
given out last month.
	   ``We are very happy to demonstrate our solidarity, friendship
and understanding for these people who had to go through such
terrible hardships,'' Bloch told a news conference after the payout
ceremony.
	   The Holocaust fund was set up in March 1997 by Swiss banks and
industry following a scandal over assets left behind by people
killed by the Nazis.
	   The aim of the 273-million-Swiss-franc (dlrs 190 million) fund
is to help aging Holocaust victims, mainly those who also were
persecuted in the decades after World War II under communist rule
in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
	   Ukraine suffered heavily under the Nazi occupation, losing a
quarter of its population. In addition, hundreds of thousands of
Ukrainians were sent to concentration camps and became Hitler's
main source of forced labor for building his empire.
	   The Swiss fund has given out payments in Ukraine to the first of
about 9,000 non-Jewish Holocaust survivors, mostly Gypsies, who,
like Jews, were among the ethnic groups that suffered the worst
from Nazi persecution.
	   The money is deposited in Ukraine's Privat Bank and can
immediately be obtained upon request in any of its 200 branches
throughout the country, according to bank officials.
	   A total of 6.8 million Swiss francs (dlrs 4.7 million) of the
fund's money has already been paid out to more than 4,500 Holocaust
survivors in the Baltic states, Belarus, the Czech Republic,
Albania and other countries, the fund said.
	   Bloch said the fund's board had to adjust aid distribution
guidelines to divide its resources among the largest possible
number of Holocaust victims. Under the latest criteria, the money
is to be paid primarily to former prisoners of concentration camps
who are 73 or older.
	   ``The exact number of people who need our aid is still unknown,
and we don't want to end up in a situation when there would be
people left without our support,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday
he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in the current showdown with
U.S. and British military strikes.
	   Addressing the nation on television for the first time since the
air strikes began early Thursday, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue
your resistance and, by God's will, you will be victorious.
	   ``You are representing justice and all the great characteristics
against injustice,'' Saddam said.
	   Dressed in his fieldmarshal's uniform, the president spoke of
the U.S._British air strikes on Iraq that have killed at least 25
people and wounded another 75, according to Iraqi officials.
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag
and you have proved again that you are heroic.''
	   ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the
name of God, strike them,'' he said.
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We
will not let evil triumph over virtue.''
	   The president paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air
defense troops, who have firing anti-aircraft guns at the cruise
missiles flying in to explode in Baghdad.
	   The air defense forces were ``Iraq's high wall in the face of
barbarism,'' Saddam said.
	   ``Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. Shame will be their
fate, those followers of Satan and evil.''
	   He ended his five-minute speech with the words: ``Long live
great Iraq, the great Arab nation and Palestine, and doomed are our
enemies.''
	   Shortly after the speech, the Iraqi General Command issued a
statement saying that since the attacks began, the air defense
forces had shot down 77 cruise missiles.
	   In the first military statement on the strikes, the general
command said the U.S. missiles had targeted military units,
communications centers, Trade Ministry warehouses and residential
areas.
	   The United States and Britain have launched the attacks to
retaliate for Iraq's alleged obstruction of U.N. inspectors seeking
to verify that Baghdad has eliminated its long-range missiles and
weapons of mass destruction.

Ducasse opens eatery featuring world cuisine and California wines

	   PARIS (AP) _ Alain Ducasse, the chef who dominates French haute
cuisine with a record six Michelin stars, is bringing pancakes,
donuts and the American-style salad bar to Paris.
	   His new ``Spoon, Food and Wine,'' which opened Thursday on the
posh Avenue Marignan behind the Champs-Elysees, is serving up what
he calls ``world fare,'' and it has a decidedly American accent.
	   Besides spare ribs and pastrami sandwiches, there's yogurt
sorbet and lemon chiffon pie and many other American staples with
Ducasse's signature light touch.
	   ``I've traveled a lot, and learned about new foods and cooking
techniques which I adore,'' Ducasse said. ``I wanted to put them
together on a single menu.''
	   Paris has no shortage of American-style restaurants, but none is
run by a notable gourmet chef.
	   Ducasse, 42 and the youngest chef ever to earn the coveted
three-star rating from the Michelin guide, is best-known for his
light, Mediterranean-style cuisine made from the freshest
ingredients blended in innovative ways.
	   At this airy, ultra-modern eatery in the heart of a chic
shopping area, diners also choose from seviche from South America
and pork ravioli dumplings from Asia.
	   Purists may wince at Ducasse's wine list: of the 120 vintages
offered, only 10 are French _ and 60 come from California.
	   Diners don't have to stand up to fill their own salad bowls, but
they choose what they want from a list of salad greens, dressings
and assorted condiments.
	   In a country where culinary tradition dies hard, the accent on
customer creativity is something of a revolution.
	   Until now, that's been the chef's preserve, while ``make
your-own'' dishes languish in low-end French restaurants catering
to tourists.
	   An average meal at ``Spoon, Food and Wine'' runs between 200-300
francs (dlrs 36-54) _ moderate by Paris standards, and downright
cheap compared to 1,000-franc cost (dlrs 182) of a gourmet meal at
Ducasse's posh Monte Carlo and Paris establishments.
	   Customers also choose how they want their food prepared: pan
fried in a wok, steamed, roasted or broiled. Three courses are not
``de rigueur.''
	   ``It's a new concept for the French, and it corresponds to what
Paris needs now,'' hostess Rosa Kim said in a telephone interview.

U.N. refugee agency: ready to help, but no one yet fleeing Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The U.N. refugee agency said Friday it is ready to
help people fleeing the U.S. and British bombing in Iraq, but that
so far no one had been crossing into neighboring countries.
	   ``We have no reports of refugee movements out of Iraq,'' said
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
	   Janowski told reporters that UNHCR has offices in each adjacent
country as well as staff in Baghdad and in northern Iraqi areas
controlled by Kurds.
	   They all are watching to see if help is needed and have stocks
of food ready, he said, but added that it is by no means certain
that anyone will try to flee Iraq.

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Norway's Lasse Kjus bruised Austria's
pride for a second time in a week Friday, overpowering the ``Power
Team'' to win a men's World Cup downhill.
	   The 27-year-old Kjus, a former World Cup and Olympic champion,
beat Werner Franz by nearly a full second and Hermann Maier by more
than a second for his second World Cup downhill victory this
season.
	   The Austrians, who looked almost unbeatable early in the season
with victories in super-giant slalom, giant slalom and slalom
races, remain winless in the event their countrymen care about
most.
	   Kjus' consecutive downhill triumphs vaulted him atop the World
Cup overall standings, with 413 points, ahead of Austrian Stephan
Eberharter, who was a distant 16th Friday.
	   Eberharter slipped to second place with 383 points. Maier
strangthened his hold on fourth place, earning 60 points for a
total of 340 after nine events.
	   Kjus, 1996 World Cup overall champion, 1994 Olympic Alpine
combined titlist and 1998 Olympic downhill silver medalis, skied a
faultless run down the icy Saslong course for a time of 2 minutes,
2.18 seconds over the 3,495-meter course.
	   ``My time today was amazing,'' said Kjus, the only skier to
break 123 seconds.
	   It was the eighth career World Cup victory _ the fourth in
downhill _ for Kjus, who won last Saturday's downhill at Val
D'Isere, France.
	   Franz finished second, 0.91 seconds behind Kjus.
	   Maier, the defending overall World Cup champion, trailed Kjus by
1.10 seconds in third.
	   Maier said he faltered on the many jumps.
	   ``I also made lots of mistakes at the bumps. Today's third place
is like a victory for me, because I lacked experience for doing any
better,'' he said.
	   Italy's Kristian Ghedina, the defending Val Gardena champion,
placed fourth in 2:03.41 ahead of Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt.
	   Other top finishers included Austrian Andreas Schifferer
(sixth), Sweden's Patrik Jaerbyn (seventh) and Hans Kanuss of
Austria and Pietro Vitalini of Italy, who tied for eighth place
2.02 seconds back of Kjus.
	   Canada's Brian Stemmle completed the top 10 in 2:04.43.
	   Audun Groenvold, a former ski jumper who has made the jump to
Alpine, finished 11th to complete a bright day for Norwegian
colors.
	   The race was marred by three bad spills.
	   American 23-year-old Ehlias Louis tore a ligament in his left
knee in a high-speed fall and will miss the rest of the season,
including the World Championships in Vail, Colorado, in February.
	   Norway's Lasse Paulsen crashed through the finish line, escaped
unhurt and finished 13th in a tie with Austrian Hannes Trinkl.
	   Late French starter David Pretot crashed against safety fences
in the upper part of the course and was taken away on a sled.
	   Organizers said Pretot possibly twisted his right knee.
	   Kjus, a skier who competes in all four disciplines, said his
victory was difficult ``on an icy track, with a lot of big jumps.''
	   ``I was a bit scared before the start. I had a lot of respect
for the course and this helped me to stay concentrated throughout.
	   ``It was a good day for me. I made no mistakes and I won by a
big margin. I hope I can ski as well tomorrow ... but others have
the capacity to fight back.''
	   Friday's race was the first of consecutive downhills in this
north Italian valley. It compensated for the lost season opener in
Whistler Mountain, Canada, canceled by bad weather earlier this
month.
	   The original Val Gardena downhill, the third of the season, is
scheduled for Saturday.

Germany calls for political solution in Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany voiced regret Friday about U.S.-led
airstrikes on Iraq and urged a return to diplomatic efforts to make
Saddam Hussein cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Joschka Fischer called for a quick end to the attacks, which he
said had ``placed extreme stress'' on the international community
and the United Nations, which was sidelined in the crisis.
	   ``The German government deeply regrets that military measures
became necessary,'' Fischer told an emergency meeting of
parliament's foreign affairs committee.
	   ``This is coupled with the hope that Iraq will be reasonable and
that efforts for a political solution will quickly resume.''
	   He repeated Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's stand that Saddam
alone was to blame for the airstrikes because of his refusal to
come clean with the weapons inspectors.
	   Fischer is a leader of the Greens, a party with a pacifist
tradition that is in the center-left government elected in
September.

Swedish bid official says Salt Lake should pay losing cities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Salt Lake City should be ordered to pay dlrs 14
million in compensation to its competitors for having ``cheated''
in the race for the 2002 Winter Olympics, the leader of a rival bid
said Friday.
	   Christer Persson, who led the 2002 bid from Ostersund, Sweden,
said Salt Lake should reimburse the three losing cities for the
millions they spent on their failed campaigns.
	   Comparing the case to Ben Johnson's drug scandal at the 1988
Olympics, Persson said it was impractical to strip Salt Lake of the
games but that financial sanctions should be imposed.
	   ``When Ben Johnson fooled the others in Seoul, he lost his gold
medal,'' Persson told The Associated Press in a telephone
interview. ``This time, when we were cheated by a competitor, they
will keep the gold medal due to practical reasons.
	   ``I think it would be appropriate that they compensate their
competitors for the loss of money which we spent in vain. That is
about dlrs 14 million altogether.''
	   Persson said Ostersund spent dlrs 2 million on the bid, while
Quebec City spent dlrs 8 million and Sion, Switzerland, dlrs 4
million.
	   Salt Lake City won the 1995 election in a landslide, getting 54
votes on the first ballot. Sion and Ostersund each got 14 votes,
while Quebec City received seven.
	   Salt Lake is currently under investigation by a high-level
International Olympic Committee panel over a scholarship fund
operated by the bid group which landed the games.
	   The program provided nearly nearly dlrs 400,000 in aid to 13
people, including six relatives of IOC members.
	   The case has snowballed into the biggest corruption scandal in
the IOC's 104-year history.
	   Persson described Salt Lake as ``the best bid city for a winter
games in Olympic history.'' But he said the scholarship fund could
have affected the outcome of the vote.
	   ``The question can always remain whether Salt Lake City would
have won in any case,'' Persson said. ``Anything can happen in the
voting rounds. If you lose 13 votes to another city, the other will
have 26 more. You never know what can happen.''
	   Persson said he never suspected any wrongdoing by Salt Lake City
or the other cities during the bid.
	   ``I have no reason to think anything else,'' he said. ``I was
naive like most Swedes. We consider people honest until the
opposite has been proved.''
	   Persson said he also was unaware of any unscrupulous agents
operating during the bid. Swiss IOC executive board member Marc
Hodler alleged last weekend that bidding cities have been the
victim of crooked agents who promise to secure IOC votes for
payoffs.
	   ``This makes me think that maybe that was the reason for Salt
Lake City to enter this type of agreement,'' Persson said. ``If
they were approached by somebody who said, `If you don't take our
offer, we will go to somebody else and that would be the difference
of 26 votes.' They might have been afraid of not taking that
offer.''
	   Persson said he supported calls for changing the selection
process for Olympic host cities by taking the decision away from
the full IOC assembly and putting it in the hands of the executive
board or other small group.
	   ``I think it would be an excellent idea for all bidding
cities,'' Persson said. ``For 2002, there was an enormous spread in
the amount spent by the cities, from dlrs 2 million to dlrs 14
million. The new system would be much less costly and be an
advantage for smaller countries.''
	   Persson, currently doing research on international marketing at
Sweden's University of Lulea, said he would offer the following
advice to any Olympic bidding cities:
	   ``Carefully consider the competitors: Do you expect them to be
fair or not?''

Miners' protest grows; steel workers demonstrate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An underground sit-in by coal miners
protesting changes in pension privileges spread to 15 more mines
Friday, while a few hundred steel workers demonstrated in Warsaw
for similar privileges.
	   A total of 48 coal mines in the Silesia region of southern
Poland had joined the protest by Friday afternoon, the PAP state
news agency reported. The total number of miners involved was at
least 340, according to PAP.
	   Parliament has approved changing retirement rules by setting age
limits of 65 for men and 60 for women. Under the current formula,
miners and others working in dangerous conditions could retire with
full pensions after 25 years of work, no matter their age.
	   Government officials say miners still would be able to retire
early with full pensions until 2006 and workers who become 50 or
older this year will keep their existing pension privileges.
	   But unions representing coal miners insist on the current system
remaining unchanged. They plan a two-hour warning strike Monday,
which will allow miners to hold a vote on a possible general
strike.
	   Meanwhile, several hundred steel workers demonstrated in Warsaw
to demand benefit packages similar to those for miners under a
restructuring plan for the industry.
	   The restructuring plan for the mining sector, which eventually
will cut jobs by more than 40 percent, pays severance packages of
about 40,000 zlotys (dlrs 11,430). The average monthly salary in
Poland is dlrs 350.
	   A similar restructuring plan for the steel industry also would
cut jobs almost in half and privatize the sector over the next two
years.
	   Coal mining and the steel industry, once the country's leading
sectors during communist times, are still heavily subsidized and
unable to compete in international markets under Poland's market
reforms that began in 1990.
	   Restructuring loss-making industries such as mining, steel and
transportation is part of Poland's strategy to reform its economy
after decades of communist rule and prepare for membership in the
European Union.

American skier tears knee ligament in spill
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with condition of French skier &QL; 
 &UR; With Val Gardena-Men-World Cup Downhill &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ American downhiller Ehlias Louis was
declared out for the rest of the ski season with a tore cruciate
knee ligament following a spill during Friday's World Cup downhill
race in this north Italian valley.
	   Frenchman David Pretot also tore a knee ligament and suffered a
slight concussion when he fell in the upper section of the downhill
course shortly before the American.
	   Louis, 23, from Park City, Utah, was taken to the nearby
hospital of Bressanone (Brixen) for treatment.
	   Pretot, 29, from Megeve, injured his right knee and was
hospitalized in Bolzano (Bozen).
	   Italian organizers said the American skier, a late starter with
No. 43 bib, tore the left knee ligament following a high speed fall
on the icy Saslong track.
	   The injury will prevent the young American from competing in the
1999 World Championships, scheduled in Vail, Colo., in February.
	   In the most spectacular fall of the day, Norway's Lasse Paulsen
crashed through the finish line but still placed 13th, unhurt.
	   Canadian Ed Podivinsky suffered a season-ending injury when he
tore his left knee cruciate ligament during the opening day of
practice in Val Gardena Wednesday.

Saddam Hussein urges Iraqis to resist US-British attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new quotes, missiles downed and strike targets &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said Friday
he would not ``compromise or kneel'' in the face of U.S. and
British airstrikes, launched because of a dispute over U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   Addressing the nation on television for the first time since the
airstrikes began early Thursday, Saddam told Iraqis: ``Continue
your resistance and, by God's will, you will be victorious.
	   ``You are representing justice and all the great characteristics
against injustice,'' Saddam said.
	   Dressed in his fieldmarshal's uniform, the president spoke of
the U.S._British air strikes on Iraq that have killed at least 25
people and wounded another 75, according to Iraqi officials.
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag
and you have proved again that you are heroic.''
	   ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the
name of God, strike them,'' he said.
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We
will not let evil triumph over virtue.''
	   The president paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air
defense troops, who have firing anti-aircraft guns at the cruise
missiles flying in to explode in Baghdad.
	   The air defense forces were ``Iraq's high wall in the face of
barbarism,'' Saddam said.
	   ``Iraq will be victorious. God damns them. Shame will be their
fate, those followers of Satan and evil.''
	   He ended his five-minute speech with the words: ``Long live
great Iraq, the great Arab nation and Palestine, and doomed are our
enemies.''
	   Shortly after the speech, the Iraqi General Command issued a
statement saying that since the attacks began, the air defense
forces had shot down 77 cruise missiles.
	   In the first military statement on the strikes, the general
command said the U.S. missiles had targeted military units,
communications centers, Trade Ministry warehouses and residential
areas.
	   The United States and Britain have launched the attacks to
retaliate for Iraq's alleged obstruction of U.N. inspectors seeking
to verify that Baghdad has eliminated its long-range missiles and
weapons of mass destruction.

Election aide killed, other attacks in St. Petersburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top energy official in St. Petersburg was
injured in a bomb blast Friday, and an election worker was killed
and another attacked in a new outbreak of violence surrounding
local elections, news reports said.
	   Konstantin Dubov, chief of the city's heat and energy authority,
his driver, and his bodyguard were hospitalized after a bomb
exploded in a car parked near their sedan, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Police said they had no evidence that the attack was directed
against Dubov, Interfax reported, but mentioned no other potential
victim or motive.
	   St. Petersburg has recently grown into a particularly
crime-ridden city even by Russian standards, with scores of
apparent contract hits against business people and politicians.
	   A liberal lawmaker and one of the most prominent women in
Russian politics, Galina Starovoitova, was gunned down by
unidentified assailants last month. Many believe she was killed to
prevent her political movement, Northern Capital, from making a
strong showing in elections to the St. Petersburg legislature.
	   But the run-up to the first round of voting, which was held on
Dec. 7, saw scores of other attacks, drive-by shootings and reports
of vote buying. Bomb threats marred election day.
	   Most legislative seats went to runoffs set for this Sunday, and
the violence has shown no sign of abating.
	   A campaign aide to candidate Alexei Borovets was killed late
Thursday as she was returning home, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported. The woman, who was not identified, was struck on the head
with what appeared to be a metal rod.
	   An aide to another candidate was attacked Thursday in the
hallway of his apartment building by three young men and was
hospitalized, the report said. The aide, Ivan Gapchenko, claimed he
recognized the attackers as campaign workers for another candidate.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet Union to
the 1988 Olympic soccer gold, was dismissed Friday as Russia's
national team coach following an 0-3 start to the squad's European
Championship qualifying campaign.
	   Byshovets, who took over the national team in July and had a
contract through the 2002 World Cup, was fired by a 14-0 vote of
the Football Union of Russia board, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   His dismissal was ``in connection with the unsatisfactory
performances by (the Russian team) in qualifying games for the
European Championship,'' the Interfax news agency reported, citing
the soccer union.
	   Russia was beaten 3-2 by Ukraine in Kiev on Sept. 5 and followed
that with a 3-2 loss to World Cup champion France on Oct. 10 in
Moscow.
	   But the blow that sealed Byshovets fate came four days later in
Reykjavik, when lightly regarded Iceland upset Russia 1-0.
	   Russia has not qualified for the World Cup since 1990 nor any
major tournament since the 1992 European Championship.
	   No replacement for Byshovets was named.
	   Byshovets was one of the Soviet Union's best players in the late
1960s and early 1970s. From 1963-73 he was a forward for Dinamo
Kiev and scored four goals in four matches at the 1970 World Cup.
	   The Russian federation has been plagued by corruption, power
struggles and violence in recent years.

U.S. pummels Iraq again as officials put toll at 25

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Deafening explosions rocked Baghdad on
Friday in the latest wave of U.S. and British air raids that Iraq
says have killed at least 25 people in the last two days.
	   The Iraqi capital came under missile attack hours before dawn,
capping a barrage of strikes that began late Thursday night. The
bombardment covered Baghdad with a pall of smoke and set the
skyline aglow in orange.
	   Again and again air-raid sirens sounded the warning and the sky
was lighted by anti-aircraft fire and tracer bullets.
	   After two days of attacks, President Saddam Hussein called on
the Iraqi people in a television address to resist the American and
British onslaught and said his government would not ``compromise or
kneel.''
	   ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi flag
and you have proved again that you are heroic,'' Saddam said,
dressed in a field marshal's uniform in a broadcast on Iraq's
official television.
	   ``Continue your resistance, and the criminals are doomed. In the
name of God, strike them,'' he said. ``We will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice. We will not let evil triumph over
virtue.''
	   Dozens of sites, including the headquarters of the military
intelligence and security police and factories that were monitored
by U.N. weapons inspectors, have been hit in the missile attacks,
Iraqi officials said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told a press conference Friday
night that the missiles had targeted ``whatever is dear to the
Iraqi people.''
	   The missiles had caused collateral damage to hospitals near the
defense ministry and had exploded in the oil refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a Trade Ministry warehouse in the northern
city of Tikrit, presidential compounds and the radio and television
buildings in Baghdad.
	   ``The radio and television are not arms of mass destruction,''
Aziz said, referring to the U.N. inspectors mandate to verify the
elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
	   As a new day dawned Friday, the tension of the night was less
evident and early risers were seen going about their normal
business. Traffic was light as Friday is the Muslim sabbath, but
worried motorists queued up at gasoline stations to make sure their
tanks were full.
	   Iraqi newspapers Friday called on people to rally behind Saddam.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' the Babil newspaper said in large
red letters above the name of the newspaper.
	   Below the slogan was a drawing of Saddam dressed in a
traditional white Arab robe hurling a spear at a large, black
hissing snake. The picture showed Saddam atop a white horse and
took up about a third of the front page.
	   The newspaper urged Iraqis to ``show their readiness for
sacrifice and their readiness to face the evil aggressors.''
	   Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath Party, headlined
its anti-American editorial ``Operation Monica.''
	   In an apparent effort to incite the public to rise up against
Saddam, U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets over southern Iraq on
Thursday, an Information Ministry official said.
	   He said the leaflets were designed to ``arouse the people'' but
gave no further details.
	   The largely Shiite Muslim south rebelled against Saddam
following the 1991 Gulf War, but the uprising was suppressed by
Iraqi forces.
	   Saudi armored units briefly moved close to the Iraqi border
Thursday, apparently on a surveillance mission, the Iraqi official
said. He spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The aerial attack in the early hours of Friday had set off the
loudest explosions heard so far since the United States launched
the operation early Thursday, firing 1,000 pound (450-kilogram)
Tomahawk cruise missiles from warships in the Gulf.
	   On Thursday night and early Friday, B-52 heavy bombers joined
the blitz, firing from the air 2,000 pound (900 kilogram) cruise
missiles. British Tornado jets also participated in the operation,
named ``Desert Fox.''
	   One missile appeared to have hit in the vicinity of the state
Military Industrial Corporation, and smoke could be seen drifting
up from the area. The corporation is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   The Thursday attack targeted several factories that were
monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the Nida heavy
machinery factory, some 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Baghdad,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said.
	   The U.N. teams have cameras and chemical sensors at a number of
sites in Iraq to ensure that the equipment is not used for the
clandestine manufacture of chemical or biological weapons or
long-range missile parts.
	   Friday's early morning attack damaged several buildings in
Baghdad, including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy
College of Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers were evacuated by
bus to the Jordanian capital Amman, a U.N. official told The
Associated Press. U.N. executives had hoped to keep the workers _
who monitor food aid for Iraqis _ in place, but apparently reversed
the decision after the Thursday night bombardment.
	   CNN said that U.N. workers spent most of the night huddled under
a staircase listening to explosions and shattering glass from U.S.
strikes near their headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad.
	   Some 28 U.N. humanitarian workers deemed ``essential'' remained
in Baghdad. The U.N. official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   To protest the strikes, Iraq's ally Russia on Friday recalled
its ambassador to Britain for urgent consultations. The move came a
day after the Russian ambassador to Washington was recalled.
	   The Pentagon said more than 200 missiles hit 50 sensitive sites
in the first attack, including Saddam's military intelligence
headquarters in Baghdad and four barracks for special security
guards who protect weapons sites.
	   An assessment of the damage from the second round of attack
wasn't immediately available.
	   There was also no word on casualties from the bombardment late
Thursday and Friday, ending about 4 a.m. (0100 gmt)
	   At least three explosions were heard in this city of 5 million,
the result of incoming missiles or bombs. Loud reports also were
created by anti-aircraft guns firing at the unseen enemy.
	   Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said earlier that at least
25 people were killed and 75 were injured before the latest round
of bombings.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there have been no
American casualties.
	   Iraq's ill-equipped hospitals would find it hard to cope with
the growing number of casualties, Mubarak told reporters in a
Baghdad hospital damaged by explosions.
	   President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq for
its alleged obstruction of the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of the illegal weapons,
the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Clinton said ``it would have been a disaster'' if the United
States had allowed Saddam to defy UNSCOM without any penalty.
	   There are 24,100 U.S. troops and 22 warships _ including eight
equipped to fire cruise missiles _ in the Gulf as well as 210
aircraft. The forces are bolstered with 15 B-52 heavy bombers.
	   The United States has said the strikes, which will last several
days, are aimed at military installations in a bid to degrade
Saddam's ability to harm U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, said
the real U.S. aim is to topple Saddam. ``I don't think it is a
question of those weapons,'' he said on CNN.
	   The strikes have divided the 15-member Security Council, with
Russia, China and Kenya supporting Iraq's demand for a cease-fire.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow would insist on
dismissal of UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler, whose negative report
about Iraq triggered the U.S.-British action.
	   In the report Tuesday, Butler said Iraq had reneged on its Nov.
14 pledge to cooperate with his inspectors. He cited Iraq's refusal
to allow entry into five sites, including an office of Iraq's
ruling Baath Party.
	   Butler defended his report and dismissed as ``utterly wrong''
any suggestion that it was timed to help Clinton deflect attention
from impeachment proceedings over the Monica Lewinsky affair.
	   Saddam taunted the United States and Britain in a radio address
on Thursday, saying they are cowards for not fighting ``face to
face'' but ``depending on a long technological arm.''

Volcano eruption reported in Iceland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) _ A volcano beneath Europe's largest
glacier in southern Iceland erupted Friday, sending clouds of steam
and ash 32,000 feet (9,750 meters) into the air, according to news
reports.
	   Scientists detected volcanic activity in the southern part of
the Vatnajokull glacier, in an area called Grimsvotn, where a
spectacular eruption took place only a couple of years ago,
according to the Iceland Review news Web site.
	   Fridrik Jonsson, a journalist with Iceland's National Radio
Service, said the eruption was less serious than the one in 1996,
which damaged roads and bridges in the south of Iceland.
	   Jonsson said the radio service was reporting that roads around
the southern part of the glacier remained open and that air traffic
had not been affected by the eruption.
	   Geophysicists flew to the glacier to examine it, he said.
	   The last eruptions in exactly the same site were in 1983 and
1934.

France rejects participation in cup without change of dates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French soccer chiefs decided Friday not to send a
team to the Confederations Cup if organizer FIFA doesn't change the
competition's dates, said a French Football Federation official.
	   FIFA moved the eight-nation event in Mexico from Jan. 8-20 to
July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France, which had earlier withdrawn
because of conflicts with the European club calendar.
	   Initially, the FFF accepted the changes, but the summer dates
upset the French National League (LNF), which plans to begin its
1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   ``The participation of France is subject to changes in the
calendar of the Confederations Cup,'' an official at the FFF, who
asked not to be identified, told The Associated Press. ``If the
calendar doesn't change, France can not participate.''
	   France wants the competition be moved to the start of the
summer.
	   The decision followed a meeting between FFF president Claude
Simonet and LNF president Noel Le Graet.
	   The withdrawal of the world champion would come as a blow to
FIFA, and greatly reduce interest in the event.

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Palestinian police clash with protesters in Gaza, arrest
four, grafs 11-12

<TEXT>
	   BEIT DOUKU, West Bank (AP) _ Anxious to avoid the image that
earned the Palestinians pariah status during the Gulf War,
authorities moved quickly Friday to contain anti-U.S.
demonstrations and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi
sentiments.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers
chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to America,
Death to Clinton, Death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity poles
during the Clinton visit.
	   Protesters found a few left-over plastic U.S. flags, and wrapped
them around their shoes in a sign of contempt.
	   Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press writer
for photographing the burning of a U.S. flag, and released him on
condition that he not take pictures of other anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.
	   The Palestinian leadership is anxious to curb the unmitigated
backing Palestinians gave Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _
stance that set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   Clinton's visited earlier this week _ to salvage peace accords
with Israel _ was visit was seen as tantamount to recognition of
Palestinian aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are
anxious to cultivate the new friendship.
	   The Palestinian Authority has issued a careful statement
regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction
capability.
	   In an attempt to quell an anti-American demonstration in Gaza
City, Palestinian police beat back some of the 500 participants
with clubs and guns, injuring three who were taken to a local
hospital.
	   The police arrested five Palestinian cameramen working for
foreign news agencies who reportedly took pictures of the beatings,
witnesses said. One of them, who is also an American, was soon
released.

Saudis see new moon, so Ramadan begins Saturday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi Royal palace announced
Friday that a new moon had been sighted, signaling that the holy
fasting month of Ramadan will begin Saturday.
	   The Supreme Legal Council, the country's top religious body,
said in a statement that ``tomorrow, Saturday will be the first day
of the holy month of Ramadan.''
	   The statement added that many people saw the new moon in
different parts of the kingdom.
	   Ramadan marks God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book,
to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago.
	   During the holy month, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking
and sex during daylight hours as an act of sacrifice and
purification.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the home of Islam's holiest shrines in
Mecca and Medina, was the first Muslim country to announce that
Saturday will be the first day of Ramadan. Gulf countries generally
follow the kingdom's lead, but most other Muslim countries make
their own determinations.
	   For Muslims around the world, Ramadan marks a period of bonding
with God and the family. Extended families gather at sunset,
awaiting the blast of a canon or the start of the evening prayer
that allows them to break their fast.

Trial set for six suspects in France jet bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The in-absentia trial of six suspects in the deadly
1989 bombing of a French passenger jet is set to begin March 8,
judicial sources said Friday.
	   A panel of judges at a Paris terrorism court will preside over
the five-day trial, sources said on customary anonymity.
	   UTA Flight 772, on a flight from Brazzaville, Republic of Congo,
to Paris, exploded over the Niger desert on Sept. 19, 1989, killing
all of the passengers and crew. Debris from the DC-10 was scattered
over 19 square miles.
	   Investigators who reconstructed the aircraft in a hangar at
Paris' Le Bourget airport concluded that a suitcase loaded with
explosives blew up in the baggage compartment.
	   The suspects _ including Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi's
brother-in-law, Abdallah Senoussi _ are all being protected by
Libya.
	   The other suspects are: Abdessalam Hammouda, Senoussi's top
aide, who is suspected of supervising the attack from Tripoli, the
Libyan capital; Abdallah Elazragh, a Libyan diplomat in Brazzaville
suspected of giving the suitcase to a passenger; Ibrahim Naeli and
Musbah Arbas, two suspected members of the Libyan secret service;
and Abdessalam Shibani, the alleged buyer of detonators in Germany.
	   The U.N. Security Council banned flights from Libya in 1992
after Ghadafi's regime refused to hand over suspects in the UTA
attack and in the Pan Am bombing a year earlier that killed 270
people over Lockerbie, Scotland.

	   LONDON (AP) _ British jets have flown three missions against air
defenses, airfields and Republican Guard installations in Iraq
without losing any aircraft, Defense Secretary George Robertson
said Friday.
	   ``We have yet to complete our full battle damage assessment, but
initial assessment is that the raids have gone very well,''
Robertson said at a press briefing.
	   ``There is still much to do before we can be satisfied that
Saddam's capabilities to develop weapons of mass destruction has
been damaged to the extent necessary,'' he said. ``We will carry on
with military action along with the U.S. until we are satisfied
that Saddam's military machine has been suitably damaged.''
	   Later Friday, a Royal Air Force spokesman in Kuwait said that
British Tornado bombers were involved in a new round of bombing
raids in Iraq.

Macedonian president says he won't run in next election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) - Macedonia's 81-year-old president, Kiro
Gligorov, the architect of the country's peaceful secession from
Yugoslavia, said Friday he will retire after next year's elections.
	   In his New Year's public address, Gligorov also called for
Macedonia's full membership in NATO.
	   Gligorov said he won't run in presidential elections scheduled
for next fall. Earlier, he was quoted as saying he wants to retire
and devote himself to his family and grandchildren after a long
political career that started in communist Yugoslavia.
	   Gligorov, a ranking communist leader in former Yugoslavia,
peacefully split Macedonia from the former six-republic federation.
He survived an assassination attempt in October 1995.
	   Macedonia's parliament voted him the country's president in
1991, and in 1994 he was elected in a popular vote.
	   Last month, he agreed to allow deployment of some 1,700 NATO
quick-reaction troops to help unarmed international verifiers if
needed in neighboring Kosovo, the strife-torn Serbian province.
	   In the address, Gligorov said Macedonia should become a member
of NATO because it would enhance overall stability in the region.

Degussa shareholders give 99.98 percent approval vote to merger
</HEADLINE>
with Huels &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Chemicals and precious metals company
Degussa approved a merger with chemical company Huels AG on a vote
of 99.98 percent at a special shareholders meeting Friday in
Frankfurt.
	   The merger had already been approved on Thursday by Huels AG,
which is 100 percent owned by the Veba trading, chemicals and
energy group, and is planned to be completed in February, a Degussa
statement said.
	   ``Together we can attain growth and yield goals that each
company alone could not have realized,'' Degussa Chairman Uwe-Ernst
Bufe told the meeting.
	   He said that growth was expected especially from further
internationalizing of the merged companies and increased strength
of capital.
	   ``At the top of the agenda is the development of competitive
employment slots through growth,'' Bufe said.
	   He said that the future Degussa-Huels AG operation would employ
some 46,000 people worldwide and expected an annual turnover of
more than 20 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion), not including the
precious metals business.
	   Initially the merger will result in the loss of about 1,000 jobs
through ``natural fluctuation,'' with no involuntary layoffs, Bufe
said.
	   Both both companies agreed in October on a 1-to-1 stock swap as
part of the merger plans, which Degussa spokeswoman Monika
Hillemacher said would create 156 million shares. Veba AG will hold
62.4 percent of the shares, with the rest held by independent
stockholders, she said.
	   In other developments, Bufe said he did not expect a
class-action lawsuit filed by Holocaust survivors at the district
court in New Jersey this summer, to have a negative impact on
Degussa's operations.
	   At the same time Bufe said he takes the suit seriously and
welcomed German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's earlier comments
saying the government wants a political, pragmatic solution on
repatriation and compensation for Holocaust survivors.

 &UR; Saudis see new moon, so Ramadan begins Saturday

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi Royal palace announced
Friday that a new moon had been sighted, signaling that the holy
fasting month of Ramadan will begin Saturday.
	   The Supreme Legal Council, the country's top religious body,
said in a statement that ``tomorrow, Saturday will be the first day
of the holy month of Ramadan.''
	   The statement added that many people saw the new moon in
different parts of the kingdom.
	   Ramadan marks God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book,
to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago.
	   During the holy month, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking
and sex during daylight hours as an act of sacrifice and
purification.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the home of Islam's holiest shrines in
Mecca and Medina, was the first Muslim country to announce that
Saturday will be the first day of Ramadan. Gulf countries generally
follow the kingdom's lead, but most other Muslim countries make
their own determinations.
	   For Muslims around the world, Ramadan marks a period of bonding
with God and the family. Extended families gather at sunset,
awaiting the blast of a canon or the start of the evening prayer
that allows them to break their fast.

Politician charged with sedition, editor with sectarianism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A politician who called President Yoweri
Museveni corrupt and a dictator was charged with sedition in a
magistrate's court Friday.
	   The editor of the newspaper that carried the politician's
remarks additionally was charged with spreading sectarianism for
publishing a story that claimed the government had distributed guns
to nomadic herders in western Uganda to defend against cattle
rustlers.
	   Both Chapaa Karuhanga, founder of the National Democratic Forum,
and George Lugalambi, editor of the tri-weekly Crusader, pleaded
innocent to the charges and were released on bail.
	   Both men were arrested Thursday.
	   The charge of sedition carries a maximum penalty of seven years
in prison upon conviction.
	   The maximum penalty for sectarianism was not immediately
available.
	   Karuhanga, 45, was arrested after telling a party rally and the
newspaper that Museveni was worse than his predecessors, Milton
Obote and Idi Amin Dada.
	   ``Amin and Obote were dictators, but Museveni is both a dictator
and corrupt,'' Karuhanga was quoted as saying by the tri-weekly
Crusader newspaper last week.
	   Obote, now in exile in Zambia, was president from 1963 until his
overthrow by Amin in 1971. He was president again from 1981 to
1985.
	   Amin ruled Uganda from 1971 until he was ousted by combined
Ugandan-Tanzanian forces in 1979. During his eight years in power,
at least 400,000 people were killed by his security police.
	   Museveni fought a successful five-year guerrilla war against
Obote's government and has ruled Uganda since 1986. He was elected
president in May 1996.
	   After coming to power, Museveni and his National Resistance
Movement suspended the election-related activities of political
parties and refused to recognize any parties formed after 1986.
	   Parties formed before 1986 can exist, but they cannot hold
rallies or carry out political activities.
	   Several members of Museveni's government, including his brother,
Maj. Gen. Salim Saleh, who was his special military adviser, have
been forced to resign following publication of a parliamentary
report on high-level corruption.
	   The Crusader story quoted several people expressing alarm over
the arming of the Hima herders, who are closely related to
Museveni's Nkore tribe, because it might lead to armed violence
like that in Somalia.
	   Lugalambi was instructed to give up his passport to police and
to report to them every two weeks.
	   Police raided the offices of the Crusader Thursday, arrested
Lugalambi and reporter Meddie Musisi and seized files and
administrative documents.
	   It was not clear whether Musisi was also charged or whether he
had been released.

Copa Libertadores to kick off Feb. 21
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) _ Two undetermined Ecuadoran rivals will
kick off the first round of the prestigious Copa Libertadores on
Feb. 21, the first step in determining South America's annual club
champion.
	   Like Chile, Peru and Brazil, Ecuador has yet to finish its
season and determine its both of its participants.
	   This year's draw was completed Friday morning after a power
failure Thursday night forced CONMEBOL to suspend the procedure
after only four of the five groups were set.
	   This year's tournament is set to finish with the two-leg final
on June 2 and 16, two months earlier than this year. In most years,
the Copa America every other year and the World Cup every fourth,
the tournament's final rounds are usually delayed until August.
	   But with the Confederations Cup and Pan American Games also
scheduled for this year, the tournament will be completed prior to
those national teams competitions.
	   Monterrey, marking Mexico's second participation in the
competition, will play in Group One with Venezuela's Estudiantes
and Uruguay's Bella Vista and Nacional.
	   Monterrey earned its spot in a preliminary competition between
August and November. Group One begins play Feb. 24 with matches
between Estudiantes and Monterrey in Merida, Venezuela, and Bella
Vista and Nacional in Montevideo.
	   Velez Sarsfield and River Plate of Argentina will face off in
Group Two with Colombian squads Deportivo Cali and Once Caldas.
	   Palmeiras and an one of its fellow Brazilian clubs will play
against Paraguay's Cerro Porteno and Olimpia in Group Three.
	   Group Four has only one confirmed team, Chile's Colo Colo.
Another Chilean squad plus both Peruvian teams are scheduled for
that group.
	   Bolivia's Blooming and Wilsterman will join the two Ecuadoran
squads in Group Five.

Official: Government should pay wage debt to miners fairly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government should stop using its
scarce funds to pay off wage debts at individual striking mines and
instead should distribute the money among all mines, the coal
minister said Friday.
	   The government does not have the money to pay off all its
mounting wage debts to coal miners.
	   Serhiy Tulub said complete repayment of wage debts at a handful
of striking mines could prompt others to protest in hopes of
winning overdue salaries, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Tulub spoke two days after about 200 miners ended a five-month
picket of the regional government headquarters in the eastern city
of Luhansk, where they demanded payment of wages more than six
months late.
	   The authorities finally paid the money after one of the
protesters set himself on fire and striking workers attacked the
Luhansk regional administration building earlier this week.
	   Miners throughout Ukraine are owed more than 2 billion hryvna
(dlrs 584 million). The debt has been steadily increasing for years
because the cash-poor government has failed to close aging and
unprofitable mines or to improve efficiency and safety conditions.
	   More than 20,000 coal workers were reported on strike at various
mines this week, part of a series of protests that have kept dozens
of Ukraine's 275 mines idled for months.
	   The Cabinet has approved several resolutions this year intended
to provide urgent aid to the deteriorating coal industry, but none
of these succeeded in improving the situation.

China to put third and most prominent dissident on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and LEADS throughout to UPDATE with details of Xu's
detention, meeting with lawyer; CORRECTS Xu's age to 56, sted 55 &QL; 
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A day after putting two leading members of a
would-be opposition party on trial, Chinese authorities told the
wife of the group's most prominent member on Friday his turn would
come in three days.
	   Setting Xu Wenli's Monday court date was the most portentous
move the communist authorities have taken in a nearly three-week
crackdown on the China Democracy Party. His sentencing to prison _
a virtual certainty in political trials _ would deprive the party
and the quarrelsome dissident community of a potent organizer.
	   Unlike his opposition party colleagues Wang Youcai and Qin
Yongmin, who had to argue their innocence in trials Thursday after
police detained and scared off potential lawyers, Xu was given a
court-appointed attorney, his wife, He Xintong, said.
	   Although court officials only notified He on Friday, the
attorney met Xu for the first time Thursday. That gave them four
days to prepare a defense against accusations of subverting state
power. Xu, 56, faces from 10 years to life in prison if convicted.
	   ``There's no hope,'' said He Xintong. ``I told the court
official today there's no way this will be a fair trial.''
	   As if to underscore the move, Chinese President and Communist
Party leader Jiang Zemin vowed Friday to maintain one-party rule
and warned against those who would end it.
	   ``The system must not be shaken, weakened or discarded at any
time,'' Jiang told 6,000 members of the political elite in a speech
to mark 20 years of successful economic reforms. ``The Western mode
of political systems must never be copied.''
	   Jiang's remarks and the clampdown on dissent countered the more
moderate tone Chinese leaders have tried to set as they courted the
United States and other governments. China won praise for signing
U.N. rights treaties and edging its legal system toward
international standards.
	   Dissidents saw opportunity in these moves. Since Wang Youcai and
others announced the China Democracy Party's start in June,
dissidents set up party branches in 14 provinces and cities and
tried to register with authorities as required by law.
	   At least 30 members of the party have been detained or
questioned in the latest and most concerted crackdown against the
group.
	   A phone call from court officials and a later meeting Friday
were the first confirmation He Xintong received of Xu Wenli's
whereabouts and the charges he faced since his arrest Nov. 30.
	   The court-appointed lawyer, Mo Shaoping, later told her that Xu
was in decent health, but was being kept in cell with five criminal
suspects at the Beijing Detention Center, she said.
	   Xu edited an influential dissident journal in the Democracy Wall
movement 20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, most of them in
solitary confinement. Since his parole ended last year, Xu has
played the role of elder adviser to dissidents.
	   He became openly involved in the China Democracy Party in
November, organizing the group's branch in Beijing and nearby
Tianjin after he believed police pressure forced another leader to
bow out. Shortly before his arrest, he called on party members and
exiled dissidents to convene a nationwide congress.
	   Xu's trial may closely mirror the trials held Thursday for Wang
Youcai, a student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy
demonstrations, and Qin Yongmin, a Democracy Wall colleague of Xu.
	   Like Wang's and Qin's trials, court officials are limiting
access by friends and family. Court officials gave Xu's wife a pass
at a meeting Friday afternoon, but later refused to issue them for
two Xu supporters and democracy party members, she said.
	   Like Wang and Qin, Xu's indictment charges him with organizing
the China Democracy Party, a Hong Kong-based rights group.
	   The indictment also accuses Xu of accepting money from abroad,
calling for independent trade unions and making subversive
statements in interviews with foreign media, the Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.

Acosta to coach Chile through the 2002

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Uruguayan-born Nelson Acosta, who coached
Chile into the second round in France this year, has reached a deal
with the federation to remain in the job through the 2002 World
Cup.
	   Miguel Bauza, vice president of the Chilean federation said the
agreement with Acosta was completed Thursday night. No details on
the new contact were available.
	   Acosta's first challenge will be the Copa America in Paraguay in
July next year.
	   Chile will play Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela in the first round
of the biennial tournament.
	   Acosta came to Chile from his native Uruguay in the late 1960s
as a player, and became a Chilean citizen. After his retirement, he
became a coach.

Saudis see new moon, so Ramadan begins Saturday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi Royal palace announced
Friday that a new moon had been sighted, signaling that the holy
fasting month of Ramadan will begin Saturday.
	   The Supreme Legal Council, the country's top religious body,
said in a statement that ``tomorrow, Saturday will be the first day
of the holy month of Ramadan.''
	   The statement added that many people saw the new moon in
different parts of the kingdom.
	   The start of Ramadan _ which marks God's revelation of the
Koran, Islam's holy book, to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years
ago _ could have been scheduled to begin either Saturday or Sunday,
depending on the sighting of the new moon.
	   During the holy month, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking
and sex during daylight hours as an act of sacrifice and
purification.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the home of Islam's holiest shrines in
Mecca and Medina, was the first Muslim country to announce that
Saturday will be the first day of Ramadan. Gulf countries generally
follow the kingdom's lead, but most other Muslim countries make
their own determinations.
	   For Muslims around the world, Ramadan marks a period of bonding
with God and the family. Extended families gather at sunset,
awaiting the blast of a canon or the start of the evening prayer
that allows them to break their fast.

Palestinian journalists arrested at protest in Gaza
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian police arrested on
Friday five journalists who photographed police beating protesters
at a pro-Iraq demonstration.
	   The violence began when 500 members of the radical Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine tried to march through the center
of Gaza City in a demonstration against the ongoing U.S. attack on
Iraq.
	   Palestinian police beat protesters with clubs and guns and then
arrested the five Palestinian journalists for taking pictures of
the violence, witnesses said.
	   One of the journalists, American Qassam Ali, was soon released.
Another working with France 2 television was beaten when he refused
to hand over his camera, the witnesses said.
	   Two other journalists police arrested work for the ARD German
television station and another for the PFLP group newspaper.
	   The Palestinian Authority has tried to clamp down on
anti-American protests that erupted Thursday across the West Bank
and in the Gaza Strip.
	   The demonstrations broke out only a day after U.S. President
Bill Clinton left the area from a visit that bolstered
U.S.-Palestinian ties.
	   Palestinian police also shut down five TV stations and a radio
station in the West Bank on Friday after they broadcast pro-Iraqi
protests and programs.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After failing to prevent U.S. and British attacks
against Iraq, Russia will concentrate even more on developments in
the Balkans, Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told visiting
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Friday.
	   Moscow staunchly opposes possible NATO airstrikes against
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, to punish its
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. Russia has been a
traditional ally of the Serbs, with whom it shares the Orthodox
Christian religion and Slavic roots.
	   ``One should have a keener eye on the situation in the Balkans
in light of the events that concern Iraq,'' the ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted Primakov as saying.
	   Tudjman was making his first visit to Russia since he came to
power in 1991 and led his country to independence from the former
Yugoslavia. The trip resulted in the signing of agreements on arms
trade and defense cooperation, as well as communications, trade and
cultural cooperation, disaster prevention and fighting
money-laundering, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Trade between Russia and Croatia totaled dlrs 620 million in
1997 and dlrs 402.9 million in the first eight months of this year,
said Nadan Vidosevic, the head of Croatia's Chamber of Economy, who
accompanied Tudjman to Moscow.
	   Tudjman praised Russia's role in international affairs.
	   ``We live in a world where the role of Russia as a superpower is
getting more conspicuous,'' Tudjman told Primakov, according to
ITAR-Tass.
	   Russia is desperately trying to maintain its influence in world
affairs, despite the decline of its military and its severe
economic troubles.
	   Tudjman met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin later Friday.
The two called for a quick settlement of the crisis in former
Yugoslavia and discussed bilateral ties, Interfax reported.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, who was present at the
talks, quoted Tudjman as saying that the Balkan nations want Russia
to remain ``a major stabilizing factor in the region,'' the report
said.
	   During Tudjman's visit, Russia and Croatia also signed a
declaration on friendship and cooperation aimed at boosting
relations.

Peace accord strides forward, first weapons destroyed in hopeful
</HEADLINE>
Belfast &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Shaking off months of
frustrations and recriminations, Northern Ireland passed two
important landmarks Friday on the road to lasting peace.
	   At 4 a.m. (0400 GMT), senior Protestant and Catholic politicians
shared handshakes and weary smiles after finally agreeing on the
shape of their future coalition government, the central plank of
April's peace accord.
	   Six hours later, submachine guns belonging to the outlawed
Loyalist Volunteer Force were sawn to bits amid showers of sparks
and burning metal _ the first terrorist weapons to be surrendered
and destroyed under terms of the accord.
	   ``I never thought I'd see the day,'' said a teary-eyed Michael
McGoldrick, father of the Protestant terrorist group's first murder
victim, watching the symbolic televised sight of a gun barrel being
cut in two.
	   ``One of those weapons could very well have been used to kill my
boy,'' said McGoldrick, whose son was abducted and shot several
times in the head in 1996. ``I'm just so, so glad they'll no longer
be used to kill anyone else.''
	   The Loyalist Volunteers spent two years killing Catholics at
random in hopes of derailing peace negotiations, but called a
cease-fire in May in recognition of widespread public support for
the accord.
	   Their liaison with an independent disarmament commission _
paroled killer-turned-preacher Kenny McClinton _ said the group had
handed over a bigger-than-expected chunk of its arsenal in hopes of
shaming the Irish Republican Army into matching the gesture.
	   In all, the group turned in nine submachine guns, rifles and
pistols; 350 rounds of ammo; six detonators and two pipe bombs.
	   The Canadian army general who leads the disarmament commission,
John de Chastelain, wore protective goggles as he watched the
weapons being dismantled, visibly relieved to see his work finally
bearing fruit.
	   But he declined to speculate whether the gesture would encourage
armed groups politically committed to the accord _ the IRA on the
Catholic side, and the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force on the Protestant side _ to start disarming, too.
	   The agreement sets May 2000 as a deadline for those groups to
complete disarmament. But all three have refused to make the first
move _ and bluntly dismissed Friday's start to disarmament as a
cynical stunt that wouldn't move them.
	   David Trimble, the Protestant politician elected to lead
Northern Ireland's future government, said that the IRA and its
allied Sinn Fein party should emulate the Loyalist Volunteers'
example.
	   ``Something which so many people told us would never happen has,
in fact, happened,'' said Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist
Party and co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize.
	   Earlier, Trimble and his senior Ulster Unionist negotiators
shook hands with leading figures of the major Catholic-supported
party, the Social Democratic and Labor Party, after reaching a
detailed deal on the structure of the unformed government.
	   Two months later than expected and after a marathon 18-hour
negotiating session, they agreed that the government's
administration should have 10 departments led equally by Protestant
and Catholic politicians.
	   It would coooperate in six cross-border committees with the
neighboring Irish Republic, an agenda that the Catholic side hopes
will promote the eventual unification of Ireland.
	   ``Agreement on the structures for the new Northern Ireland
administration is a significant breakthrough,'' said British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who kept close tabs by phone on the
negotiations.
	   Reflecting their share of the Northern Ireland vote, three
cabinet posts each would go to the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,
and two each to Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists, a
Protestant party so opposed to compromise it has boycotted
negotiations since 1997.
	   The British government, which has directly ruled Northern
Ireland since 1972, wants to transfer many powers to the local
administration by the end of February.
	   But Trimble emphasized that Protestants wouldn't tolerate Sinn
Fein in any administration unless the IRA starts disarming.

Tough chore for Jaguars, Quinn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The last time Jonathan Quinn started in an
American football game, it was at the college level for Middle
Tennessee State.
	   Welcome to the National Football League.
	   Quinn, a third-round draft pick and third-string quarterback for
Jacksonville, was thrust into the lineup last weekend against
Tennessee. The Jaguars already were without Mark Brunell (ankle
sprain), and backup Jamie Martin injured his knee against the
Oilers.
	   Quinn did a so-so job in one half against the Oilers, going
12-for-18 for 107 yards and an interception in a 16-13 loss. That
victory kept Tennessee alive in the AFC Central Division race, and
the Jaguars (10-4) could blow their first division title if they
lose their final two games while the Oilers win theirs.
	   That means Quinn needs to produce on national cable television
Sunday night at Minnesota, hardly the best situation for a rookie
quarterback. The Vikings simply have the league's best record
(13-1, same as Denver) and can clinch home-field advantage for the
entire NFC playoffs with a victory.
	   ``He throws the ball well, has very strong arm and really showed
outstanding poise the other day being pressed into battle,'' coach
Tom Coughlin said. ``He's a young developmental player on the rise
and I see an outstanding future for Jon Quinn.''
	   That future is now.
	   ``There's just a lot of stuff you have to know, a whole number
of variations on each situation, so many different things to be
prepared for,'' Quinn said. ``A big game in college obviously
doesn't have the magnitude of this one. We're going against the
best team in NFC, maybe the NFL, right now.''
	   Minnesota, which has nine players headed to the Pro Bowl, seeks
its first NFC Central title since 1994, the most victories in
franchise history and the NFL scoring record (the Vikings need to
average 31 points in the last two games to do it).
	   That means no coasting for coach Dennis Green's team, which
plays the Oilers next weekend.
	   ``We're not being hunted. We're hunting the Super Bowl
championship,'' Green said. ``We have the advantage that Green Bay,
San Francisco and Denver don't have. All three of those teams have
won Super Bowl championships and we have not in the history of our
organization. We are hunting the Super Bowl championship, and we
will be ready to play the next team in our quest to do that.''
	   Tennessee will enter an emotional cauldron in Green Bay (9-5),
which needs one victory to clinch a wild-card berth. The game
figures to be Reggie White's finale at Lambeau Field.
	   ``I'm sure it's going to be emotional, because I love it here,''
said White, who turned 37 Saturday. ``I love playing here and I
love the players. I think the thing that's really been hitting me
is I'm realizing how much I really care about these guys. And in
the process of that, how honored I am to have been a part of this
organization and to play in front of these people.''
	   The Oilers thought their postseason chase ended two weeks ago,
but they've rebounded to go from .500 to 8-6.
	   ``Two weeks ago, after our Seattle loss, we felt like we needed
to win four in a row to get in and that sounded liked a huge
task,'' Oilers coach Jeff Fisher said. ``But after the last two
wins, two in a row doesn't sound nearly as tough.''
	   The action begins Saturday with the New York Jets at Buffalo and
Tampa Bay at Washington. Other Sunday games are Baltimore at
Chicago, Cincinnati at Pittsburgh, Kansas City at the New York
Giants, St. Louis at Carolina, San Francisco at New England,
Indianapolis at Seattle, Oakland at San Diego, New Orleans at
Arizona, Atlanta at Detroit and Philadelphia at Dallas.
	   On Monday night, it's Denver at Miami.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official promised
another security sweep targeting Kosovo Albanian rebels after the
battered body of a prominent Serb official was found dumped along a
roadside Friday.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing of a municipal leader just
outside Pristina, called the death ``one more attack on Serbia.''
	   ``The earth is too small for them to hide,'' he said of the
killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army and pledging new
action against them.
	   The brutal slaying of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo
Polje, 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was the latest jolt to increasingly slim hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since a U.S.-brokered
agreement in October that was intended to buy time for a political
settlement on Kosovo's future status.
	   The past week has been the bloodiest in months. Yugoslav army
border guards killed 36 guerrillas on the Albanian border,
unidentified assailants gunned down six young Serbs in a bar in the
western city of Pec, and Serb police killed two suspected rebels
and arrested 34 in a crackdown in the Pec area.
	   Friday morning, Bojanic's badly beaten body was found dumped
along the province's main east-west road, where it lay for hours _
bloodied, bruised and shot between the eyes. An American medic in
the international verification team examined it and said there were
multiple fracture wounds.
	   KLA representative Adem Demaci denied that rebels were involved
in the killing and suggested it may have been staged by Serbian
secret police. ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of
the Serbian regime,'' he said.
	   But Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   With the political atmosphere highly charged after days of Serb
rallies over the worsening violence, busloads of Serbs were brought
to a rally in Kosovo Polje within hours, where Sainovic told them
that ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.''
	   ``Rest assured that the state will energetically respond to each
such attack, and as you have seen punishment has already caught up
with some of the perpetrators of the Pec killings,'' he said.
	   Worried U.S. officials issued a statement condemning the savage
killing and urging calm.
	   ``While there will be a great temptation to seek retribution,
that would mean surrendering to those who committed this terrible
act,'' said the statement by Richard Miles, chief mission of the
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, and Shaun Byrnes, chief of the U.S.
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the 2,000-strong verifiers
mission, met earlier with angry family members of some of the over
200 Serbs who have been reported missing.
	   In a heated and at times emotional meeting, he deplored the
latest ``heinous crime'' and condemned all terrorist acts as well
as abductions of innocent people for political aims.
	   ``The fate of your missing and abducted relatives is a grave
concern for us,'' Walker told the Serb delegation, as he listened
to personal accounts for more than two hours.
	   The Serb official's death came hours after Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla
fighters in a border clash Monday.
	   On Thursday, Serb police launched a crackdown on the village of
Glodjane, reportedly killing two ethnic Albanian fighters and
capturing 34 in a day-long battle searching for gunmen who
slaughtered six young Serbs in Pec. Reporters heard shelling coming
from the direction of Glodjane Friday afternoon.

	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ As accusations of bribery pile up faster
than Utah snow, Salt Lake Olympic officials began a formal
investigation into the landing of the 2002 Winter Games.
	   In the sanctuary of a closed meeting, the 13-member executive
committee of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee met to discuss the
charges. The remaining 28 SLOC members may attend, but cannot
participate.
	   ``There's no question that the quicker this is resolved the
better,'' John Fowler, the state's liaison with the SLOC, said as
he arrived at the committee's downtown offices for the meeting.
``There's no way this will threaten the life of the games, but
there is a lot of work to do.''
	   ``The world needs to hear anything that we wouldn't be proud of
from us and they need to hear it from us first,'' Mike Leavitt,
governor of the state of Utah, said Thursday of the anticipated
ethics probe. ``And they need to hear it from us soon.''
	   The five-member SLOC ethics panel will investigate a dlrs
400,000 scholarship fund whose 13 beneficiaries included relatives
of six IOC officials and free medical service provided to three IOC
members.
	   The payments appear to violate IOC rules limiting the value of
gifts to members to dlrs 150.
	   ``At this point, we're hearing lots of alleged details and all
we have now are a lot of questions and no answers,'' SLOC
spokeswoman Shelley Thomas said.
	   Meanwhile, Salt Lake City mayor Deedee Corradini, a member of
SLOC's board, admitted Thursday that the son of an IOC member from
Swaziland was given an internship in city government.
	   And on the same day, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno,
essentially the United States' justice minister, said that her
office also is reviewing the allegations.
	   Such reviews fall far short of a formal investigation, which
would be undertaken by the local federal prosecutor. Steven
Sorenson, chief deputy to U.S. Attorney for Utah Paul Warner, would
not discuss the matter Thursday.
	   The IOC also is investigating the allegations, which have grown
into the biggest bribery scandal in the 104-year history of the
Olympic Games.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Lazarenko returning to Ukraine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Ukrainian opposition leader Pavlo Lazarenko headed
back to his homeland Friday after being released from a Swiss jail
on bail of four million Swiss francs (dlrs 3 million).
	   Investigating judge Laurent Kasper-Ansermet said as one of the
conditions for his release, Lazarenko had agreed to stay in contact
with Geneva authorities who have accused him of laundering a
``relatively large'' sum of money.
	   Lazarenko also had to prove that his bail money was not the
result of illegally-gotten gains.
	   Lazarenko, 45, has admitted moving money to Swiss accounts, but
vows it has no criminal connections.
	   He accuses the Ukrainian government of trying to discredit him
and his centrist Hromada party in advance of presidential elections
in October 1999.
	   Ukrainian authorities maintain Lazarenko used his time as the
nation's Prime Minister from 1996 to 1997 to siphon off huge
profits from the distribution of natural gas in the former Soviet
republic.
	   The country has filed 20 separate requests for legal assistance
to Switzerland. The Swiss have handed over some bank documents and
frozen an undisclosed amount of money in accounts.
	   After leaving Geneva's main jail, Lazarenko was questioned for
four hours in the northern city of Zurich, which is conducting its
own investigations.
	   District attorney Dieter Jann said Zurich authorities would now
decide whether to give bank documents to Ukraine. Under the
decentralized Swiss system, each canton (state) is responsible for
its own investigations.
	   Jann said Lazarenko left Zurich late afternoon and flew back to
Ukraine.

Outgoing OSCE chairman fears renewed Kosovo fighting in spring
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEATA PASEK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The international community must push
harder for political dialogue in Kosovo or face renewed fighting
when winter ends in the Serbian province next year, Foreign
Minister Bronislaw Geremek said Friday.
	   Geremek is outgoing chairman of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which heads the mission sending unarmed
foreigners to Kosovo to verify compliance with agreements intended
to halt bloodshed and start political negotiations.
	   But more than 40 people have died this week in the worst
violence in Kosovo since an Oct. 12 agreement forced on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic by U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
backed by threatened NATO air strikes.
	   U.S.-led diplomatic efforts since then have failed to narrow the
gap between ethnic Albanians _ who seek independence for Kosovo _
and Serbs who refuse giving them more than autonomy within Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The simmering tensions have stoked fears of a major outburst of
violence that could spill beyond the borders of Kosovo and involve
ethnic Albanians elsewhere.
	   Geremek said the international community should focus on
creating conditions for Serbs and ethnic Albanians to start talking
to each other, intead of worrying about ``whether it will be known
where heavy weapons are located or moved.''
	   ``If there will be no understanding on the part of the OSCE and
international community that everything depends on political
dialogue ... then already in March we can face a new situation, as
bloody as before,'' he said.
	   Geremek called the next three months, until the likely spring
thaw in March, ``critical'' for preventing a resumption of war.
	   Under the October accord, Milosevic agreed to allow up to 2,000
unarmed international civilians to verify compliance on the ground.
The United States and other Western powers believed the verifiers
sent by the OSCE would be so prevalent that neither the Serb forces
nor the rebels would be able to launch attacks without the
knowledge of the international community.
	   But Serb police have kept the verifiers away from some trouble
spots this week, and the state-run Borba newspaper called Thursday
for the withdrawal from Kosovo of international verifiers and U.S.
envoys, saying they are ``direct instigators and helpers of the
crimes committed by Albanian terrorists.''

French fragrance about to go underground
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADEGE VANCAUWENBERGHE &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French fragrance is about to go underground, into
the Paris metro _ a sweet woody-smell designed to cover up all that
tobacco, filth, heated grease and rubber.
	   Quest International, the world's third largest fragrance
company, and the Paris subway system, on Friday announced the
launch of the new scent, known as ``Madeleine.''
	   What the manufacturer says is the world's first subway fragrance
will one by one fill most of the metro and suburban fast-train
stations by the end of January.
	   Madeleine will be mixed with detergent, and the scent will then
waft through stations every time the soaping machine passes
through.
	   ``Smells of heated grease and rubber coming from escalators and
trains, are especially sickening, '' explained Jacques Rapoport,
head of metro department of the RATP, as the Paris subway is
called.
	   The RATP five years ago decided to do something about bad smells
in the subway, contacting Quest International, which makes famous
like Angel by Thierry Mugler, Le Male by Gauthier or Tocade by
Rochas.
	   ``The challenge was to create a fragrance liable to make metro
smell nice and clean. ... At the same time the fragrance had to be
compatible with the materials used to clean the metro stations,''
said Rapoport.
	   Four out of 15 fragrances were shortlisted. This spring after
much testing, passengers polled chose Madeleine: a fragrance made
of a woody musky basis with a touch of vanilla and enhanced with a
blend of citrus, lavande, jasmine, rose and lily.
	   The RATP then decided to go ahead with the Madeleine scent.
	   Eleven poems on smells and perfume and green-yellow flowery
posters asking ``Do you smell the difference?'' are to cover metro
walls in support of the fragrance campaign.
	   Passengers at Invalides station, however, were not all convinced
of the efficiency of the remedy.
	   ``It is stinking anyway. It is really no use to try anything.
It's hopeless,'' said Alham Chidouh, a 15-year old high school
school student.
	   ``I didn't smell anything,'' said Anne Huynh, a personnel
department manager. ``Well, it is not really efficient, it just
smells vaguely detergent''.
	   Some passengers welcomed the change.
	   ``It's very nice, said Nathalie Rousseau, a 32 year-old
housekeeper. ``It just makes you want to take the metro more often.
That's a really good idea!''

Serb official killed, prompting new furor in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official promised
another security sweep targeting Kosovo Albanian rebels after the
battered body of a prominent Serb official was found dumped along a
roadside Friday.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing of a municipal leader just
outside Pristina, called the death ``one more attack on Serbia.''
	   ``The earth is too small for them to hide,'' he said of the
killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army and pledging new
action against them.
	   The brutal slaying of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo
Polje, 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was the latest jolt to increasingly slim hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since a U.S.-brokered
agreement in October that was intended to buy time for a political
settlement on Kosovo's future status.
	   The past week has been the bloodiest in months. Yugoslav army
border guards killed 36 guerrillas on the Albanian border,
unidentified assailants gunned down six young Serbs in a bar in the
western city of Pec, and Serb police killed two suspected rebels
and arrested 34 in a crackdown in the Pec area.
	   Friday morning, Bojanic's badly beaten body was found dumped
along the province's main east-west road, where it lay for hours _
bloodied, bruised and shot between the eyes. An American medic in
the international verification team examined it and said there were
multiple fracture wounds.
	   KLA representative Adem Demaci denied that rebels were involved
in the killing and suggested it may have been staged by Serbian
secret police. ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of
the Serbian regime,'' he said.
	   But Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   With the political atmosphere highly charged after days of Serb
rallies over the worsening violence, busloads of Serbs were brought
to a rally in Kosovo Polje within hours, where Sainovic told them
that ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.''
	   ``Rest assured that the state will energetically respond to each
such attack, and as you have seen punishment has already caught up
with some of the perpetrators of the Pec killings,'' he said.
	   Worried U.S. officials issued a statement condemning the savage
killing and urging calm.
	   ``While there will be a great temptation to seek retribution,
that would mean surrendering to those who committed this terrible
act,'' said the statement by Richard Miles, chief mission of the
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, and Shaun Byrnes, chief of the U.S.
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the 2,000-strong verifiers
mission, met earlier with angry family members of some of the over
200 Serbs who have been reported missing.
	   In a heated and at times emotional meeting, he deplored the
latest ``heinous crime'' and condemned all terrorist acts as well
as abductions of innocent people for political aims.
	   ``The fate of your missing and abducted relatives is a grave
concern for us,'' Walker told the Serb delegation, as he listened
to personal accounts for more than two hours.
	   The Serb official's death came hours after Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla
fighters in a border clash Monday.
	   On Thursday, Serb police launched a crackdown on the village of
Glodjane, reportedly killing two ethnic Albanian fighters and
capturing 34 in a day-long battle searching for gunmen who
slaughtered six young Serbs in Pec.
	   Reporters heard shelling coming from the direction of Glodjane
Friday afternoon.
	   Earlier this week, police also sealed off a part of Pec.
Residents there accused police on Friday of beating some ethnic
Albanians and detaining dozens. The claims could not be
independently verified.

France rejects participation in cup without change of dates
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS that FIFA unlikely to change dates, lists other
participants.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French soccer chiefs decided Friday not to send a
team to the Confederations Cup if organizer FIFA doesn't change the
competition's dates, said a French Football Federation official.
	   FIFA moved the eight-nation event in Mexico from Jan. 8-20 to
July 28-Aug. 8 to placate France, which had earlier withdrawn
because of conflicts with the European club calendar.
	   Initially, the FFF accepted the changes, but the summer dates
upset the French National League (LNF), which plans to begin its
1999-2000 championship on July 28.
	   ``The participation of France is subject to changes in the
calendar of the Confederations Cup,'' an official at the FFF, who
asked not to be identified, told The Associated Press. ``If the
calendar doesn't change, France can not participate.''
	   France wants the competition be moved to the start of the
summer.
	   The decision followed a meeting between FFF president Claude
Simonet and LNF president Noel Le Graet.
	   The withdrawal of the world champion would come as a blow to
FIFA, and greatly reduce interest in the event.
	   But FIFA, confronted with a busy global soccer calendar, seems
unlikely to bow to France's request.
	   South America's Copa Libertadores isn't scheduled to end until
June 16, and the Copa America begins June 29 and runs through July
8.
	   In addition to the world champion and host nation, FIFA invited
Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United
States to participate in the competition.

Israeli parliament leader condemns breaking helicopter contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The chairman of Israel's parliament said
Friday that Israel disapproved of the way Poland scrapped a deal to
buy Israeli-made missiles for the Huzar helicopter.
	   Dan Tichon, heading a delegation from the Knesset _ the Israeli
parliament _ on a four-day visit to Poland, criticized the
unilateral decision by Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's government on
Dec. 8 to drop the missile deal reached last year.
	   Buzek accused Israel of reneging on an agreement to allow Poland
to field test the NTD missile under local conditions. His
government also characterized the agreement signed by its
predecessor before elections last year as preliminary and said
scrapping it would bring no legal or financial consequences.
	   But Tichon said he was unconvinced by the Polish government's
reasoning, the PAP state news agency reported.
	   ``We have a rule of law'' in Israel, he said. ``The new
government respects all decisions by the previous government, even
when they are not beneficial for it.''
	   Tichon also said breaking the contract would harm Poland's
reputation among potential Israeli investors.
	   Following five years of negotiating with several potential
partners, Poland last year awarded the dlrs 800 million contract to
Israel's Rafael and Elbit Systems Ltd. companies to equip the Huzar
helicopters in line with NATO requirements.
	   Under the deal, which required approval from both governments,
Rafael was to supply the Huzar with anti-tank NTD missiles and
Elbit was to provide electronic integrating systems.
	   But Buzek's Solidarity-led government, which took office shortly
after the agreement was signed, criticized the handling of the
tenders by its ex-communist predecessors and demanded missile
tests.
	   It also decided to seek another tender for the integrating
systems, but has set no date for it.
	   With Poland scheduled to join NATO next year, it is trying to
bring its military arsenal up to NATO standards to meet all
requirements for membership.
	   In the United States, one of the unsuccessful bidders for the
Huzar contract _ the Boeing Company _ said in a statement it would
make a new offer when Poland opens the tender process again.

Government to investigate possibility of airport on manmade island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government on Friday announced
it will launch an investigation into the feasibility of building a
new national airport on a manmade island in the North Sea.
	   The nation's busiest airport, Schiphol, which is 76-percent
government owned, insists it needs such an island to allow it to
keep pace with projected growth in the global aviation market and
retain its position as Europe's fourth largest aviation hub.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok also confirmed that his ruling coalition
will allow Schiphol to grow on its current site and draw up new
legislation regulating noise and air pollution.
	   Schiphol currently is allowed no more than 400,000 takeoffs and
landings per year. New environmental regulations will allow the
airport to grow to 600,000 flight movements each year by 2010.
	   The decision could lead to a doubling of the airport's capacity
to a maximum of 80 million passengers each year. Last year, it
handled 32 million travelers.
	   Environmentalists are highly critical of what they see as
Schiphol's unfettered expansion. They recently built a miniature
runway in Transport Minister Tineke Netelenbos' garden to protest
the airport's growth.
	   Another government investigation will be set up to establish
whether Schiphol can continue to grow on its present site just
outside Amsterdam after 2010 instead of moving to the North Sea.
	   Schiphol and national flag carrier KLM Royal Dutch Airlines had
pressed the government to help get a North Sea island up and
running by 2010.
	   In Schiphol's plans, passengers would check in at the current
terminal before being whisked to the island on high-speed trains
through an undersea tunnel.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official promised
another security sweep targeting Kosovo Albanian rebels after the
battered body of a prominent Serb official was found dumped along a
roadside Friday.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing of a municipal leader just
outside Pristina, called the death ``one more attack on Serbia.''
	   ``The earth is too small for them to hide,'' he said of the
killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army and pledging new
action against them.
	   The brutal slaying of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo
Polje, 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was the latest jolt to increasingly slim hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since a U.S.-brokered
agreement in October that was intended to buy time for a political
settlement on Kosovo's future status.
	   The past week has been the bloodiest in months. Yugoslav army
border guards killed 36 guerrillas on the Albanian border,
unidentified assailants gunned down six young Serbs in a bar in the
western city of Pec, and Serb police killed two suspected rebels
and arrested 34 in a crackdown in the Pec area.
	   Friday morning, Bojanic's badly beaten body was found dumped
along the province's main east-west road, where it lay for hours _
bloodied, bruised and shot between the eyes. An American medic in
the international verification team examined it and said there were
multiple fracture wounds.
	   KLA representative Adem Demaci denied that rebels were involved
in the killing and suggested it may have been staged by Serbian
secret police. ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of
the Serbian regime,'' he said.
	   But Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   With the political atmosphere highly charged after days of Serb
rallies over the worsening violence, busloads of Serbs were brought
to a rally in Kosovo Polje within hours, where Sainovic told them
that ``every perpetrator will be prosecuted.''
	   ``Rest assured that the state will energetically respond to each
such attack, and as you have seen punishment has already caught up
with some of the perpetrators of the Pec killings,'' he said.
	   Worried U.S. officials issued a statement condemning the savage
killing and urging calm.
	   ``While there will be a great temptation to seek retribution,
that would mean surrendering to those who committed this terrible
act,'' said the statement by Richard Miles, chief mission of the
U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, and Shaun Byrnes, chief of the U.S.
Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission.
	   U.S. diplomat William Walker, head of the 2,000-strong verifiers
mission, met earlier with angry family members of some of the over
200 Serbs who have been reported missing.
	   In a heated and at times emotional meeting, he deplored the
latest ``heinous crime'' and condemned all terrorist acts as well
as abductions of innocent people for political aims.
	   ``The fate of your missing and abducted relatives is a grave
concern for us,'' Walker told the Serb delegation, as he listened
to personal accounts for more than two hours.
	   The Serb official's death came hours after Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla
fighters in a border clash Monday.
	   On Thursday, Serb police launched a crackdown on the village of
Glodjane, reportedly killing two ethnic Albanian fighters and
capturing 34 in a day-long battle searching for gunmen who
slaughtered six young Serbs in Pec.
	   Reporters heard shelling coming from the direction of Glodjane
Friday afternoon.
	   Earlier this week, police also sealed off a part of Pec.
Residents there accused police on Friday of beating some ethnic
Albanians and detaining dozens. The claims could not be
independently verified.

Lithuanians do 'The Video Stomp' in unusual happening

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Cheering and laughing, a crowd writhed
on the main street of Vilnius' Old Town as they smashed tens of
thousands of pirated videoptapes under their feet Friday.
	   The unusual event was organized by the Lithuanian company Garsu
Pasaulis, which represents Hollywood giants including Warner
Brothers and Tri-Star in the Baltic country, as a way of drawing
attention to the problem of unauthorized videotapes of movies.
	   Lithuania, like many former Soviet republics, has not
established effective laws against video and audio pirating. The
Lithuanian Copyright Association estimates that 70 percent of the
tapes of Western movies sold in the country are pirated copies.
	   ''This is just a drop in the ocean, this amount lying here,''
company official Aris Azguridis said of the 32,126 pirate tapes
that were placed on the street.
	   The crowd of stompers were attracted partly by the opportunity
just to blow off steam in an unusual way and partly by the offer of
a free authorized tape of ''Godzilla'' to those judged to be the
best dancers.
	   But not everyone on the street was in high spirits.
	   ''What are they doing?'' shouted an appalled onlooker. ''They
should give them to us!''
	   The event was to be repeated on Saturday and Sunday.

Decision on new director general put off until January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Faced with continuing indecision by the United
States and European Union, members of the World Trade Organization
agreed Friday to give themselves more time to choose a new
director-general.
	   The trade body's general council said that the end of January
would now be the ``timeframe'' for a decision. The United States
objected to the use of the word ``deadline,'' indicating that the
process might drag on still further.
	   There are four candidates: Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi has the most support so far declared. Former New
Zealand Premier Mike Moore is in second place, followed by Moroccan
trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub and former Canadian Trade Minister
Roy Maclaren.
	   But this may change dramatically depending on what Washington
and Brussels decide.
	   The WTO post is regarded as a key one, especially at a time when
the free trade system championed by the WTO faces growing pressure
because of the global economic turmoil.
	   The director-general will have to guide the organization into
the next century and try to narrow differences between rich and
poor on whether labor standards and the environment should be on
the future trade agenda.
	   The two diplomats charged with finding a successor for Ruggiero
will carry out a new round of international consultations in
mid-January.
	   WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said the atmosphere at Friday's
meeting was positive.
	   But Jamaican trade ambassador Anthony Hill complained to
journalists that the failure of the United States and the EU to
declare a preference was ``a sort of insider dealing.''
	   ``When a few hold back, and especially if they are influential,
they can look at the support and then decide,'' said Hill.
	   American trade ambassador Rita Hayes said her country would make
a decision during January.
	   It is hoped that a scheduled general council meeting Feb. 16
will be able to approve the candidate.

Belarus bans opposition leaders from running for office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The Belarusian parliament unanimously
adopted a bill Friday that effectively bars opposition leaders from
running for any public office in this former Soviet republic.
	   The bill says that people who have been found guilty even of a
minor ``administrative'' offense _ such as taking part in
unauthorized rallies _ may not run in any election.
	   Nearly all Belarusian opposition leaders and many members of
opposition movements have been convicted of participating in
rallies, and are therefore barred from running for office, even for
a village council.
	   Authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko bans opposition
rallies in Belarus, and his police routinely club and seize
participants, who are then usually summarily convicted by courts.
	   ``Lukashenko panics when he thinks of free elections,''
prominent opposition leader Gennady Karpenko told The Associated
Press.
	   To become law, the bill needs to be signed by Lukashenko.
	   Lukashenko had personally proposed the clause barring convicted
rally participants from running for office, and had threatened to
impose it by decree if parliament failed to approve it.
	   Belarus' parliament is made up largely of Lukashenko supporters
hand-picked by the president after he disbanded a popularly elected
legislature two years ago.
	   The bill also brings the minimum turnout required to make
elections valid to 25 percent, from the current 50 percent. The
change means that even if opposition supporters boycott an
election, it will be much harder for them to prevent victory by
pro-government candidates.
	   ``Under the current regime no elections _ democratic or
half-democratic _ are possible,'' said Vincuk Vyacherka, deputy
head of the main opposition party, Belarusian Popular Front.

Ukraine's central bank lowers discount rate to 60 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank cut its key interest
rate Friday after the bank's chairman said the financial market had
become stable enough to permit the move.
	   The National Bank lowered the discount rate from 82 percent to
60 percent as of Dec. 21 and told commercial banks to adjust their
interest rates to the new figure, the bank said in a statement.
	   The discount rate was last changed in July.
	   The decision came several days after National Bank chairman
Viktor Yushchenko said Ukraine's currency market had started to
show signs of stability after it was badly shaken by the economic
crisis in neighboring Russia.
	   Russia's crisis sharply devalued Ukraine's hryvna currency in
September and virtually halted Ukrainian bank lending. But the
National Bank has stabilized the hryvna, and annual rates on
commercial bank loans that had skyrocketed to 100 percent have
fallen drastically since October.

Italian official says pope will be in Assisi for 1999 reopening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASSISI, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II will celebrate Mass for
the reopening of the quake-damaged St. Francis' Basilica during the
1999 Christmas season, an Italian official said Friday.
	   No date has been set for the reopening of the entire basilica,
rocked by the Sept. 26, 1997 quakes that hit central Italy. But
officials have said they are aiming to open to the public the upper
level of the two-level basilica by Christmas 1999. The lower level
was reopened earlier this year.
	   An undersecretary in Italy's culture ministry, Giampaolo
D'Andrea, said the pope would lead the ceremony to mark the
basilica's reopening.
	   Four people perished in the 13th-century basilica when large
portions of the vaulted ceiling crashed down. The quake also
destroyed or ravaged priceless works of art.
	   In January 1998, the pope went to Assisi to comfort the victims.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A growing number of Indians would prefer
a government headed by the Italian-born widow of former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi to the fractious ruling coalition led by
Hindu nationalists, a magazine poll says.
	   The poll for next week's edition of the newsweekly India Today
says that if elections were held now, the centrist Congress party
headed by Sonia Gandhi would win 300 out of 545 seats in
parliament, almost twice the number it won in general elections in
February.
	   An advance copy of the poll was made available to The Associated
Press on Friday.
	   The strength of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party and its 18 coalition partners would fall from the current 252
to 135 seats, the poll predicted.
	   The poll, conducted less than a month after the BJP took a
drubbing in state elections, covered 19,000 voters from various
castes and religions in 79 parliamentary constituencies across 16
of India's 25 states. No margin of error was given.
	   The poll shows that while the government's image has taken a
beating because of electoral losses and spiraling prices, Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee remains popular. But for the first
time since he became premier, Vajpayee's popularity ratings was
overtaken by Sonia Gandhi's.
	   Thirty-one percent of those surveyed said she would make the
best prime minister, as compared with 27 percent for Vajpayee.
	   Hours before the findings of the poll were made known to the
press, Gandhi said her Congress party would like to give India a
stable, unified government.
	   ``While we welcome the support of like-minded parties, we would
like to make it clear that we must aim to provide a stable
government of our own,'' local news agencies quoted her as saying
at the opening of a party conference.
	   ``We know what good governance is,'' said Gandhi, whose Congress
led India for most of its 51 years of independence. ``People are
tired of the fractious coalition and coming together of forces
solely with the craving for power.''
	   Plagued by scandal, the Congress lost power in 1989 elections
and India has been led for much of the past decade by coalitions
that often have been accused of indecisiveness and infighting.
	   Hoping to widen the party's support base, Gandhi announced
Friday that 33 percent of party positions would be set aside for
women. Another 20 percent would be reserved for member's of India's
lower castes and minorities, she said.

<TEXT>
	   A look at some other world leaders in political trouble:
	   ___
	   RUSSIA: The economy is disintegrating and much of the government
just doesn't work any more. Ailing President Boris Yeltsin is
facing calls for impeachment, but the movement is unlikely to
succeed, even though his public approval ratings are in single
digits.
	   ___
	   ISRAEL: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will call
early elections if he cannot garner a parliamentary majority by
Monday. Likely to vote against him are coalition hard-liners
steadfast against further concessions to the Palestinians, and
doves who say he is sabotaging the Wye peace accord. He'll probably
have to face balloting by April.
	   ___
	   TURKEY: Bulent Ecevit, a center-left political veteran, says he
is abandoning efforts to form Turkey's fifth government since 1995,
unable to build a coalition or a minority Cabinet.
	   ___
	   INDIA: Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee depends on a
fractious coalition of 18 partners that has neared collapse many
times. His right-wing Hindu party lost recent state elections,
increasing his vulnerability.
	   ___
	   INDONESIA: President B.J. Habibie is plagued by his association
with Suharto, his authoritarian predecessor and former mentor. The
same students who helped oust Suharto in May have staged near-daily
protests demanding swifter democratic change. Habibie's power base
is weak and he is dependent on the support of the military.

Celtic turns down Dalglish, Kerr takeover proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ An ambitious bid by Kenny Dalglish and
Simple Minds lead singer Jim Kerr to take over ownership of Glasgow
Celtic has been turned down by the club's owners.
	   Dalglish, a star player for the team in the late 1970s, and rock
star Kerr head a consortium planning to launch a takeover bid. But
managing director Fergus McCann and vice chairman Brian Quinn
announced on Friday that their proposals were short of what they
considered the club's market value.
	   ``I have not given five years of my life to Celtic, along with
my fellow directors, to take it from bankruptcy to a point of
strength and then recommend a proposal which fails to reflect
Celtic's values and aspirations,'' McCann said.

Titanic postcard sold for dlrs 24,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A postcard from the doomed Titanic, never mailed
by the teen-age passenger who wrote it, was sold at auction Friday
for more than 14,000 pounds (dlrs 24,000).
	   Second-class passenger Edith Brown wrote the card to her
stepsister in South Africa, but still had it in her pocket when she
jumped from the sinking oceanliner into a lifeboat on the night of
April 14, 1912.
	   The buyer was Thomas Rogers, owner of a shipping services
company in Belfast, the city where the Titanic was built. Sotheby's
auction house said Rogers paid 14,375 pounds (dlrs 24,150) because
he thought the postcard should be brought ``home.''
	   More than 1,500 people died after the Titanic struck an iceberg
and sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New
York.
	   Young Edith was a survivor, making her leap into the lifeboat as
it was being lowered to the water, thus disobeying the orders of a
crewman who warned her she would ``upset the balance.''
	   The slightly water-stained card of the ship, which the
16-year-old eventually delivered to her stepsister by hand, reads:
``We are just sailing today by this boat for New York ... 4,000 ton
... EB.''
	   The stepsister's granddaughter was the seller of the postcard.

Russian general and security chief name top arts judge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Artistic achievement in Russia will from now on be
judged by an army general and security chief.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree naming Gen. Nikolai
Bordyuzha, chief of the presidential security council and the
country's former border troops commander, as head of the
presidential commission for awards in literature and arts, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported Friday.
	   But Bordyuzha also serves as Yeltsin's chief of staff _ whose
duties include chairing the awards commission.
	   The previous chief of staff, Valentin Yumashev, was sacked in a
reshuffle of the Yeltsin administration earlier this month, and
Bordyuzha is taking over his duties.
	   Bordyuzha's duties may largely be symbolic, as he is likely to
have aides selecting nominees for the awards, and would only have
to give formal approval to their selections.

Cup since 1994. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Anatoly Byshovets, who coached the Soviet Union to
the 1988 Olympic soccer gold, was dismissed Friday as Russia's
national team coach following an 0-3 start to the squad's European
Championship qualifying campaign.
	   Byshovets, who took over the national team in July and had a
contract through the 2002 World Cup, was fired by a 14-0 vote of
the Football Union of Russia board, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   His dismissal was ``in connection with the unsatisfactory
performances by (the Russian team) in qualifying games for the
European Championship,'' the Interfax news agency reported, citing
the soccer union.
	   Russia was beaten 3-2 by Ukraine in Kiev on Sept. 5 and followed
that with a 3-2 loss to World Cup champion France on Oct. 10 in
Moscow.
	   But the blow that sealed Byshovets fate came four days later in
Reykjavik, when lightly regarded Iceland upset Russia 1-0.
	   Russia has not qualified for the World Cup since 1994.
	   No replacement for Byshovets was named.
	   Byshovets was one of the Soviet Union's best players in the late
1960s and early 1970s. From 1963-73 he was a forward for Dinamo
Kiev and scored four goals in four matches at the 1970 World Cup.
	   The Russian federation has been plagued by corruption, power
struggles and violence in recent years.

IOC official says Hodler offered only `hearsay' allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The senior IOC member who sparked the biggest
ethics scandal in Olympics history told colleagues he had no facts
to support allegations of widespread payoffs, the head of an
inquiry into corruption charges said Friday.
	   Marc Hodler, the longest-serving member of the International
Olympic Committee and one of its most respected, told the
committee's executive board that he had only second-hand knowledge
of vote buying in choosing Olympic host cities, IOC vice president
Dick Pound said.
	   ``He was asked to tell the board what he knew, to share the
facts with us,'' Pound said. ``He told us, `I have no facts. It's
all hearsay.'''
	   Hodler, an 80-year-old Swiss lawyer who has served on the IOC
since 1963, was unavailable for comment on Pound's statements. His
son, Beat, said in a telephone interview from the Swiss capital of
Bern that Hodler would have nothing further to say as ``a legal
policy not to interfere in the investigation. ... He brought out
what he thinks he needs to be brought out.''
	   He also said his father had been hospitalized for a checkup but
was OK.
	   ``There is nothing to worry about,'' Beat Hodler said. ``He's a
man of 80. He's gone through a period of stress. He's allowed to
take a day or two to recover.''
	   Pound was appointed Dec. 11 to head a five-member panel
investigating allegations that relatives of six IOC members
received scholarships from the Salt Lake City bid for the 2002
Winter Games. The Utah capital won that race in an overwhelming
vote in 1995; shortly thereafter, the scholarship fund was
disbanded.
	   Hodler is a member of the executive board, chairman of the IOC
commission coordinating the Salt Lake Winter Games, and head of its
ethics panel. But Pound said he remained silent as the board
discussed the case, which was first reported by a Utah TV station
and later confirmed by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.
	   The next day, Hodler told reporters that corruption in choosing
Olympic hosts went much further, with vote buying in the elections
that picked Atlanta (1996), Nagano (1998) and Sydney (2000).
	   He said four people, including one IOC member, acted as agents
offering blocks of votes in exchange for bribes of up to dlrs 5
million. He said he knew the agents' names but would not identify
them.
	   Hodler also said that 5-7 percent of the IOC's 115 members were
open to bribery, later estimating that 25 had taken payoffs in the
1996-2002 campaigns but again refusing to identify them. He said he
spoke out because he feared the matter would be ignored.
	   Pound said the IOC was stunned by Hodler's timing.
	   ``That was the weird thing about it,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his Montreal law office. ``We had already appointed
the (Salt Lake) inquiry.''
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said the ethics inquiry
would expand to other cities only if hard evidence of corruption
was presented. Pound said that was what made the Salt Lake City
case a unique opportunity for change.
	   ``People who pay money don't talk about it and people who take
money don't talk about it,'' he said. ``This is the first time we
have had something approaching a smoking gun. It can be a good
thing, if it gives us the chance to restate and Olympic ideals and
say, `We don't do this sort of thing.'''

Ex-premier of Nova Scotia acquitted of sex-assault charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Gerald Regan, a former premier of
Nova Scotia, was acquitted Friday of sex-crimes charges involving
three woman who claimed he assaulted them as teen-agers in the
1950s and '60s.
	   The six-week trial was a test of credibility between Regan, now
70, and his accusers, who gave emotional accounts of the alleged
assaults but lacked corroborating testimony.
	   The jury, reduced to 10 after two jurors were excused,
deliberated for about eight hours over two days before acquitting
Regan _ one of Nova Scotia's best-known politicians _ on all eight
charges stemming from the three alleged incidents.
	   ``It's been a long ordeal,'' said Regan, his wife by his side.
``We're tremendously relieved at the verdict.''
	   The verdict was a huge setback for Nova Scotia prosecutors, who
began assembling a case against Regan in 1993 and collected
information from more than 20 women who said Regan had made
unwanted sexual advances on them.
	   Most of the allegations were set aside, but three cases
considered the most serious went to trial Nov. 2 after prolonged
legal wrangling.
	   Defense lawyer Edward Greenspan attributed the verdict to some
inconsistencies in the accounts of the accusers and to the strong
showings of Regan and his wife, Carole, when they testified.
	   During his testimony, Regan emphatically denied each charge _
that he raped one 14-year-old girl in 1956, attempted to rape
another 14-year-old a few months later, and in 1969, while
opposition leader in the Nova Scotia legislature, tried to rape one
of his office workers.
	   The eight charges included one count of rape, two of attempted
rape, three of indecent assault and two of unlawful confinement.
	   Regan was Nova Scotia's premier from 1970-78, and later a
federal Cabinet minister.
	   The chief prosecutor, Adrian Reid, did not rule out the
possibility of an appeal. He also praised the three accusers.
	   ``Our respect for their courage and their integrity is in no way
diminished by this verdict,'' Reid said. ``Sexual assaults are
always difficult to prove. By their very nature, they are committed
in circumstances where corroboration is lacking.''
	   Two of the cases dated to 1956, when Regan, now 70, was a lawyer
and sportscaster in the small Nova Scotia town of Windsor. Two
accusers said they were assaulted as teen-agers in separate
incidents after accepting rides home with Regan.
	   Each accuser said she lacked the confidence to press charges in
the immediate aftermath of the alleged attacks.
	   Canada has no statute of limitations for serious crimes.
Greenspan, commenting after the verdict, said the outcome of this
trial should prompt Parliament to consider creating a statute of
limitations for sexual-assault cases.

Chile revives efforts to persuade Britain to release Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Encouraged by Britain's highest court to
nullify its ruling denying immunity to Gen. Augusto Pinochet, Chile
will revive efforts to have the British government release the
former dictator, the government said Friday.
	   Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza said his government would
formally request a reversal of Home Secretary Jack Straw's decision
allowing Spain's efforts to extradite Pinochet on charges of
genocide and torture to go forward.
	   Insulza said an official request probably will be filed with
British authorities this weekend.
	   ``We believe it's time for secretary Straw to review his
decision,'' Insulza said. ``If the Lords were able to review their
decision, I don't see why others can't do the same.''
	   He continued: ``When Secretary Straw announced his decision, he
flatly rejected suggestions the ruling by the Lords had some
failure. And he said that should new facts emerge, he could review
his point of view.''
	   Britain's highest court, the House of Lords, annulled its
decision Thursday by a 5-0 vote, ordering a new hearing for
Pinochet following the revelation one of the five ruling judges had
ties with the human rights group Amnesty International.
	   The Lords thus accepted the argument by Pinochet's lawyers that
the original 3-2 vote against him on Nov. 25 was improper.
	   In setting aside their ruling, the Lords ruled that a new
hearing should be held for Pinochet, probably on Jan. 18. The
Chilean government has said it will support Pinochet as an
`intervening part'' in the case.
	   Insulza said humanitarian reasons or even expulsion from Britian
could be the basis for a decision to let Pinochet return home.
	   Pinochet, 83, was arrested Oct. 16 at a London clinic while
recovering from back surgery. He remains under police custody at a
rented suburban mansion.
	   An investigation by the civilian government that succeeded
Pinochet established that people were killed or went missing at the
hands of security services during his 1973-1990 reign.
	   The strategy announced Friday by Insulza was suggested Thursday
by President Eduardo Frei with strong support from Pinochet's
rightist loyalists.
	   ``It seems logical that Sen. Pinochet be allowed to return to
Chile and to allow us Chileans to decide our own affairs,'' Frei
said.
	   The government has insisted it is defending principles, not a
specific person, in working on behalf of Pinochet.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with balloon already in Algeria. &QL; 
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) _ British tycoon Richard Branson,
Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett and teammate Per Lindstrand
sailed aloft Friday looking to guide their 200-foot-high (61-meter)
balloon on a landmark round-the-world voyage.
	   Good weather, a good wind and a cloudless sky augured well for
the travelers in their quest to become the first to circle the
globe in a balloon.
	   Just seven hours after liftoff at a Moroccan airforce base, the
12-ton ICO Global Challenge was cruising at 29,000 feet (8,840
meters) over the Atlas mountains, according to Jackie McQuillan,
spokeswoman for ICO Global, a mobile telephone company supporting
the trip.
	   ``They are very happy with how it's going so far, and nothing
has happened to make them think it won't be a successful flight,''
she said.
	   The balloon later crossed into Algeria ahead of schedule and was
expected to arrive in Libyan airspace Saturday morning, project
director Mike Kendrick said after speaking to Branson by satellite
telephone.
	   Some 500 people, including Moroccan musicians and Berber
horsemen, gathered for the 0922 GMT liftoff, which went without a
hitch after a two-hour delay.
	   ``The tricky part is getting through the first 24 hours,''
Branson said shortly before liftoff. ``After that we can start to
relax and enjoy the flight.''
	   Branson and his colleagues, all wearing silver jumpsuits,
expressed confidence in the trip, estimating it could last from
eight days to nearly three weeks.
	   The U.S. missile strike on Iraq has complicated the task,
Branson said.
	   ``This flight around the world would have taken 9 and a half
days, but for the Iraqi problem,'' Branson told reporters.
	   ``Now, we will be happy to complete the voyage in 10-20 days.''
	   The missile strike means the team will have to find the winds to
take them north of Iraq through Turkey instead of cutting over
Saudi Arabia.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and had only four refusals -- Iran, Iraq, Russia and North Korea.
	   Fossett has made four tries to ring the globe, the last one
ending when his Solo Spirit was ripped apart in a violent storm off
Australia.
	   ``I am nervous at the launch of all balloon flights,'' Fossett
said ahead of the liftoff. ``Once we get to altitude and we know
what our problems are, if any, then it will be very relaxed.''
	   Branson has tried, and failed, four times to become the first
person to trek the globe in a balloon. The only time he managed to
take off, in January 1997, his balloon crashed a day after takeoff,
landing in the Algerian desert.
	   ICO Global spokesman Mike Johnson said the crew was more
confident this time because of the better technology used to build
the balloon, including a Kevlar canopy over the crew's pressurized
capsule. Kevlar is used for bulletproof vests.
	   At least three other balloon crews have been waiting for
favorable weather to launch their balloon -- from Albuquerque, New
Mexico, Loves Park, Illinois and the Swiss Alps. Yet another team
is to take off next month from Alice Springs, Australia.

Russia warns that Iraq crisis could wreck ties with U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin and Clinton exchanging letters in 11th
graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow denounced the United States on Friday with
the kind of rhetoric not seen since the Cold War, demanding an end
to attacks on Iraq and warning that relations with the West could
be badly damaged.
	   In a rare display of political consensus, President Boris
Yeltsin and his Communist and nationalist opponents harshly
criticized the U.S. and British attacks on Iraq with verbal
broadsides reminiscent of the Soviet era.
	   ``We condemn the United States, and nobody should doubt our
negative attitude,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Friday the U.S. and
British strikes ``flagrantly violated the norms of the
international law and openly ignored the world community's efforts
to settle the situation.'' Sergeyev said Moscow's relations with
NATO were threatened.
	   The Foreign Ministry called for a halt to the air attacks and a
U.N. Security Council meeting to restore peace in Baghdad, a
longtime Soviet and Russian friend.
	   The Iraq crisis underlines Moscow's loss of global influence and
the unhappiness of some Russian political leaders and officials
about close post-Soviet ties with the West. Russian officials are
furious that they can do little more than complain, recalling how
the Soviet Union might have been able to use its global muscle to
prevent such an attack.
	   But Russia is no longer a global power and even the most
vehement critics of the West admit privately that Moscow will do
little more than growl and indulge in half-hearted sabre rattling.
Russia, caught in its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse, needs the West far too much.
	   The Kremlin, apparently concerned about the growing rhetoric at
a time when it is desperate for Western aid, was already toning
down some of the criticism. Presidential aides stressed there was
no question of breaking relations with the United States or Great
Britain even though Moscow recalled its ambassadors to protest the
airstrikes.
	   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towards confrontation (with the West), but we should call
things by their name. The military strikes are unacceptable and
should be stopped,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a
Kremlin press briefing.
	   Senior officials hastened to add that Russia still wants Western
food aid and new loans from the International Monetary Fund. None
of that is possible with the support of Washington.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a letter to Yeltsin on Friday
defending the decision to attack, and Yeltsin responded with a
message to Clinton through Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Contents
of Yeltsin's message were not disclosed.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, passed an
appeal to Yeltsin on Friday calling for Russia to unilaterally
break U.N. sanctions against Iraq and provide aid to Baghdad.
	   Such a move is not binding on the government and Yeltsin is
unlikely to take any real action.
	   In unusually strong criticism from the military, Gen. Leonid
Ivashov, the head of the Defense Ministry's international military
cooperation department, said the attack could lead to a rift with
the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as
saying.
	   The Russian navy put some units on alert because of the Iraq
crisis, but there had been no deployment of ships, officials said.
The move appeared purely symbolic. The Russian military is not
considered an effective force after years of neglect and poor
funding.
	   Yeltsin is under opposition pressure to curb ties with the West
at a time when he has lost much of his political clout because of
health problems and his failure to handle the economic crisis.
	   Still, Yeltsin, who was mainly angry about not being informed
about the attack in advance, has staked his foreign policy on good
ties with the West and is not likely to change course.

France, skeptical of airstrikes, calls Butler report vague
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with anti-American demonstration &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSANNAH PATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France said Friday that chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler's report, which triggered U.S. and British
airstrikes, was vague and ``raised many questions.''
	   ``Mr. Butler's report contains a number of vague statements,''
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said at a news
briefing. ``The report raises questions _ a good number of
questions.''
	   She did not specify which points France considered vague.
	   Gazeau-Secret also said France regretted not having had the
opportunity to review Butler's report before the United States and
Britain began airstrikes against Iraq early Thursday.
	   The Foreign Ministry's complaints, coming after French President
Jacques Chirac said Thursday that the U.S. military strikes against
Iraq would not solve the crisis, further emphasized France's
discomfort with the developments.
	   In Paris on Friday night, about 500 people demonstrated against
the airstrikes. ``Immediately stop the bombings,'' and ``Clinton
killer.''
	   The French president, meanwhile, told Britain's Prime Minister
Tony Blair in a phone conversation they needed to find a solution
to the Iraqi crisis ``as soon as possible,'' presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.
	   The Foreign Ministry criticism of the Butler's work came after
the left-leaning daily newspaper Liberation claimed Friday that the
chief U.N. weapons inspector had provoked the crisis with a
deliberately biased report.
	   Citing diplomatic sources at the United Nations, Liberation said
Butler had exaggerated a small number of Iraqi transgressions and
left out over 300 instances where they had fully complied with
weapons inspectors. The daily did not identify its sources by name.
	   Meanwhile, Butler on Thursday defended his report that Iraq did
not fully cooperate with U.N. monitors and said he had no intention
of quitting.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said Moscow would insist on
Butler's dismissal.
	   ``I want to say simply, slowly and plainly that any suggestion
that that report was not factual, was not objective, is utterly
false,'' Butler said.
	   In the past month, the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM,
which Butler heads, has tested the promise Iraq made on Nov. 14,
under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, to resume full
cooperation with UNSCOM. Butler's report concluded Iraq had fallen
short of compliance.
	   The French Foreign Ministry also complained that Butler had
repeatedly evacuated U.N. monitors from Iraq without consulting the
Security Council.

Estonian shipping company to sue Finns over refusal to unload

ships &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ The Estonian Shipping Company says it
will file suit against Finnish dockworkers who have refused to
unload the company's ships for a week, the Baltic News Service
reported Friday.
	   The company, Estonia's largest shipping concern, said it will
demand dlrs 2.7 million in compensation, according to BNS.
	   Finnish longshoremen have refused to unload several Estonian
freighters for a week, demanding that pay for Estonian seamen be
raised to Finnish levels.
	   Estonian seamen make about dlrs 300 a month, compared with dlrs
2,500 in Finland. Estonian shipping officials say the action by the
Finnish seamen's union is aimed at squeezing cheaper Estonian cargo
ships out of lucrative routes.
	   Rein Merisalu, head of the Estonian shipowners' association,
said that even top government officials make only about dlrs 2,000
a month and ''it is unthinkable and quite impossible for a sailor
to earn more than the prime minister,'' BNS said.

Yeltsin meets intelligence officers on their professional holiday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin welcomed Russia's top
secret service agents in the Kremlin to honor their professional
holiday Friday.
	   ``The history of the (Russian) state security agencies has quite
a few dramatic and even tragic pages, but also many brilliant
operations that many of the world's special services can envy,''
Yeltsin said in an speech to mark Russia's Security Services Day.
	   Soviet-era intelligence services, from the first Bolshevik
secret police to the KGB, organized and carried out mass arrests
and even executions of opponents of the Communist regime.
	   Yeltsin disbanded the KGB after the 1991 Soviet collapse, saying
he wanted to get rid of organizations that symbolized Soviet
oppression. The KGB was replaced with several smaller agencies.
	   Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness,
appeared vigorous and spoke firmly at Friday's reception.
	   The Russian leader has suffered several ailments recently, and
has spent most of the past two weeks at a country residence, with
only occasional visits to the Kremlin.
	   In his address, Yeltsin urged the security services to fight
organized crime and solve contract murders, which have become a
routine occurrence in Russia and usually remain unsolved.
	   Yeltsin also praised the security service leaders as ``a
harmonious team of professionals,'' the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The FSB, the main successor to the KGB, has come under strong
public criticism recently. Several FSB officers have accused their
bosses of ordering contract killings, extortion and other crimes.
	   The Russian president also met with his visiting Croatian
counterpart Franjo Tudjman in the Kremlin to discuss promoting a
peace settlement in the Balkans and bilateral cooperation.

1999 budget 8.5 percent higher; no deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Rejecting criticism from the opposition,
Croatia's parliament adopted Friday a budget for 1999 that is 8.5
percent larger than the previous year's.
	   The 49.04 billion kuna (dlrs 7.90 billion) budget, which does
not foresee a deficit, passed the 127-seat parliament _ largely
dominated by deputies of President Franjo Tudjman's party _ by a
vote of 82-1.
	   The opposition argued the budget was too high for a poor country
and too much money is dedicated to the military and government
services.
	   While the government claimed the budget aims to boost the
economy and improve citizens' worsened living standards, the lion's
share of the planned expenditures, about 12.4 billion kuna (drls 2
billion), was again allotted to the military, war veterans and the
police.
	   An additional 688 million kuna (dlrs 111 million) is earmarked
for the military and other needs of Croats in neighboring Bosnia _
a sum previously kept under wraps.
	   Despite recent cuts in medical supplies and some hospitals
facing closures due to financial troubles, only 1.1 billion kuna
(dlrs 177 million) was allotted to the health ministry.
	   According to Finance Minister Borislav Skegro, the budget
envisages that real growth of the gross domestic product will reach
5 percent, while inflation would stay at about 3 percent.
	   Skego said that taxes, combined with sales of the some of the
most profitable state-owned companies, such as telecommunications,
should provide enough resources to cover all planned expenditures.

Newspapers denounce airstrikes as diversion from Clinton sex
</HEADLINE>
scandal &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH SEWARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's top newspaper commentators in dailies on
the left and the right on Friday denounced the airstrikes on Iraq
as a deadly diversion that may end up costing President Bill
Clinton _ and America _ in lost prestige.
	   ``Mr. Clinton's decision was of course too much aimed at masking
the stinging personal failure of his trip to Israel and to delay
the impeachment vote,'' wrote Alain Peyrefitte, a former spokesman
for Gen. Charles de Gaulle, in the conservative Le Figaro daily.
	   The French _ more than most nations _ have been willing to wink
at Clinton's dalliances. But the country has been a longstanding
supporter of Iraq and there is little backing for the airstrikes.
	   ``It's the most murderous oral sex in history,'' wrote
editor-in-chief Serge July in the leftist Liberation daily. The
strikes, July continued, ``could more surely ruin the credibility
of Bill Clinton than Monica Lewinsky.''
	   Other European newspapers and commentators were not far behind
in their scathing assessment of Clinton's leadership.
	   The respected Portuguese daily Publico said on the editorial
page in Friday's edition that Clinton ``should already have gone.''
Spain's La Vanguardia said the timing of the attacks had ``raised
all sorts of suspicions over Clinton's initiative.''
	   In contrast to the careful reaction of Greece's government,
newspapers on the left and right blasted Clinton's actions in Iraq,
insisting he was trying to wriggle out of ``Monica Gate'' as it is
called in Greece.
	   ``The smart bombs may have hit their target in Iraq but they
have caused greater damage to the United States and Bill Clinton.
It appears Clinton's aides are leading him to his Waterloo. He has
only bought himself a few days time.''
	   Northern European newspapers were just as harsh.
	   Norway's Dagbladet, said ``The war against Iraq gave Bill
Clinton one day to breath before the impeachment. But not even
Saddam Hussein had the symbolic power to stop the American
President's drift toward the edge.''
	   In Britain, whose forces are participating in the attacks
against Iraq, the comings and going of Royal Air Force tornadoes
overshadowed the impeachment proceedings.
	   Mews of the impeachment was on the inside pages of the papers,
where The Guardian newspaper called the situation, ``Clinton's
blunder.''
	   ``Many U.S. citizens are asking themselves whether Clinton is a
leader or a liar,'' said The Sun. And commentator Paul Routledge
writing in the Mirror tabloid said although Clinton should not be
ousted for his affair with Monica Lewinsky ``I do passionately feel
that his reputation is not worth the life of a single Iraqi
child.''
	   Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq for its alleged
obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors, who are responsible for
certifying that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are dismantled.
	   Until the inspectors certify that Iraq is free of the banned
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which triggered
the Persian Gulf War.

Parliament outlaws tinted car windows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Parliament has approved a law banning
tinted windows in cars to help police identify criminals.
	   The bill was approved in response to complaints that criminals
were using cars with tinted windows to avoid being identified. The
measure was supported by women's and consumers' groups who said
women had been raped inside cars and that drivers had fled the
scene of accidents while hidden from view inside their vehicles.
	   The measure set fines of dlrs 30 U.S. for the first infraction
and dlrs 50 for a second offense, along with suspension of the
driver's license.

Britain shows videos of attacks on military targets

 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with new quotes from Blair, demonstrations; ADDS
byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT SEELY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.S. and British warplanes unleashed a third
wave of strikes against Iraq, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Friday that the operation to limit Saddam Hussein's military
power was on course.
	   ``There is no doubt at all that we are significantly damaging
Saddam Hussein's military capability and reducing therefore ... the
threat that he poses to the region and to the world,'' Blair said
outside his Downing Street office.
	   The prime minister described Saddam as ``a man who every time he
is given the chance to use violence and terror, will do so,'' and
said that the aim of British and United States policy was to ``do
all we can to bring about an end to his rule.''
	   Britain's part in the U.S.-led air campaign is begin carried out
by 12 Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers based in Kuwait.
	   Earlier Friday, journalists were shown videos of bombing
missions taken by British Tornados jets. The targets seen exploding
were described as a radar missile site, a hardened aircraft shelter
at the Tallil air base in southwestern Iraq and an aircraft hangar.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson, speaking at a news
conference, said one objective of the attacks was to stop Iraq's
development of pilotless aircraft.
	   Blair had a round of telephone conversations Friday with leaders
of several nations, seeking to firm up support for the U.S.-British
operation.
	   His office said they included German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, and that he
also planned to speak to Crown Prince Abdullah, first deputy prime
minister of Saudi Arabia.
	   Five police officers were injured and five protesters arrested
after 200 people staged anti-war demonstrations outside Britain's
Ministry of Defense in central London.
	   Former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath also criticized the Iraqi
bombing, saying it had no clear purpose.
	   ``The whole setting of this enterprise has been so dubious,
especially when the president of the United States has his own
domestic problems,'' Heath said in an interview with British
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   The military aims, Heath said, ``have not been clearly defined
at all. If you ask what is the purpose, there is no answer.''

U.N. court gives U.S., British lawyers more time in Lockerbie case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court has given the
United States and Britain an extra three months to file written
arguments in a case brought by Libya arguing that Tripoli has the
right to try the two Lockerbie bombing suspects.
	   The extra time was granted by the court in the light of recent
diplomatic efforts to have the suspects extradited to the
Netherlands to stand trial under Scottish law in a specially
convened court.
	   The Scottish case on Dutch soil and the World Court proceedings
are not directly linked, but if Libya hands over the suspects for a
Scottish trial, the World Court case becomes moot and will likely
be dropped.
	   Libya filed its case with the World Court in March 1992 claiming
an international civil aviation treaty gives it the right to try
two Libyans accused of planting the bomb that blew Pan Am Flight
103 out of the sky above the Scottish village of Lockerbie on Dec.
21, 1988, killing 270, including 11 on the ground.
	   U.S. and British officials preparing written submissions in the
case asked for more time in the light of ``recent diplomatic
initiatives.'' In a brief press statement announcing the extension,
the court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
gave no further details.
	   Libya is believed to be close to handing over the suspects for a
trial under Scottish law in the central Netherlands.
	   The United States and Britain had been due to file their
submissions by Dec. 30, but now have until March 31. After filing
their written cases, both sides then are called to appear at the
Hague-based court to present their arguments orally.

Vatican: pope has light case of flu
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS; UPDATES with Vatican official saying pope was
much better in evening, appointments for Saturday expected to be
canceled &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The flu forced Pope John Paul to cancel his
appointments on Friday, the Vatican said, but the pontiff
reportedly was feeling better by evening.
	   Still, the 78-year-old pontiff, who has been slowed in recent
years by various ailments, was expected to miss his Saturday
engagements as well, including a Christmas concert at the Vatican
where he was supposed to be the honored guest.
	   Earlier in the day papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said
John Paul had a fever of 38 degrees Celsius (100 F) as part of a
mild flu. By evening, the Italian news agency ANSA reported, the
fever had gone down by almost a degree (99 F).
	   A Vatican official, speaking on condition of anonymity, wouldn't
comment on the reported improvement in the pope's temperature. But
he said the pope was ``much better'' in the evening.
	   Among audiences canceled Friday were meetings with the Catholic
patriarch of Iraq and a representative of the Arab League.
	   For Saturday, the pope's engagements were supposed to include a
meeting with the governor of Macao as well as the concert.
	   The next public appearance scheduled was the pope's weekly
blessing Sunday at noon from his studio window overlooking St.
Peter's Square.
	   The flu hit at the start of the busy holiday period, when he has
made few concessions for his age and health.
	   In the only change in recent years, the frail John Paul no
longer celebrates Mass Christmas morning in St. Peter's Basilica to
allow himself more time to rest after midnight Mass Christmas eve,
which he was still scheduled to celebrate.
	   Also still on the schedule was his delivery of his annual
holiday message at noon on Christmas.
	   His next planned foreign trip is to Mexico and St. Louis,
Missouri, Jan. 22-28.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Saddam Hussein declared he would not
``compromise or kneel'' in the showdown over arms inspections,
hours before the United States announced a new round of U.S. and
British air strikes late Friday.
	   In his first national address since the attacks began, Saddam
exhorted his people to continue their resistance and ``by God's
will, you will be victorious.''
	   Earlier, a pre-dawn air raid rocked Baghdad with deafening
explosions.
	   The capital was quiet Friday night, despite an announcement from
Washington that U.S. and British warplanes were targeting Iraqi
military targets in a third wave of attacks. The targets might have
been far from Baghdad.
	   Iraq says the earlier airstrikes have killed at least 25 people,
wounded 75, and damaged government offices, factories, a hospital
and even a museum, where a missile punched a gaping hole through
one wall.
	   ``You are representing justice and all the great characteristics
against injustice,'' Saddam said, dressed in his field marshal's
uniform. ``You, great Iraqi people, you have raised high the Iraqi
flag and you have proved again that you are heroic.''
	   Saddam paid tribute to the Iraqi armed forces and the air
defense troops, who have been firing anti-aircraft guns at the U.S.
cruise missiles that have raining down upon Baghdad.
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice. We
will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he declared.
	   Shortly after the speech, the Iraqi General Command issued a
statement saying that since the attacks began, the air defense
forces had shot down 77 cruise missiles.
	   In the first military statement on the strikes, the general
command said the U.S. missiles had targeted military units,
communications centers, Trade Ministry warehouses and residential
areas.
	   Meanwhile, anti-American protests erupted Friday in half a dozen
Arab capitals, with many saying the attacks were President
Clinton's way of squirming out of his sex scandal with Monica
Lewinsky.
	   ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read one sign
at a protest at Cairo's famous al-Azhar mosque.
	   Baghdad came under a brief but intense missile attack hours
before dawn, following a barrage of airstrikes late Thursday in
which at least a dozen explosions resounded. Anti-aircraft fire and
tracer bullets lit the sky over the city, air-raid sirens blared,
and the thud of explosions could be felt in downtown buildings.
	   Still, there was little evidence of tension in the capital
during the day Friday. Traffic was light as normal, in keeping with
the Muslim sabbath. But some motorists lined up at gas stations,
making sure their tanks were full in case U.S. officials make good
on their promise of a sustained effort to demolish Saddam's
military power.
	   The attack earlier Friday damaged several buildings in Baghdad,
including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy College of
Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took reporters to the museum, where a missile
punched a two-foot (half-meter) hole through a wall and shattered
the windows of several showcases that displayed stuffed lions and
hyenas.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told a press conference Friday
night that the missiles had targeted ``whatever is dear to the
Iraqi people.''
	   Smoke drifted up Thursday from the state Military Industrial
Corporation in Baghdad, which is in charge of Iraq's factories.
	   The attacks Thursday targeted several factories that were being
monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the Nida heavy
machinery factory, 10 miles (15 kilometers) south of Baghdad,
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said.
	   Iraqi newspapers urged the public Friday to rally behind Saddam.
	   ``God bless Iraq and Saddam,'' Babil newspaper said in large red
letters on its front page. Below that was a drawing of Saddam,
dressed in a traditional white Arab robe atop a white horse hurling
a spear at a black, hissing snake.
	   It urged Iraqis to ``show their readiness for sacrifice and
their readiness to face the evil aggressors.''
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of Saddam's ruling Baath Party, ran a
large headline in Arabic and English: ``Operation Monica.''
	   In an apparent effort to ``arouse the people'' against Saddam,
U.S. aircraft dropped leaflets over southern Iraq on Thursday, an
Iraqi official said.
	   U.S. officials said the leaflets in Arabic implored Iraqi forces
to stay in their bases and threatened them with attack if they
mobilized.
	   The largely Shiite Muslim south rebelled against Saddam
following the 1991 Gulf War, but the uprising was brutally
suppressed by Iraqi forces.
	   The aerial attack began early Thursday, when the United States
fired more than 200 1,000-pound (450-kilogram) Tomahawk cruise
missiles from warships in the Gulf. On Thursday night and early
Friday, B-52H heavy bombers joined the blitz, firing 2,000-pound
(900-kilogram) cruise missiles. British Tornado jets joined the
operation, named ``Desert Fox.''
	   U.N. officials evacuated 106 U.N. humanitarian workers by bus to
the Jordanian capital of Amman for their safety. About 28 U.N.
humanitarian workers remained in Baghdad.
	   To protest the airstrikes, Russia recalled its ambassadors to
Britain and the United States. Rallies were held in Egypt, Jordan,
Yemen, Iran, Lebanon and the West Bank.
	   The Pentagon said 50 sensitive sites were struck early Thursday,
including Saddam's military intelligence headquarters in Baghdad
and four barracks for special security guards who protect weapons
sites.
	   Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said at least 25
people had been killed and 75 injured Thursday and a hospital in
Baghdad was damaged.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said there have been no
American casualties.
	   Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq for its alleged
obstruction of UNSCOM, which is responsible for dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction _ chemical and biological weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of the banned weapons,
the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions imposed
on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which triggered the Gulf
War.

EU to give Armenia dlrs 45 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ The European Union is giving Armenia 50
million ecu (dlrs 45 million) for various projects, EU officials
visiting this former Soviet republic said Friday.
	   Francois Lamorot, deputy head of the EU commission on foreign
relations, would not say what the money would target. But the
ITAR-Tass news agency quoted unidentified EU officials as saying
the aid would be for new railroad lines linking Europe with Asia
through the Caucasus Mountains region.
	   It said the EU has also drawn up plans for restoring railroad
traffic between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan, destroyed
during fighting over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Half of the EU money will be a grant and the other half a
15-year loan, Lamorot told a news conference in Yerevan, the
Armenian capital.
	   He also said the EU was ready to help Armenia shut down its
nuclear plant by 2004. Armenia relies on the plant for 40 percent
of its energy, but neighboring countries have complained the plant
may be unsafe.

U.N. court gives U.S., British lawyers more time in Lockerbie case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The World Court has given the
United States and Britain an extra three months to file written
arguments in a case brought by Libya arguing that Tripoli has the
right to try the two Lockerbie bombing suspects.
	   The extra time was granted by the court in the light of recent
efforts to have the suspects extradited to the Netherlands to stand
trial under Scottish law in a specially convened court.
	   The Scottish case on Dutch soil and the World Court proceedings
are not directly linked, but if Libya hands over the suspects for a
Scottish trial, the World Court case becomes moot and will likely
be dropped.
	   Libya filed its case with the World Court in March 1992,
claiming an international civil aviation treaty gives Tripoli the
right to try two Libyans accused of planting the bomb that blew Pan
Am Flight 103 out of the sky above the Scottish village of
Lockerbie on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   U.S. and British officials preparing written submissions in the
case asked for more time in the light of ``recent diplomatic
initiatives.'' In a brief press statement announcing the extension,
the court, formally known as the International Court of Justice,
gave no further details.
	   The United States and Britain had been due to file their
submissions by Dec. 30, but now have until March 31. After filing
their written cases, both sides then are called to appear at the
Hague-based court to present their arguments orally.

Saudis see new moon, Ramadan begins Saturday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 4th graf with Ramadan beginning Saturday in Iraq,
Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon, Sunday in Egypt; EDITS to conform. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi royal palace announced
Friday that a new moon had been sighted, signaling that the Islamic
fasting month of Ramadan will begin Saturday.
	   The Supreme Legal Council, the country's top religious body,
said in a statement that ``tomorrow, Saturday will be the first day
of the holy month of Ramadan.''
	   The statement added that many people saw the new moon in
different parts of the kingdom.
	   Later in the day, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon announced
that Ramadan would begin Saturday. But Egypt's chief Islamic
official, Mufti Nasr Farid Wassel, announced that Saturday will be
the last day of the Islamic month of Shaaban, meaning that Ramadan
will begin Sunday in Egypt.
	   Since the beginning of the month depends on the sighting of the
new moon, Muslim nations disagree almost every year on when the
month begins.
	   Ramadan marks God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book,
to the Prophet Mohammed some 1,400 years ago.
	   During the holy month, Muslims abstain from food, drink, smoking
and sex during daylight hours as an act of sacrifice and
purification.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the home of Islam's holiest shrines in
Mecca and Medina, was the first Muslim country to announce that
Saturday will be the first day of Ramadan. Gulf countries generally
follow the kingdom's lead.
	   For Muslims around the world, Ramadan marks a period of bonding
with God and the family. Extended families gather at sunset,
awaiting the blast of a canon or the start of the evening prayer
that allows them to break their fast.

U.S. warns Americans in the Gulf states to be cautious
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The United States Embassy warned
American citizens in Saudi Arabia and neighboring Gulf states
Friday to be vigilant and to keep a low profile.
	   ``In the light of the military operations in Iraq and the
possibility of acts of revenge, the State Department urges American
citizens, residents or travelers, to review their security
measures,'' the embassy said in a statement.
	   The statement urged Americans to vary their daily travel routes
and to look out for suspicious parcels.
	   The United States and Britain launched a series of missile and
air attacks against Iraq on Wednesday in retaliation for Baghdad's
alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors verifying the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The attacks were
continuing Friday night.
	   Security for the 40,000 Americans working in Saudi Arabia _
along with an estimated 5,000 military personnel _ has been a a
major U.S. concern since two bomb attacks in 1995 and 1996 killed a
total of 24 American military personnel.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow denounced the United States on Friday with
the kind of rhetoric not heard since the Cold War, demanding an end
to attacks on Iraq and warning that relations with the West could
be badly damaged. Anti-American protests swept through half a dozen
Arab cities, echoing those sentiments.
	   In a rare display of political consensus, President Boris
Yeltsin and his Communist and nationalist opponents launched verbal
broadsides against the United States and Britain for their attacks
on Iraq.
	   ``We condemn the United States, and nobody should doubt our
negative attitude,'' Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said the U.S. and British strikes
``flagrantly violated the norms of the international law and openly
ignored the world community's efforts to settle the situation.''
Sergeyev said Moscow's relations with NATO were threatened.
	   The Foreign Ministry called for a halt to the air attacks and a
U.N. Security Council meeting to restore peace in Baghdad, a
longtime Soviet and Russian friend.
	   Clinton sent a letter to Yeltsin on Friday defending the
decision to attack, and Yeltsin responded with a message. In an
apparent bid to smooth the waters, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright announced Friday she will go to Moscow next month.
	   The mood in Arab capitals was ugly Friday as protests erupted in
Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Syria and the
Palestinian territories as well as in Iran.
	   The angry shouts of demonstrators were tinged with threats
against American interests and cast the U.S. air strikes as a war
on Muslims.
	   Many condemned the attacks as an attempt by President Clinton to
save himself from impeachment over his sexual relations with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``For Monica's sake, Iraqi children are dying,'' read one sign
at Cairo's Al-Azhar University mosque, where hundreds gathered.
``Leaders of the country, let us go to holy war!'' some of the
protesters chanted.
	   Criticism of the United States was repeated in sermons at Friday
prayers across the Muslim world.
	   Sheik Mohammed Tantawi, head of Al-Azhar, urged solidarity with
Iraqis. ``Stand by the Iraqi people, or we will be hit by God's
damnation,'' he preached.
	   Inside the mosque, 27-year-old Mohammed Abdrabbo shouted,
``Attack American interests!''
	   Elsewhere, about 300 police ringed protesters at a mosque near
the U.S. Embassy in Cairo. In Jordan, about 500 police surrounded
an equal number of demonstrators in Amman, and police dispersed
thousands of demonstrators in Irbid, 60 miles (95 kilometers) to
the north.
	   At Amman's University of Jordan mosque, the protesters called
for an Arab revolt against the United States.
	   ``Saddam ... if you want commandos, we are ready!'' protesters
chanted.
	   In the West Bank city of Bethlehem _ where Clinton was greeted
enthusiastically just days ago _ hundreds of protesters chanted
``Death to Clinton.''
	   About 15,000 Muslims marched through the Yemeni capital of
San`a, and 2,500 people _ mostly students _ held a sit-in outside a
U.N. office in Lebanon's capital Beirut. Demonstrators in the
southern Lebanese city of Sidon shouted ``Clinton is the terrorist
of the century!''
	   In Moscow, Russian officials were furious that they can do
little more than complain, given how much they need Western aid as
they struggle with the country's worst economic crisis since the
1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Presidential aides stressed there was no question of breaking
relations with the United States or Britain, even though Moscow
recalled its ambassadors to protest the airstrikes.
	   ``The president believes that under no circumstances should we
slide towards confrontation (with the West), but we should call
things by their name. The military strikes are unacceptable and
should be stopped,'' presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
	   The State Duma, the lower chamber of parliament, passed an
appeal to Yeltsin calling for Russia to unilaterally break U.N.
sanctions against Iraq. Such a move is not binding, however, and
Yeltsin is unlikely to take any real action.
	   Gen. Leonid Ivashov of Russia's Defense Ministry said the
attacks against Iraq could lead to a rift with the West.
	   Moscow ``will be forced to change its military-political course
and may become the leader of a part of the world community that
disagrees with the (U.S.) dictate,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
quoted him as saying.
	   Elsewhere Friday:
	   _Police clashed with 300 protesters outside the U.S. Embassy in
The Hague, Netherlands, using batons to break up a demonstration
against American airstrikes.
	   _Thousands of Muslims gathered in mosques across India's
northern Kashmir state to condemn the attacks on Iraq.
	   _Chinese President Jiang Zemin has sent a personal message to
Clinton urging an end to the airstrikes, state media reported.

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests

<TEXT>
	   BEIT DOUKU, West Bank (AP) _ Anxious to avoid the image that
earned the Palestinians pariah status during the Gulf War,
authorities moved quickly Friday to end anti-U.S. demonstrations
and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments.
	   The Gaza police chief declared a ban on further pro-Iraq
demonstrations and ordered the arrest of a leader of a pro-Iraqi
radical group.
	   ``All the pro-Iraq demonstrations are illegal and anyone
organizing and participating in them will be considered a violator
of the law,'' Ghaza Jabali said in a statement issued Friday night.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers
chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to America,
Death to Clinton, Death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity poles
during the Clinton visit.
	   Protesters found a few left-over plastic U.S. flags, and wrapped
them around their shoes in a sign of contempt.
	   Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press
photographer for taking pictures of the burning of a U.S. flag, and
released him on condition that he not take pictures of other
anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.
	   The Palestinian leadership is anxious to curb the unmitigated
backing Palestinians gave Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _
a stance that set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   Clinton's visit earlier this week _ to salvage peace accords
with Israel _ was seen as tantamount to recognition of Palestinian
aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are anxious to
cultivate the new friendship.
	   The Palestinian Authority has issued careful statements
regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction
capability.
	   The authority's Cabinet announced after its meeting Friday night
that it was sending an envoy to ``brother Iraq'' to explore a
peaceful solution to the crisis. Notably, the statement did not
condemn the U.S.-British attacks.
	   In an attempt to quell an anti-American demonstration organized
in Gaza City by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
police beat back some of the 500 participants with clubs and guns,
injuring three who were taken to a local hospital.
	   Police invited four PFLP leaders ``to have a cup of tea'' after
the demonstration and promptly placed them under arrest. Among them
was Jamil Majdawali, the top PFLP official in the
Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The police arrested eight Palestinian journalists who covered
the demonstrations, witnesses said. One of them, who is also an
American, was soon released.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down two TV stations and a radio station in
Ramallah and three TV stations in Bethlehem.
	   There was no official explanation for the shutdown, but the TV
stations had broadcast footage of the pro-Iraq demonstrations,
pro-Iraqi interviews and nationalist music. The Voice of Peace and
Love had devoted its broadcasts on Thursday to a popular
nationalist Iraqi singer.
	   Police also sealed the offices of two foreign news agencies in
the Gaza Strip.
	   The largest turnout was in Nablus, where thousands marched
through the city chanting ``America is under our feet.'' and
``Britain is an enemy of God.'''
	   Some marchers shook their fists in the air when they saw
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's helicopter approach.
	   In Beit Douku, a village near Ramallah, over a thousand people
joined the funeral procession for a youth killed by Israeli troops
during pro-Iraq demonstrations on Thursday.
	   Mohammed Ismail, 20, was hoisted on a mattress, draped in a
green sheet.
	   ``With body and soul we will redeem you, martyr,'' the
protesters chanted. ``With body and soul, we will redeem you,
Iraq!''

	   Key developments in the airstrikes against Iraq:
	   ___
	   _U.S. and British warplanes launch a third wave of strikes on
Iraqi military installations.
	   _Pentagon officials say most missiles are hitting intended
targets, but that initial damage assessments indicate only a small

	   _Iraqi General Command issues a statement saying air defense

US human rights official deplores Kosovo situation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top U.S. human rights official on
Friday wrapped up a trip to Kosovo, calling the humanitarian
situation in the successionist province ``deeply disturbing.''
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Harold Hongju
Koh, castigated the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
for a ``strong contempt for international law and human rights.''
	   Koh, who recently replaced John Shattuck in the post, met with
Kosovo leaders foreign diplomats and others during a trip to
Serbia's successionist province of Kosovo, where he also visited
hospitals.
	   In addition, Koh toured Montenegro, which together with Serbia
makes up the Yugoslav Federation.
	   In the wake of this week's upsurge in violence in Kosovo, Koh
said the U.S. govenment ``deplores violence on all sides, and urges
all parties to the conflict to avert a new cycle of retaliatory
violence.''
	   Koh also assailed Serbian authorities for using their harsh new
information law to threaten Albanian-language newspapers with
closure if they don't change their editorial policies.
	   ``These acts constitute an outrageous attack on free speech,''
he said. ``The United States government condemns these acts as the
latest round in the Milosevic regime's self-destructive attack on
its own civil society.''
	   Since the law was enacted in October, independent papers in the
Yugoslav capital have been forced to stop printing or face huge
fines.
	   Among other ``disturbing practices,'' Koh said he saw Serbian
police stationed outside the Pristina Hospital intensive care unit,
and noted the ``normal citizens of Kosovo continue to be treated as
military targets.''
	   ``Most of all, I saw a tired and demoralized population and a
human rights catastrophe that is still unfolding.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official promised
another security sweep targeting Kosovo Albanian rebels after the
battered body of a prominent Serb official was found dumped along a
roadside Friday.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing of a municipal leader just
outside Pristina, called the death ``one more attack on Serbia.''
	   ``The earth is too small for them to hide,'' he said of the
killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army and pledging new
action against them.
	   The brutal slaying of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo
Polje, 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital
Pristina, was the latest jolt to increasingly slim hopes that
diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war in the separatist
Serbian province.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since a U.S.-brokered
agreement in October that was intended to buy time for a political
settlement on Kosovo's future status.
	   In the past week, Yugoslav army border guards killed 36
guerrillas on the Albanian border, unidentified assailants gunned
down six young Serbs in a bar in the western city of Pec, and Serb
police killed two suspected rebels and arrested 34 in a crackdown
in the Pec area.
	   Reporters Friday heard shelling coming from the direction of
Glodjane, where police reportedly killed two ethnic Albanian
fighters the previous day and captured 34 in a search for gunmen
who slaughtered six young Serbs in Pec.
	   Earlier this week, police also sealed off a part of Pec.
Residents there accused police on Friday of beating some ethnic
Albanians and detaining dozens. The claims could not be
independently verified.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Harold Hongju
Koh, who visited Kosovo castigated the regime of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic for a ``strong contempt for international law
and human rights.''
	   In the wake of this week's upsurge in violence in Kosovo, Koh
said the U.S. govenment ``deplores violence on all sides, and urges
all parties to the conflict to avert a new cycle of retaliatory
violence.''
	   Friday morning, Bojanic's badly beaten body was found dumped
along the province's main east-west road, where it lay for hours _
bloodied, bruised and shot between the eyes. An American medic in
the international verification team examined it and said there were
multiple fracture wounds.
	   The Serb official's death came hours after Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla
fighters in a border clash Monday.
	   KLA representative Adem Demaci denied that rebels were involved
in the killing and suggested it may have been staged by Serbian
secret police. ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of
the Serbian regime,'' he said.
	   But Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   Busloads of Serbs were brought to a rally in Kosovo Polje within
hours, where Sainovic told them that ``every perpetrator will be
prosecuted.''
	   ``Rest assured that the state will energetically respond to each
such attack, and as you have seen punishment has already caught up
with some of the perpetrators of the Pec killings,'' he said.
	   In Geneva, Bardhyl Mahmuti, the political representative of the
KLA in Switzerland, warned that ``all conditions are ready for
there to be a new massacre'' of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo with
world attention ``focused on Iraq.''
	   Mahmuti said the Serbs are taking numerous actions against
ethnic Albanians in violation of the Holbrooke accord.
	   ``Milosevic is reinforcing the military and police forces in
Kosovo, there is a redeployment of Serb forces. All the checkpoints
have been retaken by the Serbs. There is a media offensive of
propaganda'' portraying the KLA as having committed ``certain
crimes recently against Serb civilians.''

	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Refugees fled a second day
of fighting on Friday between the army and a rogue militia group
while automatic weapons fire rattled through a neighborhood of
Brazzaville.
	   Police fired on looters taking advantage of the disorder in the
south Brazzaville suburb of BaKongo, and civilians fled the area,
witnesses said.
	   The capital of this Central African country _ on the Atlantic
coast and next to its larger neighbor, Congo _ was without
electricity and telephone services were limited to the center of
the city. Many people in other parts of the city were taking refuge
in their homes.
	   Casualties were reported by civilians fleeing the area, although
the numbers were unclear.
	   Meanwhile, the United Nations' refugee agency counted 8,500
emigres who had escaped the turmoil in Republic of Congo in recent
weeks to border villages near the town of Luozi in Congo, the
former Zaire, UNHCR spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva.
	   Other aid groups have estimated that 10,000 refugees have
crossed the river border to Congo.
	   ``The group has adequate food at present but is in urgent need
of medical assistance,'' Janowski said. Several children reportedly
died from lack of care after crossing into Congo. UNHCR began
distributing medical kits to health posts in the vicinity and soap
to area villages. Food and basic necessities will be given to the
most vulnerable members of the group.
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas, who had launched scattered
ambushes, were pushed back from the suburbs south of Brazzaville, a
military officer said Thursday.
	   Hundreds of people panicked in downtown Brazzaville, believing
the Ninjas had launched an all-out attack.
	   Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president Pascal Lissouba,
fled Republic of Congo after President Denis Sassou-Nguesso and his
``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan government troops _
defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war last year. Since then,
the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and are waging a campaign
against Sassou-Nguesso's government.
	   Since his takeover, Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia
groups including the Cobras. Many of his former militia fighters,
though, have joined the army.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, sending
troops to help Sassou-Nguesso defeat Lissouba. Many Angolan
soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola joined the civil war because Lissouba was believed to be
sending aid to the rebel group UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola which has been
fighting the Angolan government for two decades.
	   The Republic of Congo government has said that UNITA is now
supporting the Ninjas.

Palestinian Authority contains pro-Iraq protests

	   BEIT DOUKU, West Bank (AP) _ Anxious to avoid the image that
earned the Palestinians pariah status during the Gulf War,
authorities moved quickly Friday to end anti-U.S. demonstrations
and shut down media broadcasting pro-Iraqi sentiments.
	   The Gaza police chief declared a ban on further pro-Iraq
demonstrations and ordered the arrest of a leader of a pro-Iraqi
radical group.
	   ``All the pro-Iraq demonstrations are illegal and anyone
organizing and participating in them will be considered a violator
of the law,'' Ghaza Jabali said in a statement issued Friday night.
	   Protesters throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip gathered
after Friday morning Muslim prayers to protest the joint
U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
	   In Manger Square in Bethlehem _ where just days ago, U.S.
President Bill Clinton received a rapturous greeting _ marchers
chanted ``Saddam, Saddam, our beloved,'' and ``Death to America,
Death to Clinton, Death to Britain!''
	   Anticipating the demonstration, authorities made sure to strip
the city of the U.S. flags that had garnished electricity poles
during the Clinton visit.
	   Protesters found a few left-over plastic U.S. flags, and wrapped
them around their shoes in a sign of contempt.
	   Palestinian security briefly detained an Associated Press
photographer for taking pictures of the burning of a U.S. flag, and
released him on condition that he not take pictures of other
anti-U.S. actions.
	   After the demonstration, marchers threw stones at Israeli troops
guarding the entrance to the city. The troops responded with rubber
bullets and tear gas. Fifteen protesters were injured.
	   The Palestinian leadership is anxious to curb the unmitigated
backing Palestinians gave Saddam Hussein during the 1991 Gulf War _
a stance that set back the Palestinian cause in the West.
	   Clinton's visit earlier this week _ to salvage peace accords
with Israel _ was seen as tantamount to recognition of Palestinian
aspirations to statehood. Palestinian leaders are anxious to
cultivate the new friendship.
	   The Palestinian Authority has issued careful statements
regretting the strikes, but urging Saddam to cooperate with U.N.
inspectors seeking to contain Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction
capability.
	   The authority's Cabinet announced after its meeting Friday night
that it was sending an envoy to ``brother Iraq'' to explore a
peaceful solution to the crisis. Notably, the statement did not
condemn the U.S.-British attacks.
	   In an attempt to quell an anti-American demonstration organized
in Gaza City by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
police beat back some of the 500 participants with clubs and guns,
injuring three who were taken to a local hospital.
	   Police invited four PFLP leaders ``to have a cup of tea'' after
the demonstration and promptly placed them under arrest. Among them
was Jamil Majdawali, the top PFLP official in the
Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The police arrested eight Palestinian journalists who covered
the demonstrations, witnesses said. One of them, who is also an
American, was soon released.
	   In another sign of Palestinian efforts to contain anti-U.S.
sentiment, police shut down two TV stations and a radio station in
Ramallah and three TV stations in Bethlehem.
	   There was no official explanation for the shutdown, but the TV
stations had broadcast footage of the pro-Iraq demonstrations,
pro-Iraqi interviews and nationalist music. The Voice of Peace and
Love had devoted its broadcasts on Thursday to a popular
nationalist Iraqi singer.
	   Police also sealed the offices of two foreign news agencies in
the Gaza Strip.

Palestinians: Israeli refusal to meet deadline endangers peace
</HEADLINE>
process &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Israel's refusal to meet a peace
process deadline on Friday was ``dangerous'' and could freeze the
peace, the Palestinian Cabinet said.
	   Israel was to handed over a further 5 percent of the West Bank
to Palestinian control by Friday, according to the accords brokered
by U.S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday he would miss
the deadline until he sees solid evidence that the Palestinians are
meeting their conditions.
	   ``We have fulfilled our commitments,'' top Palestinian
negotiator said after the Cabinet meeting. ``The Israeli government
has not.''
	   Aside from returning territory, Erekat said, Israel has failed
to open a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank,
has not moved to improve economic conditions, and has not released
prisoners.
	   ``We see this behavior as dangerous,'' Erekat said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week accused the
Palestinians of failing to contain anti-Israel violence and
incitement.
	   Netanyahu, who has staked the survival of his government on his
peace policies in a vote next week in parliament, said he wanted to
see solid proof the violence was ended before he withdrew.
	   ``Netanyahu's declarations mean the stopping of the peace
process,'' Erekat said.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had expressed his concern to
the current leaders of the European Union, Erekat said, and would
send similar letters to Netanyahu and Clinton.
	   There were signs Friday that the Palestinians were moving to
meet Netanyahu's demands.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, protesters against U.S. and
British airstrikes in Iraq tried to march toward Israeli outposts
to confront soldiers.
	   Palestinian police quickly moved to contain them.
	   An expected outbreak of protests against Israel's refusal to
withdraw had been anticipated, but were overwhelmed by the events
in Iraq and subsequent protests in Palestinian areas.
	   The Palestinian Authority has not condemned the bombing, anxious
to cultivate a growing friendliness with the United States that
blossomed during Clinton's visit to the region this week.
	   Erekat said that Arafat ordered an envoy to Iraq to seek ways to
resolve the crisis.

Dortmund routs Stuttgart, Bochum clinches draw in Freiburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Borussia Dortmund routed Stuttgart 3-0
on Friday, in its last Bundesliga game before the two-month winter
break.
	   In another game Friday, Bochum clinched a 1-1 draw at Freiburg
with a last-minute goal.
	   Dortmund took the lead in the 38th minute on Heiko Herrlich's
first goal of the season. Herrlich headed in a good cross from
Andreas Moeller from the left, with the ball bouncing off the
inside of the post and into the net.
	   Stuttgart hardly threatened Dortmund's goal in the first half,
but the 61,000 fans couldn't be too happy with Dortmund's
performance either.
	   But three minutes into the second half, another free-kick cross
by Moeller from the left side was perfectly met and headed into the
net by Vladimir But.
	   But, a Russian, set up Dortmund's third goal in the 67th,
finding the open Togo striker Bachirou Salou, who easily slotted
home from 14 meters (yards) out for his fifth goal of the season.
	   Freiburg and Bochum both had to reshuffle their regular lineups
substantially because of injuries. While Bochum's Norbert Hofmann
hit a post in the first half-time, Freiburg's Michael Frontzek
twice missed from pointblank range.
	   Freiburg took the lead in the 50th, through Tunisian
international Zubaier Baya, who drove home from 12 meters (yards)
out after a bad clearance by Bochum's defense.
	   In the dying seconds, Bochum's 19-year-old midfielder Sebastian
Schindzielorz notched the equalizer. But Bochum remained without a
victory for seven consecutive games.
	   After this weekend's round, the Bundesliga goes into a winter
break and resumes Feb. 19.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Saddam Hussein vowed Friday that
his country will ``not compromise or kneel'' as the United States
and Britain unleashed a third day of air strikes against Iraq.
	   Moments after the Iraq leader's tough talk, air raid sirens
wailed throughout the country, warning of a new wave of the attacks
that have already struck government buildings, communications
centers and factories that could be used to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons inspectors
had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Friday.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage from the third night
of strikes, which did not target the capital.
	   There was one moment of jitters Friday night when a loud boom
was heard in Baghdad, but it turned out to be a cannon announcing
the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   In a TV address to the nation, Saddam wore an olive green field
marshal's uniform, ditching the civilian suits he has favored in
public since the last crisis with the United Nations in February.
He urged Iraqis to ``continue your resistance.''
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice,''
Saddam said in his first television appearance to the nation since
the air strikes began early Thursday. ``We will not let evil
triumph over virtue.''
	   The United States has fired almost 300 cruise missiles and U.S.
pilots have flown some 200 combat sorties since the attacks began.
	   While the Iraqi military announced its anti-aircraft batteries
had shot down 77 incoming missiles, American officials said in
Washington that they had met little real resistance to the attacks.
	   But Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said there have been some glitches in the bombardment of
Iraq. Initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the 75 targets attacked have been destroyed or severely
damaged.
	   ``Not all have gone as planned,'' Shelton told a news
conference.
	   Dozens of Iraqi sites, including the intelligence and police
headquarters, the national radio and television and an oil refinery
have been struck in the bombardment.
	   The missiles are targeting ``whatever is dear to the Iraqi
people,'' Aziz told reporters.
	   He added that there were ``a lot of casualties,'' but gave no
details.
	   Iraqi officials had earlier said that 25 people were killed and
75 wounded in the raids.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday there had been
no American casualties.
	   In Baghdad's al-Kharkh hospital on the western side of the
Tigris River, Amar Shakir lay unconscious on a bed, the stumps of
his left arm and leg swathed in thick bandages.
	   Doctors said the 25-year-old civilian was crippled in the air
strikes. They did not know where Shakir was at the time of the
attack.
	   In the Karada district, near the center of Baghdad, workers
quickly cleared away the debris from a missile that smacked into
the middle of a street, rupturing a water pipe.
	   Rihab Mohammed, a 39-year-old mother of four, said she was
afraid to go back inside her 2-story brick home.
	   ``The walls and the foundations are so weak,'' she said, looking
at the old, yellow brick home.
	   Nearby, Farouk Mansour, 46, surveyed the damage at his toy
store.
	   ``The windows were thrown out of the frames and all the
merchandise was scattered all over the floor,'' he said.
	   ``It will cost me a lot of money'' to repair the damage, he
said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq
for what he said was Baghdad's obstruction of U.N. weapons
inspectors, who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's programs to
build chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of the illegal
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In announcing the start of the strikes, Clinton recognized that
it would be offensive to the United States' Arab allies if the
attacks continued into Ramadan. But National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said Friday the strikes would not necessarily end with the
beginning of Ramadan.
	   ``That is not an automatic deadline,'' Berger said.
	   Aziz said Friday that Iraq would no longer be willing to accept
both the sanctions and the inspection regime.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) and
sanctions at the same time,'' he said.
	   Thursday's attacks targeted several factories that were
monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the Nida heavy
machinery factory, some 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Baghdad,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said.
	   Aziz said the U.S. and Britain ``have targeted many, many _
almost all _ of the sites that were under full monitoring.''
	   The U.N. teams have cameras and chemical sensors at several
sites in Iraq to ensure that the equipment is not tampered with and
used for the clandestine manufacture of chemical or biological
weapons or long-range missile parts.
	   Early Friday morning, missiles damaged several buildings in
Baghdad, including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy
College of Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   An editorial in Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath
Party, called the attacks ``Operation Monica.''
	   Aziz echoed the feeling that the strikes may have been tied to
Clinton's domestic troubles, adding that ``when a statesman... lies
in one case, how can he be credible in another case?''
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers who monitor food aid
to the Iraqis were evacuated by bus to Jordan.

Butler indirectly challenges United States on Iraq

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Reiterating that he has no intention of
resigning now, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said
Friday he would quit if he concluded that Iraq had been disarmed
and economic sanctions against Baghdad were not immediately lifted.
	   Butler's comment was an indirect challenge to the United States,
which refuses to acknowledge a Security Council resolution
promising to lift sanctions when inspectors certify that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed.
	   ``Some people express doubt about whether that promise would be
kept. I have no doubt of that,'' Butler said in a speech to the
Women's International Forum. ``I passionately believe in that
promise. And were it not to be kept then that would be ...
resignation material.''
	   In terms of future carrots or incentives to Iraq, Butler said,
``it needs to be made unambiguously clear to Iraq that the law
means what it says and when the disarmament process is declared by
me and the director-general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency to be over ... sanctions lifting will follow.''
	   The Security Council, which is badly divided over the
airstrikes, held consultations for a third day Friday but took no
action. The council agreed to meet again Monday morning.
	   All Security Council members except the United States back
Butler's view that the oil embargo and other economic sanctions
must be lifted when Butler declares that Iraq is disarmed.
	   But the Clinton administration is demanding not only Iraq's
disarmament but its compliance with other resolutions calling for
an accounting of missing Kuwaitis, looted Kuwaiti property and
government archives.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh refused to answer a
question Friday on whether the United States might change its
policy to prevent Butler's resignation if Iraq is disarmed.
	   But responding to Russian calls for Butler's resignation and
strong criticism from China, Burleigh said it was ``very
regrettable that political attack is now seeming to focus on
Ambassador Butler'' and the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which he heads.
	   ``We don't want Ambassador Butler to resign. We think he's been
a very effective, professional executive chairman of the Special
Commission under the most extraordinarily difficult situation,''
Burleigh said. ``I think frankly that they have done a brilliant
job and I think the UNSCOM people are heroes.''
	   In the past month, UNSCOM has tested the promise Iraq made on
Nov. 14, under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, to resume
full cooperation with UNSCOM. Butler's report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday concluded Iraq had fallen
short of compliance.
	   Butler said Friday that if Iraq had handed over only one
document on its production of deadly VX nerve agent, it would have
made a big difference.
	   ``It would have been such a good step on a really important
matter, a clear signal that would have made it far easier for me to
report to the secretary-general that they were in full
cooperation,'' Butler said.
	   Russia, which along with China has bitterly condemned the United
States and Britain for using force without council approval, has
circulated a nonbinding draft statement calling for an immediate
cessation of hostilities and expressing regret at the attack.
	   Given the divisions on the council, the Russian draft has no
chance of being approved, but council members said it will serve as
the basis for discussion on how to move forward in dealing with
Iraq.

More U.S. troops arrive in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMP DOHA, Kuwait (AP) _ Some 200 U.S. soldiers arrived in
Kuwait Friday, boosting the number of American forces in this small
Gulf state to 5,000.
	   The troops will be deployed in battle-ready positions along the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi border on Saturday, U.S. military spokesman Col. Ron
Williams said.
	   Kuwait fears that Iraq will retaliate for the current air
strikes by U.S. and British forces. Some of the warplanes taking
part in the raids are based in Kuwait.
	   ``It is critically important that we be prepared,'' Williams
said.
	   The troops that arrived Friday had flown for about 16 from Fort
Stewart, Georgia.
	   Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement with the U.S. after
the 1991 Gulf War that drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait after a
seven-month occupation.
	   The U.S. and Britain launched the strikes because of Iraq's
alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors seeking to verify
the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.

Saudis see new moon, so Ramadan begins Saturday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to UPDATE with Ramadan beginning Saturday
in Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon, Sunday in Egypt; ADDS that
U.S. airstrikes on Iraq won't necessarily end with Ramadan.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi Royal palace announced
Friday that a new moon had been sighted, signaling the holy fasting
month of Ramadan will begin Saturday in much of the Muslim world,
including Iraq.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton has linked the timing of the
U.S.-led air attack on Iraq to a desire to avoid offending Muslims
by bombing during Ramadan.
	   However, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Friday
the airstrikes will not necessarily end with the start of Ramadan.
``That is not an automatic deadline,'' Berger said.
	   Ramadan marks God's revelation of the Koran, Islam's holy book,
to the Prophet Mohammed about 1,400 years ago. Its start depends on
the sighting of the new moon, so it does not always begin on the
same day everywhere.
	   Saudi Arabia, which is the home of Islam's holiest shrines in
Mecca and Medina, was the first Muslim country to announce that
Ramadan would begin Saturday.
	   Later Friday, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and Lebanon all announced
the fasting month would begin in their countries on Saturday too.
However, Egypt's chief Islamic official, Mufti Nasr Farid Wassel,
said it would start Sunday in Egypt.
	   Saudi Arabia's Supreme Legal Council, the country's top
religious body, said in a statement the new moon was spotted in
many different parts of the kingdom Friday, so ``Saturday will be
the first day of the holy month of Ramadan.''
	   During the holy month, devout Muslims abstain from food, drink,
smoking and sex during daylight hours as an act of sacrifice and
purification.
	   For Muslims around the world, Ramadan marks a period of bonding
with God and family. Extended families gather at sunset, awaiting
the blast of a cannon or the start of evening prayer that allows
them to break their fast.

Britain says military operations in Iraq on course

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ As U.S. and British warplanes unleashed a third
wave of strikes against Iraq, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Friday that the operation to limit Saddam Hussein's military
power was on course.
	   ``There is no doubt at all that we are significantly damaging
Saddam Hussein's military capability and reducing therefore ... the
threat that he poses to the region and to the world,'' Blair said
outside his No. 10 Downing Street office.
	   The prime minister described Saddam as ``a man who every time he
is given the chance to use violence and terror, will do so,'' and
said that the aim of British and United States policy was to ``do
all we can to bring about an end to his rule.''
	   Britain's part in the U.S.-led air campaign is begin carried out
by 12 Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers based in Kuwait.
	   Earlier Friday, journalists were shown videos of bombing
missions taken by British Tornados jets. The targets seen exploding
were described as a radar missile site, a hardened aircraft shelter
at the Tallil air base in southwestern Iraq and an aircraft hangar.
	   A Royal Air Force spokesman in Kuwait said all Tornados had
returned to base Friday evening after completing their missions.
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson, speaking at a news
conference, said one objective of the attacks was to stop Iraq's
development of pilotless aircraft.
	   Blair had a round of telephone conversations Friday with leaders
of several nations, seeking to firm up support for the U.S.-British
operation.
	   His office said they included German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, French President Jacques Chirac, Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, and that he
also planned to speak to Crown Prince Abdullah, first deputy prime
minister of Saudi Arabia.
	   Five police officers were injured and five protesters arrested
after 200 people staged antiwar demonstrations outside Britain's
Ministry of Defense in central London. Police arrested a further
three demonstrators after they tried to chain themselves to the
railings of the prime minister's official residence.

Saddam vows defiance as U.S., British bombs rock Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Saddam Hussein vowed Friday that
his country will ``not compromise or kneel'' hours before the
United States and Britain unleashed a third day of air strikes
against Iraq.
	   Air raid sirens wailed throughout the country after the Iraqi
leader's comments were broadcast, warning of a new wave of attacks
that officials say have already killed 25 people and struck
government buildings, communications centers and factories that
could be used to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons inspectors
had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Friday. He warned that Iraq could no
longer tolerate both U.N. arms searches and sanctions.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage from the third night
of strikes, which did not target the capital.
	   There was one moment of jitters Friday night when a loud boom
was heard in Baghdad, but it turned out to be a cannon announcing
the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   In a TV address to the nation, Saddam wore an olive green field
marshal's uniform, ditching the civilian suits he has favored in
public since the last crisis with the United Nations in February.
He urged Iraqis to ``continue your resistance.''
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice,''
Saddam said in his first television appearance to the nation since
the air strikes began early Thursday. ``We will not let evil
triumph over virtue.''
	   The United States has fired almost 300 cruise missiles and U.S.
pilots have flown some 200 combat sorties since the attacks began.
	   While the Iraqi military announced its anti-aircraft batteries
had shot down 77 incoming missiles, American officials said in
Washington that they had met little real resistance to the attacks.
	   But Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said there have been some glitches in the bombardment of
Iraq. Initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the 75 targets attacked have been destroyed or severely
damaged.
	   ``Not all have gone as planned,'' Shelton told a news
conference.
	   Dozens of Iraqi sites, including the intelligence and police
headquarters, the national radio and television and an oil refinery
have been struck in the bombardment.
	   The missiles are targeting ``whatever is dear to the Iraqi
people,'' Aziz told reporters.
	   He added that there were ``a lot of casualties,'' but gave no
details.
	   Iraqi officials had earlier said that 25 people were killed and
75 wounded in the raids.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday there had been
no American casualties.
	   In Baghdad's al-Kharkh hospital on the western side of the
Tigris River, Amar Shakir lay unconscious on a bed, the stumps of
his left arm and leg swathed in thick bandages.
	   Doctors said the 25-year-old civilian was crippled in the air
strikes. They did not know where Shakir was at the time of the
attack.
	   In the Karada district, near the center of Baghdad, workers
quickly cleared away the debris from a missile that smacked into
the middle of a street, rupturing a water pipe.
	   Rihab Mohammed, a 39-year-old mother of four, said she was
afraid to go back inside her 2-story brick home.
	   ``The walls and the foundations are so weak,'' she said, looking
at the old, yellow brick home.
	   Nearby, Farouk Mansour, 46, surveyed the damage at his toy
store.
	   ``The windows were thrown out of the frames and all the
merchandise was scattered all over the floor,'' he said. ``It will
cost me a lot of money'' to repair the damage.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq
for what he said was Baghdad's obstruction of U.N. weapons
inspectors, who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's programs to
build chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of the illegal
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In announcing the start of the strikes, Clinton recognized that
it would be offensive to Washington's Arab allies if the attacks
continued into Ramadan, which begins Saturday in Iraq. But National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Friday the strikes would not
necessarily end with the beginning of Ramadan.
	   ``That is not an automatic deadline,'' Berger said.
	   Aziz said Friday that Iraq would no longer be willing to accept
both the sanctions and inspectors from the U.N. Special Commission.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate UNSCOM and sanctions at the same time,''
he said.
	   Thursday's attacks targeted several factories that were
monitored by U.N. weapons inspectors, including the Nida heavy
machinery factory, some 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of Baghdad,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said.
	   Aziz said the U.S. and Britain ``have targeted many, many _
almost all _ of the sites that were under full monitoring.''
	   The U.N. teams have cameras and chemical sensors at several
sites in Iraq to ensure that the equipment is not tampered with and
used for the clandestine manufacture of chemical or biological
weapons or long-range missile parts.
	   Early Friday morning, missiles damaged several buildings in
Baghdad, including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy
College of Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   An editorial in Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath
Party, called the attacks ``Operation Monica.''
	   Aziz echoed the feeling that the strikes may have been tied to
Clinton's domestic troubles, adding that ``when a statesman... lies
in one case, how can he be credible in another case?''
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers who monitor food aid
to the Iraqis were evacuated by bus to Jordan.

U.S. Customs intercepts 800 kilos of cocaine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Authorities seized 22 bales of
cocaine weighing a total of about 800 kilograms (1,760 pounds) off
the south coast of Puerto Rico, U.S. Customs officials said Friday.
	   Special agent Ronnie Ortiz said the Customs Air Branch was
informed Thursday afternoon of a suspicious plane about 160
kilometers (100 miles) south of Puerto Rico. Customs aircraft
spotted a speed boat of the type used by drug traffickers to pick
up bales of drugs dropped at sea by airplanes.
	   The boat and airplane fled the area, but authorities were able
to recover the 22 bales of drugs and two discarded fuel drums after
a two-hour search.

Journalists detained, media offices closed in police crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police detained nine journalists
who had covered pro-Iraq demonstrations on Friday in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip.
	   Police also sealed the doors to the offices of eight news
organizations in the Gaza Strip, including The Associated Press
office in Gaza City. A notice was posted on the door stating no one
was permitted to enter and violators would be prosecuted.
	   Authorities would not comment on the actions.
	   The office manager of the Gaza branch of Orbit Satellite
Service, an Israeli-based agency that transmits TV footage, said
police came to his office on Friday evening and asked whether he
had sent any material showing the burning of U.S. flags.
	   Abdel Salam Abu Askar was then summoned to Palestinian police
headquarters and informed that his office was closed and that he
could no longer send material to points outside the Gaza Strip.
	   The other outlets targeted included five local TV stations and
one radio station in the West Bank.
	   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, a photographer on assignment
for the AP was ordered by a plainclothes security agent to stop
taking pictures of demonstrators and summoned to police
headquarters.
	   The photographer, Nasser Shiyoukhi, was asked to stop covering
pro-Iraq rallies and was released after about an hour.
	   Eight other journalists were detained in Gaza City after
covering a rally of a radical PLO faction, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine.
	   Among those detained were cameramen covering the rally for the
German TV station ARD, the U.S. network ABC and the French station
France 2.
	   At police headquarters, the France 2 cameraman was asked to sign
a pledge that he would not cover any events that could prove
embarrassing to the Palestinian Authority, according to his office
in Jerusalem.
	   The cameraman signed the document and also had his footage of
the rally taken away from him, the office said.
	   The eight journalists were released after about two hours of
questioning.
	   The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said in a statement that
the closing of the offices and the detention of the journalist was
a ``serious violation'' of their basic rights.

Iraqis brace for Ramadan _ and more missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nervous citizens hurried home late Friday
with baskets full of food and sugar-coated rolls as they prepared
for Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, under threat of more
American and British bombardment.
	   Mosques were lighted up with neon strips, and preachers
congratulated the Muslims on the coming of ``the month of virtue,''
which marks Prophet Mohammed's receiving the holy Koran from God
some 1,400 years ago.
	   ``May God help us enjoy peace and stability in Ramadan. May God
bring humiliation and shame on our enemies,'' blared loudspeakers
from atop a minaret near the Culture and Information Ministry where
foreign journalists work.
	   The United States and Britain have vowed to continue their air
and missile campaign to force President Saddam Hussein's government
to accept unhindered U.N. searches for its prohibited weapons of
mass destruction.
	   After two days of missile blasts, fear grips Baghdad's five
million people once night falls. On Friday night, streets were
empty of pedestrians and shops that usually stay until early in the
morning on the eve of Ramadan had closed down.
	   There was no spontaneous sentiment against Americans on the
streets. When pressed to say who is to blame for their predicament,
some Iraqis reply _ with typical Islamic resignation _ that all has
been decided by God in advance.
	   Petrol is plentiful and residents say there have been no power
cuts in the past three days. But air strikes have downgraded
state-run television and radio. Saddam's picture and voice wavered
when addressing the nation on Friday evening.
	   ``It's fine without (state) television and radio. Kids go to bed
early but they go crazy at the sound of bombs and anti-aircraft
guns,'' said Ibrahim Farhan, a teacher.
	   The government has temporarily closed schools and universities
since many students belong to militias guarding communication
centers and main streets in the capital.
	   While Saddam exhorted his people to resist, many in Baghdad
hoped the beginning of Ramadan would usher in nights with no bombs
and missiles. Some were doubtful this would happen.
	   ``It is not in the Islamic tradition not to wage war during
Ramadan. Early Muslims fought all day without eating or drinking.
And we Arabs launched a war against Israel in 1973 during
Ramadan,'' said Hussein Hammeed, a Baghdad resident.
	   Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar. In it,
Muslims must fast during daylight hours.
	   But Numan Abdulkarim, out shopping for Ramadan, said he would
pray all night that his wife and three grown children will be able
to have their Suhour _ the light meal served before dawn during
Ramadan _ to the sound of Koran recitations and not deafening
bombs.
	   ``We are by nature a peaceful people, but I do not know what has
happened to us,'' he said.
	   But while ordinary people yearned for a peaceful Ramadan, their
leaders gave no hint of a peaceful solution.
	   Both Saddam and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz declared on
Friday that Iraq can withstand the bombing and defeat its enemies.
	   Saad Qassem Hammoudi, a senior official of the ruling Baath
party, spurned the idea that Iraqis were afraid of war.
	   ``The Iraqis believe in the just cause and the fight for the
lifting of sanctions. They will continue their steadfastness no
matter the sacrifices,'' he told The Associated Press.

Serb official killed, prompting new furor in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official promised
another security sweep targeting Kosovo Albanian rebels after the
battered body of a prominent Serb official was found dumped along a
roadside Friday.
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing of a municipal leader just
outside Pristina, called the death ``one more attack on Serbia.''
	   ``The earth is too small for them to hide,'' he said of the
killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army and pledging new
action against them.
	   The slaying of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo Polje, 5
kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina, was
the latest jolt to increasingly slim hopes that diplomacy can head
off a return to full-scale war in the separatist Serbian province.
	   Dozens of people have been killed since a U.S.-brokered
agreement in October that was intended to buy time for a political
settlement on Kosovo's future status.
	   In the past week, Yugoslav army border guards killed 36
guerrillas on the Albanian border, unidentified assailants gunned
down six young Serbs in a bar in the western city of Pec, and Serb
police killed two suspected rebels and arrested 34 in a crackdown
in the Pec area.
	   Reporters Friday heard shelling coming from the direction of
Glodjane, where police reportedly killed two ethnic Albanian
fighters the previous day and captured 34 in a search for gunmen
who slaughtered six young Serbs in Pec.
	   Earlier this week, police also sealed off a part of Pec.
Residents there accused police on Friday of beating some ethnic
Albanians and detaining dozens. The claims could not be
independently verified.
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights, Harold
Hongju Koh, castigated the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for a ``strong contempt for international law and human
rights.''
	   In the wake of this week's upsurge in violence in Kosovo, the
visiting Koh said the U.S. government ``deplores violence on all
sides, and urges all parties to the conflict to avert a new cycle
of retaliatory violence.''
	   Friday morning, Bojanic's badly beaten body was found dumped
along the province's main east-west road, where it lay for hours _
bloodied, bruised and shot between the eyes. An American medic of
the international team monitoring Kosovo examined it and said there
were multiple fracture wounds.
	   The Serb official's death came hours after Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla
fighters in a border clash Monday.
	   KLA representative Adem Demaci denied that rebels were involved
in the killing and suggested it may have been staged by Serbian
secret police. ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of
the Serbian regime,'' he said.
	   But Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into
Bojanic's home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   Busloads of Serbs were brought to a rally in Kosovo Polje within
hours, where Sainovic told them that ``every perpetrator will be
prosecuted.''
	   ``Rest assured that the state will energetically respond to each
such attack, and as you have seen punishment has already caught up
with some of the perpetrators of the Pec killings,'' he said.
	   In Geneva, Bardhyl Mahmuti, the political representative of the
KLA in Switzerland, warned that ``all conditions are ready for
there to be a new massacre'' of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo with
world attention ``focused on Iraq.''

	   BRAZZAVILLE, Republic of Congo (AP) _ Police opened fire on
looters taking advantage of mayhem in Brazzaville on Friday in the
second day of battles between the army and a rogue militia group.
	   Refugees _ now numbering in the thousands _ continued to flee
the Republic of Congo, which borders the former Zaire, now known as
Congo.
	   Automatic weapons fire rattled through the BaKongo neighborhood
of the capital, and electricity and telephone services were cut in
some parts. Many civilians still in Brazzaville took refuge in
their homes.
	   Those fleeing the area reported casualties, but the numbers were
unclear.
	   About 8,500 people have flooded out of this Central African
country in recent weeks to border villages near the town of Luozi
in Congo, said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency
in Geneva.
	   Other aid groups have estimated that 10,000 refugees have
crossed the river border to Congo.
	   ``The group has adequate food at present but is in urgent need
of medical assistance,'' Janowski said.
	   Several children reportedly died from lack of care after
crossing into Congo.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees began distributing
medical kits to health posts in the vicinity and soap to area
villages. Food and basic necessities will be given to the most
vulnerable members of the group.
	   The shooting began Wednesday night and continued, off and on,
into early Thursday when the outlawed ``Ninja'' militia of former
Prime Minister Bernard Kolelas were pushed back from the suburbs
south of Brazzaville, a military officer said Thursday.
	   Hundreds of people panicked in downtown Brazzaville, believing
the Ninjas had launched an all-out attack.
	   Last year, Kolelas and his sometime-ally, ousted president
Pascal Lissouba, fled the country after President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso and his ``Cobra'' militia _ with the help of Angolan
government troops _ defeated Lissouba in a five-month civil war
last year.
	   Since then, the Ninjas have resisted disarmament and have been
waging a campaign against the government.
	   Sassou-Nguesso has outlawed all militia groups including his own
Cobras. Many of his former militia fighters have joined the army.
	   Angola turned the tide in Republic of Congo's civil war, sending
troops to help Sassou-Nguesso defeat Lissouba. Many Angolan
soldiers stayed in Republic of Congo after the war ended.
	   Angola joined the civil war because Lissouba was believed to be
sending aid to the Angolan rebel group UNITA, which has been
fighting Angola's government for two decades.
	   The Republic of Congo government says UNITA is now supporting
the Ninjas.

Mayweather set to make first title defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ If you weren't part of Floyd Mayweather's
title-winning celebration, don't feel slighted.
	   Even Mayweather had little time to rejoice, returning to the gym
quickly after stopping Genaro Hernandez for the WBC
super-featherweight title Oct. 3.
	   Mayweather, the first boxer from the 1996 U.S. Olympic team to
win a world title as a pro, makes the first defense of his
130-pound (59-kilogram) title Saturday night against Angel Manfredy
of Gary, Indiana.
	   ``I don't want to be known as someone who ducked opponents,''
Mayweather said last week from Big Bear, California, where he
completed a six-week training session before heading to South
Florida. ``Angel Manfredy is a good fighter, determined to win. I
have to be ready.''
	   Mayweather, who has won all 18 of his professional fights,
including 13 by knockout, is not concerned about facing Manfredy
(25-2-1, 19 KOs) in such a short time after winning the title.
	   ``I'm young and I know what I'm capable of,'' said Mayweather,
of Las Vegas. ``Winning a world title won't distract me. I'm very
dedicated to this sport.''
	   Mayweather hopes his dedication will lead to a prosperous
career. Helping in Mayweather's continued development is his
father, Floyd, Sr., and uncles Roger and Jeff, all of whom work his
corner.
	   ``Being a world champion comes with many responsibilities,''
Mayweather said. ``I don't just plan on carrying myself in the
ring. Anybody I meet will have my respect. I'll make sure to sign
all autographs.
	   ``In the coming years, Floyd Mayweather will be a name to
remember. I want to follow what Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler
did in the '80s and (Muhammad) Ali did in the '60s and '70s.''
	   U.S. boxers from previous Olympics usually had built-in
recognition once they turned pro. But the 1996 group wasn't
showcased as NBC relegated most of its boxing coverage to
post-midnight taped segments.
	   But, as HBO continues to feature Mayweather and fellow Atlanta
Olympians and recently-crowned IBF junior-middleweight champion
Fernando Vargas and gold medalist David Reid, lack of attention
should no longer be a problem.
	   ``We are all capable of being world champions for a long time,''
Mayweather said. ``I root for those guys to do well.''
	   In addition to the Mayweather-Manfredy bout, Saturday's card
will feature a 12-round heavyweight match between Hassim Rahman and
David Tua.

Iraqis brace for Ramadan _ and more missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Nervous Iraqis hurried home late Friday
with baskets full of food and sugar-coated rolls to prepare for
Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, awaiting another round of U.S. and
British bombardment.
	   Mosques were lighted up with neon strips, and preachers
congratulated the Muslims on the coming of ``the month of virtue,''
which marks Prophet Mohammed's receiving the holy Koran from God
about 1,400 years ago.
	   ``May God help us enjoy peace and stability in Ramadan. May God
bring humiliation and shame on our enemies,'' blared loudspeakers
from atop a minaret near the Culture and Information Ministry where
foreign journalists work.
	   The United States and Britain have vowed to continue their air
and missile campaign to force President Saddam Hussein's government
to accept unhindered U.N. searches for its prohibited weapons of
mass destruction.
	   After days of missile blasts, fear grips Baghdad's five million
people once night falls. On Friday night, streets were empty of
pedestrians and shops that usually stay until early in the morning
on the eve of Ramadan had closed down. Cars were still on the
streets, though, when anti-aircraft fire lit up Baghdad's night
sky.
	   There was no spontaneous sentiment against Americans on the
streets. When pressed to say who is to blame for their predicament,
some Iraqis reply _ with typical Islamic resignation _ that all has
been decided by God in advance.
	   Petrol is plentiful and residents say there have been no power
cuts in the past three days. But air strikes have downgraded
state-run television and radio. Saddam's picture and voice wavered
when addressing the nation on Friday evening.
	   ``It's fine without (state) television and radio. Kids go to bed
early but they go crazy at the sound of bombs and anti-aircraft
guns,'' said Ibrahim Farhan, a teacher.
	   The government has temporarily closed schools and universities
since many students belong to militias guarding communication
centers and the main streets in the capital.
	   While Saddam exhorted his people to resist, many in Baghdad
hoped the beginning of Ramadan would usher in nights with no bombs
and missiles. Some were doubtful this would happen.
	   ``It is not in the Islamic tradition not to wage war during
Ramadan. Early Muslims fought all day without eating or drinking.
And we Arabs launched a war against Israel in 1973 during
Ramadan,'' said Hussein Hammeed, a Baghdad resident.
	   Ramadan is the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar. In it,
devout Muslims fast during daylight hours, eating at night and just
before dawn.
	   But Numan Abdulkarim, out shopping for Ramadan, said he would
pray all night that his wife and three grown children will be able
to have their Suhour _ the light morning meal _ to the sound of
Koran recitations and not deafening bombs.
	   ``We are by nature a peaceful people, but I do not know what has
happened to us,'' he said.
	   But while ordinary people yearned for a peaceful Ramadan, their
leaders gave no hint of a peaceful solution.
	   Both Saddam and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz declared Friday
that Iraq can withstand the bombing and defeat its enemies.
	   Saad Qassem Hammoudi, a senior official of the ruling Baath
party, spurned the idea that Iraqis were afraid of war.
	   ``The Iraqis believe in the just cause and the fight for the
lifting of sanctions. They will continue their steadfastness no
matter the sacrifices,'' he told The Associated Press.

Palestinians: Israeli refusal to meet deadline endangers peace
</HEADLINE>
process &QL; 
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Israel's refusal to meet a deadline to
cede more West Bank land to the Palestinians was a ``dangerous''
move that could freeze the peace process, a Palestinian leader said
Friday.
	   Israel was to hand over a further 5 percent of the land to
Palestinian control by Friday, according to the U.S.-brokered Wye
River land-for-peace agreement.
	   But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared earlier this week
that he would hold off until he sees evidence that the Palestinians
are meeting their obligations under the accord.
	   ``We have fulfilled our commitments,'' top Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said after a Palestinian Cabinet meeting.
``The Israeli government has not.''
	   Besides refusing to hand over land, Erekat said Israel has
failed to open a safe passage between the Gaza Strip and the West
Bank and to release prisoners.
	   ``We see this behavior as dangerous,'' Erekat said.
``Netanyahu's declarations mean the stopping of the peace
process.''
	   Netanyahu this week accused the Palestinians of failing to
contain anti-Israel violence. Before delivering more land, he said
the Palestinians must round up illegally held weapons; reduce the
Palestinian police force; and back off declared aspirations to
statehood or to a presence in Jerusalem.
	   There were signs Friday that the Palestinians were moving to
meet Netanyahu's demand.
	   In the West Bank town of Nablus, protesters against U.S. and
British airstrikes in Iraq tried to march toward Israeli outposts
to confront soldiers but Palestinian police quickly moved to
contain them.

	   CAMP DOHA, Kuwait (AP) _ Some 200 U.S. soldiers arrived in
Kuwait Friday, boosting the number of American forces in this small
Gulf state to 5,000.
	   The troops will be deployed in battle-ready positions along the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi border on Saturday, U.S. military spokesman Col. Ron
Williams said. The troops had flown for about 16 hours from Fort
Stewart, Georgia.
	   Kuwait fears that Iraq will retaliate for the current air
strikes by U.S. and British forces. Some of the warplanes taking
part in the raids are based in Kuwait.
	   ``It is critically important'' that troops in Kuwait are
prepared, Williams said.
	   The new troops marched into a fenced draw yard singing cadence,
put down their bags and their M16s and went to work. Their
immediate task will be to check equipment and move it to desert
positions near the Iraqi border.
	   ``Every time he (Saddam Hussein) does it, we jump over here,''
said Staff Sgt. Kurt Antoine of Asbury park, N.J. He had
participated in the 1991 Gulf War to evict Iraq from Kuwait, and in
several following buildups caused by Iraqi threats to Kuwait.
	   But for Pfc. Tylor Keen it is a whole new experience. It was the
first time the 21-year-old Newsmyrna Beach, Florida native had
deployed outside the United States.
	   ``I've never been to a different country, I'm looking forward to
it,'' he told The Associated Press. But, he added, Christmas away
from family was going to be ``weird.''
	   The soldiers were originally supposed to be part of a
1,250-strong task force that was going to take part in Intrinsic
Action, a routine exercise. But because of the strikes on Baghdad,
they became part of Operation Desert Fox, and their mandate changed
to deterring any possible aggression.
	   Checking a recovery vehicle, Sgt. Donald Merritt of Hinesville,
Georgia, said a possible Iraq attack with chemical or biological
weapons was ``the worst fear that everyone has, but we are trained
for it.''
	   Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement with the United States
after the Gulf War.
	   The United States and Britain launched the strikes this week
because of Iraq's alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors
seeking to verify the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.

	   BAGHDAD: House intern
	   Saturday's attack was the third wave of air strikes on Iraq
since the U.S. began its campaign in the dark hours of Thursday
morning to retaliate for Baghdad's alleged obstruction of U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the object of the campaign was
to diminish Iraq's ability to manufacture weapons of mass
destruction and its capacity to threaten its neighbors.
	   Late Friday, a cannon boomed over Baghdad to announce the start
of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Clinton has said it would be
offensive to the United States' Arab allies to continue the attacks
during Ramadan, but on Friday U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said the holy month would not necessarily be regarded as a
deadline.
	   Iraqi officials have said that 25 people have been killed and 75
wounded in the air raids.
	   Cohen said there had been no U.S. or British casualties.

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Rebel forces shelled a second provincial
city Friday in an apparent attempt to prevent the army from sending
reinforcements to a neighboring province where fighting has been
focused over the past two weeks.
	   The attack on Malange, about 350 kilometers (200 miles) east of
the capital Luanda, took place during the night and into the
morning, private radio station Radio Eclesia reported.
	   Shells landed less than one kilometer (half a mile) from the
provincial governor's palace in the center of the city. Several
wounded people, apparently civilians, were arriving at the city
hospital, the radio said.
	   The attack came as government forces in Malange reportedly were
preparing to move 300 kilometers (186 miles) south to Bie province
to try to break a rebel siege of the government-held city of Kuito.
	   Battles have focused on Bie's capital Kuito since fighting
between the government and UNITA rebels restarted two weeks ago,
ending a four-year peace agreement in the southwest African
country.
	   There was sporadic shelling early Friday in Cunji, about seven
kilometers (four miles) outside Kuito, which lies 500 kilometers
(300 miles) southeast of the capital Luanda, Radio Eclesia said.
	   Rebels reportedly shelled the airport, located in Kuito's
suburbs. The rebels have kept the airport under siege to choke the
government's air supply line.
	   Meanwhile, reports of several attacks in other parts of the
country apparently were an attempt by UNITA to disrupt army
strategy.
	   UNITA _ a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ has a well-equipped army of some
30,000 men experienced in guerrilla warfare. The government has
about 100,000 troops.
	   In Benguela province, 400 kilometers (250 miles) south of
Luanda, unidentified gunmen ambushed a bus, killing 11 people and
wounding 10 others, state-controlled daily Jornal de Angola
reported Friday.
	   Other areas, including Luena in the east and Uige in the
northwest, also were said to be tense.
	   Kris Janowski, a Geneva spokesman for the United Nations' High
Commissioner for Refugees, said their staff had reported ``recent
attacks or military activity'' in those cities.
	   An estimated 100,000 people have been displaced by the fighting
in the past two weeks, according to the UNHCR, making up a total of
500,000 displaced this year.
	   The U.N. World Food Program on Thursday flew 34 tons of food
into Luena, where there were some 30,000 displaced, adding to a
population of an estimated 100,000.
	   ``The security perimeter around the town is shrinking,'' WFP
spokeswoman Maria Flynn said in Luanda.
	   The WFP also said it delivered its first food aid _ maize, beans
and vegetable oil _ to some of the 50,000 people displaced in
Kuito.
	   Both sides fought a two-decade civil war following the country's
1975 independence from Portugal.
	   Several attempts at establishing a longlasting peace repeatedly
have failed, although neither side has yet acknowledged the
collapse of the latest one _ the 1994 U.N.-brokered Lusaka
protocol.

Anti-aircraft guns open fire in Baghdad

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Anti-aircraft guns began firing in Baghdad
early Saturday, hours after the United States and Britain launched
a third wave of attacks on Iraq.
	   Red tracer shells streaked across the night sky.
	   The anti-aircraft guns began firing at 1:20 local time
(2220GMT), moments after dull thuds were heard on the outskirts of
the city. Residents assumed these were the sounds of missiles
hitting the ground.
	   Unlike Thursday night when many U.S. cruise missiles exploded
close to the city center, no big explosions were heard in the first
minutes of the Saturday attack.
	   The anti-aircraft guns continued firing, but at lower rate than
in the earlier attacks on the city.
	   Cars were still passing in the streets near the Information
Ministry, from where foreign journalists operate, as the
anti-aircraft barrage continued.
	   The anti-aircraft guns began firing a little more than five
hours after U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told a Pentagon
news conference that the third wave of attacks had begun.
	   It is presumed that the opening strikes of this wave were
against targets far away from Baghdad.
	   ``The United States and British forces are continuing to attack
a wide range of military targets,'' Cohen said.
	   The third wave of strikes began as the U.S. Congress debated
whether Clinton should be impeached over allegations that he gave
false testimony to a grand jury about his relationship with a White
House intern.
	   The United States began the series of air strikes on Iraq in the
dark hours of Thursday morning to retaliate for Baghdad's alleged
obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors. The inspectors were charged
with verifying that Iraq has eliminated its mass-destruction
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said the object of the campaign was
to diminish Iraq's ability to manufacture weapons of mass
destruction and its capacity to threaten its neighbors.
	   Late Friday, a cannon boomed over Baghdad to announce the start

Cruise missiles: Weapon of choice has some disadvantages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo WX103 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN DIAMOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. cruise missiles, speeding to targets with
a faint whine and 1,000 or more pounds (450 kilograms) of
explosives, strike deep within Iraq without endangering pilots. But
there are problems: The missiles aren't always accurate, they're
expensive, and they're becoming scarce.
	   Defense officials say it will take months to figure out if the
cruise missiles launched against Iraq were effective. What is clear
already is that concern about the loss of aircrews has made cruise
missiles the weapon of choice in combat against Iraq.
	   As in the Gulf War, cruise missiles were the first weapons
launched against Iraq when the latest round of strikes began in the
early morning hours, Baghdad time, Thursday. By Friday, the Air
Force and Navy had launched nearly 300 cruise missiles, more than
the 289 fired at Iraq in the entire, five-week Gulf War in 1991.
	   Army Gen. Henry H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, showed some of the first results: reconnaissance photos of
the Ibn Al Haytham Missile Research and Development Center north of
Baghdad, struck by a Tomahawk cruise missile with a 1,000-pound
(450 kg) conventional warhead.
	   During the second and third days of the strikes, reporters in
Baghdad heard and felt much larger concussions. Those were the
3,000-pound (1350kilogram) warheads of the air-launched cruise
missiles, so-called air-to-ground conventional weapons, or AGM-86C.
	   The latest models of both these weapons are satellite-guided and
also contain computerized terrain-following programs that guide the
weapon to the target area. A target-matching imagery system then
brings the weapon through the final phase to the actual target.
	   The key advantage with cruise missiles is that no pilots are put
in danger over hostile territory. Ships in the Gulf, or B-52s
flying outside of Iraqi airspace, launch the weapons. Small jet
engines then carry the 18-foot-long winged tubes from 600 to 1,000
miles (1,000 to 1,600 kilometers) to their targets at a pace
approaching the speed of sound.
	   ``This is a launch-and-leave weapon,'' said Air Force Capt.
Kelly Lawson, a B-52 navigator, in a telephone interview from his
base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Just back from the
12-hour round trip to the skies above the Gulf, Lawson said once
the missile is launched, the B-52 turns away and its crew will only
learn later, if ever, if the weapon was on target.
	   Air Force Lt. Gen. Hal M. Hornburg, commander of air forces in
the Gulf, said, ``If we can use an unmanned weapon system to go
against heavily defended targets, our preference would be to do
so.''
	   These weapons epitomize the kind of push-button warfare
capability available to the U.S. military. But they also have
weaknesses:
	   _The engine, guidance and fuel loads carried by cruise missiles
limit the size of the warhead, especially in the case of the
Tomahawk, and they do not perform well against reinforced concrete
targets.
	   _Cruise missiles are less accurate than laser-guided bombs and
they are susceptible to mechanical failure. Tomahawks, in
particular, sometimes fail to make the transition from the rocket
launch phase to the jet engine cruise phase.
	   _Numbers are limited. The Air Force had only 239 AGM-86Cs in its
inventory before this week's strikes; the Navy has just over 2,000
Tomahawk missiles.
	   _At a cost of between dlrs 750,000 and dlrs 1.2 million, cruise
missiles are far more expensive than conventional bombs.
	   _Because, unlike aircraft, there are no onboard cameras,
assessing damage cruise missiles cause involves fly-overs by spy
planes and satellites.
	   In some cases, a cruise missile may do little visible damage to
the exterior of a structure even though the inside is demolished,
making an assessment from the sky difficult.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Saddam Hussein vowed Friday that
his country will ``not compromise or kneel'' as the United States
and Britain unleashed a third day of air strikes against Iraq.
	   Moments after the Iraq leader's tough talk, air raid sirens
wailed throughout the country, warning of a new wave of attacks
that have already struck government buildings, communications
centers and factories that could be used to build weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons inspectors
had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids, Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Friday.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage from the third night
of strikes, which did not target the capital.
	   There was one moment of jitters Friday night when a loud boom
was heard in Baghdad, but it turned out to be a cannon announcing
the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
	   Addressed the nation in a taped speech broadcast on state
television Friday evening, Saddam urged Iraqis to ``continue your
resistance.''
	   Saddam wore an olive green field marshal's uniform, ditching the
civilian suits he has favored in public since the last crisis with
the United Nations in February. It was his first television speech
appearance since the strikes began early Thursday.
	   ``We will not compromise or kneel in the face of injustice ...
We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' Saddam said.
	   Hours later, anti-aircraft guns opened fire again. A few minutes
earlier, reporters in Baghdad had heard dull thuds, indicating
bombardment in the distance, possibly outside Baghdad.
	   The bombardment came after U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said in Washington that the third wave of attacks had begun. It is
presumed that the opening strikes of this wave were against targets
far away from Baghdad.
	   Since Thursday, the United States has fired almost 300 cruise
missiles and U.S. pilots have flown some 200 combat sorties.

	   CAMP DOHA, Kuwait (AP) _ As the United States and Britain
launched a third wave of airstrikes over Iraq, about 200 U.S.
soldiers arrived in Kuwait on Friday, boosting the number of
American forces in this small Gulf state to 5,000.
	   The troops will be deployed in battle-ready positions along the
Kuwaiti-Iraqi border on Saturday, U.S. military spokesman Col. Ron
Williams said. The troops had flown for about 16 hours from Fort
Stewart, Georgia.
	   Kuwait fears that Iraq will retaliate for the current air
strikes by U.S. and British forces. Some of the warplanes taking
part in the raids are based in Kuwait.
	   ``Every time he (Saddam Hussein) does it, we jump over here,''
said Staff Sgt. Kurt Antoine, who took part in the 1991 Gulf War to
evict Iraq from Kuwait, and in several following buildups caused by
Iraqi threats to Kuwait.
	   Kuwait signed a 10-year defense agreement with the United States
after the Gulf War.
	   The United States and Britain launched the strikes this week
because of Iraq's alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors
seeking to verify the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.

Constitutional commission recommends Queen no longer be head of

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A government-appointed
constitutional commission recommended Friday that Barbados change
from a monarchy to a republic, removing the Queen of England as the
official head of state.
	   ``If our recommendation is accepted, in the future the head of
state will be the president of the republic of Barbados and would
be a native Barbadian either by birth or descent,'' said commission
chairman Sir Henry Forde.
	   The commission's report was delivered Friday to Parliament,
which accepted it without comment and adjourned until next year.
Officials expect Parliament is unlikely to act on the commission's
recommendations until after elections, which are expected to be
called during the first three months of 1999.
	   Forde said the change shows that after 32 years of independence
the former British colony called ``Little England'' has come of
age. He called the proposal ``a positive move that shows a sense of
maturity on the part of Barbados that it can function at the
highest level.''
	   While many Bajans, as Barbados residents call themselves, see
the old ties to Great Britain as outdated and largely irrelevant in
their daily lives, the former colony mostly lacks the sense of
resentment found in other Caribbean islands that were once outposts
of European empires.
	   Though most residents are the descendants of slaves that worked
on British plantations, the island has a less bloody history than
many of its neighbors, whose paths to independence often involved
violent slave uprisings, civil wars and other clashes.
	   But all over the world, British territories and others joined in
the Commonwealth are questioning old ties. Australia, where the
British monarch has been head of state for 210 years, will vote
next year whether to become a republic.

Exhibition game set for Saturday night

 &UR; Eds: NEW with Friday's developments &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey (AP) _ Gathered in another gambling
town and needy for publicity, locked-out National Basketball
Association players tried to boost prospects for their exhibition
game by billing it as a ``gift to the fans.''
	   But this gift, in person or on TV, comes with a price.
	   ``The Game on Showtime,'' featuring 16 current or former
All-Stars, will tip off at 9 p.m. EST Saturday night (0200 GMT
Sunday) at the Atlantic City Convention Center. The telecast is
available only to cable customers who pay a premium to receive
Showtime.
	   ``This weekend is for giving back to the fans,'' said Shawn Kemp
of the Cleveland Cavaliers, ``and hopefully people will tune in
around the country because people miss professional basketball.''
	   About 8,000 tickets have been sold or given away for the
12,500-seat arena, according to game director Curtis Polk, although
a ticket agent was quoted in Friday's edition of The Press of
Atlantic City as saying only 574 tickets, priced at dlrs 25, dlrs
50, dlrs 100, dlrs 200, dlrs 300 and dlrs 500, had been sold
through his agency as of Thursday morning.
	   Promoters historically have been wary of scheduling events in
this city between Thanksgiving and Christmas _ traditionally the
slowest time of the year.
	   Interest also has been kept down because of the
non-participation of Michael Jordan.
	   ``We have no expectations that Michael will attend,'' Polk said.
	   The 16 players will be divided into two teams. The ``Red'' team,
coached by Charles Barkley, will include Patrick Ewing, Tim
Hardaway, Kemp, Dan Majerle, Karl Malone, Reggie Miller, Mitch
Richmond and Dominique Wilkins.
	   The ``White'' team will include Alonzo Mourning, Vin Baker, Tom
Gugliotta, Allan Houston, Chris Webber, Glen Rice, Penny Hardaway
and Gary Payton.
	   ``We're going to have a little surprise on the `White' team
coach,'' Polk said.
	   For some of the players, this weekend will be the first time
they've seen each other since more than 200 of them gathered in Las
Vegas in late October for a union meeting.
	   Some have criticized the players for using two gambling towns
for their meetings.
	   Polk explained that Atlantic City was chosen because it is close
to Philadelphia, site of the now-canceled NBA All-Star game, and
because it is within 200 miles (320 kilometers) of several major
cities.
	   Since their caucus in Las Vegas, when an 82-game season remained
a possibility, the first 2 1/2 months of the season have been wiped
out by the owner-imposed lockout that threatens to cancel the
entire season. Players have lost more than dlrs 400 million in
salaries.
	   Commissioner David Stern said he spoke with union director Billy
Hunter by telephone Thursday but that no new negotiations are
scheduled.
	   Proceeds from the game will be donated to charities in the
Atlantic City and Philadelphia areas. Organizers backed off an
earlier plan to share some of the proceeds with ``needy' basketball
players.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A defiant Saddam Hussein vowed Friday that
his country will ``not compromise or kneel'' as the United States
and Britain unleashed a third day of air strikes against Iraq.
Anti-aircraft guns opened fire again over the skies of Baghdad
after reporters heard dull thuds, indicating bombardment in the
distance, early Saturday _ the first day of the Muslim holy month
of Ramadan. Iraqi officials say the bombardmants have already
killed 25 people and struck government buildings, communications
centers and factories that could be used to build weapons of mass
destruction. Almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids,
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Friday. He warned that Iraq
could no longer tolerate both U.N. arms searches and sanctions.
(IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A deeply divided House clashed Friday over
articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton, the first
time a chief executive has been cited for high crimes and
misdemeanors on the floor of Congress in 130 years. ``Perjury and
obstruction of justice cannot be reconciled with the office of the
president of the United States,'' Judiciary Committee Chairman
Henry Hyde argued on a day made all the more remarkable by an
ongoing campaign of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq and a stunning
admission of martial infidelity by the incoming speaker of the
House. Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt implored Republicans to
allow a vote to censure Clinton, thus sparing a scandal-weary
public the spectacle of a Senate trial on allegations stemming from
the president's efforts to cover up a sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky. (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Shaking off months of
frustrations and recriminations, Northern Ireland passed two
important landmarks Friday on the road to lasting peace. At 4 a.m.
(0400 GMT), senior Protestant and Catholic politicians shared
handshakes and weary smiles after finally agreeing on the shape of
their future coalition government, the central plank of April's
peace accord. Six hours later, submachine guns belonging to the
outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force were sawn to bits amid showers of
sparks and burning metal _ the first terrorist weapons to be
surrendered and destroyed under terms the accord. ``I never thought
I'd see the day,'' said a teary-eyed Michael McGoldrick, father of
the Protestant terrorist group's first murder victim, watching the
symbolic televised sight of a gun barrel being cut in two.
(NORTHERN IRELAND)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top government official promised
another security sweep targeting Kosovo Albanian rebels after the
battered body of a prominent Serb official was found dumped along a
roadside Friday. Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic,
addressing angry Serbs at a rally hours after the killing of a
municipal leader just outside Pristina, called the death ``one more
attack on Serbia.'' ``The earth is too small for them to hide,'' he
said of the killers, accusing the Kosovo Liberation Army and
pledging new action against them. The slaying of Zvonko Bojanic,
district mayor of Kosovo Polje, 5 kilometers (3 miles) west of the
provincial capital Pristina, was the latest jolt to increasingly
slim hopes that diplomacy can head off a return to full-scale war
in the separatist Serbian province. Dozens of people have been
killed since a U.S.-brokered agreement in October that was intended
to buy time for a political settlement on Kosovo's future status.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   COLUMBIA, South Carolina (AP) _ A man who stabbed an elderly
couple to death after they refused to let him borrow their car was
put to death by injection Friday in the 500th execution in the
United States since capital punishment resumed in 1977. Andrew
Lavern Smith was executed by injection and pronounced dead at 6:21
p.m., prisons spokesman John Barkley said. Before the curtain was
drawn on the death chamber, witnesses could hear people singing
``Amazing Grace.'' Smith made no final statement. Nine
death-penalty opponents were arrested outside Broad River
Correctional Institution in a civil disobedience protest shortly
before the execution. They sat on the prison's entrance road and
refused to move. (US-500th EXECUTION)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose Friday as technology shares soared
despite a dramatic debate in Washington about whether to impeach
President Clinton, and the second day of U.S. bombing of Baghdad.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.81 points
_ or by 0.3 percent _ at 8,903.63. Broader stock indexes were
sharply higher as computer-related and Internet stocks soared on
reports that online holiday sales were strong. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two days after Deutsche Bank said it
would spin off its industrial holdings into separate units,
Germany's Dresdner Bank said Friday that it was considering doing
the same. A spokesman said the move would be taken partly for tax
reasons, without elaborating. It wasn't clear when the move would
take place. Analysts say Dresdner Bank may be in a hurry to copy
Deutsche Bank's move to spin off its holdings via limited
partnerships, as tax benefits for adopting such a structure may
soon be abolished by the new center-left government. On Wednesday,
Deutsche Bank said it would fold its more than dlrs 24 billion
worth of industrial stocks _ including a 12 percent stake in
DaimlerChrysler _ into limited partnerships, which will be run by a
separate holding company. (GERMANY-DRESDNER BANK)
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Mexico, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia tried
but failed to reach a deal cutting production by a further 2
million barrels a day in a bid to boost sagging oil prices,
Mexico's oil minister said Friday. But the minister, Luis Tellez,
said the countries pledged to maintain cuts they agreed to in June
and would try to persuade other oil producers, such as Iran, to
join efforts to reduce global production. Tellez said that Iran,
the second-largest OPEC exporter behind Saudi Arabia, was producing
300,000 barrels per day more than the limit it voluntarily agreed
to in March, and that the extra production was creating problems
for the market. (OIL MEETING)
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Saudi Arabia's oil minister Friday said any
military activity in the Gulf can affect petroleum prices, but
there is now such an oil glut that not even U.S.-British bombings
of Iraq have had an impact. ``There is too much oil on the market
to worry about Iraq,'' Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi told reporters
after meeting his Norwegian counterpart, Marit Arnstad. Oil prices,
depressed by overproduction amid a global economic crisis, have
been at 12-year lows, costing exporting nations billions of dollars
in revenue. Saudi Arabia and Norway are the world's two largest oil
exporters. (NORWAY-SAUDI-OIL)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Chemicals and precious metals company
Degussa approved a merger with chemical company Huels AG on a vote
of 99.98 percent at a special shareholders meeting Friday in
Frankfurt. The merger had already been approved on Thursday by
Huels AG, which is 100 percent owned by the Veba trading, chemicals
and energy group, and is planned to be completed in February, a
Degussa statement said. ``Together we can attain growth and yield
goals that each company alone could not have realized,'' Degussa
Chairman Uwe-Ernst Bufe told the meeting. He said that growth was
expected especially from further internationalizing of the merged
companies and increased strength of capital. (GERMANY-DEGUSSA
MERGER)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Talks between President Bill Clinton and
leaders of the 15-nation European Union failed to achieve a
breakthrough Friday in a trade fight involving bananas. The United
States indicated it will press ahead with plans to impose punitive
tariffs on millions of dollars worth of European imports while
talks continue. Both sides held out the hope that the dispute,
which has dragged on for six years, will be resolved short of a
trade war breaking out between America and its largest trading
partner. But U.S. officials stressed that they would go ahead with
plans to select next week a list of European imports which would be
subject to 100 percent tariffs, in effect doubling their costs, to
American consumers. The products will be chosen from a preliminary

Koreans put on a happy face to be more competitive, democratic

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ It's Saturday night and a room full of
accountants and bank tellers are at school learning a new business
skill.
	   ``Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey,'' they chant together, pulling
their mouths into a grin at the end of each word.
	   They're practicing smiling. Instructors say it's the hardest
part of the curriculum at Korean Air Service Academy, a school that
aims to make Korean businesses more globally competitive by
teaching ``international manners.''
	   ``Koreans have difficulty smiling'' said Y.D. Lee, the academy's
general manager. ``Our ancestors ... had the philosophy that the
serious person _ stern or strict _ is better than the smiling one.
That's changing.''
	   The academy teaches not just service with a smile, but also
proper greetings, Korean bowing, posture, the importance of a
polite refusal and so on.
	   And it's not just for business.
	   Officials at the several academies that make up this growing new
consulting industry in Korea say their fastest-growing group of
students comes from government. That's partly because businesses
have been tightening their belts during the economic crisis of the
past two years and partly because citizens are demanding better
treatment from government.
	   Tax collectors, prosecutors and others are being sent to school
to polish their service manner _ a recognition of how things have
changed from the years of authoritarian military governments that
ended a decade ago. Then, it was citizens who had to show deference
to rulers.
	   ``It's a symbol of a democratic conscience for a government
official to express kindness and sincerity,'' said H.D. Cho,
assistant general manager at the Korean Air school.
	   Since the airline started the academy in late 1992, competitor
Asiana Airlines also has started a course and travels the country
to train people at their workplaces. Samsung Group opened an
institute south of Seoul and other companies have started their
in-house programs or hired newly formed consulting firms to do the
job.
	   Prices and length of courses vary, but a client would pay about
dlrs 1,600 to send 25 employees to an 8-hour course over two days
at Korean Air. About 15,000 people attend each year at Korean Air
alone.
	   ``Before, the main factor in competing was the product,'' said
Lee. ``Now our product, price and quality are on the same level (as
local and global competitors), but the difference is service _ the
way of delivery, way of speaking, way of negotiating.''
	   And what's wrong with Korean manners? Nothing, really. Koreans,
perhaps most among Asians, still teach their children the Confucian
value of respecting elders and superiors, knowing their place,
knowing when to speak. But the effect, Cho said, is that a person
can appear reserved and formal _ that is, not exude an eagerness to
be of service.
	   ``You not only have to make yourself more approachable, but have
to be able to approach someone easily,'' he said.
	   Lee said that although some students have difficulty with the
course, everyone can succeed.
	   And at a recent Saturday night class, student Cha Myoung-eun was
willing to try.
	   Smiling isn't so difficult to learn, said Cha, a 29-year-old
accountant at Nara Bank. ``The hard thing is to get into the habit
(of) doing it.''

Kjus shakes Austrians self-confidence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be UPDATED with Saturday's race
scheduled to begin at 1145 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VAL GARDENA, Italy (AP) _ Self-confidence is the key on the
men's World Cup circuit these days.
	   Norway's Lasse Kjus boosted his own Friday as he won his second
downhill race in seven days and shot for a sensational third
consecutive triumph on Saturday.
	   Skiers of the powerful Austrian team had their confidence shaken
when they were badly beaten by the Norwegian rival in their
favorite discipline, following an impressive season start.
	   Kjus, a 1996 World Cup overall champion, dominated Friday's
speed race in Val Gardena beating Werner Franz and Hermann Maier,
the ``Herminator,'' by a wide margin.
	   ``If I'm lucky and I repeat myself tomorrow, I can think of
another victory,'' said Kjus, whose consecutive downhill wins
vaulted him atop the World Cup overall standings, with 413 points.
	   Kjus has been pocketing points in all four World Cup disciplines
and leads a trio of Austrians between 30 to 73 points after nine
races.
	   ``This victory, with an amazing time, has boosted my self
confidence and my chances for the next race,'' Kjus said.
	   Saturday's downhill will be run on the same, icy Saslong course
which hosted Friday's event _ an added race to make up for the one
canceled in Whistler Mountain, Canada, earlier this month.
	   Maier, who trailed Kjus by 1.10 seconds, conceded the Austrian
team morale was flying low following the consecutive setbacks,
which followed two wins by Maier, two by Stephan Eberhartert and
one by Thomas Stangassinger in previous Super-G, giant slalom and
slalom races.
	   ``Personally I'm not frustrated because I could not do any
better today. I lacked experience on this course,'' said Maier, the
defending World Cup overall, Super-G and giant slalom champion.
	   Italian organizers were hoping of an accident-free race down the
3,495-meter long fast course following the bad spills which knocked
out American Ehlias Louis and Frenchman David Pretot on Friday.
	   Louis, 23, of Park City, was out for the rest of the season with
a torn left knee cruciate ligament. Pretot tore a right knee
ligament.

Gerg hands Germany first win of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be UPDATED with Saturday's race by 1300
GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VEYSONNAZ, Switzerland (AP) _ Looking more like a speed demon
than a slalom expert, Hilde Gerg gave Germany an unexpected first
win of the season on Friday with a victory in the women's downhill.
	   Charging down the rock-hard Piste de l'Ours course .42 seconds
clear of runnerup Pernilla Wiberg, the Olympic slalom gold
medallist proved she was as much a speedster as a technical master.
	   She also proved she has what it takes to pick up some of the
slack in the absence of Germany's overall World Cup champion and
double Olympic gold medallist Katja Seizinger.
	   With their illustrious teammate out for the entire season due to
injured knees, the German women have been floundering, reaching the
podium just five times in 11 races.
	   At this time last season, Germany could already count six
victories, all Seizinger's.
	   ``All the pressure is gone now,'' said Gerg. ``That's why I let
out such a huge scream at the finish.
	   ``After winning the slalom gold at the Olympics I went into
every race feeling pressured and with Katja out I started to feel
it even more,'' explained Gerg. ``But now the pressure is gone and
I can ski again.''
	   Teammate Martina Ertl, runnerup behind Seizinger in the World
Cup overall last season, has managed a second in a giant slalom and
a second and third in the super-G, while Regina Haeusl collected a
third in a downhill in Lake Louise, Canada.
	   Before Friday, Gerg's contribution was limited to a third place
finish in the other Lake Louise downhill.
	   Germany's meager performances have permitted Austrian skiers to
rise to the fore-front, winning 7-of-11 races and posting 13 podium
finishes.
	   As a result, Austria's women lead in every discipline, with
Alexandra Meissnitzer topping the overall, super-G and giant slalom
standings.
	   Teammate Renate Goetschl leads the downhill and Sabine Egger the
slalom.
	   On Friday the Austrians were excluded from the top-three, as
Wiberg finished runnerup, ahead of Italy's Bibiana Perez, who
claimed her first career downhill podium.
	   Meissnitzer, still seeking a first career downhill win, finished
fourth, missing the podium for just the fifth time in 11 races.
	   The Austrian tops the overall table with 675 points, a
significant 277 ahead of Ertl, whose 16th place finish did nothing
to narrow the gap.
	   Goetschl clings to third with 362 points.
	   The winner of both races at the season-opening downhill
double-header in Lake Louise, Goetschl appeared headed for a third
consecutive victory until narrowly escaping a nasty fall coming
into the finish area, crossing 14th.
	   ``I was just glad I didn't crash,'' said Goetschl, the reigning
world and World Cup champion in the combined.
	   Despite the result, the Austrian still hangs onto the lead in
the downhill rankings, ahead of Italy's Isolde Kostner, runnerup in
the back-to-back Lake Louise downhills behind Goetschl.
	   Goetschl will have the opportunity to redeem herself in another
downhill on Saturday, which will also count, along with Sunday's
slalom, towards the combined.

 &UR; SANTA'S HOMELAND: Tourists flock to snowy land of reindeer &QL;

 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROVANIEMI, Finland (AP) _ In this snowy land of reindeer and the
eerie aurora borealis, no one dare mutter, ``Bah, humbug.''
Scrooge's infamous put-down of Christmas cheer is blasphemy to the
half-million people who journey every year to this remote town in
the Arctic Circle to visit the home of Santa Claus.
	   Although this capital of Lapland is actually well south of the
North Pole, Rovaniemi, some 700 kilometers (450 miles) north of
Helsinki, has made the case for being Santa's home convincingly
enough that visitors come from around the world.
	   Some even come on the supersonic Concorde _ about as close to a
magic sleigh ride as real life can offer _ on trips arranged by
several travel operators. The largest number of visitors come from
the United Kingdom, Japan and Poland, in that order.
	   For Arthur and Joyleen Deer of Adelaide, Australia, it was a
long haul from the other side of the planet, but worth every mile
(kilometer), they said.
	   ``You can't comprehend it,'' Mrs. Deer says, standing with her
husband on the snow-swept porch of the main building at Santa Claus
Village. ``Where we grew up, this sort of scene was an absolute
dream.''
	   In winter _ that is to say, about half the year here _ the Santa
Claus Village that sits right on the Arctic Circle eight kilometers
(five miles) outside town is an almost picture-perfect rendition of
an old-fashioned Christmas. Neat wooden buildings are arrayed under
snow-laden pines, aromatic log fires crackle comfortingly, and a
few reindeer browse in the background.
	   It's a scene that can bring out the sentimentalist in anyone _
even in cynical teen-agers.
	   Mark Gardner, a university student visiting from Wales, fell
under the spell and sat on Santa's lap. When Santa asked what he
wanted, his pals hooted and told him, ``Ask for a 5-foot-10
(1.8-meter) brunette!'' He blushed and quietly said he hoped for a
stereo.
	   ``Well, I figured I wouldn't get a brunette, because they're all
blondes up here,'' he explains later, his bravado a bit restored.
	   Santa Claus Village manages to sap cynicism partly because it
doesn't try to drain visitors' wallets. There's no admission
charge, the food prices are reasonable (keeping in mind that in
Finland 7 markkaa (dlrs 1.30) for a basic cup of coffee is not out
of line) and the park offers free attractions, including an exhibit
of teepee-like wooden huts and a charming trail bordered by lighted
ice and snow sculptures.
	   It's possible to spend a cheery half-day here without spending
anything more than the 17-markkaa (dlrs 3) bus fare from town and
parents will be pleased to find that the gift shops' shelves are
stocked with well-made goods that are competitively priced.
	   (Parents of small children should be warned that reindeer meat
is a favorite Finnish treat, featured at many local restaurants in
Lapland. So parents may want to guard the menus to keep the kids
from figuring out that they may be eating Rudolph.)
	   Rovaniemi's claim to be the true home of Santa Claus apparently
dates from 1927, when a Finnish radio announcer claimed that Santa
lived in the area. The idea warmed hearts in what was then a
relatively poor country struggling through its first years of
independence.
	   The conceit took off in the 1950s, after Eleanor Roosevelt,
widow of the U.S. president, paid a visit to the town, which was
almost completely leveled in World War II. The visit of the popular
Mrs. Roosevelt drew considerable media attention to the obscure
town, where reindeer previously had been important only for
providing food and clothing.
	   Once a major market town, where city folks from the south
dickered for food and hides produced by the indigenous Sami people,
Rovaniemi was in need of a modern source of income and latched on
to the burgeoning tourist market.
	   This year, another Santa-related attraction has opened: the
Santapark theme park built in an artificial cavern hollowed out of
a hillside near Santa Claus Village.
	   Unlike the village, the park charges admission, about 85 markkaa
(about dlrs 15) for adults.
	   Rovaniemi, a small city of 40,000 that is the capital of Finnish
Lapland, is also home to the Arktikum museum, an extensive display
about life in the Arctic.
	   For those who want to experience the severe beauty of Lapland
firsthand, there are outfitters who will arrange ventures ranging
from a couple of hours on a sled pulled by wacky howling dogs to a
week skiing through the silent forests.
	   Although Rovaniemi never endures the round-the-clock winter
blackout of the farther north, the sun's above the horizon less
than an hour a day for much of December and January.
	   But on those days, the sky glows an odd, thrilling blue after
the sun sets. When the blue fades to black, the aurora borealis
might appear, snaking, darting and shimmering in arrays that make
even lifelong residents fall silent.

	   Around Christmas, people in the Nordic lands abandon their
usually modest eating habits in order to indulge in ``joulupoytas''
(``julbords'' in Swedish and Norwegian), holiday buffets where they
gorge on food like bears preparing for a long winter.
	   A well-done joulupoyta can stretch 30 feet long, crowded with
foods of unexpected variety. There's herring prepared a half-dozen
ways _ with mustard, chili and even with bright red lingonberries _
as well as several other kinds of seafood.
	   Then there's julskinka, ham cured and cooked in an elaborate
days-long process that includes painting it with a glaze of egg and
mustard and breadcrumbs. Beetroot salad, potatoes and a variety of
cheeses come before dessert, which usually includes tarts, rice
puddings and berries.
	   No joulupoyta is really complete unless it's decorated with a
pig's head adorned with cake frosting.
	   Like the joulupoyta, much of Nordic life around Christmastime is
a mix of indulgence and modesty. Strings of Christmas lights weave
a net across many city streets, but the lights are generally just
white, not multicolored.
	   Garish home displays are rare. More typical is an electric
seven-step candelabra in windows, one candle for each of the weeks
from Advent to Epiphany.
	   Outdoor Christmas markets usually feature handicrafts, including
the ever-popular ``Christmas goat'' figures woven of straw.
Explanations of the connection between goats and the holiday vary
widely.
	   Also at the markets are the spices for making ``gloegg,'' the
hot wine served in a cup with raisins and almonds at virtually
every Christmas event.
	   At the joulupoyta, tradition requires everyone at the table to
make eye contact with everyone else when drinking a toast.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A tall fir tree with golden ornaments and a
life size nativity scene both set up in front of the obelisk in St.
Peter's Square have become the symbols of Christmas in Rome.
	   Tourists hasten to be photographed in front of the wooden
stable, and Romans have grown accustomed to the incongruous sight
of Alpine pine branches in the Renaissance square.
	   Up until 20 years ago, when Pope John Paul II insisted on
bringing some of his native Polish tradition to the Vatican, a
porcelain babe in a manger to one side of the main altar in St.
Peter's Basilica was the only visible sign that it was Christmas
time.
	   In fact, Roman Christmas has little to do with the northern
notion of holiday cheer, with its jingling bells, gently falling
snowflakes, and, of course, Santa Claus. St. Nick only arrived in
the wave of post World War II American influence in Europe.
	   Now he appears on TV commercials, and shows up at the open air
Christmas markets such as the one in Piazza Navona, but he still
has to fatten up to match the jolly figure beloved by children in
the United States.
	   There is no caroling through the narrow streets of downtown
Rome, although many are elaborately decorated. Instead shepherds in
native costume come down from the Abruzzi mountains to blow a sad
little tune on their bagpipes. Putting a penny -- or some lire --
in their tipped hat is said to bring good luck.
	   The words of the tune ``Tu scendi dalle stelle'' (You descend
from the stars) speak of the sacrifice of a shivering baby born in
a cold grotto, nothing like the words of comfort reserved for the
sleeping babe in English carols.
	   Although many homes now also have beautifully decorated
Christmas trees, the focal point of the family Christmas is the
``presepio'' or creche. This, however, is no ordinary nativity
scene, but rather a full fledged village built around a simple
stall or grotto. The whole family works on setting it up, and on
Christmas eve the youngest child places baby Jesus in the manger.
	   The most elaborate presepios come from Naples, and many have
movable parts such as running water, glowing flames and even
villagers going about their daily tasks, like a baker putting bread
into the oven.
	   Most of Rome's hundreds of churches also pride themselves in
elaborate nativity scenes, which remain on display for at least a
month after Christmas.
	   If Santa came to this town relatively recently, the Befana, an
old head-kerchiefed woman with a hook nose and glasses has been
around for the better part of the century. She travels on a broom
instead of in a sleigh leaving presents for good children and
pieces of black coal (sugar) for the transgressors.
	   The Befana delivers on the Jan. 6 feast of the Three Kings, so
some Italian children are doubly lucky.
	   The exchange of Christmas gifts usually takes place on Christmas
Eve when the family has gathered for a sparse meal based on fish
before going to midnight Mass. After Mass the family reunites for a
glass of sparkling wine and a piece of traditional panettone, a
dome shaped white cake dotted with raisins.
	   Those children who believe in ``Babbo Natale'' (Father
Christmas) open their presents Christmas morning before the big
family dinner: Tortellini - meat tucked into pockets of pasta, a
capon or turkey, more pannetone, and torrone, a chocolate bar chock
full of nuts and nougat.
	   Highlight of the pope's Christmas is midnight Mass in St.
Peter's Basilica.
	   Earlier in the evening the nativity scene and the tree in the
square have been lit for the first time.
	   Although the Mass is still accompanied by the Gregorian chant of
the Sistine choir, John Paul usually invites another choir to sing
the traditional carols familiar to many of the tourists attending
the ceremony.
	   The pope, 78 years old and ailing, no longer presides over the
public Mass on Christmas Day but will deliver his traditional
Christmas message and impart his ``Urbi et Orbi'' (to the city and
the world) blessing at noon. At that time he also delivers
Christmas greetings in over 50 languages. Both the midnight Mass
and the blessing are televised worldwide.
	   John Paul has made it a habit to meet with fellow Poles living
in the city before Christmas to sing Polish carols and break the
traditional ``oplatek'' bread.
	   He is said to spend Christmas Eve with his closest aides,
including his Polish secretary Bishop Stanislaw Dziwisz.
	   The small tree with hand made Polish ornaments which along with
a creche adorns the papal apartments is a gentle reminder of the
white Christmases John Paul left behind in his native Poland.

Tradition gives holiday a French twist

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Christmas stockings haven't quite caught on in
France, and candy canes hang from fewer trees and mantels. But here
the holiday known as ``Noel'' is not all that foreign to a visiting
American.
	   There are decorations, parties, gifts, religious services, and
overly crowded stores. The image is bright, festive, and above all,
traditional. It is the tradition, perhaps, that gives the actual
celebration of Christmas a French twist.
	   My first Christmas in France was a gathering of family and
friends. The feast began at 9 p.m. on Christmas Eve and ended in
the early morning hours with the final few crumbs of the ``buche de
Noel,'' or Yule log, a sponge cake filled with butter cream and
rolled into jelly roll form. Our meal, the same as the one shared
by many French families, was a tribute to the country known for its
gastronomy.
	   The menu is not for the fainthearted. It begins with oysters,
smoked salmon or escargots, all of which are typically French.
Turkey with chestnuts, salad and cheese, and finally, dessert.
	   In between courses, there were presents, Santa Claus' rapid,
midnight visit while the children were distracted, and a giant real
tree.
	   For most, quieter festivities continue on Christmas Day. The
meal is lighter and the day is shared with immediate family
members.
	   But Christmas in France, much like the holiday season in the
United States, is not simply a two-day affair. Decorations and
special events, often even in the smallest of villages, begin more
than a month ahead. In early November, Paris becomes a winter
wonderland.
	   The famous department store Galeries Lafayette sprawling along
the boulevard Haussmann starts the holiday shopping season with
indoor and outdoor displays as early as Nov. 11. The store spends
between 3 and 4 million French Francs (dlrs 500,000 and dlrs
650,000) on the project, estimates Ovan Trouillet of the store's
decorating department.
	   In keeping with the French love of fashion, each year a designer
takes the leading role. ``This year there is the `French touch' of
Christian Lacroix,'' Trouillet said.
	   Lacroix has dressed the store in tones of blue that were
inspired by the Christmas sky. A 50-foot (15-meter) Christmas tree
has its place under the finely sculpted, domed ceiling. It, too, is
covered with the night-sky decor.
	   Outside Galeries Lafayette, the Christmas theme continues with a
story told though glass. Twenty-five windows, designed by Lacroix
and illustrator Emmanuel Pierre, visually tell the tale of
constellations one Christmas night.
	   The Star Boutique, featuring everything needed to decorate _ and
gift items as well _ is open on the third floor until the end of
December. Many of the items presently for sale were designed by
Lacroix. There is a Lacroix bath towel selling for 395 French
francs (about dlrs 70), a candle sculpted with suns for 145 French
francs (about dlrs 25), and many other items varying in prices.
	   And for those who can't take the time to visit Galeries
Lafayette, there is always the store's Internet site.
	   On Paris' most famous avenue, the Champs-Elysees, the holiday
season begins at the end of November with its trees strung with
lights.
	   For a two-month display, 70,000 light bulbs are used, said
Sandrine Hecht of the Champs-Elysees Committee's illumination
service.
	   The cost of lighting one tree for two months is about 8,000
French francs (dlrs 1,300), Ms. Hecht said.
	   Decorating the avenue dates back to the 1950s, but lighting the
trees only began in the early 1980s with a request by the shop
owners. The shops pay only for the illuminations on their part of
the sidewalk. The lights that continue along the avenue toward the
Place de la Concorde are paid for by the committee.
	   ``The goal was to attract the eye to the Champs,'' Ms. Hecht
said. ``The display is not very active, but it is a beautiful
perspective. It holds a certain Latin idea of Christmas.''
	   More Christmas magic can be found about a half-hour away from
the bustle of the city. In the town of Marne-La-Vallee, it is a
Disney Christmas.
	   Reindeer from Finland accompany Santa and his sleigh every
afternoon as part of the Christmas Parade.
	   A 60-foot (18-meter) Christmas tree covered with 7,000 light
bulbs is one of the regular holiday attractions.
	   ``Each year we like to innovate, but the lights of winter are
the same _ classic,'' said Claudine Sintes, a park spokeswoman.
	   Changes include the parade's theme _ this year it's inspired by
Tchaikovsky's ballet ``The Nutcracker'' _ and entertainment in the
park.
	   This Christmas at Disneyland Paris is much like that of its
American counterparts. The Hotel New York in the adjacent Disney
Village even has a large ice rink that was designed to resemble
Rockefeller Center's original.
	   When Christmas is over, the French look forward to more magic:
New Year's Eve and Day. The holiday decorations remain, so does the
chill in the air, and the Yule log is replaced by the ``Galette des
Rois,'' an almond paste-filled cake.
	   On New Year's Day, everyone is served a slice. The person who
bites into the party favor hidden somewhere within the flaky layers
wears a shiny, paper crown for the day _ and becomes king, or
queen, for the year.

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ The last place Judy Flaherty expected to be
the week before Christmas last year was this city's French Quarter.
	   The New York woman loved New Orleans and had always enjoyed her
visits, but she just didn't link the naughty Big Easy, known for
its Mardi Gras carousing, with the Christmas holidays.
	   ``I guess I'd always thought of Bourbon Street and night clubs
when I thought of the French Quarter,'' Flaherty said. ``We were
just here on a stopover before going on to my mother's house in
Texas. But we ended up staying an extra four days and are planning
to come back again this year.''
	   New Orleans at Christmas has always had a unique air, from the
decorated balconies in the French Quarter, to the
ribbon-and-greenery-adorned streetcars rolling along St. Charles
Avenue, to the elaborately constructed bonfires that blaze on the
Mississippi River levee to guide Papa Noel on Christmas Eve.
	   But the festivities have expanded markedly in the past two
years.
	   ``People who only think of New Orleans in terms of Bourbon
Street are shortchanging themselves,'' said Gary Esolen of the New
Orleans Tourism Marketing Corp. ``There are many unique attractions
in the city and our Christmas celebration is just one of them.''
	   The Christmas festivities are also growing in popularity with
residents as well as visitors.
	   ``I think our Christmas has combined a lot of Old World
traditions with the kind of things we always do here _ getting
together to celebrate, lots of music, lots of different customs,''
said Dave Roy, a New Orleans resident. ``We always go to see a
bonfire and we always go to the caroling in Jackson Square.''
	   The bonfires dot the Mississippi River levee for miles
(kilometers). They range from plain towers to elaborate replicas of
plantation homes, boats and even alligators. Building them has
become a competition among various groups.
	   Lighting them is a tradition that attracts thousands.
	   The bonfires can be viewed throughout the month, culminating
with Christmas Eve blazes that are watched from riverboats or the
shore.
	   If you like your lights without the heat, ``Christmas in the
Oaks'' is a holiday extravaganza featuring thousands of Christmas
lights in the huge, Spanish moss-draped oak trees in New Orleans'
City Park. The light displays turn the huge park into a fairyland,
with carolers, a live nativity scene, storybook villages,
horse-drawn carriages and an old-fashioned carousel.
	   On Dec. 19, the display includes ``Snowland,'' when 40 tons of
artificial snow are trucked in for children to play in. The display
is strictly temporary in New Orleans' mild climate.
	   Music, a big part of any New Orleans celebration, is everywhere
in December.
	   The biggest caroling takes place Dec. 20 in Jackson Square, the
French Quarter park. Thousands light candles and sing carols
beginning at 7 p.m. Candles and song sheets are provided free.
	   Strolling carolers perform throughout the French Quarter daily
and there are gospel concerts which sometimes include some of the
city's famous musicians as well as children's groups and church
choirs.
	   This year, daily parades with brass bands, Papa Noel, and
puppets representing ``Giants of Jazz,'' such as Louis Armstrong,
will wind through the narrow French Quarter streets as well.
	   And of course, expect performances from the usual assortment of
street musicians, mimes, jugglers and other entertainers.
	   Food is as much a part of New Orleans ambiance as music, and
it's also a big part of the month-long Christmas festivities.
	   Reveillon dinners will be served by 32 restaurants, including
many of the city's most famous.
	   ``Traditionally, reveillon was the meal Creole families ate
after midnight Mass,'' said Ted Brennan of Brennan's Restaurant.
``It was really a feast because families had been fasting before
Mass.''
	   It's a feast again at Brennan's, Arnauds, Galatoires,
Commander's Palace and other restaurants that are serving it.
	   The four or five-course prix fixe meals range from dlrs 18.95 to
dlrs 45 and include such delicacies as smoked rabbit gumbo, roast
goose or crawfish and tasso-laced quail, tasso being Cajun-style
jerked beef. Desserts include chocolate bread pudding and sweet
potato pecan pie.
	   ``It's a chance for our chefs to really do some wonderful
traditional dishes that are a big part of the season for many
families,'' Brennan said.
	   Coming as it does in a traditionally slow period, hotels in the
city are offering big discounts during December.
	   ``You can find room rates from 40 to 60 percent off the regular
rates this month,'' said Brett Smith of the St. Louis Hotel. ``So
it's a bargain as well as a lot of fun.''
	   Although the event is a family celebration and there are many
activities for children, visitors include single people and couples
as well, Smith said.
	   After all, Bourbon Street, with its jazz clubs, strip joints and
nonstop honky-tonks, is still staging its 24-hour-a-day party along
with everything else that's going on.

Second Disney cruise ship set to sail in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Florida (AP) _ Disney will be late setting
sail with its second cruise ship, but the delay will pay off for
passengers who have to rebook.
	   The Disney Wonder will debut Aug. 15 from Port Canaveral, said
Amy Foley, a Disney Cruise Line spokeswoman.
	   Officials say they hadn't set a debut date, but in January the
cruise line started taking reservations for the Wonder with the
first public sailing set for March.
	   Construction delays began with the Disney Magic. It sailed from
Port Canaveral in July, several months later than scheduled.
	   The Wonder, under construction at the same Italian shipyard,
will look exactly like the 2,400-passenger Magic.
	   Passengers who booked on the Wonder between March and Aug. 15
can rebook on the Magic.
	   Those who can get the same stateroom will be given dlrs 250 to
spend aboard the ship. Passengers who are unable to book into the
same stateroom will be given a dlrs 500 credit.
	   The Wonder will follow the same itinerary as the Magic, sailing
from Port Canaveral to the Bahamas on three-and-four-day cruises.

 &UR; Living a dog's life on a grand scale
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Travelers who can't bear to leave their pets at
home will find a warm but expensive welcome at a downtown menagerie
that also bills itself as a hotel.
	   All kinds of pets are welcome and pampered for a price at the
Soho Grand in Manhattan, although exotic pets and birds have to
stay in their cages.
	   Run-of-the-mill dogs and cats, however, can step out with a
walker, go for a ride in a limo, choose from an assortment of toys,
sleep on a full body pillow, or get their own toothbrush at prices
ranging from dlrs 8 to dlrs 20.
	   Two-legged guests who worry about animal allergies, can request
a room off-limits to pets. Nightly room rates, pet or otherwise,
run a hefty dlrs 334 to dlrs 414, but do include, if you like, a
complimentary gold fish.
	   The hotel, owned by the pet products firm, Hartz Mountain
Industries, Inc., can be reached at the Web site www.sohogrand.com.

 &UR; New museum for children to open in Baltimore
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ A new ``kid-powered'' museum that opens here
Dec. 29 will emphasize problem-solving and fun.
	   ``From concept to design, we have listened to our major audience
_children_ and they have told us what they want,'' said Kathy Dwyer
Southern, the Port Discovery museum's president and CEO.
	   Designed in collaboration with Walt Disney Imagineering and a
team of educators, the museum will feature exhibits, activities,
program development with the community and services to schools.
	   Located in the historic Fishmarket Building amidst Baltimore's
Inner Harbor attractions, it will be one of the largest of the more
than 250 children's museums across the country.

 &UR; Eating American takes top honors in Chicago
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Eating out in Chicago is a good buy, no matter
how you slice it, according to the eater/reviewers for the 1999
Zagat Survey.
	   Compared to Paris, London and New York, a good Windy City meal
was cheaper in all categories: expensive, average or best values.
	   But the Chicago restaurant ranked No. 1 in popularity is no
cheapskate. The average price of a meal, one drink and tip at
Charlie Trotter's, given the No. 1 spot by the 1,873 diners
surveyed, weighed in at a hefty dlrs 92.
	   Of the 20 most expensive restaurants in the four cities, Paris
topped the list with an average of dlrs 128.52, while the average
cost of Chicago's 20 most expensive restaurants was a mere dlrs
58.34.
	   Charlie Trotter's was described by reviewers as the ``Lincoln
Park temple to New American dining'' that's ``like going to an art
show on plates.'' Trotter's bumped it's Lincoln Park neighbor,
Ambria, from last year's No. 1 spot down to No. 3 for 1999.
	   In the No. 2 spot for most-popular was Le Francais in suburban
Wheeling, which was No. 4 last year.
	   Judged on food alone for 1999, Le Francais was No. 1, Ambria was
No. 2 and Carlos' was No. 3. Charlie Trotter's was a distant No. 9
in the food category.
	   Service was the big complaint among diners, with 61 percent
saying it was the most irritating aspect of Chicago dining.

Colbert, Costner lead senior-celebrity golf tourney
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA QUINTA, California (AP) _ Jim Colbert and actor Kevin Costner
teamed to shoot a tournament-record, 14-under-par 58 for the
first-round lead Friday in the Lexus Senior Challenge.
	   Larry Nelson and actor Sean Connery were three strokes back at
61 in the two-day, best-ball event featuring 12 Senior PGA Tour
players paired with celebrities.
	   Costner shot a 79, the first time he'd ever broken 80. He played
a pro golfer in the 1995 movie ``Tin Cup.''
	   ``I was surprised that I never blew up out there,'' he said. ``I
didn't have four or five bad holes like I usually do. When I missed
that foot and a half putt for a birdie I could have blown up. But
Jim made his birdie putt and everything went well.''
	   Colbert laughed when Costner had to remove his new golf shoes
after the ninth hole to bandage blisters.
	   ``He's a professional on the screen,'' Colbert said, ``but he's
an amateur on the golf course.''
	   The celebrities don't share in the dlrs 1 million prize money,
but their scores are used to determine how much the pros earn.
	   Bob Murphy and Seattle Mariners slugger Ken Griffey Jr. shot 62
to share third with Jay Sigel and actor Randy Quaid.
	   Griffey eagled the par-5, 495-yard (450-meter) second hole on
the 6,825-yard (6,211-meter) Citrus course at the La Quinta resort.
	   ``I was nervous at the start and it took me a couple of holes to
get comfortable,'' he said. ``I just wish I could be more
consistent and had a little better touch. It felt just like opening
day.''
	   Connery also eagled the second. He won the tournament in 1996
with Hale Irwin, who is partnering Michael Jordan this year. Irwin
and Jordan were tied with Johnny Miller and singer Glenn Frey at
67.
	   ``I still get nervous out there,'' said Connery, who gained
movie fame as James Bond. ``To have a pro give you the line on your
putts really makes a huge difference. I can judge the pace of the
greens, but Larry helped me with the line.''
	   Defending champions Raymond Floyd and actor William Devane were
at 7-under, tied with Hubert Green and ``Today'' co-host Matt
Lauer.

Security Council starts considering what happens after the bombs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Even though U.S. airstrikes wrested the
Iraqi crisis from the United Nations, the Security Council will
have to put the pieces back together once the bombs stop falling.
	   And council members are already starting to consider what
happens next _ though serious discussion isn't expected until next
week when the airstrikes are expected to be over.
	   Since the Gulf War ended in 1991, the council has used a
combination of sanctions and inspections to compel Iraq to abandon
its development and production of weapons of mass destruction.
	   In the eyes of Iraq's supporters on the council _ Russia, France
and China _ the U.S. and British bombing campaign now under way
represents a failure of that strategy.
	   Now France and Russia are starting to explore new ideas and are
seeking support of other council members.
	   French President Jacques Chirac and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair discussed the way forward on Iraq during a telephone
conversation Friday and Chirac stressed the need for the
international community to find ``a long-term global strategy,''
Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said in Paris.
	   The objective of the approach that Chirac and Blair are working
on should be ``to define a new relationship between the United
Nations and Iraq allowing for assurances of the control of Iraq's
disarmament under the authority of the Security Council,'' she
said.
	   Chirac is also concerned that greater consideration should be
given to the Iraqi people and he backed an expansion of the
oil-for-food program, Colonna said.
	   During Friday's Security Council meeting, French Ambassador
Alain Dejammet asked council members to try to imagine a new system
that would ensure that Iraq does not revive its banned weapons
programs without inflicting unintended hardship on the Iraqi
people, diplomats said.
	   What that could mean is the end to the wide-ranging, tough
economic sanctions now in effect, which has been Baghdad's key
demand for years.
	   Security Council resolutions now offer only one mechanism for
the council to lift sanctions _ verification by the U.N. Sepcial
Commission, known as UNSCOM, that Iraq has eliminated its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has already staked out its position after the bombing
campaign ends: either sanctions or inspections but not both.
	   ``Iraq cannot tolerate UNSCOM and sanctions at the same time,''
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Friday.
	   Russia has circulated a non-binding draft Security Council
statement calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, an
expression of regret for the attacks, and a call for Iraq to comply
with council resolutions.
	   Given the divisions on the council, the Russian draft has no
chance of being approved but council members said Friday it will
serve as the basis for discussion on how to move forward in dealing
with Iraq.
	   ``There were some comments and many members expressed their
readiness to discuss the council's next steps on the basis of our
suggestion and we will continue on Monday,'' said Russia's U.N.
Ambassador Sergey Lavrov.
	   The big stumbling block in any new plan that would modify
sanctions is the United States.
	   The Clinton administration is demanding not only Iraq's
disarmament but its compliance with other resolutions calling for
an accounting of missing Kuwaitis, looted Kuwaiti property and
government archives, before any lifting of the oil embargo.
	   Chirac and Clinton spoke for 20 minutes Thursday on ways of
ending the crisis, Colonna said.
	   The United States has ``some major problems'' with the Russian
draft statement, said Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, but it
will help the council focus ``on what we do next.''
	   Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said the council
agreed ``that next week we must get down to a discussion of how we
see the resolutions of the council complied with over the
long-term.''

Butler indirectly challenges United States on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with Butler saying he signaled
report's finding to U.S. and some other Security Council members &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Reiterating that he has no intention of
resigning now, chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said
Friday he would quit if he concluded that Iraq had been disarmed
and economic sanctions against Baghdad were not immediately lifted.
	   Butler's comment was an indirect challenge to the United States,
which refuses to acknowledge a Security Council resolution
promising to lift sanctions when inspectors certify that Baghdad's
weapons of mass destruction have been destroyed.
	   ``Some people express doubt about whether that promise would be
kept. I have no doubt of that,'' Butler said in a speech to the
Women's International Forum. ``I passionately believe in that
promise. And were it not to be kept then that would be ...
resignation material.''
	   In terms of future carrots or incentives to Iraq, Butler said,
``it needs to be made unambiguously clear to Iraq that the law
means what it says and when the disarmament process is declared by
me and the director-general of the International Atomic Energy
Agency to be over ... sanctions lifting will follow.''
	   The Security Council, which is badly divided over the
airstrikes, held consultations for a third day Friday but took no
action. The council agreed to meet again Monday morning.
	   All Security Council members except the United States back
Butler's view that the oil embargo and other economic sanctions
must be lifted when Butler declares that Iraq is disarmed.
	   But the Clinton administration is demanding not only Iraq's
disarmament but its compliance with other resolutions calling for
an accounting of missing Kuwaitis, looted Kuwaiti property and
government archives.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh refused to answer a
question Friday on whether the United States might change its
policy to prevent Butler's resignation if Iraq is disarmed.
	   But responding to Russian calls for Butler's resignation and
strong criticism from China, Burleigh said it was ``very
regrettable that political attack is now seeming to focus on
Ambassador Butler'' and the U.N. Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, which he heads.
	   ``We don't want Ambassador Butler to resign. We think he's been
a very effective, professional executive chairman of the Special
Commission under the most extraordinarily difficult situation,''
Burleigh said. ``I think frankly that they have done a brilliant
job and I think the UNSCOM people are heroes.''
	   In the past month, UNSCOM has tested the promise Iraq made on
Nov. 14, under threat of U.S. and British airstrikes, to resume
full cooperation with UNSCOM. Butler's report to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday concluded Iraq had fallen
short of compliance.
	   Butler said he knew what his conclusion would be after receiving
final reports Sunday from inspectors in the field and technical
experts _ and he signaled the conclusion to Security Council
members who asked on Sunday and Monday, including the United
States.
	   Butler said Friday that if Iraq had handed over only one
document on its production of deadly VX nerve agent, it would have
made a big difference.
	   ``It would have been such a good step on a really important
matter, a clear signal that would have made it far easier for me to
report to the secretary-general that they were in full
cooperation,'' Butler said.
	   Russia, which along with China has bitterly condemned the United
States and Britain for using force without council approval, has
circulated a nonbinding draft statement calling for an immediate
cessation of hostilities and expressing regret at the attack.
	   Given the divisions on the council, the Russian draft has no
chance of being approved, but council members said it will serve as
the basis for discussion on how to move forward in dealing with
Iraq.

Sabres holdout Audette traded to Kings

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Nearly two months after asking to be
traded, Buffalo Sabres holdout Donald Audette got his wish.
	   Audette, the Sabres' No. 3 scorer last year who has spent this
National Hockey League season working out on his own and watching
the team on television, was traded to Los Angeles, the Sabres
announced Friday.
	   The Sabres traded Audette for a second-round draft choice. The
Kings offered a two-year deal worth dlrs 3.6 million, according to
Audette.
	   ``It feels great,'' said Audette, whose negotiations with the
Sabres ended in bitterness. Of the struggling Kings (8-19-3),
Audette said, ``I think they're a better team than they show.''
	   Last season, Audette led the team in goals with 24 and in
game-winning goals with five, and was third in points with 44. He
also led in multi-point games with 11 and power-play goals with 10,
and was tied with Matthew Barnaby for the team lead in playoff
goals last season with 13.
	   Audette said the problem wasn't money but terms of the contract,
when he asked for the trade back in November. Both sides agreed to
dlrs 5.7 million over three years, according to Audette and his
agent, Gilles Lupien.
	   The Sabres agreed to pay dlrs 1.2 million, dlrs 2 million and
dlrs 2.5 million. But the team wanted to hold the option on the
second and third years, Lupien said.
	   The Sabres had trouble scoring early this season but broke out
of their slump with 10 goals in a home-and-home series with Toronto
the last two days of October. The Sabres have been winning since
then, reducing the team's incentive to sign the forward.
	   The move concluded the team's struggles this season with its
holdouts, of which there were four.
	   Alexei Zhitnik, who missed all of training camp pending
resolution of his contract, signed a two-year, dlrs 5 million deal
just before the season started.
	   The team agreed to terms at the last minute also with forward
Miroslav Satan, who signed a one-year deal at the airport just
before the team plane departed for the season opener in Dallas.
	   Defenseman Mike Wilson signed a three-year deal with the Sabres
on Dec. 1. Wilson, 23, had been playing with the Las Vegas Thunder
of the IHL during contract negotiations.

Belcher signs with Angels; four free agents reject arbitration
</HEADLINE>
offers &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tim Belcher, one of the top free agents left on
the market, became the lastest player to spurn the Boston Red Sox,
agreeing Friday to a dlrs 10.2 million, two-year contract with the
Anaheim Angels.
	   On the last day all major league offices were open before the
holiday break, pitchers Roger Pavlik and Bill Swift, and catchers
Terry Steinbach and John Marzano rejected salary arbitration offers
from their former teams Friday and remained free agents.
	   The four, who had been offered arbitration Dec. 7, may continue
to negotiate with their former teams (Seattle for Swift and
Marzano, Minnesota for Steinbach, Texas for Pavlik) through Jan. 8.
After that, they would be ineligible to re-sign with their former
clubs until May 1.
	   Belcher, a 37-year-old right-hander, was 14-14 with a 4.27 ERA
in 34 starts for the Kansas City Royals last season. He gets dlrs
4.6 million in each of the next two seasons, while the Angels have
a dlrs 5.1 million option with a dlrs 1 million buyout.
	   Boston had sought to sign Belcher, who instead joins Mo Vaughn
in Anaheim. The Red Sox, who also lost out on Bernie Williams and
took themselves out of the Albert Belle bidding, have made just two
major moves since they were eliminated from the playoffs, signing
infielder Jose Offerman to a dlrs 26 million, four-year deal and
right-hander Mark Portugal to a dlrs 3 million, one-year contract.
	   Meanwhile, another of baseball's big offseason dates approached:
the Dec. 20 deadline to offer 1999 contracts to players on 40-man
rosters. Any player not offered a contract by the deadline becomes
a free agent.
	   Some teams use that deadline to get contract agreements,
threatening to let players go free if they don't sign.
	   Outfielder Danny Bautista, Atlanta's only player eligible for
salary arbitration, agreed to a dlrs 470,000, one-year contract.
With 19 players signed, the Braves' payroll is at dlrs 70,845,000,
third in the majors behind Baltimore (dlrs 75,092,637) and Los
Angeles (dlrs 71,870,286), according to figures compiled by The
Associated Press.
	   Minnesota right-hander Frankie Rodriguez agreed to a dlrs
455,000, one-year contract, Texas left-hander Eric Gunderson agreed
Friday to a dlrs 450,000, one-year deal, and Tampa Bay left-hander
Scott Aldred agreed to a dlrs 425,000, one-year contract.
	   Some teams announced which players wouldn't be given contracts.
Montreal is letting go outfielder F.P. Santangelo, right-hander
Marc Valdes and left-hander Tim Young. Houston won't give one to
right-hander Ramon Garcia, and Cincinnati won't give one to
right-hander Keith Glauber.
	   San Francisco is not offering contracts to pitchers Osvaldo
Fernandez and Alvin Morman, catcher Brian Johnson and infielder
Jeff Ball,
	   Several minor-league free agents agreed to minor-league
contracts: outfielder Luis Polonia with Detroit; infielder Craig
Paquette and right-hander Josias Manzanillo with the New York Mets;
and right-hander Mark Hutton and shortstop Aaron Holbert with the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Also, the Twins designated shortstop Pat Meares for assignment,
meaning they have 10 days to trade him, release him or send him
outright to the minors.
	   Milwaukee released outfielder Marc Newfield and claimed
infielder Lou Collier off waivers from Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati
claimed outfielder Roderick Myers off waivers from the Kansas City
Royals. Anaheim traded catcher Matt Garrick to St. Louis to
complete Monday's trade for right-hander Mark Petkovsek.

Welch pleaded with doctor to perform fee surgery on IOC member
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous versions of Sports-Olympics-Bribes &QL; 
 &UR; By MIKE CARTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ As Salt Lake's Olympic committee met to
confront a bribery scandal, the man who brought the 2002 Winter
Games to Utah said the high ideals expected of athletes should not
apply to the bidding cities.
	   Tom Welch, who ran Salt Lake's bid, defended a scholarship
program that the Salt Lake Olympic Committee is alleged to have
used as a possible front to secure IOC votes.
	   ``What I hope happens from this is that there is a better
recognition and understanding that goes into the process'' of
winning an Olympic bid, Welch said Friday.
	   ``You have to know what it is and what it isn't. And it isn't
the Olympic competition. It's the business side of it,'' he said.
	   And that, said Welch, involves wooing members of the
International Olympic Committee, giving them gifts and ``letting
them know who their friends are.''
	   Welch's comments were lent stark credence by a prominent Salt
Lake plastic surgeon, who said Welch pleaded with him to perform
free cosmetic surgery on an IOC member in the months before Salt
Lake won the bid in 1995.
	   ``Tom told me it was the way in the past and the way in the
future that places got these kinds of things,'' Dr. Rick Anderson
told The Associated Press.
	   Anderson, who would not identify the IOC member because of
privacy considerations, said he had already removed a cyst from the
man's eyelid for free when Welch begged him to perform the
additional surgery to remove bags under the patient's eyes, even
offering to pay for the $7,000 procedure out of his own pocket.
	   Anderson said he did it for free, even though the IOC member
``could well have afforded to pay for it.''
	   Welch was not immediately available to comment on Anderson's
assertion.
	   Salt Lake's efforts to cozy up to key IOC members _ including
providing college scholarships to some of their children _ have set
off a firestorm over the 2002 bid and the way the IOC selects host
cities.
	   The SLOC executive board met behind closed doors to launch an
ethics investigation into the bid even as the IOC undertook its own
inquiry into charges that some members and unscrupulous agents may
have sold their votes.
	   The FBI in Salt Lake confirmed that it, at the behest of
Attorney General Janet Reno, was reviewing the allegations to
determine whether to open a formal investigation.
	   ``We've been looking at it for about four days,'' special agent
George Dougherty said. ``We're trying to determine whether the
facts and allegations fall under one of the statutes we're
responsible for enforcing.''
	   U.S. Attorney Paul Warner said the review is being supervised by
the Justice Department's criminal division.
	   Few SLOC members arriving at the meeting spoke to waiting
reporters before the session began. Those who did talk said
everything should be done to make a clean breast of any
improprieties so the city can get on with preparing for the games.
	   ``There's no question that the quicker this is resolved, the
better,'' said John Fowler, the state's liaison to the SLOC and a
former high official in the Mormon church. ``There's no way this
will threaten the life of the games, but there is a lot of work to
do.''
	   Welch, who left the SLOC two years ago after a no-contest plea
to a domestic violence charge, ran the city's bid for nearly a
decade. Salt Lake, he said, did nothing considered abnormal at the
time and it would be disingenuous for the IOC to now claim
otherwise.
	   Senior IOC member Marc Hodler last weekend claimed Salt Lake
used the scholarships and other favors to bribe IOC members. Later,
he said Salt Lake and other recent bid cities were the victims of
extortion by greedy IOC members and their agents, although he did
not name names.
	   Welch insisted Hodler was, at best, exaggerating, and at worst,
``crazy.''
	   ``We never felt shook down,'' Welch said. ``I never had any IOC
members tell me they could get me so-and-so's vote if we did
something for them.
	   ``Oh, sure, there are a couple (of agents) out there who
represent things they can't do, like bring votes. But we never
dealt with them.''
	   However, Mahmoud El-Farnawani, an Egyptian-born consultant
living in Canada, told the Toronto Sun in 1995 that he ``assured''
the IOC's Arab vote for Salt Lake. The bid committee's tax
documents for 1994 show El-Farnawani was paid $58,000 as a
``consultant.''
	   ``I offered my service to Quebec,'' another of the four cities
that sought the 2002 Games, El-Farnawani told the newspaper. ``But
they didn't want anybody from outside Quebec. So I signed a
contract with Salt Lake City and assured them of all the Arab
votes.''
	   On Friday, The Toronto Star reported El-Farnawani was identified
by Hodler as an agent who promised to deliver IOC votes to bidding
cities. The newspaper quoted his nephew as saying El-Farnawani was
in Saudi Arabia to observe the holy month of Ramadan.
	   In 1991, after losing the 1998 Winter Games to Nagano, Japan,
Salt Lake began focusing its efforts for the 2002 vote on IOC
members from Africa and Latin America. The only Salt Lake bid
scholarship recipient identified so far was the daughter of the
late IOC member from Cameroon, Rene Essomba.

	   In a Pentagon briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen.
Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more than 75 targets
in the last two nights of attack.
	   On the second day alone, warplanes flew more than 200 sorties.
	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets have been destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' he said in a
Pentagon briefing.
	   Iraq says 25 people have been killed and 75 injured in the first
two nights.
	   ``The real objective of this aggression is to show that the
United States is the sole superpower,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz told reporters.
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative department, a refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a warehouse and the radio and television
facilities.
	   The targets were chosen ``just to hurt whatever is dear to the
Iraqi people,'' Aziz said. But he did not say which military sites
had been hit.
	   The United States has said the sole aim of the Operation Desert
Fox is to lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass
destruction, threaten its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in
the region.
	   Aziz said almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage from the third night
of strikes, which did not target the capital.

	   In a Pentagon briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen.
Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more than 75 targets
in the last two nights of attack.
	   On the second day alone, warplanes flew more than 200 sorties.
	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets have been destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' he said in a
Pentagon briefing.
	   Iraq says 25 people have been killed and 75 injured in the first
two nights.
	   ``The real objective of this aggression is to show that the
United States is the sole superpower,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz told reporters Friday.
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative departments, a refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a warehouse and the radio and television
facilities.
	   The targets were chosen ``just to hurt whatever is dear to the
Iraqi people,'' Aziz said. But he did not say which military sites
had been hit.
	   The United States has said the sole aim of the Operation Desert
Fox is to lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass
destruction, threaten its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in
the region.
	   Aziz said almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage from the third night
of strikes.

	   The toll in the first two waves of attacks was largely civilian,
officials have said.
	   In Baghdad's al-Kharkh hospital on the western side of the
Tigris River, Amar Shakir lay unconscious on a bed Friday, the
stumps of his left arm and leg swathed in thick bandages.
	   Doctors said the 25-year-old civilian was crippled in the air
strikes. They did not know where Shakir was at the time of the
attack.
	   In the Karada district, near the center of Baghdad, workers
quickly cleared away the debris from a missile that smacked into
the middle of a street, rupturing a water pipe.
	   Rihab Mohammed, a 39-year-old mother of four, said she was
afraid to go back inside her 2-story brick home.
	   ``The walls and the foundations are so weak,'' she said, looking
at the old, yellow brick home.
	   Nearby, Farouk Mansour, 46, surveyed the damage at his toy
store.
	   ``The windows were thrown out of the frames and all the
merchandise was scattered all over the floor,'' he said.
	   ``It will cost me a lot of money'' to repair the damage, he
said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq
for what he said was Baghdad's obstruction of U.N. weapons
inspectors, who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's programs to
build chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of the illegal
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In announcing the start of the strikes, Clinton recognized that
it would be offensive to the United States' Arab allies if the
attacks continued into Ramadan. But National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said Friday the strikes would not necessarily end with the
beginning of Ramadan.
	   ``That is not an automatic deadline,'' Berger said.
	   Aziz said Friday that Iraq would no longer be willing to accept
both the sanctions and the inspection regime.
	   Early Friday morning, missiles damaged several buildings in
Baghdad, including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy
College of Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   An editorial in Al-Thawra, the paper of Saddam's ruling Baath
Party, called the attacks ``Operation Monica.''
	   Aziz echoed the feeling that the strikes may have been tied to
Clinton's domestic troubles, adding that ``when a statesman... lies
in one case, how can he be credible in another case?''
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers who monitor food aid
to the Iraqis were evacuated by bus to Jordan.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A series of thunderous explosions rocked
Baghdad Saturday as U.S. forces pressed with the punishing air
offensive for the third straight night.
	   The first indication of trouble came when anti-aircraft gunners
on roof-tops opened fire into the inky sky, sending bright red
flashes and the loud report of gunfire.
	   The noise was heightened by several explosions on the ground,
somewhere in the vicinity of central Baghdad. After a few minutes'
lull, at least two more explosions shook the ground, sending up
huge fire balls in the air.
	   The pre-dawn horizon was lit by flaming red glow, silhouetting
palm trees against the dark sky.

Curator blasts cricket authorities

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Curator Mark Perham blasted New
Zealand Cricket (NZC) for scheduling a test here before Christmas
as the first test between New Zealand and India was destined to a
total washout at Carisbrook.
	   Play was abandoned for the second successive day as sweeping
rain left the outfield soggy. The wicket remains dry with heavy
covering.
	   Umpires Steve Dunne and West Indian Eddie Nicholls abandoned
play Saturday before tea. Both teams remained in their hotels while
captains Stephen Fleming and Mohammad Azharuddin made a brief visit
during the lunch break.
	   Nine years ago a test between the hosts and Pakistan was
abandoned without a ball bowled.
	   ``This is the first time a test has been scheduled here before
Christmas,'' Perham, the chief curator said. ``The weather here is
unpredictable before January. They should have know better.''
	   Perham, in his second year with Otago Cricket Association, said
it was unlikely play will be possible at all in the remainder of
the test with more bad weather forecast in the next four days.
	   ``Even if the rain seizes, we'll need a lot of sun shine to dry
the outfield. It will remain greasy,'' said Perham.
	   If the game is abandoned without a ball bowled it will be only
the eighth instance in 1,434 test matches.
	   The last time a test was abandoned without a ball bowled was
between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Colombo when post-election curfew
canceled the second test at Sinhalese Sports Club grounds.
	   Dunne, New Zealand's most experienced umpire with 29 tests and
66 one-day internationals, was left wondering whether he will ever
umpire a test in his home town.
	   His debut test against Pakistan in 1989 was the first ever test
to be washed out in New Zealand.
	   ``I don't want it to happen again. Your first home test is
always special and I've waited a long time. I just want to get out
on the field and get the first ball bowled,'' Dunne said.
	   ``At this rate I'll never get out there,'' Dunne said Saturday.

Australians to give video evidence to Pakistan inquiry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Cricket Board said
Saturday that Mark Waugh and Shane Warne will give evidence by
video link to the Pakistan cricket bribery inquiry next week.
	   A board spokesman said the exact time and place for the
Australian players to give evidence had not yet been finalized.
	   The ACB has been negotiating with Pakistani judge Malik Mohammed
Qayyum over his request to reexamine the pair following their
admission that they took money to provide a bookmaker with
information about pitch and weather conditions during Australia's
1994 tour of Sri Lanka.
	   Neither the ACB nor the players had been keen for them to return
to Pakistan to give evidence.
	   The spokesman said the ACB had heard back from the judge's
office overnight Friday night, agreeing to a video link which will
enable him to question them. (djp)

	   From the roof of the Information Ministry, where foreign
journalists are based, reporters saw several bright streaks of
light speeding across the sky in a descending arc and ending up in
giant fireballs. A few seconds later followed the explosions from
the impact.
	   It was not clear immediatley if the bright streaks were Tomahawk
cruise missiles, the weapons of choice for the U.S. military since
it began the punishing strikes early Thursday.
	   Ambulances were heard rushing down the streets.
	   As anti-aircraft guns continued firing, flashes of light, as if
from giant cameras suspended in the air, illuminated the sky.
Bright orange tracer bullets streaked up.
	   With the reverberations from the explosions subsiding, the
winter air was filled with the sounds of muezzin's call from
mosques, informing Muslims to eat breakfast before beginning the
first day of fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Clerics declared the start of Ramadan late Friday after the
sighting of the moon.

	   It was not immediately clear if British forces also took part in
the attack. But British role so far has been limited.
	   The explosions Saturday were not preceded by air raid sirens
implying that for the first time the strikes has eluded Iraqi air
defense. In the past attacks, anti-aircraft batteries had started
firing at missiles a few seconds before the explosions.
	   On Friday, the Iraqi military said its anti-aircraft batteries
had shot down 77 incoming missiles.
	   Between Thursday and Friday, the United States had fired a
little less than 300 cruise missiles _ more than the 289 fired
during the five-week Gulf War in 1991 to evict Iraq out of Kuwait.
	   The missiles have been launched from air by B-52 bombers and
from warships in the Gulf where the United States has deployed a
massive armada.
	   Earlier Saturday, anti-aircraft gunners had opened fired for
about 10 minutes at the invisible enemy but none of the
incendiaries appeared to have hit the capital in that strike.
	   Dull thuds were heard in the distance, indicating that the
missiles had fallen outside the capital or in its outskirts.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice ... We will not let evil triumph
over virtue.''
	   In a Pentagon briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen.
Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more than 75 targets
in the last two nights of attack.
	   On the second day alone, warplanes flew more than 200 sorties.

South Korea demands apology for spy boat incident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea demanded an apology from
North Korea on Saturday as its navy continued an air and sea search
for the remains of a vessel it sank two days ago.
	   South Korean navy ships chased and then sank a low-slung
speedboat believed to be from North Korea in a gunbattle off the
country's south coast Friday.
	   South Korean officials said the boat was on a mission to land or
pick up North Korean spies in the South.
	   The latest incident came despite President Kim Dae-jung's
``sunshine policy,'' under which Seoul is pushing economic
exchanges to bring the two Koreas closer to peace on the divided
peninsula.
	   ``We are shocked and enraged by the North's continued
provocative infiltrations,'' the Defense Ministry said in a
statement. ``We demand the North offer a responsible and convincing
explanation.''
	   The U.N. Command, which oversees the Korean Armistice that ended
the 1950-53 Korean War, will demand a meeting with North Korean
officials at the truce village of Panmunjom to protest the
incident, the ministry said.
	   But President Kim's office said the gunbattle will not derail
its policy towards the North.
	   Meanwhile, navy ships and planes searched the sea off the
southern coast of South Korea for a second day looking for bodies
of crewmen and wreckage of the sunken boat.
	   Farther off in international waters, South Korean warships and
planes search for a larger ship believed to have launched the
speedboat. No discoveries were reported in either operation.
	   On Friday, the body of one crewman was recovered shortly after
the sinking of the boat.
	   On Saturday, the daily Chosun Ilbo, quoting military sources,
reported investigators found traces of poison in the man's body,
indicating the crewmen may have killed themselves shortly before
their vessel was sunk.
	   The ministry was unable to confirm the report.
	   The speedboat, carrying an estimated four people, was first
spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as it approached Yosu, a
small port on the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula.
	   The boat was pursued for hours by South Korean warships and air
force planes until it was hemmed in and sunk in a gunbattle.
	   In June, a 70-ton North Korean submarine was found in South
Korean waters with its propeller and periscope tangled in a fishing
net. South Koreans cut through the hatch and found nine bodies, all
shot dead in an apparent suicide pact. Seoul officials said it was
on a spy mission.

	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets have been destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said.
	   Iraq says 25 people have been killed and 75 injured in the first
two nights.
	   ``The real objective of this aggression is to show that the
United States is the sole superpower,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz told reporters Friday.
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative department, a refinery in the

	   From the roof of the Information Ministry, where foreign
journalists are based, reporters saw several bright streaks of
light speeding across the sky in a descending arc and ending up in
giant fireballs.
	   It was not immediately clear if the bright streaks were Tomahawk
cruise missiles, the weapons of choice for the U.S. military since
it began the punishing strikes early Thursday.
	   Ambulances were heard rushing down the streets.
	   As anti-aircraft guns continued firing, flashes of light, as if
from giant cameras suspended in the air, illuminated the sky.
Bright orange tracer bullets streaked up.
	   With the reverberations from the explosions subsiding, the
winter air was filled with the sounds of calls from mosques,
informing Muslims to eat breakfast before beginning the first day
of fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.

	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq
for what he said was Baghdad's obstruction of U.N. weapons
inspectors, who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's programs to
build chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of the illegal
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In announcing the start of the strikes, Clinton recognized that
it would be offensive to the United States' Arab allies if the
attacks continued into Ramadan. But National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said Friday the strikes would not necessarily end with the
beginning of Ramadan.
	   The Friday missile attack damaged several buildings in Baghdad,
including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy College of
Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.

	   The explosions Saturday were not preceded by air raid sirens,
implying that for the first time the strikes could have eluded
Iraqi air defense. In the past attacks, anti-aircraft batteries had
started firing a few seconds before the explosions.
	   On Friday, the Iraqi military said its anti-aircraft batteries
had shot down 77 incoming missiles.
	   Between Thursday and Friday, the United States had fired fewer
than 300 cruise missiles but more than the 289 fired during the
five-week Gulf War in 1991 to evict Iraq out of Kuwait.
	   The missiles have been launched from air by B-52 bombers and
from warships in the Gulf where the United States has deployed a
massive armada. British forces are also taking part in the
offensive but on a more limited scale.
	   Earlier Saturday, anti-aircraft gunners had opened fired for
about 10 minutes at the invisible enemy but none of the
incendiaries appeared to have hit the capital in that strike.
	   Dull thuds were heard in the distance, indicating that the
missiles had fallen outside the capital or in its outskirts.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice ... We will not let evil triumph
over virtue.''
	   In a Pentagon briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen.
Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more than 75 targets
in the last two nights of attack.
	   On the second day alone, warplanes flew more than 200 sorties.

number of the targets have been destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.

South Korea demands apology for spy boat incident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that boat was sunk one day ago, 1st graf

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea demanded an apology from
North Korea on Saturday as its navy continued an air and sea search
for the remains of a vessel it sank the day before.
	   South Korean navy ships chased and then sank a low-slung
speedboat believed to be from North Korea in a gunbattle off the
country's south coast Friday.
	   South Korean officials said the boat was on a mission to land or
pick up North Korean spies in the South.
	   The latest incident came despite President Kim Dae-jung's
``sunshine policy,'' under which Seoul is pushing economic
exchanges to bring the two Koreas closer to peace on the divided
peninsula.
	   ``We are shocked and enraged by the North's continued
provocative infiltrations,'' the Defense Ministry said in a
statement. ``We demand the North offer a responsible and convincing
explanation.''
	   The U.N. Command, which oversees the Korean Armistice that ended
the 1950-53 Korean War, will demand a meeting with North Korean
officials at the truce village of Panmunjom to protest the
incident, the ministry said.
	   But President Kim's office said the gunbattle will not derail
its policy towards the North.
	   Meanwhile, navy ships and planes searched the sea off the
southern coast of South Korea for a second day looking for bodies
of crewmen and wreckage of the sunken boat.
	   Farther off in international waters, South Korean warships and
planes search for a larger ship believed to have launched the
speedboat. No discoveries were reported in either operation.
	   On Friday, the body of one crewman was recovered shortly after
the sinking of the boat.
	   On Saturday, the daily Chosun Ilbo, quoting military sources,
reported investigators found traces of poison in the man's body,
indicating the crewmen may have killed themselves shortly before
their vessel was sunk.
	   The ministry was unable to confirm the report.
	   The speedboat, carrying an estimated four people, was first
spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as it approached Yosu, a
small port on the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula.
	   The boat was pursued for hours by South Korean warships and air
force planes until it was hemmed in and sunk in a gunbattle.
	   In June, a 70-ton North Korean submarine was found in South
Korean waters with its propeller and periscope tangled in a fishing
net. South Koreans cut through the hatch and found nine bodies, all
shot dead in an apparent suicide pact. Seoul officials said it was
on a spy mission.

Loud explosions rock Baghdad as U.S. attacks continue

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A series of thunderous explosions rocked
Baghdad before dawn Saturday as U.S. forces pressed with the
punishing air offensive for the third straight night.
	   The first explosion was followed by anti-aircraft gunners on
roof-tops opening fire, filling the inky sky with bright red
flashes and booms.
	   The noise was heightened by several explosions on the ground.
After a few minutes' lull, more explosions shook the ground,
sending up huge fire balls in the air in what appeared to be the
severest attack on the capital since the strikes began early
Thursday.
	   From the roof of the Information Ministry, where foreign
journalists are based, reporters saw several bright streaks of
light speeding across the sky in a descending arc and ending up in
giant fireballs. A few seconds later came the explosions from the
impact.
	   The horizon was lit by flaming red glow, silhouetting palm trees
against the dark sky.
	   Ambulances were heard rushing down the streets.
	   It was not immediately known if the bright streaks were Tomahawk
cruise missiles, the weapons of choice of the U.S. military in this
operation, code-named Desert Fox.
	   As anti-aircraft guns continued firing, flashes of light, as if
from cameras suspended in the air, illuminated the sky. Bright
orange tracer bullets streaked high up.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided, the winter
air was filled with the sounds of muezzin's call from mosques,
informing Muslims to eat their last meal before beginning the first
day of fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.
	   Clerics declared the start of Ramadan late Friday after the
sighting of the moon.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice ... We will not let evil triumph
over virtue.''
	   Iraq says 25 people have been killed and 75 injured in the first
two nights.
	   It was not immediately known if British forces also took part in
Saturday's attack, but their role so far has been limited. The
British Tornado fighter-bombers used so far do not have the ability
to fire missiles.
	   The explosions Saturday were not preceded by air raid sirens
implying that for the first time the strikes has eluded Iraqi air
defense. In the past attacks, anti-aircraft batteries had started
firing at missiles a few seconds before the explosions.
	   On Friday, the Iraqi military said its anti-aircraft batteries
had shot down 77 incoming missiles so far.
	   Between Thursday and Friday, the United States had fired a
little less than 300 cruise missiles _ more than the 289 fired

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo's successionist Albanians
rebels are denying responsibility for the killing of a Serb
municipal leader, amid Serb threats to launch another security
sweep.
	   The body of Zvonko Bojanic, district mayor of Kosovo Polje, 5
kilometers (3 miles) west of the provincial capital Pristina, was
found dumped along a roadside Friday, wrapping up what has been the
bloodiest week in the province since a U.S.-brokered agreement in
October.
	   Bojanic had been badly beaten, with multiple fracture wounds,
and was shot between the eyes.
	   The Serb official's death came hours after Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian rebels vowed revenge for the killing of 36 guerrilla
fighters in a border clash Monday, but Kosovo Liberation Army
representative Adem Demaci denied the rebels were involved.
	   ``Our targets are exclusively police and military of the Serbian
regime,'' said Demaci, suggesting Serbian secret police may have
staged the killing.
	   Serbian police said the five assailants who broke into Bojanic's
home and kidnapped him Thursday night wore KLA uniforms.
	   In the past week, Yugoslav army border guards killed 36
guerrillas on the Albanian border, unidentified assailants gunned
down six young Serbs in a bar in the western city of Pec, and Serb
police killed two suspected rebels and arrested 34 in a crackdown
in the Pec area.
	   Reporters Friday heard shelling coming from the direction of
Glodjane, where police reportedly killed two ethnic Albanian
fighters the previous day and captured 34 in a search for gunmen
who slaughtered six young Serbs in Pec.
	   Earlier this week, police also sealed off a part of Pec.
Residents there accused police on Friday of beating some ethnic
Albanians and detaining dozens. The claims could not be
independently verified.
	   The U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights, Harold
Hongju Koh, castigated the regime of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for a ``strong contempt for international law and human
rights.''
	   In the wake of this week's upsurge in violence in Kosovo, the
visiting Koh said the U.S. govenment ``deplores violence on all
sides, and urges all parties to the conflict to avert a new cycle
of retaliatory violence.''
	   Yugoslav Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic, addressing angry Serbs
at a rally hours after the killing of a municipal leader in Kosovo
Polje, just outside Pristina, called the death ``one more attack on
Serbia.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A series of thunderous explosions rocked
Baghdad before dawn Saturday as U.S. and British forces pressed
with the punishing air offensive against Iraq for the third
straight night.
	   Anti-aircraft gunners on rooftops opened fire after the first
explosion, filling the inky sky with red flashes and booms.
	   The noise was heightened by several explosions on the ground
which sent up huge fireballs in what appeared to be the severest
attack on the capital since the strikes began early Thursday.
	   From the roof of the Information Ministry, where foreign
journalists are based, reporters saw what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles speeding across the sky in a descending arc and
ending up in giant orange balls of flame. A few seconds later came
the explosions from the impact.
	   Cruise missiles are the weapons of choice of the U.S. military
in this operation, code-named Desert Fox.
	   The British Ministry of Defense said British aircraft had been
operating in the third wave of raids, but it wasn't clear where.
British Tornado fighter-bombers used so far do not have the ability
to fire missiles.
	   As anti-aircraft guns continued firing, flashes of light, as if
from cameras suspended in the air, illuminated the sky. Bright
orange tracer bullets streaked high up.
	   Ambulances were heard rushing down the streets.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided, the winter
air was filled with the sounds of calls from mosques, informing
Muslims to eat their last meal before beginning the first day of
fasting for the holy month of Ramadan.
	   On Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on television,
President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not compromise or
kneel in the face of injustice ... We will not let evil triumph
over virtue.''
	   Iraq says 25 people have been killed and 75 injured in the first
two nights.
	   The explosions Saturday were not preceded by air raid sirens
implying that for the first time the strikes could have eluded
Iraqi air defense. In the past attacks, anti-aircraft batteries had
started firing at missiles a few seconds before the explosions.
	   On Friday, the Iraqi military said its anti-aircraft batteries
had shot down 77 incoming missiles so far.
	   Between Thursday and Friday, the United States had fired fewer
than 300 cruise missiles but more than the 289 fired during the
five-week Gulf War in 1991 to evict Iraq out of Kuwait.
	   The missiles have been launched from air by B-52 bombers and
from warships in the Gulf where the United States has deployed a
massive armada.
	   In a Pentagon briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Gen.
Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more than 75 targets
in the last two nights of attack.
	   On the second day alone, warplanes flew more than 200 sorties.
	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets have been destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters Friday that the
real objective of the attacks ``is to show that the United States
is the sole superpower.''
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative department, a refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a warehouse and the radio and television
facilities.
	   The targets were chosen ``just to hurt whatever is dear to the
Iraqi people,'' Aziz said. But he did not say which military sites
had been hit.
	   The United States has said the sole aim of the Operation Desert
Fox is to lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass
destruction, threaten its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in
the region.
	   Aziz said almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit as part of the raids.
He warned that Iraq could not tolerate inspections and sanctions at
the same time.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage from the third night
of strikes.
	   The toll in the first two waves of attacks was largely civilian,
officials have said.
	   In Baghdad's al-Kharkh hospital on the western side of the
Tigris River, Amar Shakir lay unconscious on a bed Friday, the
stumps of his left arm and leg swathed in thick bandages.
	   Doctors said the 25-year-old civilian was crippled in the air
strikes. They did not know where Shakir was at the time of the
attack.
	   In the Karada district, near the center of Baghdad, workers
quickly cleared away the debris from a missile that smacked into
the middle of a street, rupturing a water pipe.
	   Rihab Mohammed, a 39-year-old mother of four, said she was
afraid to go back inside her 2-story brick home.
	   ``The walls and the foundations are so weak,'' she said, looking
at the old, yellow brick home.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the strikes to punish Iraq
for what he said was Baghdad's obstruction of U.N. weapons
inspectors, who are responsible for dismantling Iraq's programs to
build chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of the illegal
weapons, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   In announcing the start of the strikes, Clinton recognized that
it would be offensive to Washington's Arab allies if the attacks
continued into Ramadan. But National Security Adviser Sandy Berger
said Friday the strikes would not necessarily end with the
beginning of Ramadan.
	   Friday's missile attacks damaged several buildings in Baghdad,
including the Museum of Natural History and the Pharmacy College of
Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
	   Iraqi officials took photographers and reporters to the museum,
where a missile punched a two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a
wall and shattered the windows of several showcases that displayed
stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   Early Friday, 106 U.N. humanitarian workers who monitor food aid
to the Iraqis were evacuated by bus to Jordan.

Women try out for professional American football team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHLEY H. GRANT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Gina Houser grew up in a neighborhood full of
boys. She had to learn to play sports or be left out _ and that
included American football.
	   Football lasted until seventh grade, when Houser switched to
hockey. Now 21, Houser is among about 50 women trying out for the
Minnesota Vixens professional women's football team.
	   This is not expected to be a powder-puff league. Organizers say
it will be smash-mouth, full-pads, full-contact football.
	   ``I just saw their ad in the paper and thought it would be
fun,'' said Houser, now the hockey coach at Shattuck St. Mary's, a
prep school.
	   ``I'm 6-foot-1 (1.8 meters), 180 pounds (80 kilograms). I'm a
large girl and athletic. I understand the rules. I understand the
plays.''
	   Tryouts for the Vixens and the Lake Michigan Minx were held at
the Metrodome Thursday night. The Women's Professional Football
League is scheduled to begin play next year.
	   ``We're taking 60 of the best athletes in the country and going
on a tour,'' said Carter Turner, chief executive of the league.
``We will test the markets _ see if there's good public
acceptance.''
	   Several groups dabbled with professional women's football during
the 1970s and '80s, forming five teams in Michigan and Ohio.
	   ``The fan base just wasn't there yet,'' Turner said.
	   He thinks the attitude has changed, but a few logistical
problems remain, such as the lack of trained players and women's
football equipment.
	   ``That's one of the dilemmas,'' he said, laughing. ``The
learning curve is going to be there.''
	   For now, the plan is to buy new jerseys and pants, then pick up
used college men's pads and helmets to save money.
	   Over the next six months, league representatives will talk to
track stars, rugby teams, baseball and soccer players _ anyone who
might be able to run, throw or kick _ and wants to make the switch
to NFL-NCAA-rules football.
	   The league also will hold tryouts in June and September.
	   So far, the Vixen and Minx make up the entire league. Both will
be based in the Twin Cities initially, but organizers hope the Minx
eventually will move to a city near Lake Michigan.
	   A small group of sports promoters including Turner are targeting
groups throughout the Midwest to buy franchises for dlrs 50,000
apiece.
	   ``I've worked in several different leagues and some price
themselves out of the market by charging too much for a
franchise,'' Turner said. ``The dlrs 50,000 covers the ... nuts and
bolts.''
	   He said the group was trying to prod Green Bay into forming a
team _ perhaps capitalizing on the fierce rivalry between the NFL's
Minnesota Vikings and Green Bay Packers.
	   ``You know how much Green Bay hates us,'' he said.
	   WPFL players will be paid through profit sharing, he said. It
wouldn't be enough to live on _ probably between dlrs 200 and dlrs
600 per game _ so most players will keep their full-time jobs and
travel with the team on weekends.
	   League officials are recruiting sponsors to help fund the team.
Sponsorships range from dlrs 500 on-field banners to dlrs 5,000 for
having a sponsorship patch embroidered on the Vixens' uniforms. The
uniform colors are fox red, arctic-fox white and fox-foot black.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina began
an apparent effort Friday to smooth over a diplomatic incident
sparked by Fidel Castro's remarks about Mexico.
	   Mexico recalled its ambassador from Havana on Dec. 4 and
demanded an explanation after the Cuban president, speaking two
days earlier at a meeting of Latin American leaders, said Mexicans
knew more about Mickey Mouse than their national heroes.
	   ``I don't know if what occurred was an incident, the only thing
I can say is that Mexico and Cuba maintain good relations,'' said
Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Abelardo Curbelo.
	   Robaina, who arrived here Friday, said the visit ``is not an
attempt to patch up differences,'' the government news agency
Notimex quoted Robaina as saying at Mexico City's International
Airport.
	   Mexico had demanded an explanation of Castro's remarks, and
Robaina is scheduled to meet in private with Mexican Foreign
Secretary Rosario Green.
	   The Cuban Embassy in Mexico said Castro's comments were made
``in a discreet and familiar environment'' during a gathering of
Latin American economic leaders in Cuba, and had been taken out of
context and ``absolutely misinterpreted.''
	   Castro said that if many Mexican children were asked to name
their country's founders ``it is possible that many of them would
not know, but they would instead know who is Mickey Mouse, who are
all of the principal characters of the animated cartoons coming
from the United States; and the same thing occurs in the rest of
Latin America.''
	   The embassy said Castro's comment about Mickey Mouse was not a
criticism of Mexicans but a remark on the overwhelming cultural
dominance of the U.S. entertainment industry.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ The rebel movement that fought the
government for 34 years registered as a political party Friday.
	   The Supreme Electoral Tribunal registered the Guatemala National
Revolutionary Union, making it eligible for the 1999 presidential
elections.
	   ``This is one of the most important events in the history of
Guatemala,'' said Jorge Ismael Soto, the new party's
secretary-general. As commander of the rebel forces, Soto used the
nom de guerre, Pablo Monsanto.
	   A peace accord between the rebels and the government was signed
in 1996.
	   The elections set for November 1999 will chose a president, vice
president, congressmen and mayors.
	   ___
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ More than 100,000 Honduran children
will attend classes in tents next year because of damage to schools
across the country caused by Hurricane Mitch, Education Minister
Ramon Calix Figueroa said Friday.
	   The hurricane that hit in late October and continued to pound
Honduras for several days destroyed or badly damaged about 2,800
classrooms. Officials canceled school for the remainder of 1998.
	   The United Nations has agreed to donate 1,000 tents for schools
and Calix said he expected other organizations to follow suit.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A clash between army troops and a band
of rearmed Sandinista army veterans killed five people in
northeastern Nicaragua, the armed forces said Friday.
	   According to the military, troops killed two Sandinista veterans
in a skirmish with some 10 men at about 8 p.m. (0300 GMT) Thursday.
Another clash a half-hour later killed two soldiers and one
veteran.
	   The army identified the group as part of the Andres Castro
United Forces, named for a 19th century Nicaraguan who fought U.S.
intruders led by the fillibuster William Walker.
	   The group supposedly turned over its arms to the government at
the beginning of the year, but officials say some members remained
armed.
	   Rearmed members of the Indian organization Miskita, which
formally disarmed in 1990 at the end of Nicaragua's civil war, are
also said to be operating in the same zone.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ The government will change a law
on pardons to keep the convicted killer of rain forest defender
Chico Mendes in prison, a presidential spokesman said.
	   When President Fernando Henrique Cardoso signed the law in
November, he didn't realize it might benefit Darly Alves da Silva,
spokesman Sergio Amaral said late Thursday.
	   Silva is serving a 19-year sentence for the 1988 shotgun slaying
of Mendes, an Amazon rubber tapper who gained worldwide recognition
for peacefully blocking tree-cuttings by loggers and ranchers.
	   Among those he opposed was Silva, a rancher in the western
Amazon town of Xapuri. Silva's son confessed to the shooting, and
Silva also was convicted for planning the murder.
	   The law benefits felons 60 or older who were sentenced to six
years or more and have served at least a third of their term. Silva
qualifies on all counts.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) - Police arrested two suspects in
the slayings of a Brazilian congresswoman and three of her
relatives in an impoverished and violent northeastern state, police
said Friday.
	   Ceci Cunha, a 48-year-old two-term congresswoman with the
government's Brazilian Social Democratic Party was killed Wednesday
evening outside her sister's house in Maceio, the state capital of
Alagoas state, located 1,033 miles (1,667 kms) northeast of Rio de
Janeiro.
	   Cunha's husband, sister-in-law and her sister's mother-in-law
were also killed after three hooded men burst into the home firing
12-guage shotguns and 9 millimeter pistols.
	   During a manhunt involving more than 400 policemen, law
enforcement officers arrested a bodyguard of a political rival of
Cunha's and an unidentified man, the Brazilian media reported
Friday.
	   The bodyguard, identified only as Jadielson, is accused of
hiring the hit squad while the unidentified man is believed to be
one of the killers.
	   Politics in Alagoas, one of Brazil's poorest states, has long
been dangerous business.
	   Since 1993, at least nine prominent politicians have been
murdered, including the chief of police of Maceio and the state tax
director.

Pressure mounts for further disarmament as peace accord strides

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The outlawed Irish Republican
Army _ and other armed groups _ are coming under increased pressure
to surrender their weapons after Northern Ireland moved closer to
peace.
	   Politicians agreed Friday on the shape of the new government,
and the province watched hopefully as the first terrorist weapons
were handed over and destroyed under the April peace accord.
	   ``They have been given an example, let them and other
paramilitaries follow it,'' said David Trimble, the Protestant
politician elected to lead Northern Ireland's future government.
	   On Friday, the Loyalist Volunteer Force began the disarmament
process by handing in nine submachine guns, rifles and pistols; 350
rounds of ammo; six detonators and two pipe bombs.
	   That gesture followed a successful 18-hour negotiating session
by Protestant and Catholic politicians that agreed the shape of the
new coalition government's executive body, a subject that had
bedeviled them over the past two months.
	   With those two steps, coming in a matter of hours of each other,
the peace process seemed to get back on track.
	   ``I never thought I'd see the day,'' said a teary-eyed Michael
McGoldrick, father of the Protestant terrorist group's first murder
victim, as he watched the symbolic televised sight of a gun barrel
being sawed in two.
	   The Loyalist Volunteers spent two years killing Catholics at
random in hopes of derailing peace negotiations, but called a
cease-fire in May in recognition of widespread public support for
the accord.
	   Under the watchful eye of John de Chastelain, the Canadian army
general who leads the independent disarmament commission, the group
gave up a larger-than-expected chunk of its arsenal in hopes of
shaming the IRA into matching the gesture.
	   But the IRA on the Catholic side, along with Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force on the Protestant side,
bluntly dismissed Friday's start to disarmament as a cynical stunt
that wouldn't move them. All three groups have repeatedly refused
to disarm _ a stance the IRA reaffirmed only last week.
	   Pressure, however, is mounting. And particularly on the IRA,
whose allied Sinn Fein party wants to take its seats as soon as the
new government administration is formed.
	   The agreement reached between Trimble's Ulster Unionist Party
and leading figures of the major Catholic-supported party, the
Social Democratic and Labor Party, calls for 10 executive
departments, lead equally by Protestant and Catholic politicians.
	   They also agreed to cooperate in six cross-border committees
with the neighboring Irish Republic, an agenda that the Catholic
side hopes will promote the eventual unification of Ireland.
	   Now the legislation will go to the British parliament after the
new year, a step necessary before Britain, which has directly ruled
Northern Ireland since 1972, can transfer powers.
	   But Trimble, co-winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, made
clear that Protestants still won't tolerate the Sinn Fein in any
administration until the IRA starts disarming.
	   Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams maintains that his party deserves to
take the seats they won in the election, and anyway the April
accord only set May 2000 as the deadline to complete disarming.
	   Reflecting their share of the Northern Ireland vote, three
cabinet posts each would go to the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP,
and two each to Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionists, a
Protestant party so opposed to compromise it has boycotted
negotiations since 1997.

Baghdad comes under worst attack in three-day offensive

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A series of thunderous explosions rocked
Baghdad before dawn Saturday as U.S. and British forces pressed
with punishing air offensive on Iraq for the third night.
	   Reporters saw fiery streaks from what appeared to be Tomahawk
cruise missiles speeding across the sky in descending arcs and
landing on ground in giant fireballs.
	   A few seconds later came the sound of warheads exploding,
lighting the pre-dawn horizon in red glow that silhouetted palm
trees against the dark sky.
	   As the missiles whizzed overhead, Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners on
roof-tops opened fire, filling the sky with booms and bright red
flashes as if from scores of camera flashbulbs suspended in the
air. Bright orange tracer bullets streaked high up.
	   When the attack ended, ambulances or fire trucks with sirens
blaring were heard speeding away. Officials, who must escort
journalists wishing to tour the city, refused to take journalists
to the targeted areas.
	   The attack appeared the most severe and dramatic on Baghdad
since U.S. and British forces began airstrikes early Thursday to
punish Iraq for its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors
searching for the country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Before Saturday's attack, the United States had fired nearly 300
Tomahawk cruise missiles from ships in the Gulf or by B-52 bomber
aircraft. The missiles carry warheads of up to 3,000 pounds (1,365
kilograms).
	   Iraq says 25 people have been killed and 75 injured in the first
two nights.
	   In London, a defense ministry spokesman said British aircraft
took part in operations Friday night. He refused to say if they
participated in the early Saturday operations.
	   Saturday's explosions were not preceded by air raid sirens,
implying that for the first time the strikes has eluded Iraqi air
defense.
	   When the reverberations from the explosions subsided at about
4.45 a.m. (0145 GMT), the winter air filled with the sounds of
muezzins' call from mosque loudspeakers, informing Muslims to eat
their last meal before beginning the first day of fasting for the
holy month of Ramadan.
	   Clerics declared the start of Ramadan after sighting the moon on
Friday, the 29th day of the preceding month, Shaaban.
	   Earlier Friday, in an address to the nation broadcast on
television, President Saddam Hussein vowed that Iraq ``will not
compromise or kneel in the face of injustice.''
	   ``We will not let evil triumph over virtue,'' he said.
	   Also Friday, in a Pentagon briefing, the Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman Gen. Henry Shelton said that U.S. forces have hit more
than 75 targets in the last two nights.
	   But initial bomb-damage assessments indicate that only a small
number of the targets were destroyed or severely damaged even
though Iraq offered virtually no resistance.
	   ``We ... have had some very good success with our strikes, but
not all of them have gone exactly as planned,'' Shelton said.
	   For example, of 27 Iraqi surface-to-air missile facilities
attacked, only one was destroyed and eight suffered no damage.
	   The Iraqi military claimed its anti-aircraft batteries had shot
down 77 incoming missiles so far.
	   The United States says the sole aim of Operation Desert Fox is
to lessen Iraq's ability to make weapons of mass destruction,
threaten its neighbors and attack U.S. interests in the region.
	   But Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz questioned that.
	   ``The real objective of this aggression is to show that the
United States is the sole superpower,'' he told reporters Friday.
	   He said the strikes targeted the old defense ministry building,
which houses only administrative department, a refinery in the
southern city of Basra, a trade ministry warehouse and a
radio-television transmission facility.
	   The Pharmacy College of Baghdad and the Museum of Natural
History were also hit. In the museum, a missile had punched a
two-foot (2/3 of a meter) hole through a wall, shattering the
windows of several showcases with stuffed lions and hyenas.
	   The targets were chosen ``just to hurt whatever is dear to the
Iraqi people,'' Aziz said.
	   He did not say which military sites had been hit.
	   But in Washington, U.S. officials showed aircraft videotape of
laser-guided bombs slamming into what they said were military
targets, including radar stations, a missile storage facility, and
a missile production plant.
	   Aziz said almost all potential weapons sites that U.N. weapons
inspectors had been monitoring have been hit.
	   The inspectors, who had been working in the country since 1991,
withdrew from the country on Wednesday, complaining of lack of
cooperation from Iraq. The withdrawal became the trigger for the
U.S.-British attack.
	   Until the monitors certify that Iraq is free of biological and
chemical weapons and long-range missiles, the U.N. Security Council
cannot lift economic sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The U.N.'s efforts to relieve the hardships caused by the
sanctions received a severe blow with the evacuation Friday of 106
international staffers of a program to monitor food aid to the
Iraqis.
	   The airstrikes have also added to the misfortunes of common
people.
	   In Baghdad's al-Kharkh hospital on the western side of the
Tigris River, Amar Shakir lay unconscious on a bed Friday, the
stumps of his left arm and leg swathed in thick bandages.
	   Doctors said the 25-year-old civilian was crippled in the air
strikes. They did not know where Shakir was at the time of the
attack.

Oodles of noodles and 199 Kims at Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With more than 6,000 bowls served a
day, noodles have won the taste buds of athletes at the Asian
Games.
	   Organizers say noodles of assorted varieties are the No. 1
choice among more than 300 dishes offered daily at the Athletes
Village. Another top favorite is the spicy Thai shrimp soup, tom
yam kung.
	   Bananas have emerged as top fruit, while orange juice and milk
are the most popular beverages.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   KIM KIN COUNT SOARS: In what they describe as a pizza delivery
boy's worst nightmare, Asian Games officials have discovered 199
Korean athletes with the surname Kim, surpassing their earlier
count of 113.
	   And they say more Kims may be lurking within the official
delegations of North and South Korea.
	   Following announcement of the earlier count, one South Korean
journalist tried, apparently without success, to find out whether
South Korea had more Kims that its political archrival to the
north.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HOME TOWN ADVANTAGE: If further proof was needed that hometown
teams have the advantage, it has come again at the Asian Games.
	   The host Thais had notched their best ever Asian Games
performance _ 79 medals, including 20 golds, by the end of Friday's
competition. Their earlier best was 42 medals at the 1978 Games _
also in Bangkok.
	   India, which normally produces lackluster results, was fifth in
the gold medal race when it staged the games in 1982, and headed
the standings at the first games, held in New Delhi 47 years ago.
	   The Philippines was third at the Manila games of 1954, Indonesia
ranked fourth in the 1962 Jakarta games and Iran stood second when
the games were in Tehran in 1974.
	   The Thais were third at the 1966 and 1970 Asian Games, both
staged in Bangkok.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ROYAL FAREWELL: Thailand's Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is to
preside over the two-hour closing ceremony of the 13th Asian Games
Sunday, when games' flags will be passed to South Korea.
	   The ceremony is include a Buddhist pageant, brass bands and the
traditional march of some 6,000 athletes who took part in the
games.
	   Flags of the Asian Games and Olympic Council of Asia will be
handed to the mayor of Pusan, the South Korean port city that will
hold the next games in 2002.

Anwar's wife applies to register pro-reform group

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim's
wife on Saturday submitted an application to officially register a
pro-reform group that will seek greater political freedom in the
Southeast Asian nation.
	   Azizah Ismail, the sacked deputy prime minister's wife,
announced creation of the pro-reform group on Dec. 10 but said it
was not going to contest elections.
	   Police have threatened Azizah with jail if she took up the
leadership of the nascent movement that her husband began. But she
has openly defied the authorities by giving interviews and making
statements.
	   On Saturday, she was accompanied by her eldest daughter, Nurul
Izzah, when she went to the office of the Registrar of Societies in
Kuala Lumpur.
	   Along with forms for registration, she submitted the logo of the
group, named Adil, the Malay word for justice.
	   Without registration, meetings or gatherings under the banner of
Adil could be deemed illegal.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 2 after organizing huge rallies to
demand the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir recently dared Anwar's supporters to form a party to
challenge him in the general election in 2000.
	   Anwar is currently on trial for abuse of office and sodomy. He
has denied all charges, saying they are politically motivated.

East Timorese separatists protest ahead of U.N. envoy visit

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Pro-independence activists rallied in
disputed East Timor on Saturday, ignoring a warning from their
spiritual leader that street protests could endanger peace talks.
	   Dozens of buses, trucks and motorcycles carrying at least 1,000
protesters meandered through Dili, the seaside capital of East
Timor, ahead of a scheduled visit by a United Nations envoy.
	   The U.N. diplomat, Jamsheed Marker, was expected to arrive later
Saturday for discussions with local leaders on how to craft a
solution to the long-running conflict in Indonesian-controlled East
Timor.
	   Marker's trip has heightened fears that demonstrations timed for
his arrival could degenerate into riots and derail the momentum
that has been gained in talks between Indonesia and Portugal, East
Timor's former colonial master.
	   East Timor's Nobel laureate, Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo,
on Saturday reiterated an appeal that protesters, many of them
students, get off the streets to avoid the possibility of clashes
with Indonesian troops.
	   ``Please stop the demonstrations. It will disturb efforts to
find a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' Belo told reporters after
visiting a high school in Dili.
	   ``It will be better if the demonstrators go back home and go to
school because we're coming into Christmas time, so we need a calm
situation,'' said Belo, a co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize
for his efforts to solve the conflict in his homeland.
	   East Timor is predominately Roman Catholic, while some 90
percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim.
	   Belo's message was lost on the protesters, who shouted
``independence'' and waved flags of the separatist rebel movement
that has been fighting Indonesian troops since they invaded in
1975. Activists staged similar peaceful rallies earlier this week.
	   Peace talks chaired by Marker were revitalized earlier this year
after Jakarta offered to grant autonomy to East Timor in exchange
for international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   However, sporadic fighting between guerrillas and the Indonesian
military persists, and many independence activists want a total
withdrawal of Indonesian troops.
	   Marker visited East Timor last July and was heavily guarded by
Indonesian troops when he held talks with local community leaders
at a remote airport.
	   During a visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers shot and
killed two pro-independence protesters at a rally outside a Dili
hotel where the envoy was staying.

Canada will analyze black box from Thai plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The flight and data recorders from a
Thai Airway jet that crashed and killed 101 people last week will
be sent to Canada for analysis, The Nation newspaper reported on
Saturday.
	   Results of the analysis will be sent to Thailand about two weeks
after the black boxes are dispatched to Canada on Jan. 2, said
Wichai Pratheeppreecha, chief investigator of a committee set up to
find causes of the crash.
	   He said the delay in sending the tapes to Canada was because of
the holiday season, according to The Nation.
	   TG Flight 261 crashed on Dec. 11 in a heavy rains during its
third attempt to land at the airport in Surat Thani, 530 kilometers
(330 miles) southwest of Bangkok.
	   Some of the 45 survivors blamed the pilot for continually trying
to land in bad weather and not turning back to Bangkok or diverting
to another airport.
	   The airport at Surat Thani also had its instrument landing
system removed during renovations. The ILS is designed to aid
pilots attempting to land in bad weather.
	   Air safety experts have said, however, that there are always
several factors that contribute to a crash.
	   Wichai said the public may never know the contents of the voice
and data recorders as it was routine by international standards to
keep them secret, according to The Nation.
	   Many nations release transcripts of the conversations between
cockpit and control tower but don't release the tapes themselves.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In the cramped quarters of Baghdad's
government press center, Iraqi journalists wind up working next to
_ and sometimes sharing lunch with _ American and British reporters
whose countries are bombing Iraq.
	   More than 200 journalists from around the world have arrived to
cover the latest crisis over U.N. weapons inspections which has led
to three days of bombardment by U.S. or British forces.
	   The ground floor of the Information Ministry _ which has been
cut into dozens of cubicles _ has become a mix of many languages as
American, British, Japanese, Australian, French, and Arab reporters
do their jobs, along with some from other nations.
	   Among those represented are the major U.S. networks, Britain's
BBC and other major world TV outlets. Other American media include
news magazines Time and Newsweek and such papers as the Washington
Post, Los Angeles Times and Philadelphia Inquirer.
	   The word's major news agencies like The Associated Press,
Reuters and Agence France Presse, which regularly staff Baghdad
with Iraqi reporters, also have sent in foreigners to cover the
crisis.
	   Little of the animosity of the current conflict creeps into
relations between Iraqi reporters and those from the attacking
countries, mainly since they share the struggle of trying to cover
the story _ often with resistance from the Iraqi government.
	   Iraq does not censor reporters' copy, but it maintains control
over the foreign journalists by requiring that they take a
government escort to cover the story. Iraqi reporters do not need
escorts, but are aware of how far they can go in reporting.
	   Even when there are major events such as air raids on the
capital city, Iraqi officials comment only when they choose.
	   That means that when missiles strike, reporters often can't find
out much beyond what they can see when they dash outside the press
center for a look around.
	   Iraq organizes tours to examine the damage, but it chooses the
sites. And again, government escorts _ whom journalists call
``minders'' _ go along, meaning witnesses may be uneasy about
talking to reporters.
	   For working in the press center, foreign reporters pay the Iraqi
government dlrs 50 daily, which is supposed to cover the costs of
escorts and the cumbersome process of arranging interviews with
Iraqi officials.
	   To conduct such an interview, a journalist has to apply in
writing, and it can take four or five days to get approval.
	   The whole process lends itself to reporters spending lots of
time waiting _ for minders to go out on the street, for interviews,
and for Iraqi officials to give the official viewpoint.
	   One reporter long familiar with the Arab world _ who insisted on
anonymity _ assessed bureaucratic obstacles to reporting in various
Arab countries this way: Egypt is the worst, Lebanon is the best,
Iraq is somewhere in the middle.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUFFALO, New York (AP) _ Curtis Brown snapped a third-period tie
as the Buffalo Sabres beat the Montreal Canadiens 4-2 Friday night
and extended their unbeaten streak to eight games.
	   Dixon Ward added a shorthanded goal with four minutes left as
the Sabres came from behind to beat the Canadiens, 0-5-3 in their
last eight.
	   Brian Holzinger and Vaclav Varada also scored for the Sabres,
who took over first place in the Northeast Division by a point over
idle Toronto with a 16-5-5 record. Igor Ulanov and Benoit Brunet
scored for Montreal.
	   Dominik Hasek made 36 saves for the Sabres, 7-0-1 in their last
eight.
 &UR; Oilers 4, Lightning 1
	   In Tampa, Florida, Bill Guerin and Todd Marchant each had a goal
and an assist as Edmonton snapped a seven-game winless streak with
a victory over Tampa Bay.
	   The victory lifted the Oilers into sole possession of first
place in the Northwest Division, giving Edmonton a two-point
advantage over idle Colorado.
	   Karl Dykhuis scored the Tampa Bay goal as the Lightning dropped
their eighth straight game at home. Tampa Bay has lost 14 of 16
overall, getting outscored 70-28.
 &UR; Stars 3, Red Wings 1
	   In Detroit, Ed Belfour made 24 saves to lead Dallas over the
Detroit Red Wings, the Stars' third straight victory over the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions this season.
	   Pat Verbeek, Jere Lehtinen and Brett Hull had the other goals
for the Stars, who began a four-game road trip by extending their
unbeaten streak to six (4-0-2). Dallas took its second straight win
in Detroit after winning just once in its previous 20 visits,
including playoffs, to Joe Louis Arena.
	   The Stars, who have one game remaining against the Red Wings,
clinched a season series over Detroit for just the second time in
seven seasons.
 &UR; Senators 5, Hurricanes 1
	   In Kanata, Ontario, Alexei Yashin had two goals and three
assists to lead the Ottawa Senators over the Carolina Hurricanes.
	   Ottawa's captain and top scorer set a club record for points in
a period with a goal and three assists in the second. It was the
first time an Ottawa player has scored five points on home ice for
the modern-era Senators and was the third five-point night of
Yashin's six-year career.
	   Shawn McEachern contributed a goal and two assists for the
Senators, who ended a three-game losing streak.
 &UR; Flames 5, Devils 2
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Cory Stillman scored twice and
Theo Fleury had a goal and two assists as the Calgary Flames
stopped the New Jersey Devils' eight-game unbeaten streak.
	   The loss was the first for the Devils following a 6-0-2 streak.
The Flames completed a 3-1-1 road trip with the victory.
	   Stillman scored the first and last goals for Calgary, giving him
12 for the season, while Fleury scored his 17th at 14:29 of the
third period, giving the Flames a 4-2 lead.

In China's crush of opposition, organizers face prison, labor camps
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's move to crush a would-be opposition party
has gathered force: President Jiang Zemin vowed one-party rule
would not be shaken, key opposition organizers went on trial for
subversion and a rights group said Saturday another organizer was
sent to a labor camp.
	   The developments were the latest in a campaign against the China
Democracy Party that began three weeks ago. Activists around the
country in June started to form what they hoped would be communist
China's first opposition party.
	   Xu Wenli, a veteran dissident who was the opposition group's
adviser and a leading organizer, faced trial Monday for subversion.
Two other leaders, Qin Yongmin and Wang Youcai, were tried
separately on Thursday, but no verdict was immediately announced.
	   Prison terms were virtually certain. The maximum term the three
faced was life.
	   Authorities sent another organizer to a labor camp for three
years without trial, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported Saturday.
	   Xu Wangping, 36, was detained Oct. 14 and sent to the Xishanping
labor camp outside Chongqing, in southwestern China's Sichuan
province, earlier this month, the Information Center said.
	   He was a former factory worker who served an eight-year prison
sentence for trying to organize an independent labor union during
the 1989 democracy protests. Since his release in 1997, he had been
organizing a branch of the China Democracy Party in Sichuan, the
monitoring center said.
	   On Friday, in a national address marking the anniversary of
China's 20 years of economic reforms, President Jiang Zemin said
China would spurn Western-style democracy and crush threats to
Communist Party rule.
	   Also on Friday, authorities informed the wife of veteran
activist Xu Wenli that his trial on charges of attempting to
subvert state power would be Monday in Beijing.
	   Xu Wenli, who was arrested Nov. 30, was being held with five
criminal suspects at the Beijing Detention Center, a
court-appointed attorney, Mo Shaoping, told Xu's wife, He Xintong,
on Friday.
	   Xu edited a dissident journal during the Democracy Wall movement
20 years ago and spent 12 years in prison, much of it in solitary
confinement. Since his parole ended last year, he began to speak
out frequently for democracy, established communication among other
activists around the country and played the role of elder adviser
to the would-be opposition group.
	   Wang, Qin and Xu Wenli are the most prominent dissidents China
has put on trial since Tiananmen Square student leader Wang Dan in
1996.
	   Wang was convicted of subversion and served less than two years
of an 11-year sentence. In return for his release, he agreed to go
into exile.
	   The Hong Kong rights group also reported that 18 dissidents in
several provinces issued a statement saying more than 20 democracy
campaigners were taken into detention the day before Wang's trial
in Hangzhou and Qin's in Wuhan.
	   They said the detentions showed it was a sham for authorities to
say the two activists' trials were open. The courts allowed three
family members for each defendant to attend the trials but barred
foreign journalists and others who applied to observe.
	   Both men defended themselves after police detained and scared
off potential defense lawyers.

Japan faces uphill battle preparing for Sydney Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite four world-class performances,
Japan castigated itself Saturday for poor results at the Asian
Games and said it would face an uphill battle preparing for the
2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   ``Unfortunately our total number of gold medals did not reach
our target,'' said Teruji Kogake, who heads the country's
delegation to the games.
	   After Friday's competition, Japan had won 50 golds, compared to
leader China with 113 and second-place South Korea with 64.
	   Kogake noted that Japan lost to the South Koreans in 14 of 15
team sports, failed to reach the finals in soccer and suffered
humiliating defeats in baseball and volleyball. Japan, he said, had
won golds in only 11 sports as compared to 20 at the Hiroshima,
Japan, games four years ago.
	   ``We must use the setbacks in the games as an impetus to put
together the strongest possible team for the Sydney Olympics,''
Kogake told a news conference.
	   He said Japan's Olympic committee would encourage professionals
in soccer and baseball to play on the national sides, and possibly
gear its training cycles to the Asian Games rather than just the
Olympics.
	   ``We need to raise the status of the Asian Games,'' he said.
``We place more emphasis on the Olympics.''
	   Despite the disappointments in Bangkok, Kogake said Japan came
up with some world-class efforts in individual sports while its
women topped the powerful Chinese in basketball and volleyball.
	   He cited star sprinter Koji Ito, who won the 100-meter gold and
ran an Asian record 10 seconds flat in the semifinals, and woman
marathon runner Naoko Takahashi who fell just one minute short of
breaking the world record. Results in the men's 200-meter butterfly
and the women's 400-meter individual medley swimming were also
world class, he said.

Indians take offence to Rixon's comments
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Sports-Cricket-New Zealand-India
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ The Indian cricket team's management
protested Saturday to New Zealand Cricket after host coach Steve
Rixon accused the visitors of being negative.
	   Rixon, a former Australian wicketkeeper, criticized the Indians
after they refused to accept a request to reschedule the test.
	   Play was abandoned for the second successive day after sweeping
rain left a deluge at Carisbrook in the first test of the
three-match series.
	   Earlier India had turned down an offer to utilize the
International Cricket Council's (ICC) experimental laws regarding
lost time.
	   Under the ICC rule lost time can be made up by using floodlights
or by altering the start or finish times later in the match.
	   Team manager S.D.A. Drabu said he had lodged an official
complaint with Chris Doig, the chief executive officer of New
Zealand Cricket (NZC).
	   The Indians were overly offended when Rixon was quoted in the
Otago Daily Times saying: ``We're supposedly the underdogs. I would
have thought they would have been keen to get out there and prove
it. You can't win games of cricket sitting in the dressing room.''
	   ``I think it was very irresponsible of him to make comments like
that,'' Drabu said. ``We have brought it to the attention of Doig.
We will have to wait and see now.''
	   ``We have three batsmen averaging over 50 in test cricket. I
don't think they could have achieved it sitting in the dressing
room,'' Drabu in his first tour as manager said.
	   The Indians also privately expressed their disappointment over
comments made by ICC match referee Barry Jarman.
	   Jarman casually told journalists: ``I wonder what they'll think
if they need an hour at the end to wrap the game up,'' after India
refused to play extra time. (ik/djp)

Traces of poison found in dead crewman's body

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with traces of poison found in dead crewman's body,
North Korean denial; ADDS byline

 &UR; By SANG-HUN CHOE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Military investigators found traces of
poison in a body recovered from a suspected North Korean boat sunk
by South Korea's navy, officials said Saturday.
	   The finding indicated that some of the boat's crewmen may have
killed themselves before their vessel was sunk Friday in a
gunbattle off South Korea's southern coast, Defense Ministry
officials said.
	   South Korean warships pounded the low-slung speedboat with naval
guns and depth charges. Before it went down in waters 110 meters
(yards) deep, the boat fought back with a machine gun fire at the
end of a nearly six-hour chase.
	   The body of a crewman armed with a hand grenade and knife was
found shortly after the vessel sank.
	   ``We found evidence that the man bit an ampul of poison. We also
found injuries from gun shrapnel,'' said Lt. Col. Lee Woon-se, a
ministry spokesman. Lee added North Korean agents were trained to
commit suicide before being caught by South Korean troops.
	   Navy ships and planes continued a sea and air search for more
bodies and wreckage of the sunken boat.
	   In a separate operation, Japan's Self-Defense Forces assisted
South Korean warships and planes searching international waters for
a larger ship believed to have launched the speedboat, Lee said. He
refused to give further details.
	   South Korean officials believe the boat was on a mission to land
or pick up North Korean spies in the South.
	   But North Korea's government accused Seoul of fabricating the
incident to raise tension and carry out a U.S. plan to trigger a
second war on the divided Korean peninsula.
	   The incident ``is a farce cooked up for that purpose,'' the
North's official Korean Central News Agency quoted an unidentified
spokesman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the
Fatherland as saying.
	   ``We seriously warn the South Korean puppets not to act
rashly,'' said the committee, the North's government agency in
charge of relations with the South.
	   Earlier Saturday, Seoul's Defense Ministry said: ``We are
shocked and enraged by the North's continued provocative
infiltrations.''
	   ``We demand the North offer a responsible and convincing
explanation,'' it said.
	   The latest incident came despite President Kim Dae-jung's
``sunshine policy,'' under which Seoul is pushing economic
exchanges to bring the two Koreas closer to peace on the divided
peninsula.
	   The U.N. Command, which oversees the Korean Armistice that ended
the 1950-53 Korean War, will demand a meeting with North Korean
officials at the truce village of Panmunjom to protest the
incident, the ministry said.
	   But President Kim's office said the gunbattle will not derail
its policy towards the North.
	   The speedboat, carrying an estimated four people, was first
spotted shortly before midnight Thursday as it approached Yosu, a
small port on the southern tip of the Korean Peninsula.
	   The boat was pursued for hours by South Korean warships and air
force planes until it was hemmed in and sunk in a gunbattle.
	   In June, a 70-ton North Korean submarine was found in South
Korean waters with its propeller and periscope tangled in a fishing
net. South Koreans cut through the hatch and found nine bodies, all
shot dead in an apparent suicide pact. Seoul officials said it was
on a spy mission.

Coles says Sydney could have lost 2000 Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney probably would have lost the
2000 Olympic Games to Beijing if the bidding process was different,
International Olympic Committee (IOC) member Phil Coles said
Saturday.
	   The Australian official said if the decision to select the
Olympic venue was left to the 11-strong IOC executive board, the
Chinese capital would have been the likely winner.
	   ``I know of three or four of the executive board in 1993 before
the decision was made who were committed to China so if the
decision was left to them, my guess is that Sydney would not have
won it,'' Coles said.
	   In the wake of recent corruption allegations, IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch is now understood to favour a system whereby a
commission _ including experts in areas such as security, transport
and construction _ would evaluate bidding cities.
	   It would then report to the executive board, whose members would
also visit contenders before making a decision.
	   Coles said during the bidding period in 1992-93, 72 members of
the 114-strong IOC visited Sydney.
	   ``I would estimate that 75 percent of the members who came here
had never been to Australia before so they only had a vision of
Sydney from a plan on paper,'' he said.
	   ``But once they saw the plan for transport, the stadium, the
harbor, our hotels, beaches and our culture, many were very
impressed.
	   ``I, myself, have had a vision about a bidding city and changed
my mind when I've done an inspection visit.''
	   Coles said ``maybe four'' members of the IOC executive board did
not visit Sydney and had ``closed minds'' about the Australian bid.
	   Senior IOC member Marc Hodler said recently that a group of
agents, including one IOC member, claimed to have successfully
bought votes in the past.
	   The IOC has now formed a committee headed by vice-president and
lawyer Dick Pound to look into Hodler's allegations. It is expected
to finish its inquiry by the end of January.
	   Coles said he would wait until the outcome of the inquiry before
commenting on how the bidding process should be changed.
	   ``I've heard that Mr. Hodler has now said that the allegations
were hearsay, so I don't know where the inquiry stands at the
moment,'' he said.
	   ``There may be a need to rationalize the current system but I
want to see what the commission of inquiry comes up with and then
debate where we go from there.'' (djp)

Floods threaten habitat of rare cranes in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Rare Siberian cranes that winter in a nature
reserve in central China face a severe food shortage because of the
summer's disastrous floods, a Chinese newspaper reported Saturday.
	   About 3,000 Siberian cranes, about 98 percent of the world
population of the rare birds, winter at Poyang Lake in Jiangxi
province in southeastern China.
	   But as a result of heavy flooding from the Yangtze River during
the summer, eelgrass and other water plants that are important food
for the cranes are not growing well, the China Daily reported.
	   Eelgrass is now growing in only one of the nine small lakes that
make up the Poyang Lake Nature Reserve, the paper quoted reserve
official Ji Weitao as saying.
	   Ji said he was worried the cranes would not have enough food in
winter and early spring. If they move outside the reserve, the
cranes would not be as well protected.
	   Farmers in the flood stricken region have resorted to hunting
the cranes for trade and food, the report said.
	   Loan and job-retraining programs for farmers launching
habitat-friendly enterprises have been sponsored by the
International Crane Foundation in other regions, Ji said, adding
that he hoped the programs would be extended to the Poyang reserve.
	   In southern Guizhou province's Caohai Nature Reserve, farmers
have been given small loans to help them start business such as
selling eggs that do not damage the habitat.
