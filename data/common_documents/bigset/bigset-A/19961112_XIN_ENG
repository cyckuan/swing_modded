<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Ukraine signed here
today a friendship and cooperation agreement, following talks
between Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and visiting Ukraine
President Leonid Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, who arrived in Athens today on an official two-day
visit, told the press that he had received the fullest support
from Greece on issues that had been discussed, including the
region's problems, Russo-Ukraine relations with the European Union
and the imminent enlargement of NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said particular emphasis was placed on economic cooperation
and European security issues.
</P>
<P>
Simitis said the multi-dimensional character of Greek foreign
policy and multi-faceted relations being developed with the
countries of eastern Europe was very much in evidence in his talks
with Kuchma.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister confirmed Greece's support for Ukraine's
efforts to find its place in the new world order and noted the
ties of friendship binding the two peoples and the long and
dynamic presence of hellenism in the region of the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
Simitis added that they had discussed Greek-Turkish relations
and the Cyprus problem and had agreed that differences between the
states should be resolved on the basis of the principles of
international law and respect for international treaties.

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific Etchells Yachting Championship to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Crews of the participating
boats for the OOCL Fifth Asia Pacific Etchells Yachting
Championship are badly expecting a favorite weather on Tuesday for
the event's opening race.
</P>
<P>
The four-day championship has drawn six out of the world's top
seven sailors, including current world number one and the current
Etchells world champion Adam Gosling from Britain, No. 2 Jud
Smith, No.3 Peter Conde and winner at the Second Asia Pacific
Championship Warwick Downes.
</P>
<P>
All the top three and the Hong Kong hopeful were present at a
press conference held today at Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club's Middle
Island clubhouse where the regatta is based.
</P>
<P>
John Boxall, chairman of the Hong Kong International Etchells
Association and crew member for Warwick Downes' on board
"Lunchcutter", said: "We are very pleased to see this caliber of
sailors here in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Having six out of the seven of the current top Etchells
sailors in the world sailing in the OOCL Fifth Asia Pacific
Championship bodes extremely well for the type of competition we
expect next year at the OOCL Etchells World Championship in Hong
Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sailed over a three years period, the first event of the OOCL
World Series was the OOCL Fourth Asia Pacific Championship here
last November. This year's regatta is followed by two next year -
the OOCL China National Championship in October and the OOCL
Etchells World Championship in Hong Kong in November.
</P>
<P>
OOCL, a global container transportation company and the title
sponsor of the World Series, sees the Series a historical event as
it spans the transition of Hong Kong to the 1997 handover. And the
1997 world championship will be the first ever world yachting
championship held in China.

<HEADLINE> Zairean Tutsis Allow Humanitarian Groups Enter Goma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zairean Banyamulenge Tutsis
today allowed the staff of several international humanitarian
groups to enter the city of Goma on evaluation missions for
sending aid to the city's inhabitants who are faced with famine.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) reported that after waiting for
several hours at the Rwandan-Zairean border, half a dozen vehicles
and two trucks were allowed in by the Tutsi rebels, who have been
controlling the city since early this month.
</P>
<P>
The aid workers are due to meet local health officials on how
to help the inhabitants of Goma, who are seriously running out of
food, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
However, the humanitarian groups are still unable to reach
hundreds of thousands of refugees stuck around Goma and around the
city of Bukavu in South Kivu, who are reportedly dying in the
thousands because of hunger, thirst and epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) today called
on the United Nations to rapidly deploy a neutral force in eastern
Zaire, according to reports from Addis Abeba.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU asks earnestly the rapid deployment of the force,
stresses in the meantime that it is important that this force
should be neutral, and insists on the need of a clear mandate for
the force which should facilitate the progress of humanitarian
assistance and repatriation of refugees," said the OAU in a
communique.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the participation by African countries in the
multinational force is "indispensable."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Riot Police Stop Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Police today arrested four
trade union leaders for organizing a demonstration over the
current health crisis and used tear gas and batons to disperse
demonstrators outside the magistrates' courts here at lunch time.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National News Agency reported that over 200
demonstrators who were seated outside the courts in preparation
for the march into the city center were quickly dispersed as the
riot police fired tear gas and beat them up with batons.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful march was immediately aborted as riot police
threw tear gas canisters at fleeing crowds, including local and
international journalists who went to cover the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of riot police officers were deployed around the
capital this morning, armed with batons and shields, in
anticipation of the planned lunch time demonstration against the
health crisis and sacking of striking nurses and doctors.
</P>
<P>
Police barricaded the main entrances to the Harare Polytechnic
and the University of Zimbabwe to stop students from joining the
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Armed riot police officers were also deployed along the main
streets leading into the city center.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was supported by the Zimbabwe Congress of
Trade Unions, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Association, the Public
Service Association, the Zimbabweanors Teachers Association and
church groups.
</P>
<P>
The strike by nurses and doctors, which entered its fourth
week today, has resulted in a crisis in health services at the
country's major hospitals, causing many avoidable deaths.
</P>
<P>
The government has, however, refused to hear the grievances of
the over 2,000 nurses and more than 200 striking junior doctors
and has instead fired them.
</P>
<P>
Applications for replacement have been invited from South
Africa, Britain and other African countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Friendly Ties With Bulgaria: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing today held talks with his Bulgarian counterpart, Dontcho
Konakchiev, on further developing Sino-Bulgarian friendly
cooperation and on other issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Sino-Bulgarian friendly relations have developed
rapidly in recent years, marked by increasing bilateral contacts.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Zhan Videnov's China visit in May this year and
the agreements signed during the visit have created favorable
conditions for deepening bilateral relations, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people cherish their
traditional friendship and friendly cooperation with Bulgaria, one
of the first countries recognizing the People's Republic of
China. They are willing to develop long-term friendly cooperation
with Bulgaria in various fields on the basis of mutual respect and
mutual benefit, he added.
</P>
<P>
China respects the choice of the Bulgarian people in the road
of development, and acclaims the Bulgarian government's stance of
recognizing only one China and not having official relations with
Taiwan, which is an inalienable part of China, added the Chinese
vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of economic and trade cooperation, he said that
bilateral trade has been resumed gradually in recent years, and
both sides should make efforts to ensure long-term stable
development.
</P>
<P>
Konakchiev said that Li's visit embodies the wishes of
strengthening understanding, deepening friendship and promoting
cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
There are no obstacle in developing bilateral cooperation, he
said, adding that he admires the achievements of China's policy of
reform and opening up and hopes that the two countries can further
develop bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li and Konakchiev also exchanged views on issues such as
setting up joint ventures in clothing, textiles, energy, and
machinery building, enhancing cooperation in banking and
insurance, and expanding cooperation in culture, education, sports
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Li met with Blagovest Sendov, chairman of the
Bulgarian National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Li and his entourage arrived here Sunday on a three-day
official visit to Bulgaria following a visit to Belarus.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese New Cabinet Holds First Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's newly-formed cabinet
headed by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri held its first meeting here
today to discuss its policies.
</P>
<P>
Comprising 18 ministers from the previous government and 11
new faces, the cabinet formed last Thursday was the third headed
by the billionaire prime minister since October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Bassem Al-Sabaa said after the meeting
that the cabinet has set up a committee to prepare a policy
statement on the basis of which the government is to stand a vote
of confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The policy statement will be ready for discussion at the
cabinet Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government was formed following a fortnight-long bitter
power struggle among the political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hariri has apparently failed to keep his government clean from
opposition force as he wished, for at least four ministers who
are widely believed to be potential opponents to him have
obtained their portfolios in the government.
</P>
<P>
Minister of the Displaced Walid Jumblatt, an ally-turned-rival
of Hariri, said Sunday that the "pot is broken and there is no
way it can be repaired."
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt said today that his difference with the prime
minister was only on politics and it would not affect their
personal friendship.

<HEADLINE> CBI Promises Straight-Talking to Politicians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harrogate, England, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Politicians from
all sides view the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) National
Conference as an ideal platform to speak straight to business, but
this year they can expect straight-talking from business too, the
President of CBI said today.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the CBI's National Conference here
this morning, Colin Marshall welcomed the fact that over the past
year the major political parties had all put forward a
pro-business stance on a number of crucial issues. But he warned
that there are plenty of messages that still have to be got
across.
</P>
<P>
The pro-business stance does not give the CBI any reason to sit
back and relax. Colin said "We have been quite-clear over the past
year what it is we want from any government... it is as important
as ever that we keep pressing those issues we see as vital to
business competitiveness and wealth creation."
</P>
<P>
The President highlighted the need to face up to the challenges
to business offered by the growth of the global market and the
information society, by saying "the challenges set by the evolving
world scene are matched by opportunities."
</P>
<P>
"For every nation that grows rapidly, as the Asian Tigers do
today, the challenge of competition is more than matched by the
potential of new consumer markets," Colin said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has many world class companies, +but we need more+, the
President said. This does not necessarily mean large companies,
Britain must have a thriving sector of small and medium sized
enterprises as well.
</P>
<P>
"We need firms with the confidence and the skills to innovate,
who are driven by customer satisfaction, who invest in the long
term and who are able aggressively to seek out new market
opportunities," Colin added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the relationship between business and government,+
Colin said, "wealth creation is the road we want to take. And
business is the engine to take us there. But that engine needs
oiling and this is where government policies must focus."
</P>
<P>
The president also warned that a strong focus on education and
training is crucial to Britain's future success. "Britain needs to
develop skilled and flexible people, we need an education system
that ensures all individuals are equipped with basic, core
skills," he said.
</P>
<P>
But British business is vitally concerned with quality as well,
for high quality people are fundamental to the success of many
businesses, especially in science and engineering, Colin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CBI President pointed out, to encourage training, "Br itain
also needs employment practices which focus on investing in people
as individuals, and it needs labor market legislation which
supports flexibility and responsiveness and doesn't stand in the
way of job creation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The President concluded his address by saying "we must not
allow poor education and training to become Britain's Achilles
Heel, lest we nobble ourselves in the race for global market
success."

<HEADLINE> SMEs in UK Missing out on Export Opportunities, Says CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harrogate, England, November 11 (Xinhua) -- British Small and
Medium Enterprises (SME) are missing out on major export
opportunities, according to a report launched on Monday at the
Confederation of British Industry's (CBI) Annual Conference.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Trade Secrets, aims to build on the
changes currently being introduced to the government's export
support services by identifying key areas for improvement to
encourage more SMEs to consider exporting as a strategic part of
their plans for growth.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secrets says the needs of SME exporters change as they
move up the export experience curve whereas the targeting of
services tends not to differentiate between these needs.
</P>
<P>
This leads to low awareness levels by the more experienced
exporters and low take-up levels by the more experienced, who may
be aware of the services but do not use them, it adds.
</P>
<P>
The report says that with only 100,000 out of 3.6 million firms
in Britain exporting on a regular basis there is a vast potential
waiting to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Given the right support and information, more SMEs could take
the first steps to exporting and SMEs who have overcome the
initial barriers could increase the value of their overseas trade,
it adds.
</P>
<P>
Tony Bonner, Chairman of the CBI's SMEs Council, said at the
Conference: "We need to create an environment in which SMEs
automatically consider exporting as an integral part of their
growth strategies."
</P>
<P>
"Success in exporting is a vital component of a healthy
economy. More particularly, it can provide additional profits and
stability to a business by broadening and diversifying its
customer base. We need to move more SMEs along the export
experience curve," the Chairman added.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secrets is based on a survey the CBI carried out of its
SME members, both exporters and non-exporters. It says that the
business community as a whole has a role to play, but welcomes
schemes like the recently announced "Export Winners" initiative by
the Overseas Trade Services who are drawing up a new set of case
studies reflecting best export practice among SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Bonner said: "Peer pressure is a great motivator and successful
exporters should be encouraged to share their experience and
expertise with less experienced colleagues."

<HEADLINE> Fatah Condemns Jewish Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A faction of the PLO in the
West Bank today condemned the Israeli government's policy of
settlement expansion, describing the campaign as "brutal."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Higher Committee of the PLO's
mainstream Fatah said the settlement campaign is "against our land
and people."
</P>
<P>
The campaign "coincides with the Israeli arrogant
procrastination in implementing the signed agreement between both
the Israeli and Palestinian sides, namely agreement on Hebron,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said tension is mounting in Hebron, the last West Bank town
still under Israeli control, and "the Palestinians are daily
confronting herds of settlers and facing their bullets with bare
chests."
</P>
<P>
"We will not comply or bargain while our land is being stolen
and our rights are daily ignored by the Israeli government,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah statement called for enhancing unity and organizing
activities by Palestinians "until (Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin) Netanyahu and his government recognize the fact that our
people do not accept aggression, compulsion or give up their
inalienable rights."
</P>
<P>
The statement condemns "the occupation soldiers' crime" in
killing and wounding Deir Qidees villagers in the West Bank
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place in Deir Qidees village near Ramallah on
Sunday morning, when dozens of Palestinian villagers marched to
their lands threatened with confiscation near Kfar Saifer
settlement. The villagers clashed with Israeli soldiers, who
opened fire to leave one villager killed and seven others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Fatah has been the backbone of the peace policy of Yasser
Arafat. But according to recent poll by JMCC, a Palestinian press
service, Fatah support for the Oslo Accords is in decline due to
the hardline policy of the Likud government.

<HEADLINE> Africa's Cartographic Conference Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. Conference for
Africa started here today focussing on providing foundations for
accelerated growth and sustainable development with cartography
and other forms of land resource and environmental information
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Opening the five-day Ninth UN Cartographic Conference for
Africa, ECA official Pierre a. Traore said many African countries
give low priority to mapping and other forms of geographic
information in their national development plans.
</P>
<P>
This is reflected in low budget allocations, lack of basic
infrastructure and technical skills as well as difficulties of
services in getting new technologies, said Traore, who represents
K.Y. Amoako, executive Secretary of the Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
Many new technological innovations such as ''super
satellites'' ''constitute a quantum lead in the quality and
quantity of information which can significantly enhance modern
planning process,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Traore added that using these innovations, African countries
could bridge inforamtion gaps, particularly in decision making.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occassion, Ethiopia's Vice-Minister for
Economic Development and Cooperation Mekonnen Manyazewal said the
challenge which africa and the developing world should seriously
address is the bringing of the widening gap between the demand
and supply of the geo-information resource and the need for the
transition from conventional to digital technology.
</P>
<P>
He listed the changes that are taking place at the Ethiopian
Mapping Authority with regard to cartography as increasing the
level of computerization, introduction of geographical
inforamtion systems, improving national and international
communications and increasing the flow of information within
society.
</P>
<P>
Eelegates from various African countries are attending the
five-day conference at the presence of representatives from
Asian, European and American countries.

<HEADLINE> French, Africans Protest Against French Immigration Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Amid national celebrations of
the World War I Armistice Day, some 300 French people and 30
illegal African immigrants today paid homage to a tomb of
Senegalese soldiers who died in World War II in France in protest
against French government's immigration law.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony sparked a dispute between the visitors organized
by some leftist groups and African associations and the city
government of Chasselay in Rhone in central France, where the tomb
is located, the Agence France Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The visitors jammed the small cemetery in Chasselay to
commemorate the 50 African sharpshooters, executed by German SS
troops on June 20, 1940 after they surrendered. They were among
some 188 Senegalese then serving in the French army who died in
Rhone.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Chasselay accused the mourners of trying to mix a
political movement for African immigrants with the celebration of
the World War I Armistice Day and the memory for the soldiers who
died for France.
</P>
<P>
But the visitors said they "came here simply to pay homage to
our ancestors who died for this country."
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to stress that the illegal immigrants are the
children of Senegalese sharpshooters who were killed for France,"
said Boubacar Diop, spokesman for the illegal immigrants who
occupied the Saint-Bernard Church of Paris in June and July to
protest the expulsion of paperless Africans.
</P>
<P>
In late August, the French police stormed the church and forced
out all the 300 African immigrants in support of some hunger
strikers who were pressuring the government to revoke the 1993
immigration laws depriving tens of thousands of African immigrants
of legal status in France.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Groups Begin to Act in Eastern Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations humanitarian
groups and non-governmental organizations are acting alone in
eastern Zaire today by beginning evaluation missions in Goma and
Bukavu on humanitarian aid to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian groups are persuading the Zairean Tutsi rebels
to let their staff return to the Kivu region to rescue hundreds of
thousands of refugees threatened with death.
</P>
<P>
Six non-governmental humanitarian agencies -- Save the
Children, Concern, Trotaire, Medecins sans Frontiers,
Help-Germany and Merlin -- entered Goma this morning with
permission from the Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. humanitarian agencies, including the United
Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), U.N. International
Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Program
today sent 16 tons of food to Goma, and have begun an evaluation
mission in Bukavu, another Zairean city controlled by the Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The action was condemned by the Zairean government which
regarded the agreement between humanitarian groups and the Tutsi
rebels as "a treason".
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman in Kinshasa told the Agence France
Presse (AFP) that the Zairean government could go as far as
stopping humanitarian aid workers from working on Zairean soil.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the United Nations now seems to be moving on two
different tracks for ending the refugee crisis in eastern Zaire,
by keeping its envoy for the Great Lakes region Raymond Chrestien
on a shuttle mission between Kinshasa and Kigali, and letting
humanitarian groups go back to refugees by themselves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee of Red Cross is also
contacting Zairean government for entering both the areas which
are under the control of Zairean government forces and those
controlled by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that there is a lot of confusion among humanitarian
groups over how to coordinate rescue operations and over the
actual situation of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Britain Deeply Concerned over Renewed Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
expressed grave concern over the renewed violence in West Bank and
urged both sides to make efforts in restoring momentum to the
right track of the Middle East Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement issued
earlier today that the British government is "deeply concerned by
reports of violence returning to the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"The incident in Deir Qadis, where another Palestinian died
during demonstrations against Israeli settlement activity,
underlines the importance of both sides avoiding provocative acts
and violence and reinforces the urgency of restoring momentum to
the Palestinian track of the Peace Process," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli armed forces reportedly shot dead a Palestinian man and
wounded 11 others in the West Bank village of Deir Qadis during an
Arab protest against Israeli settlements on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Office spokesman stressed that the British
government considered all Jewish settlements in the occupied
territories were illegal.
</P>
<P>
"As (British) Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind emphasized
during his visit to Hebron on November 3, settlements are illegal
and an obstacle to peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Expansion of settlements erodes trust, which needs to be
restored for a serious start to be made to final status
negotiations," he added.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Stop of Brutality Toward Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A UNICEF spokesperson today
called for concrete actions to stop "modern-day brutality toward
children", warning that the impact of armed conflicts on children
worldwide has never been so urgent as today.
</P>
<P>
Shahida Azfar, regional Director of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) for Eastern and Southern Africa, said
millions of children are caught up in armed conflicts throughout
the world, noting that they are not merely bystanders but
targets, victims and even involved into the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks in a briefing here, explaining a report
-- the Impact of Armed Conflicts on Children -- UNICEF presented
to the Third Committee of the U.N. last Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the most comprehensive analysis of this issue ever
compiled, which details the suffering of children caught up in
some 30 wars raging around the world today, according to Azfar.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, two million children lost their lives in
armed conflicts and three times as many were seriously injured or
permanently disabled, she said.
</P>
<P>
One of the most alarming trends in armed conflicts is the
participation of children as soldiers. It is concerned that
increasing numbers of children are being used as soldiers, a
UNICEF news release stressed.
</P>
<P>
The release called for a global campaign to stop the
recruitment of children under the age of 18 into armed forces and
ensure that all forces disband their under-18s immediately.
</P>
<P>
It also urges all countries to raise the minimum age of
recruitment and participation in armed forces to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
However, even after conflicts have ended, children are still
exposed to the dangers posed by an estimated 110 million
anti-personnel land mines scattered throughout the world's war
zones, the UNICEF report noted.
</P>
<P>
Azfar said children are much easier than adults to become
victims of land mines and urged all African countries to make the
continent a landmine-free zone.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect the long-term development of children, the
report also made some practical recommendations. It argued that
health, education and psycho-social support should be the three
pillars of all emergency interventions in times of war.
</P>
<P>
The report was compiled by former Mozambican Minister of
Education Graca Machel, who was appointed in 1994 by the U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali as his expert to
undertake a study on the impact of armed conflicts on children,
specially commissioned by the U.N. General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Peaceful Use of Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Committee of the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space should play a greater role in
promoting international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer
space, Chinese Ambassador Chen Shiqiu said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Fourth Committee (Special Political and
Decolonization) of the U.N. General Assembly, Chen said that the
committee should strengthen international legal order in space,
boost progress in science and technology in developing countries
and help them share spin-off benefits from space technologies.
</P>
<P>
"Its work should be in no way weakened. The existing schedule
of meetings accommodates various positions of delegations and has
certain flexibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the committee has achieved many results after
years of efforts. The change in international situation is
conducive to the establishment of a sound international legal
order in space and to peaceful uses of outer space and the
international cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
He also reported China's achievements in the exploration and
peaceful uses of outer space.
</P>
<P>
In China, "space technologies play an ever more important role
in economic and social development. This is especially noteworthy
in formulating cultural and educational programs, raising the
overall level of science and technology of the nation, developing
communication and information industries, exploiting natural
resources and reducing natural disasters," he said.
</P>
<P>
After 40 years' efforts, China has established a complete
system of space industry from research, designing, pilot
manufacture and production to testing. The launching centers in
China are capable to launch various types of satellites while a
corresponding network of tracking and control have come into
being.
</P>
<P>
China's Long March serious of rocket carriers are utilized to
place satellites on low earth, sunsynchronous and geostationary
orbits, he said.
</P>
<P>
As a country stands among those in the forefront of the
international arena, China will continue to support and promote
international cooperation in peaceful uses of outer space, expand
its cooperation with other countries in space activities and make
contributions to the lofty cause of peaceful uses of outer space
for the benefit of mankind, he said.

<HEADLINE> Boutros-Ghali: His Independence Brings U.S. Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that his independence
might be the main reason to trigger the opposition from the United
States for his second term of office in the world body.
</P>
<P>
"It was probably that I was too independent as
secretary-general," Boutros Ghali said in an interview with The
Washington Times, which was published today. "Clearly, I was not
successful in my relationship with the principal actor" -- the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali dismissed the idea that the U.S. position was the
result of a "personal vendetta" conducted by U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations Madeleine K. Albright.
</P>
<P>
"It was a kind of incomprehension about the role of the U.N.
and its importance, not only for the community of nations, but
mainly for the U.S. itself," Boutros-Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S., after all, was created by the U.S., by President
Roosevelt, and has always served the interests of the U.S. -- the
Korean War, the Gulf War, decolonization, contacts with the Third
World -- in short, world leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is virtually alone in the 185-nation world
body to oppose Boutros-Ghali's bid for a second term in an openly
explained reason that the U.N. has not championed reform of it.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros-Ghali said that he was continuing to implement
major reforms of the world body. The departments and offices have
been restructured and the number has been cut from 20 to 12.
High-level posts in the Secretariat have been reduced from 48 to
37. The posts are now 40 percent less than 10 years ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some 1,000 positions were phased out, or a
staff reduction of 20 percent since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said that new budget of the U.N. was 117 million
U.S. dollars lower and will include additional cuts of 154 million
dollars mandated by the General Assembly. "That's a zero-growth
budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Bourtros-Ghali, the U.S. now owes 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a U.S. Senator criticized the U.S. government for
its opposition to Boutros-Ghali and said the position was
irrational and embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
Senator Paul Simon said the U.S. would be wrong if it vetoes
the secretary-general either because of domestic political reasons
or because he has on rare occasions shown independence from U.S.
wishes.

<HEADLINE> Overcrowding Scenarios in African Cities: Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Harare's Mayor said today many
African cities are fast drifting toward the east Asian cities
scenario where the majority of people move to urban areas,
resulting in overcrowding and putting a strain on basic services.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants at a regional workshop on poverty
alleviation here, Mayor Solomon Tawengwa said the population
increase could not be proportionally matched by infrastructural
development and appropriate resources.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid urbanization is putting an unacceptable strain on
municipal services such as refuse removal, sewerage reticulation
systems, housing and health services," he said.
</P>
<P>
"More than 60,000 new people settle in Harare annually and
unemployment figures continue to rise, while the city's house
waiting list now stands at over 100,000 applicants," Tawengwa
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the introduction of economic structural adjustment
programs in many countries had adverse social implications.
</P>
<P>
"Many urban enterprises closed due to the opening of
economies, while retrenchments have frustrated urban authorities
attempts to eliminate poverty," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said, "we believe that boosting of the informal
sector and addressing the question of gender issues and
encouraging mass participation in economic development is the
solution."
</P>
<P>
Some 46 participants holding positions of mayor, town clerk,
and other senior local government officials from different
municipalities in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Namibia and
Ethiopia are attending the three-day workshop.

<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka today left here for Addis Ababa to attend a
ministerial meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to
be held tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The Minister is expected to brief the OAU meeting on the
outcome of the recent regional summit on eastern Zaire held in
Nairobi on Tuesday last week.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka is also believed to speak about the follow-up actions
recommended by the summit initiated by Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Addis meeting was aimed at seeking
urgent solution to the crisis in eastern Zaire as the situation
of over one million stranded refugees was deteriorating rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The refugees have been caught in the fighting between Zairean
troops and Tutsi rebels and many of them have been without food
and water for many days. The U.N. has not decided to send the
force because the u.s. has not made up its mind so far.
</P>
<P>
The meeting organized by the OAU top conflict prevention body
is due to work out plans for intervention and make proposals on
the precise composition of a "neutral force" recommended by the
regional summit.
</P>
<P>
So far, several African countries including Mali, Senegal,
Congo, Chad and Ethiopia have already stated that they are
willing to contribute to the force.

ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh today asked more Turkish companies to seek
business opportunities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Turkish State Minister Ahmet Cemil Tunc here,
Saleh said Iraq has lost 120 billion U.S. dollars since the
U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq six years ago following its

Under a deal reached with the United Nations last May, Iraq is
allowed to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil over a six-month
period to buy food and medicine which are badly needed in the
country under the sanctions. But the deal has been repeatedly
delayed.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Turkey and other countries make pressure on the
U.S. and Britain in a bid to immediately implement the
U.N. Resolution 986 (which allows the oil-for-food deal)," the
Iraqi minister noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Tunc, the annual trade volume between Turkey and
Iraq in the 80s stood at 3 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> OAU Backs Intl Peace Meeting on Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) Conflict Prevention Organ today reaffirms its
support for the convening of the international conference on
peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a communique issued here at the end of
the fourth extraordinary ministerial meeting of the Central Organ
of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the one-day session considered the report
of the OAU Secretary General on the current crisis in the Great
Lakes region, with special reference to eastern Zaire and appeals
for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for restraint.
</P>
<P>
It said, the central organ underscores the urgent need to
provide humanitarian relief and facilitate the voluntary return
of the refugees to their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
Over one million refugees have been caught in the fighting
between Zairean troops and Tutsi rebels in eastern Zairae and
many of them have been without food and water for many days.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that the central organ fully supports and
endorses the decisions and approach taken by the regional leaders
at their meeting of November 5, 1996 in Nairobi on the crisis in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
''The central organ underscores the position that the setting
up of a neutral force as recommended by the Nairobi summit would
have been the most effective manner in facilitating the creation
of safe corridors and temporary sanctuaries and ensuring an
effective African contribution to such a force,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement added, ''the central organ regrets that the
security council did not fully take into account this particular
recommendation of the Nairobi summit.''
</P>
<P>
The central organ appeals to all African countries in a
position to contribute contingents to the U.N. Security Council
proposed multinational force.
</P>
<P>
The central organ requests the OAU Chief to enter into
consultation with all concerned, especially with the U.N.
Secretary General with a view to ensuring an effective African
participation in the force, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> US High-Ranking Officials to Arrive in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. high-ranking officials
will visit Cyprus later this week for talks on the protracted
Cyprus problem, a senior U.S. diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after a meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill said
"a team from the U.S. State Department, the National Security
Council and the Defense Department is coming here later this
week," noting that the team will be in Athens and in Cyprus for
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said 1997 will be a year of serious
mobility toward a Cyprus solution and "the U.S. government is
always ready institutionally to be very much involved in that."
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. delegation headed by Director of the State
Department Office of southern European Affairs, Carey Cavanaugh,
currently in Athens for talks, is due in Cyprus on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of one third of the island's territory following a
coup by Greek Cypriots supporting union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which
was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. blames the Turkish side for the deadlock in the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks for the reunification of the island.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 35,000 Turkish troops and more than 50,000
mainland settlers occupy northern Cyprus while 200,000 Greek
Cypriot refugees are now in the south.

of 1995/96 agricultural year.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister, Frederick Sumaye said today that SADC member countries
can benefit from trade globalization by coming together and using
their huge market potential in their regions.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day seminar for SADC parliamentarians in Dodoma,
central Tanzania today, the prime minister said the end of the
Uruguay Round and the creation of the World Trade Organization
have not helped the developing world as it has sidelined them.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to benefit from this globalization of trade, we
must try to come together and use the huge market in our region
to increase trade between our countries," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said, however, that trade barriers between SADC member
states are a hinderance to free movement of goods. He called on
member states to formulate policies and strategies which would
enable the people in the region cross borders and exchange their
good without hinderance.
</P>
<P>
He said economic intergration of the region will help the
countries solve some of the key obstacles to development as it
would help the countries to modernize and diversify their
economies, the official Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
He noted that instability and insecurity, as is being
witnessed today in Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire are obstacles to
regional co-operation, but he said dialogue is important in
bringing peace and stability to any conflict areas.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is being attended by delegates from SADC member
countries, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, South Africa,
and the host Tanzania. Representatives from Finland and EC

<HEADLINE> SADC Trade Protocol Needs to be Reviewed: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The SADC Trade Protocol
needs to be reviewed so that provisions are made to safeguard the
weakest members, an official of the Southern Africa Development
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Rosalyn Thomas of the bank told a seminar of parliamentarians
from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in Dodoma
today that the present protocol does not provide for safeguards
against weakest members and as a result there are complaints and
fears that South Africa would dominate the community.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper at the seminar, she said that for the SADC
to become a strong economic bloc, such imbalances ought to be
addressed.
</P>
<P>
During discussions, delegates said while they agreed that
South Africa is the "locomotive engine" of the SADC, it has to be
regulated so as to provide fair trade competition among member
states, Daily News said in a report from Dodoma in central
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thomas said SADC member states could not
effectively compete on the world market unless they united and
moved from being primary producers to industrial goods
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
She further said some of the conditionalities imposed by the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are not in the
interest of developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Push for Anti-Fraud Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government
intends to push for legislation to curb fraud and regulate the
procedure for tenders, a senior government official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his Ministry's 1997 budget, Finance Minister
Christodoulos Christodoulou told the House Finance Committee that
his Ministry plans to set up a special department, made up of
technocrats and others, to examine claims relating to squandering
of public money.
</P>
<P>
"Such a department will fall within the exclusive competency
of the Finance Ministry and will be responsible for the
management of public funds," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Referring to bidding procedures, Christodoulou said that before
the end of the year, the government will table draft
legislation, in accordance with European Union directives, to
regulate tenders.
</P>
<P>
The Minister's remarks came days after the cabinet sacked
the Board of Directors of the semi-government Electricity
Authority for following improper procedures in a multi-million
dollar bid.
</P>
<P>
The government also ordered an investigation into how a
contract to supply boilers and turbines for the new Vassiliko
power station was awarded to the higher of two short-listed bids,
amounting to more than 70 million Cyprus pounds (about 140 million
U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> IMF Official on Resuming Lending to Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
(IMF) official said today the Zimbabwe government should
fine-tune its economic policies before the organization can
resume lending to support its economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
Briefing journalists here, IMF Divisional Chief for southern
Africa Michael Nowak said while the IMF recently pledged to
support the second phase of Zimbabwe's reform program, it is
waiting for positive moves by the Zimbabwe government before
releasing key balance of payment support suspended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Describing the second phase of economic reform program as
being in an "embryonic" stage, Nowak said the recent civil
service pay rise is likely to worsen the budget deficit, whose
reduction is a prerequisite for resumption of the IMF support.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we resume our support this year will depend on
whether the government meets these conditions because chances are
that the programs will fail if these measures are not put in
place," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to believe that the next six months will be critical
in deciding whether we resume our support," Nowak said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank suspended support for Zimbabwe's
economic reform program in September last year citing lack of
government commitment to reducing its bloated budget deficit
which has averaged 10 percent of the gross domestic product over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Nowak is in the country to assess Zimbabwe's economic climate
before making a decision on the resumption of aid to the southern
African country.

More than a million Hutus fled from Rwanda to east Zaire in
fear of reprisals in 1994 after Hutu troops and militiamen killed
hundreds of thousands of minority Tutsis and their sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
These refugees have been caught in the fighting between
Zairean troops and Zairean Tutsi rebels who rose up in arms to
fight and defend their presence in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Many of the million Hutus have been left without food and
water for many days and people fear that they would die if no
food aid arrives in eastern Zaire to help them.
</P>
<P>
Boguo said in Kinshasa that Zaire had agreed to creating a
multinational military intervention force and setting up a
corridor to enable the refugees to return to Rwanda from zaire.
</P>
<P>
Zairean Tutsi rebels launched an offensive near the border
with Burundi three weeks ago. They hold a number of major towns
in north and south Kivu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Zaire accuses Tutsi-led Rwanda of fomenting the revolt and
invading, a charge Rwanda denies. Kinshasa also accuses Uganda of
backing the rebels by supplying them with weapons.
</P>
<P>
Hutus from Burundi, which like Rwanda has been plagued by
Tutsi-Hutu rivalry for generations, have also fled the area along
with several hundred thousand Zaireans.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Begins Launching Humanitarian Operation in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations International
Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) is launching a humanitarian
operation in Zaire to save tens of thousands of displaced Zairean
civilians.
</P>
<P>
This operation has been authorized by Zairean Interior Minister
Kamanda wa Kamanda, the Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Steven
Allen, head of the UNICEF office in Zaire, this evening in
Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
About 100 tons of humanitarian aid materials, including food
and medicines, are expected to arrive in Kinshasa Tuesday or
Wednesday and will then be distributed to about 60,000 displaced
people on the road between Kisangani and Goma. Kisangani is 500
kilometers from Goma.
</P>
<P>
"These people have walked for 200 to 300 kilometers under
difficult conditions. It is logic to predict that they are in a
bad condition," said Allen.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the UNICEF was planning to use Kisangani as a
transition base to send aid materials to refugees in the Kivu
region further east, but this would depend on the security
situation.
</P>
<P>
Russia is sending to Kinshasa 10,000 covers, eight tons of
medical materials, milk, biscuits, cooking instruments and four
vehicles on a plane from Moscow via Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
The United States has offered a plane for the UNICEF to use,
and some other governments have announced plans to send aid to
Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Reopen Oil Pipeline With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu
Ciller announced here today that Turkey will reopen a
1,000-kilometer oil pipeline with Iraq despite U.S. objections.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the remarks at a meeting with Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul-Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
Issues discussed at the meeting include the Middle East peace
process, bilateral economic ties, ways of combating terrorism and
the Iraqi situation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey closed the pipeline, which runs from Iraq's Kirkuk oil
fields to a Mediterranean terminal at Ceyhan, Turkey, following
the U.N. sanctions against Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who postponed her visit to Jordan twice due to rising
tensions over neighboring Iraq, also held meetings with King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister, who arrived here today and was
accompanied by businessmen and trade officials, said she would
discuss business opportunities with Jordan, including joint
venture projects in electricity and supplying Jordan with drinking
water.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises Thorough Probe Into Gulf Ailments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today promised a thorough investigation into the unexplained
ailments afflicting many Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
"There are mysteries still unanswered, and we must do more,"
Clinton said during a Veterans Day service at Arlington National
Cemetery. "We will discharge our obligations to those who served
in the Persian Gulf."
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War, thousands of veterans have complained
of illnesses such as memory problems, fatigue, diarrhea, and
insomnia. They have attributed the illnesses to "Gulf War
Syndrome" caused by exposure to chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
In a draft report, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf
War Veterans' Illnesses did not find evidence of a syndrome but
recommended an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
Noting 26,000 cases of disability among Gulf veterans, Clinton
said they deserve an explanation for what's happened to them and
support to overcome their sickness.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure all of you that we will leave no stone
unturned in our efforts to investigate these cases and to provide
our Gulf War veterans with the medical care they need," he said.
</P>
<P>
In March 1991, U.S. troops destroyed two parts of a massive
munitions depository in Iraq, where chemical weapons were being
stored. The Pentagon said that it did not learn that there were
chemical weapons until May and June of this year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Pentagon announced that it was sending letters to
20,000 Americans who were serving in Iraq and might have been
exposed to chemical weapons, and asked them to sign up for medical
examinations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Promulgate Pollution Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The government will soon
promulgate a decree on payment of remedy, compensation and
liability for environmental pollution in Nigeria, a senior
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
At present, an interministerial technical committee is to put
finishing touches on the draft decree, said Adegoke Adegoroye,
acting director-general of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency (FEPA).
</P>
<P>
The committee comprises officials of the FEPA and Justice
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The decree, according to the official, would spell out the
types of environmental damages that could merit compensation and
provide correct assessment of valuation of damages or loss as
well as determine the level of remedy on a damaged environment.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to prevent the issue of environment
from being exploited as "a tool in politics or ethnic struggles
as in the case of Ogoni", the FEPA chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
People in Ogoniland, west Nigeria, have been complaining that
the Shell Petroleum Company that drilled oil there has caused
serious pollution to the local environment. The development of
the issue led to the execution of writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and other
eight Ogonis a year ago.

CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali said today that the Chinese representation at the
forthcoming Cairo economic conference reflects the keenness on
both countries to promote their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wali, who is also minister of agriculture and land
reclamation, made the remark during a meeting with Chinese Deputy
Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Liu Shanzai,
who is leading a Chinese delegation to the Cairo economic
conference of the Mideast and North Africa slated for Tuesday.

<P>
"The participation of 23 Chinese companies in the Cairo
economic get-together is a crystal-clear indication of the two
countries' genuine desire for widening the scope of their
bilateral ties," said the Egyptian minister.
</P>
<P>
Later, Ibrahim Fawzi, head of the Investment Authority
executive body, also met with the Chinese official and updated
him on the incentives offered to investors in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> US to Send Military Aid to Sudan's Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States will send
some military aid to three African countries in collaboration with
them to overthrow the Sudanese government, the International
Herald Tribune said today.
</P>
<P>
The United States has decided to provide military aid to help
topple the Sudanese government because it regarded the Islamic
African country a "staging ground for international terrorism and
for Islamic extremists in subverting its pro-U.S neighbors," said
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 20 million U.S. dollars in surplus U.S. military
equipment will be sent to Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda, the
newspaper quoted U.S. officials as saying. They said these
countries support a Sudanese opposition group preparing a joint
offensive to topple the government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of the military aid is expected to arrive in
East Africa around the last week of December, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was first proposed to provide 15 million dollars in
aid a year ago, but the aid package grew when 4.7 million dollars
was added for fiscal year 1997, which began on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Of the initial 15 million dollars in military aid, 7.3 million
dollars is set aside for Ethiopia and 3.85 million dollars each
for Eritrea and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The United States has now referred to Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Uganda as "front-line states" as they border Sudan and are
regarded by Washington as instrumental in containing the Khartoum
government.

<HEADLINE> EU President: Palestinian Development Vital for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the European
Union (EU) Dick Spring said here today that the economic and
social development of Palestine is a prerequisite for durable
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Spring made the remarks while addressing the opening session
of the third Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference
(MENA Three) here. He said that the EU helps this region through
assistance to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Spring, who is also foreign minister of Ireland, said that the
EU and its member states have made very substantial contributions
both to a number of aid projects and to the budget of the
Palestinian Authority. So far, the EU has been the largest donor
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Recently, he said, the EU underlined its commitment to make
substantial additional resources available to the Palestinians,
and adopted guidelines for negotiating a Euro-Mediterranean
Interim Agreement on Trade and Cooperation with Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that helping the Palestinians can
largely underpin the Middle East peace process and the regional
prosperity as well.
</P>
<P>
Spring said that the MENA Three took place at a time of
serious crisis in the peace process. "I have to stress that the
European Union is deeply concerned by the recent tragic events
in the region as well as by slow progress in the direct talks
between the parties," he said in a reference to the stalled
Palestinian-Israeli talks over the Israeli redeployment in the
West Bank town of Hebron and the bloodshed caused by the
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is a friend of the region for the bad times as well
as for the good," he said. "It is at times like... a downturn in
the peace process, that the Union's support is all the more
necessary."
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to the peace process for the long haul,
until a just, lasting and comprehensive peace can be reached in
the Middle East," he told an audience of 3,500, including
government officials and business leaders from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Spring also said the EU's involvement is determined by its
links of history, geography and thick relationship with the
Middle East, and by its substantial financial contribution to
the peace march as well.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the EU has the responsibility both to the
region and to itself by putting the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Spring recalled the past painstaking
experience of economic cooperation in the Middle East, saying
that the first conference in Casablanca in 1994 was inspired by
the belief that the economic development of the region would
firmly underpin the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The second conference in Amman in 1995 created a formal
institutional framework for region cooperation. "Now, at Cairo,
we are attempting to build upon that institutional framework and
to promote the creation of a zone of regional cooperation," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of so many business leaders at the Cairo
conference serves to demonstrate the great potential for
economic cooperation," he said, adding that the conference
should make a further step towards unlocking the potential for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He called for facilitating a friendly environment for
investment in the Middle East and North Africa, saying that it
is essential to encourage the business community in a global
economy characterized by increasing competition from other
regions to attract investment.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope the conference will clearly focus on
concrete projects and regional cooperation initiatives. He said
that the EU is trying to advance its economic cooperation with
and assistance to the region on various levels.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated the conference
earlier today with an opening address, followed by a speech
given by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived
here Monday leading a large U.S. delegation to attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Heavy police presence is seen in and around the Cairo
International Conference Center, where the conference is held,
and key intersections and hotels where the delegations take
lodging. Truckloads of security forces are also seen posted with
poised rifles along major streets of the Greater Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests Against Turkish Violation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq urged the United
Nations to conduct an immediate and comprehensive investigation
into violations by the Turkish armed forces of its territory
and airspace, Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The complaint came in a letter delivered to U.N. Secretary
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali by Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf as
saying that the Turkish forces continued bombarding Iraqi cities
and villages and intruding Iraqi territory in the
Kurdish-controlled northern area.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf said that the Turkish acts had violated Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, thus constituting a
conflict with relations of good neighborliness, the U.N. Charter,
rules of international law and an existing border treaty with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Turkish actions also affected the stability
of the region as a whole, which suffers from what the diplomat
called as the abnormal situation created by the U.S. and their
allies in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the presence of foreign forces
on Turkish soil under various pretexts is only a cover for acts of
aggression against Iraq and interference in its internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He renewed his call to the Turkish government to reconsider
its policy toward the situation in northern Iraq, which has
been out of control of the Iraqi government since the 1991
Gulf War.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The corn output of the
United States could reach 9.27 billion bushels (236.76 billion
kilograms) this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said
today, once again raising its monthly production forecast.
</P>
<P>
The department also increased forecast for soybeans to 2.4
billion bushels (65.32 billion kilograms), reflecting nearly ideal
weather conditions late in the growing season, as well as for milk
production, causing a sharp drop from last month in the forecast
price for milk in the coming 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The latest estimates for corn and soybeans will mean lower
prices for farmers but less expensive feed for livestock,
especially chickens and turkeys. The boost in dairy production
will end the short-lived run-up in farm prices and means lower
supermarket prices for milk.
</P>
<P>
Favorable late autumn weather in some major growing states also
helped raise the output estimates for cotton to 18.6 million bales
(3.33 billion kilograms), up 2 percent from last month and 4
percent from last year.

<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is trying to locate some
700,000 refugees struggling to survive hunger and diseases in the
hills in Kisangani, northeast of Zaire.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR team has left Kinshasa, the capital of Zaire today, for
the city of Kisangani, trying to send them food and medicines
first, and then bring refugees back to Rwanda if possible,
according to the Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
"It is to find them, reassure them, bring them together, give
them minimal assistance, because we don't intend to rebuild
refugee camps or settle down the people where they are," AFP
quoted UNHCR official Sergio De Mello as saying in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR is negotiating with the Zairean government on the
opening of an air bridge between Kinshasa and Kisagani to bring
food to refugees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, non-governmental humanitarian groups today continue
to enter Zaire from the rebel-controlled borders on evaluation
missions for helping refugees and displaced civilians, despite
condemnations by the Zairean government.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that some representatives of humanitarian groups met
with Tutsi rebel leader Laurent Kabila last night in Goma, who
complained about the scarcity of international aid to displaced
civilians in rebel-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
An aid convoy composed of Dutch, British, French, German and
Australian rescue workers entered Goma from Rwanda by noon today,
to send medical materials to local hospitals while an American
humanitarian team was driven back by Tutsi rebels after entering
Bukavu in South Kivu, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Burundi have opened their territories for
humanitarian aid headed for Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Cholera and some other epidemics have broken out in North Kivu,
raising fear of a wide-spread epidemic disaster among refugees and
civilians in the region, AFP cited Zairean doctors as saying in
Goma.

<HEADLINE> China to Commemorate Originator of Beijing Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Cultural Ministry is
to stage activities to commemorate the life of Cheng Changgeng,
the originator of Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
Many traditional programs will be held around November 22, the
185th anniversary of the master's birth, to mark his achievements
in transferring different vocal music into a complete art form,
the culture ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, theorists and performers will hold a number of
seminars to discuss the fate of Beijing Opera in modern times,
when the art is being challenged by many other types of
entertainment and is losing its attraction.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who was born in 1811 and died in 1880, was the best
known actor and director of Beijing Opera during its formation in
the late Qing Dynasty. The reformist brought a local opera from
his hometown in Anhui province into Beijing, and turned it into a
sophisticated art, full of lyrics, dance, recitation, acrobatics
and martial arts.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Opera is now regarded as a national treasure of China,
as famous as the Great Wall and the Palace Museum.
</P>
<P>
"The commemoration is aimed not only at helping to revive
Beijing Opera, but also to develop the country's folk arts as a
whole, and promote the nation's fine culture," said Tan Bin,
spokesman for the cultural ministry.
</P>
<P>
He added that this is also a part of the campaign to build good
ethics and culture, which is encouraged by the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Every year, the Chinese government pours money, and holds
activities to revive Beijing Opera and other traditional arts,
with mass media taking part to spread their popularity.

performance in Macao this year.
</P>
<P>
Two Toyota Corona ExiVs, one of the world's most powerful
touring cars, have been selected for the team for this year's
Macao race. Among other design features is the wide and low body
shape, which was adopted by the winner car for this year's All
Japan Touring Car.
</P>
<P>
The team's stars are Denmark's Tom Kristensen and Germany's
Michael Krumm.
</P>
<P>
Kristensen, now 29, was the Danish Karting Champion from 1983
to 1985. He won the 1985 Scandinavian Karting Champion in Sweden
and was the runner-up in the 1987 World Karting Championship.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> British Airways Responsible for French Hostages: Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Appeal Court today
confirmed that the British Airways was responsible for the taking
hostage by Iraq of 61 French passengers on August 2, 1990, in
Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
On August 2, 1990, a passenger plane of the British Airways
taking off from London landed in Kuwait City hours before the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, resulting in the detention by Iraqi
soldiers of all passengers and the crew on board.
</P>
<P>
A Paris court judged on November 8, 1995, that the British
Airways should compensate the 61 French passengers held hostage by
Iraq for physical and psychological sufferings during captivity of
one to three months.
</P>
<P>
The British Airways, however, denied that it was aware of the
risk in landing the plane in Kuwait City.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, the British Airways would have to pay
400,000 French francs (80,000 U.S. dollars) to each ex-hostage
detained for one month, 600,000 francs (120,000 dollars) for three
months, and 60,000 francs (12,000 dollars) to the relatives of
ex-hostages.

<HEADLINE> China Starts to Salvage Famous Sunken Warship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China today started a salvage
operation to recover a sunken cruiser warship from the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The salvage attempt is in commemoration of the 130th
anniversary of the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the forerunner of
the Chinese democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, "Chungshan", was named after Dr. Sun in 1925, and
was involved in many historic incidents in the first half of this
century.
</P>
<P>
It was sunk by Japanese bombers near Wuhan, capital of Central
China's Hubei Province, in October 1938.
</P>
<P>
The salvage work began at 3 p.m. today, with military bands
playing loud music on the river bank, and boats and ships sounding
their sirens on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Li Guanghui, manager of the Chongqing Yangtze River Rescue and
Salvage Company, which will take charge of the salvage project,
revealed their plan.
</P>
<P>
"We will place 20 steel cables under the sunken cruiser, one
every three meters, to form a steel net, and then lift the ship
out of water as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li's company won the bid for the salvage project a year ago,
due to its engineering strength and the feasibility of its salvage
plan.
</P>
<P>
"The route of the salvage will be first vertical, then
horizontal, and then vertical and horizontal again, just like
ascending steps," Li added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the most difficult task for the salvage team
will be placing the steel cable net under the sunken ship.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only 40 percent of the steel cables, whose diameters
range from six to nine inches, have been placed.
</P>
<P>
Another major difficulty for his company, he said, is to remove
nearly 2,000 tons of mud and sand deposited in the sunken ship
during the past 58 years.
</P>
<P>
"It is also planned to first recover various cultural relics
aboard the ship, such as guns and ammunition, navigation and
communication equipment, books and archives, and instruments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The salvage company has so far successfully taken out of water
107 items from the sunken ship, including artillery shells,
navigating instruments, leather belts, and a coal shovel.
</P>
<P>
The divers said they also discovered 100 tons of unburned
coal on the submerged cruiser.
</P>
<P>
"Our major concern is whether the ship will break during the
salvage," said an archaeologist attending today's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
However, he believed that the present salvage plan has taken
enough precautions.
</P>
<P>
The salvage company will send nine ships to work in the salvage
area tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
After the whole ship is salvaged, the "Chungshan" cruiser will
be sent to a shipyard to restore it to its former glory, so it
looks just as it did in 1925.
</P>
<P>
The salvage and restoration work is expected to cost more than
70 million yuan (about 8 million US dollars).

ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The assembly and the
government of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP) were
dissolved today by new NWFP Governor Arif Bangash, following the
dissolution of those in Sindh and Baluchistan provinces.
</P>
<P>
The dissolution was effected with the prior approval of
Pakistani President Farooq Leghari who dissolved the National
Assembly and fired Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangash, who took oath as the new NWFP governor Monday, said
today that none of the political parties had a clear-cut majority
in the NWFP Assembly and that the coalition government was formed
through horse trading.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling coalition in NWFP comprised the Pakistan
People's Party led by Bhutto, Pakistan Muslim League (Junejo
group) and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazlur group).
</P>
<P>
Bangash accused the coalition of widespread malpractice in
provincial affairs and indulgence in nepotism, favoritism and
corruption on a mass scale.

<HEADLINE> China's Oilfields to Introduce High-Tech Oil Recovery Method </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to promote enhanced
oil recovery, a high-tech extraction method, in its top six
oilfields in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The move is a bid to increase crude output from the fields by 7
million to 10 million tons annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Oil experts say that the introduction of the technology is
equivalent to discovering an oilfield with over 100 million tons
of oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Primary recovery extracts oil in natural conditions, while in
secondary recovery water is injected into oil-bearing layers
before extraction. In enhanced oil recovery, or tertiary recovery,
chemical agents are injected into oil-bearing layers to recover
the oil.
</P>
<P>
China is to introduce a polymer flooding method in enhanced oil
recovery, and build 103 chemical-agent injection stations at six
oilfields, including Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
The industrialization of the polymer flooding method in oil
exploitation, a state major science and technology research
project during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991 to 1995),
has been jointly developed by more than 4,000 technicians and
scientists from 24 research institutes.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, most of China's big oilfields have entered
their later phase of production. China is short of undeveloped oil
reserves, and has low oil recovery rates. Two thirds of proven oil
reserves can not be extracted.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced oil recovery has been a major world problem in oil
recovery. Some foreign countries started similar experiments more
than 30 years ago, and are still in their experimental period.
</P>
<P>
After years of efforts, Chinese technicians have made
achievements in solving 10 key problems in large-scale polymer
flooding methods. The technique can raise oil recovery rates by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The injection of one ton chemical agent can help produce 290 to
471 tons of crude.
</P>
<P>
An official at the China Oil and Gas Corporation said that the
country has made trials in enhanced oil recovery in nine oil areas
of six oilfields, and yielded increased crude output by a big
margin from 1991 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official said China is to improve its
alkaline-surfactant-polymer flooding technology, a even more
effective output increasing method, in next five years.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Offers Fat Dossier of Projects at Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today began to offer a fat
dossier of projects involving 33 billion U.S. dollars to the third
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three),
which opened here this morning with some 3,500 participants from
across the world.
</P>
<P>
Egypt pins great hope on the MENA Three to attract foreign
investments and boost its sluggish economy. For this purpose, it
presented 188 projects to the conference.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address to the conference, Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak expressed his hope that the Egyptian economy would
become an integral part of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Today, our countries are part of a global structure. There are
no longer island economies, isolated blocs and closed systems,"
Mubarak told the audience, which included more than 2,000
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"Direct investments are global, capital flows react to global
variables, production and distribution respond to global trend,"
he explained , in what was seen as an appeal for foreign capital
to invigorate Egypt's sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
At the instruction of Mubarak, the Egyptian government has
issued two thick volumes of private and state projects to lure
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians are highlighting at the conference investment
opportunities in almost all sectors of the economy, ranging from
tourism industry to information schemes in the region.
</P>
<P>
Among the projects offered by the Egyptians are a North
Africa-Middle East coastal highway and a pipeline to supply
Egypt's natural gas to Israel, Jordan and possibly Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Another project presented is a 1.5 billion dollar petrochemical
manufacturing facility, which will use Egypt's amply supply of
natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is also trying to draw foreign funds to finance the Nile
River clear-up campaign to reduce water pollution and facilitate
smooth waterways for ships. In addition, a 17.5 million dollar
project is listed for producing sugar from the country's abundant
sugar beets.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, Egypt hopes the MENA Three will provide it with
a strong backing for its economic take-off despite a pessimistic
mood caused by the stalemate of the Middle East peace process,
especially the stalled Israeli-Palestinian talks on the
repeatedly-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron, the
last West Bank city still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who spoke at
the opening session of the conference, said the current
negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians have been
"intensive and at times frustrating." But he expressed his belief
that "a final set of very specific understandings on Hebron is
close."
</P>
<P>
Many Egyptians think otherwise. An Egyptian businessman
attending the conference said that "we just come here to look,
tabled projects are many, but the actual results will not be
promising."
</P>
<P>
About 90 countries and regions sent delegations to the
conference, which will last until Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Embassy Confirms Israeli Citizen in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian Embassy in
Tel Aviv issued a statement today confirming that an Israeli
citizen had been arrested in Cairo for security offenses,
reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
But the embassy statement did not give the Israeli's name or
details.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian police announced Monday that security officials are
holding Azzam Azzam, a 35-year-old Druse from Lower Galilee in
Israel on suspicion of spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Azzam was detained Wednesday outside a Cairo hotel and
remanded in custody for 15 days. He had been in Cairo for the
past six months working as a mechanic at the joint
Egyptian-Israeli Tefron textile factory. His brother, Wafa, is
manager of the factory.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian legal source was quoted in the local press today
as saying that Azzam was recruited by Mossad after the Netanyahu
government was set up in June. He was offered a huge sum of
money and then recruited Egyptian citizens as well.
</P>
<P>
Assad Assad, prime minister's adviser on Druse affairs, has
traveled to Cairo to investigate the matter.
</P>
<P>
The incident was first reported in the London-based Arabic
daily Al-Hayat Monday. It said that Azzam was part of a group,
including Egyptian citizens, arrested in Cairo on suspicion of
having contacts with the Israeli secret agency Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Assad Monday spoke with Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny, who promised to have details "within 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
In reply to the family's charge that Azzam had been
kidnapped, Bassiouny said that the Egyptian authorities are not
in the habit of abducting people from outside their hotel and
then having them disappear. He asked Assad to relay a message to
the Azzam family that they should not be alarmed, and said he
had already sent several communications on the subject to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Druse is an Arabic minority in Israel with a population of
less than 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in China were today
urged by President Jiang Zemin to work hard to make greater
achievements in scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and party leader Hu Jintao met
with representatives attending a national conference on China's
scientific and technological achievements made between 1991 to
1995.
</P>
<P>
Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the
Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, said at the
conference in the Great Hall of the People that scientists and
technicians should focus their research on technical upgrading of
basic and pillar industries and the development of high-yielding
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the speeding up of the reform of China's
scientific research institutions, and transforming scientific
achievements into productive forces.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that the government will reduce its administration in
the arranging of scientific research projects, and let specialists
take charge.
</P>
<P>
Relying mainly on China's own science development, Wen Jiabao
said, China will also introduce key technologies from abroad, and
promote technological cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
He emphasised that repetition of introducing overseas
technology and equipment will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming overseas Chinese scientists to return home and engage
in major research projects for their motherland, Wen said that the
government will also work to improve the working and living
conditions for China's own scientists.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, China launched a large number of major state
science research projects involving nine billion yuan. The
projects resulted in over 60,000 scientific and technical
findings, and generated 60 billion yuan (7.5 billion U.S. dollars)
in economic profits.
</P>
<P>
They cover agriculture, raw materials, equipment, energy,
communications, new materials, light industry, textiles,
environmental protection and social development.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Calls for Compromise From Both </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher urged here today the Israelis and Palestinians to
understand each other better and be ready to compromise in future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the Middle East and
North Africa (MENA) economic conference, he said:" For these
and future negotiations to succeed, each side must go the
extra mile to understand the needs of the other -- to take
their requirements into account."
</P>
<P>
"Each side must accept that to succeed, there can be no
winners or losers. Each side must win and be seen to win
-- or both sides will lose," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Each side must recognize that it is not possible to make
peace without taking risks -- but that maintaining the status
quo poses even greater risks for the future," the outgoing
top U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official failed to specify what he has in mind
to narrow the gap between the two sides which have reached
no agreement on Israeli redeployment from Hebron, the only
West Bank town still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were made to arrange the signing of an accord on
Hebron during the three-day economic conference, but they somehow
proved to be fruitless.
</P>
<P>
The both sides blamed each other for the delay in signing
the agreement after four weeks of hard negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"The current negotiations have been intensive and at times
frustrating, but I believe that a final set of very specific
understandings on Hebron is close at hand," Christopher
announced.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that the Hebron issue is no longer
the major obstacle. Harder bargainings could be predicted over
the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank rural areas, the safe
passage between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the release
of Palestinian detainees, as requested by the Oslo II agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Once those negotiations (on Hebron) finally succeed, I urge
the parties to move ahead with the same urgency to implement
the remainder of the Interim Agreement," the U.S. official
said.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the United States would help the Israelis and
Palestinians to take those risks and support them throughout the
hard journey to peace.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in the Middle East is a vital national interest of
the United States," Christopher said, adding the Mideast peace
process would remain a top priority for the U.S. over the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
Apparently the U.S. official tried carefully to avoid putting
direct pressure on Israel as demanded by the Arab world, urging
evenly the both sides to compromise.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made a very brief reference to Syria and Lebanon,
which have boycotted the three MENA economic conferences since
1994 Casablanca summit, saying that there is still the opportunity
for a comprehensive peace that involves the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"A peace must finally be achieved if the region is to enjoy
real security," said the U.S. official who is to resign early
next year.

enterprises in China, which have made rapid developments in
China's reform and opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>

intermediary organizations, chambers of commerce, as a whole, have
played their own role and have won support from the government at
all levels, and have been highly regarded by the government, he
noted.

multimillion-dollar legal battle between one of Japan's biggest
shipping firms and a prominent German recycling concern.
</P>
<P>
Mixed with industrial and household waste, the consignment
arrived in April in three shipments from Rotterdam and
Antwerp. Marks on the packages indicate that the waste should have
been treated in Germany under its laws, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This summer, some 200 tons of plastic waste from the United
States was left in Hong Kong for four months, while last month the
 government admitted that 80 tons of imported waste had been
illegally dumped in a landfill before being spotted.
</P>
<P>
The US consignment was eventually sent back, and the latest
German shipment could also be returned, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong rushed in new rules from September 1 requiring
permits for imports of contaminated waste.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Sign Charter of Mideast Development Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said today the U.S. will sign next week the Charter
of the Middle East Development Bank with the aim of funding
private projects to boost regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the statement in an opening speech to the
third Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference,
attended by 3,500 government officials and business leaders from
some 90 countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. will send representatives to the Bank's
Transition Team to Cairo later this month to speed up the
preparation.
</P>
<P>
Christopher promised that the U.S. government would work with
the new Congress to gain strong American backing for the bank and
ensure that it become operational by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
The 5 billion U.S.dollar Middle East Development Bank,
established in last year's Amman summit with the strong support
by the U.S. and Israel, was aimed at promoting development of the
private sector to back regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
However, European countries were opposed to the creation of
the bank, arguing that enough banking institutions had existed
to provide funds for regional economic development.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the U.S. would make efforts to enlist
more support from other nations. "I urge other nations to come
forward now to support the Bank's funding needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. government would encourage greater
American economic engagement across the MENA region to promote
trade and foreign investment.

TEHRAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian who hijacked a
Boeing 727 airplane when it was on a domestic flight in 1984 was
hanged here last week, Tehran's Islamic Revolution Court
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Gholamreza Vahidjou, who was on board a flight from Tehran to
Bushehr, southern Iran, threatened to explode the aircraft by
saying that he had a bomb in his bag and forced the pilot to
make an emergency landing at the Qatar airport.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA said that the hijacker later
fled to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
After living in Iraq, Turkey and France for some time, he
clandestinely returned to Iran in 1995 and lived in a quarter in
western Tehran with female appearance.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, he tried to flee the country after the law
enforcement forces became suspicious of him. Vahidjou was
arrested at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport and was
handed over to judicial officials.
</P>
<P>
Vahidjou has admitted the charges of hijacking the aircraft
and using forged documents. He was given a death sentence by the
Islamic Revolution Court to which he appealed.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court turned down his appeal and confirmed the
verdict last Monday. The sentence was carried out two days
later.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher pledged here today that the advancement of Middle
East peace process remains a top priority for the U.S. in the
next four years.
</P>
<P>
"Peace in the Middle East is a vital national interest of the
United States," said the outgoing secretary of state at the
opening session of the Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Washington would strive to encourage the Mideast peace
process to move forward in both political and economic
dimensions, he vowed.
</P>
<P>
The participation of over 1,400 business people from over 70
countries showed the world's "willingness to invest in a better
future" for the region, said the top U.S. diplomat who led a
170-member delegation to the conference.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the first economic summit in Casablanca of Morocco
in 1994 which started the process of MENA regional economic
cooperation, Christopher said "a whole new dimension of the
peace process" had been opened up.
</P>
<P>
He said that, despite all the setbacks of the peace process,
especially after the Israeli-Palestinian bloodshed in September,
both Arabs and Israelis have "glimpsed the promise of peace"
because they had recognized the imperativeness of moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Christopher expressed the hope that the Israeli-Palestinian
talks on Israeli troop pullback in Hebron would be soon
concluded to pave the way for further implementation of the
remainder of the Interim Agreement.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the U.S. government, led by Bill Clinton who
was re-elected early this month, would continue to help the peace
partners to take risks and support them along the long, hard
journey to peace.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and the next Secretary of State will
"continue to make the advancement of the Middle East peace
process a top priority over the next four years," said
Christopher, who is to retire in the upcoming cabinet shake-up.
</P>
<P>
The Casablanca process of economic cooperation would
"reinforce our partnership for peace and prosperity," Christopher
said.

militiamen of Somali warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid re-captured
the remote town of Huddor from the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA), according to a report from Huddor.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness said that several houses were hit by of rocket
propelled grenades launched by the offensive militiamen and few
shops and small businesses were looted during the 45 minutes long
operation.
</P>
<P>
The retreated RRA men are reportedly regrouping themselves
in 10 km outside the town. The town of Huddor has been calm
this morning with heavily armed militiamen manning several
checkpoints along all the roads in and outside the town.
</P>
<P>
Despite the calmness, the town seemed to be deserted and all
business centers and shops were closed down most probably in fear
of further looting by the militiamen of Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
Huddor Town peacefully fell to the RRA forces in early August
after the death of late general Mohamed Farah Aidid. Hussein
Aidid's men withdrew from Huddor without engaging any fighting
with the RRA after the communication and logistical support were
allegedly cut off by the panic mounted after the death of General
Aidid.

<HEADLINE> 96 Namibians Killed by Landmines in Past Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Ninety-six Namibians,
mainly children, have been killed by landmines throughout the
country since 1989 along with 216 injuries in 165 incidents,
reported the South African Press Association today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the United Nations report "Impact of
Armed Conflict on Children" in the capital Windhoek on Monday,
Namibian Defence Force Ministry spokesman Vincent Mwanga said
almost 500,000 unexploded rounds of ammunition, anti-personnel
and anti-tank mines had been destroyed since independence in
1990.
</P>
<P>
The mines were left over in Namibia's 23-year armed struggle
for independence from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mwanga said the danger of landmines was increased as they were
usually concealed and difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the victims are children who are curious about
unfamiliar objects," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the UN report, Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia
are reported to have the highest number of landmine casualties
accounting for 85 percent of the world total.

<HEADLINE> Text of Jiang Speech Marking Sun Yat-sen's Birth Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
a speech by Jiang Zemin, president of China and general secretary
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, at a ceremony
marking the 130th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in
Beijing today:

Comrades and friends:
</P>
<P>
We are gathered here today in a ceremony marking the 130th
anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, an outstanding patriot and
national hero, and a great forerunner of China's democratic
revolution, a man who enjoys great prestige among the Chinese of
different ethnic groups and among all those who are patriots.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen represents an era. He lived from the second
half of the 19th century to the early part of the 20th century, a
period during which China, invaded and bullied by imperialist
powers, and under the decadent rule of feudal forces, was reduced
to a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society.
</P>
<P>
From his youth on, Sun Yat-sen devoted himself to the
revolution with a burning sense of grief and indignation and great
patriotic passion. He expressed himself with vehemence, saying,
"We must lose no time in saving the Chinese people who are living
in an abyss of misery, and use all our might to support a mansion
that is on the verge of collapse."
</P>
<P>
He was an indefatiguable worker for revolutionary publicity,
organization, and mobilization among the people. He held the
banner of democratic revolution high, and fought an uncomprising
battle against bourgeois reformists and royalists. He united with
other revolutionary forces and repeatedly mobilized armed
rebellions until finally, during the 1911 Revolution, he led the
people in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, thus ending the feudal
autocratic monarchy that had lasted for more than 2,000 years in
China. This is the great historical merit of Dr. Sun Yet-sen.

<TEXT>
<P>
Encouraged and inspired by the October Revolution in Russia,
Dr. Sun Yat-sen came to realize, after the May 4th Movement and
the establishment of the Communist Party of China (CPC), that the
CPC and the powerful CPC-led worker-peasant movement constituted a
staunch force for the revolution, and assisted by the CPC,
developed the earlier Three Principles of the People
(i.e. Nationalism, Democracy, and People's Livelihood) into the
new Three Principles of the People.
</P>
<P>
He pursued the "Three Major Policies" of alliance with Russia,
cooperation with the Communists, and assistance to the workers'
and peasants' movements, got the Kuomintang and the Communist
Party to cooperate, and pushed for an anti-imperialist,
anti-feudalist democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Mao Zedong praised the new Three Principles of the
People and the united front policy formulated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen,
calling them his "greatest contribution to the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen struggled hard for national independence,
national prosperity, democracy, freedom, and people's happiness,
all his life. Today, in cherishing the memory of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's
historical merit for China's democratic revolutionary cause and
his glorious life, dedicated to reforming China, we are filled
with a feeling of profound reverence.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen regarded Chinese Communists as his good
friends, and Chinese communists have always been staunch
supporters, cooperators and successors of Sun Yat-sen's
revolutionary cause.
</P>
<P>
Since his death, Chinese Communists have carried out his
unfulfilled wish. They have united with and led the Chinese people
from various ethnic groups and all patriotic forces in arduous
struggles, making enormous sacrifices, and eventually completing
the democratic revolution that he left unfinished, developing that
revolution into the socialist revolution, ultimately changing the
destiny of the Chinese nation and bringing sweeping changes to
China.
</P>
<P>
We can comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen by saying that the goal of
invigorating China he sought all his life and the prospects of a
modern China that he had in mind are bit by bit becoming a reality
that has even exceeded his expectations in many ways.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen left the Chinese nation and the Chinese people
many valuable ethical assets, particularly a rich legacy of
patriotic ideas, revolutionary will, and an enterprising spirit --
a heritage that is worthy of our efforts to always learn, inherit
and carry forward.
</P>
<P>
He was the first to voice the resounding slogan of
"revitalization of the Chinese nation", at a time when China was
in dire straits, with extreme poverty, and a foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
He raised a resounding slogan that "construction is the sole
purpose of revolution" and explicitly mapped out the blueprint of
a China with modern industry, transportation, and agriculture in
such works as "Outlined Plan for Building a Nation", which showed
his superb understanding and great boldness of vision for China's
future development.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun held that China should resort to "concept of openism"
and should "learn from strong points of other countries" if it
wants to catch up with or even surpass the economically developed
countries in the West.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized, "if the right to development is held
in our own hands, we shall survive, and if it is held in the hands
of others, we shall perish."
</P>
<P>
He stood squarely for the safeguarding of state sovereignty and
national unity, and is in opposition to any action that attempts
to divide the nation, claiming that "the unity of the nation is
the wish of all the Chinese nationals. Once the reunification is
achieved, the people of China would enjoy happiness and, if the
reunification cannot be accomplished, they would suffer."
</P>
<P>
This great patriotic spirit and idea of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's still
plays a role of tremendously enlighting, educating, and inspiring
the Chinese people who are working hard to build the socialist,
modernized country, all compatriots both at home and overseas, who
are dedicated to national prosperity and might of the motherland
and the accomplishment of national reunification.
</P>
<P>
No external threat, internal division, or temporary setback
would shake the revolutionary will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen who
"dedicated himself to the revolution of the Chinese nation for all
of his four decades". And his words "I shall charge ahead with an
indomitable will to wherever my ideals guide me, and persevere all
the more with greater setbacks and make persistent efforts," are a
faithful portrayal of his real revolutionary life.
</P>
<P>
Today, when we want to build our motherland into a socialist,
modern state with a high degree of prosperity, might, democracy
and civilizations, we likewise need Dr. Sun Yat-sen's indomitable
revolutionary spirit, fearless of any hardships and dangers.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Airlines Fare Raise Annuled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Amid the shock of a flight
crash that claims 143 lives last Thursday, Nigeria's domestic
airlines yesterday raised their fares by 110 percent, but annuled
it a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Aviation Minister Ita Udo-Imeh has declared it as
illegal and an economic sabtage against the people and government
of Nigeria, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the airlines to return to the old price and refund
the passengers the money they have overcharged, otherwise they
should stop operation forthwith.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the airlines have been asking for a
fare hike, but he insisted that the unilateral increase of fares
without approval is not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The sudden fare hike has caused chaos and tensions at
airlines' ticket.
</P>
<P>
A private airline, however, expressed the idea that airlines
have been in a financial difficulty, which has affected the
import of plane parts.

<HEADLINE> HK Equity Funds Take Lead in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong equity funds
continued to outperform other Asian equity sectors for the fourth
consecutive month till October, according to the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
In October Hong Kong equity funds yielded an annual return of

survey released today by the HKIFA.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Sun Yat-sen pursued the truth and continued to make
progress all his life. It is impossible for any great figure, no
matter how great, to be freed from the limitations of history, and
Dr. Sun Yat-sen also had his limitations. But, he was adept at
learning from practice, including learning from lessons of
failure, and never stopped his steps in the exploration of
advancement.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he could "adjust to the tide of the world, and
adapt to people's needs," and became a great forerunner of the
Chinese democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
At a time when mankind is on the threshhold of a new era and in
the great cause of our party in leading the people across China in
their reform and opening-up and modernization drive today, it is
especially important that we need all the more to earnestly learn
from and vigorously promote the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's noble
spirit, which progresses along with the advancement of the times.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two years ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "If China becomes
strong and powerful, we will not only resume our national status,
but will take on a big responsibility for the world," and forty
years ago, when commemorating the 90th anniversary of the birth of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that, "China
should make relatively greater contributions to mankind."
</P>
<P>
After the reforms and opening-up were launched, Comrade Deng
Xiaoping also noted that China should "make bigger contributiond
to all of mankind." These give an adequate expression of
lofty ambition and the broadmindedness of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
At present, the people of all ethnic groups of our country are
working to continuously advance the cause of socialist
modernization, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the basic
line of the party.
</P>
<P>
Our country has become increasingly stronger and more powerful,
and our society is progressing daily. We sincerely hope that the
people of all ethnic groups throught the country, patriots on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits and all patriots both at home and
overseas who respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen and hold him in high esteem,
will unite still more closely and work hard for the prosperity and
might of the motherland, for the great cause of the motherland's
reunification, for the maintenance of world peace and for common
development, so as to enable the motherland to make still greater
contributions to mankind.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Develop New Sugar Cane Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
successfully tested new sugar cane crop varieties for low-yield
areas of the country that could increase productivity by over 40
percent, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The scientists in the southern state of Tamil Nadu achieved
amazing results in their research project conducted in some
cooperative sugar mills involving about 40,000 farmers in the
state's North Arcot Ambedkar District.
</P>
<P>
The project was initiated in 1991 when the area was recording
very poor sugar cane yield of around 50 tons per hectare as
against the state's average of about 108 tons.
</P>
<P>
The results of the research project show that the average cane
yield in the low-yield area increased by 45.63 percent from 51.7
tons to 75.29 tons per hectare during the project period.
</P>
<P>
The scientists said they also succeeded in providing varieties
suitable for flood-prone areas besides those for areas frequently
stricken by drought.

<HEADLINE> Interview: US Bank Building Presence in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Morgan Stanley, one of the
leading investment banks across the globe, is taking a strategic
approach to China, the potentially huge capital market in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
"China is such a large country with fast economic growth, and
that's why we make a significant commitment to China," J. Wesley
McDade, vice president of Morgan Stanley Asia Limited, told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The US investment bank started to make contact with China in
1988 by advising the Chinese government in a credit rating
process with the US rating agencies. In 1994 Morgan Stanley opened
its representative offices there, one in Beijing and the other in
Shanghai -- the first move in its long-term strategy to tap the
giant emerging market.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 Morgan Stanley joined hands with China Construction
Bank to set up China International Capital Corporation (CICC), the
first joint venture investment bank in the country. The CICC has
undertaken a wide range of investment banking business in China,
such as raising capital, advising on restructuring and project
financing.
</P>
<P>
"China is a market at such a size that it is very important to
be on the ground floor," said McDade, who believed that the CICC,
the vehicle of cooperation, could help Morgan Stanley gain
knowledge of doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Morgan Stanley got actively involved in China's
capital market. It arranged a 500-million-US dollar Yankee bond
offering for Bank of China in 1993 and a one-billion-US dollar
global bond issue by China's Ministry of Finance in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the investment bank managed a bond issuance to
raise 200 million US dollars for Zhuhai Highway Company, which is
based in a coastal city in southern China's Guangdong province.
Another deal was the initial public offering in Hong Kong for
Shanghai Industrial, pooling a total of 140 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Morgan Stanley has raised over 2.67 billion
US dollars for Chinese mainland and Hong Kong companies as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Though it is difficult to predict how large China's capital
market will be up to 2000 and beyond, McDade said: "There is no
question that China has a tremendous need for capital considering
its big size and fast economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"China is an opportunity for the next century, and it will
become a huge opportunity for Morgan Stanley when the RMB is fully
convertible," said McDade, who forecast a free floating of the
Chinese currency in five years' time.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China does not allow foreign securities firms to
conduct domestic business. Morgan Stanley expects the market to
open substantially with the convertibility of the RMB.
</P>
<P>
The importance of China also lies in the fact that it takes a
large percentage of the Asian capital markets. "China is the
economic driver of Asia. In order to get the region all right, it
is important to get China all right," said McDade.
</P>
<P>
The investment banker believed that Hong Kong, with a separate
capital market after 1997, would continue to play an important
role in providing international capital for China's development.
More than 20 Chinese state-owned enterprises have gone public on
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, raising a total of 3.2 billion US
dollars. At the same time, many Hong Kong-based companies are
raising funds here by spin-off and placement to finance their
infrastructure projects in China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's position is secured in the near future, though
Shanghai is emerging quickly as an international financial hub,
McDade said. "After all, China is large enough to have more than
one stock exchange."

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Crested crane, the national
symbol of Uganda, faces extinction, a famous Ugandan expert
warned here today.
</P>
<P>
Byaruhanga Achilles, the Program Officer of the East Africa
Natural History Society of the Makerere University has attributed
the crisis to improper human activities.
</P>
<P>
Crested cranes inhabit in dry and wet open areas such as
marshes, wetland and open margins of lakes and rivers. Every
couple of the favorite of the Ugandan people has an exclusively
controling area of about 1-1.5 square kilometers as their
territory. Increasing cultivation in recent years drastically
reduced their habitant and decreased their breeding sites.
</P>
<P>
Futhermore, there are indications that some people tried to
capture the crested crane chicks and keep them as pets, Achilles
writes in today's "The Monitor".

"China is a market at such a size that it is very important to
be on the ground floor," said McDade, who believed that the CICC,
the vehicle of cooperation, could help Morgan Stanley gain
knowledge of doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Morgan Stanley got actively involved in China's
capital market. It arranged a 500-million-US dollar Yankee bond
offering for Bank of China in 1993 and a one-billion-US dollar
global bond issue by China's Ministry of Finance in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the investment bank managed a bond issuance to
raise 200 million US dollars for Zhuhai Highway Company, which is
based in a coastal city in southern China's Guangdong province.
Another deal was the initial public offering in Hong Kong for
Shanghai Industrial, pooling a total of 140 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Morgan Stanley has raised over 2.67 billion
US dollars for Chinese mainland and Hong Kong companies as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Though it is difficult to predict how large China's capital
market will be up to 2000 and beyond, McDade said: "There is no
question that China has a tremendous need for capital considering
its big size and fast economic growth."
</P>
<P>
"China is an opportunity for the next century, and it will
become a huge opportunity for Morgan Stanley when the RMB is fully
convertible," said McDade, who forecast a free floating of the
Chinese currency in five years' time.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China does not allow foreign securities firms to
conduct domestic business. Morgan Stanley expects the market to
open substantially with the convertibility of the RMB.
</P>
<P>
The importance of China also lies in the fact that it takes a
large percentage of the Asian capital markets. "China is the
economic driver of Asia. In order to get the region all right, it
is important to get China all right," said McDade.
</P>
<P>
The investment banker believed that Hong Kong, with a separate
capital market after 1997, would continue to play an important
role in providing international capital for China's development.
More than 20 Chinese state-owned enterprises have gone public on
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, raising a total of 3.2 billion US
dollars. At the same time, many Hong Kong-based companies are
raising funds here by spin-off and placement to finance their
infrastructure projects in China.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's position is secured in the near future, though
Shanghai is emerging quickly as an international financial hub,
McDade said. "After all, China is large enough to have more than
one stock exchange."

<HEADLINE> Russia Pledges Active Involvement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia, co-sponsor of the
Middle East peace process, pledged here today an active role in
promoting economic reconstruction of the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) region so as to bolster the Israeli-Arab peace.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the third Middle East and North
Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three) here, Russian Minister
of Economy Yevgeny Yasin said Russia, as a co-sponsor of the
MENA Three conference, would make great efforts to ensure a
comprehensive development in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Yasin expressed the hope that the MENA Three conference would
creat prerequisites for regional transformations based on a
favorable atmosphere, which should first of all be facilitated
with trust and understanding.
</P>
<P>
"The Cairo forum opens good opportunities for the
establishment of useful business contacts facilitating such
atmosphere," he said, noting that the first conference of its
kind was held in Casablanca in 1994 despite "certain
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
The second MENA economic conference was held in Amman,
Jordan, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Yasin said Russia is ready to make its contribution to the
economic construction of the region with a view on transforming
it into an area of broad and mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation may be exercised not only on bilateral
basis, but also through involvement of third countries,
international economic and financial organizations that will
enable us to augment financial technological potential of the
partners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia highly appreciates the aspiration of the Middle East
and North Africa business circles and leading companies to forge
close interaction and trade with Russian partners, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to participate in multilateral financial and
economic institutions," he told the 3,500 participants of the
conference, held in the Cairo International Conference Center
under tight security measures.
</P>
<P>
Yasin said Russia is also ready to consider its participation
in the implementation of promising regional projects, and
upgrading production of "numerous enterprises."
</P>
<P>
"We could also cooperate in the field of scientific research,
information, health, higher and secondary special education,
culture and tourism," he said, adding that Russia believes that
conditions and opportunities are now in place for the promotion
of closer cooperation between Russia and the countries of the
Middle East and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated the conference
earlier today with an opening address, followed by a speech
given by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived
here Monday leading a large U.S. delegation to attend the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Heavy police presence is seen in and around the Cairo
International Conference Center, where the conference is held,
and key intersections and hotels where the delegations take
lodging. Truckloads of security forces are also seen posted
along major streets.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa to Send Troops to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is prepared
to send military troops to strife-torn central Africa as part of
an international force to bring peace to eastern Zaire, President
Nelson Mandela said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Citizen" of South Africa today quoted Mandela as saying
in a television interview that he was prepared, in principle, to
contribute troops in an attempt to help solve the deteriorating
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
He would send a delegation to central Africa's Great Lakes
region to gather information that would allow him to decide how
big a unit to commit, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
The South African government announced earlier that it would
be prepared to take part in a humanitarian effort in the Great
Lakes region, but for the first time, Mandela himself has made it
clear that South Africa is ready to send military troops.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has resisted military intervention in any African
crisis before, said he had given the commitment to former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, who visited the country at
the weekend to discuss the situation in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Nyerere briefed Mandela on the decisions
made at a regional summit last week to create a neutral force to
provide safe corridors for aid for more than one million refugees
in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between Zairean troops and its Tutsi rebels in easern
Zaire has caused serious concern to the region that a regional
war might break out if nothing could be done to address the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Says It Has Right to Deploy Troops in Sevastopol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine said today that it is its
right to conduct military deployment in Sevastopol, which is not
to be negotiated with Russia when they discuss the split of the
Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
The country's First Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bizhan told a
press conference at the President's Office, that the port of
Sevastopol cannot be regarded just as a base for Russia's Black
Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the Russian troops should withdraw from
Ukrainian territory and at the same time set the size of the
Russian fleet to be stationed temporarily in Ukrainian waters.
</P>
<P>
Russia can use the base in the form of a leasing agreement and
this has been Ukraine's principled stand on the issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Bizhan believed that Sevastopol will remain a difficult issue
in their later negotiations because Russia was opposed to Ukraine
making deployments there, attempting to bring the base totally
under its control.
</P>
<P>
The dispute between the two former Soviet republics over the
aging Black Sea Fleet, based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol
since 1783, has strained bilateral relations since the
disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed on splitting the 900 ships but are
divided over how to divide bases in Crimea, populated mainly by
ethnic Russians.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has delayed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit
to Ukraine and remains the sole hurdle preventing signature of a
friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of talks on the issue ended fruitless here on
November 6. They agreed to hold the next round in Moscow.

PARIS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the support given by French President Jacques
Chirac, it is increasingly doubtful whether the government of
Prime Minister Alain Juppe can hold on for long as nearly all its
economic and social initiatives have been widely rejected inside
and outside the ruling majority.
</P>
<P>
-- The first convoys of the humanitarian groups arrived at
Goma, Zaire Monday without waiting for the establishment of an
international protection force, indefinitely delayed by diplomatic
bargainings. Meanwhile, the Organization of African Unity Monday
criticized the United Nations Security Council for failing to act
in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
-- Three weeks before the holding of a constitutional
referendum in Algeria called by President Liamine Zeroual, some 30
political figures of the country have launched "an appeal of
peace" urging the stop of all acts of violence. However, this
appeal, supported by a leader of the Islamic fundamentalist
movement, has been widely criticized by the Algerian press.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- More than 840 million people are still suffering from hunger
around the world, as 173 national delegations will meet from
Wednesday at the World Food Summit in Rome.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak today spelled out a regional blue print at the third
Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference (MENA Three).
</P>
<P>
In an opening address to some 3,500 participants from about
90 countries across the world, Mubarak depicted the blue print
as "one of prosperity, abundant, sustained and shared
prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"Today we are witnessing the rebirth of the Middle East yet
again. A rebirth that will generate a new dynamic in this
region," he said. "We are here to declare that the countries of
this region have in common a deep yearning for a better day for
our children."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mubarak expressed his conviction that economic
cooperation on a broader basis would make the region an integral
part of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"Today, our countries are part of a global structure. There
are no longer island economies, isolated blocs and closed
systems," he said, adding that all economic and financial
decisions are made on a "planetary scale."
</P>
<P>
He said that direct investments are global, capital flows
react to global variables, production and distribution respond
to global trends, which he described as "the character" of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
The president also referred to the start of the stagnant
Middle East peace process, saying that in Madrid in 1991 "we
chose this road, a difficult path, one fraught with danger,
setbacks, disappointments and sorrows."
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the path is just where "our destiny is
truly ours." He lauded the Madrid peace conference as "a shining
legacy" that illuminated the true path for the Middle East
region.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly the first Middle East and North Africa
Economic Conference in Casablanka in 1994 and the second one of
its kind in Amman in 1995, saying that "we took a stand and we
dared to look beyond the horizon."
</P>
<P>
After Mubarak gave his speech, U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, who leads a large U.S. delegation to the conference,
also addressed the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Heavy security is seen in the Cairo International Conference
Center, where the conference is held. Large number of policemen
are seen posted at key intersections and major hotels in Cairo
to guarantee the smooth proceeding of the conference and the
security of the delegations.

MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today said he was confident that the upcoming Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting will be a success.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the remarks when meeting with a Japanese press

He said preparations for the APEC meeting were on schedule and
that all substantive items on the APEC agenda were well

<P>
"We assure you that the Philippines will be a good host," the
Philippine president said, adding that everything is "on track"

</P>
<P>
Ramos said the possible entry of new members into the 18-member
APEC would not be a priority item on the agenda of the APEC
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was likely, he said, that the APEC leaders would give
priority to the immediate actualization of commitments made in the
previous APEC meetings in Seattle, Bogor and Osaka.

LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba will discuss Zambia's presidential elections with South African
President Nelson Mandela as well as Kenneth Kaunda, the Post
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba left here this morning for South Africa to meet
Mandela, Botswanan Presient Ketumire Masire and Malawian
President Bakili Muluzi. Former Zambian President Kaunda will
also be present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
On departure, Chiluba said he is going to South Africa for
consultations with Mandela and to brief him on the unfolding
political situation in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said ''There is no way we are going to change the
election date to suit the aspirations of oppostion parties.''
</P>
<P>
The biggest opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP) led by Kaunda and several other opposition parties have
declared their election boycott in protest against the government
insistence that the elections be held under the new constitution,
which bars in fact Kaunda from contesting in the presidential
elections because his parents are foreign immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Now the UNIP and some others are demanding postponement of the
November 18 elections and asking Mandela to pressure Chiluba to
do so.

others, to witchcraft promoters that have been active in their
"magic activities" because of the lack of a law to deter them in
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of foiled drug trafficking cases were reported this
year, including the most recent one foiled Sunday when the police
authorities seized 65 Kilograms of hashish waiting for
distribution in desert about 70 kilometers to the south of
Kuwait city.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fahed said most drugs were flowing in from countries such
as Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan, adding that his personnel had
confiscated large quantities of incoming drugs from nationals of
those countries.
</P>
<P>
The customs officer said his department had dealt a
significant blow to the smuggling operations.
</P>
<P>
Rampant drug addiction has caused great concern in Kuwait
society as experts and specialists expressed their opinions that
drug dealers should be sentenced to death because they promote
deadly poisons in the society.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Deficit Breaks Record in First 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit
expanded in October by 900 million U.S. dollars, reaching a total
of 9.1 billion dollars since the beginning of this year,
according to the latest Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) report.
</P>
<P>
The gap between imports and exports during the first 10
months of last year was 8.4 billion dollars, before climbing to
an all-time annual record of 11.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month's imported goods and raw materials, excluding
ships, aircraft, diamonds and fuel, totalled 2.6 billion
dollars, while exports totalled 1.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CBS said the trade balance's previously
ballooning trend has been moderately reversed since the beginning
 of the year, imports have not grown, while exports expanded by a
monthly average of 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The CBS noted October's figures show that imports of durable
goods and raw materials were stable in comparison to recent
months, while imports of machines and other equipment intended
for investment rose by a monthly average of 0.33 percent, or 4
percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The trade gap, along with the current account and budget
deficits, have posed the Israeli government a major challenge
since 1993, when the previous year's current account surplus
turned into a rapid ballooning deficit.
</P>
<P>
The reversal of balances is largely due to accelerated
infrastructure construction across the country during the past
four years, and the salary hikes the previous government
sanctioned to a variety of public-sector groups, from university
teachers to hospital workers.

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Cui Tiankai announced here today that U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher will visit China from November 19 to 21,
at the invitation of Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question about Christopher's visit, the spokesman
said that China hopes that the secretary of state's visit, which
is an important bilateral one and part of high-level Sino-US
visits, will play a role in prompting the Sino-US ties to embarking
on a healthy and steadily developing track.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, a major problem the two countries
face is what kind of a bilateral relationship they should have
while going into the 21st century. The U.S. is the world's largest
developed country and China the largest developing country, and
relations between the two not only involve their own interests,
but also produce a major impact on peace, stability, and
prosperity in the Asian-Pacific region and in the rest of the
world at large, he noted.
</P>
<P>
From a long-term and strategic perspective, Cui noted, there is
no reason for the two countries not to establish, maintain, and
develop a healthy and stable relationship, and that the two sides
could thereby discover that their common interests far exceed
their differences.

<HEADLINE> Middle East, North Africa Economic Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The third Middle East and
North Africa Economic Conference opened here today with the
participation of 3,500 government officials and businessmen from
about 90 countries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak inaugurated the three-day
conference at the heavily guarded Cairo International Conference
Center. The participants include about 600 government officials
and 1,500 leading businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Among the dignitaries attending the meeting are U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher, Russian Minister of Economy Yevgeny
Yasin, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti, and Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring whose country holds current presidency of the European
Union,
</P>
<P>
In a sign showing Asia's desire to increase involvement in
developing the Middle East, major Asian countries including
China, South Korea and Thailand are represented at the
conference at ministerial level for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme of "Building for the Future: Creating an
Investor-friendly Environment," the meeting will be divided into
several plenary and thematic sessions to explore ways of
boosting economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Several countries in the region will hold project
presentations and workshops in order to catch the eyes of
potential investors. Businessmen are expected to strike major
transactions on a variety of bilateral and multilateral projects
that will contribute to the regional development.
</P>
<P>
The conference is a follow-up to the Amman summit last year
and the Casablanca summit held in Morocco in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo conference opened under the heavy shadow of renewed
tension between Israel and Arab countries, a main reason behind
Egypt's decision to downgrade it from summit to a ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the common desire for developing the Middle
East economically so as to consolidate the peace process has
gathered the largest number of officials and business people.
</P>
<P>
The conference also attracted great attention from the world
media as more than 1,000 foreign journalists came to cover the
event.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian security forces are put on high alert to
ensure the conference is trouble free. A large number of police
are deployed around major hotels hosting the delegates and the
conference site, where security checks are doubled at the
entrances.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Urges Settlers to Comply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has called on Jewish settlers not to create
what he called an irreparable chasm in Israeli society by
opposing the Hebron redeployment plan.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Likud Knesset (parliament) faction along with
representatives of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories
Monday night, Mordechai reassured the 450 settlers living in the
center of Hebron that their security is guaranteed after the
redeployment, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief also promised that Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu will definitely present any initialed agreement to the
Cabinet and Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Likud MKs gave the impression that should the
agreement provide sufficient security measures, they would not
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Mordechai indicated that an agreement on
Hebron could be reached in the next few days. "We want to
implement our part of the agreement, which rests on our security
requirment there and the ability to minimize, as much as
possible, the points of conflict," he said while visiting the
northern border areas.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I believe that all the sides will make efforts in
the next few days to reach an agreement over the redeployment."
</P>
<P>
Mordechai admitted that there is an element of risk in the
redeployment but stressed that there was also hope and
expectation.
</P>
<P>
"There is no absolute security in any place, but the security
forces and the army will do everything possible to give maximum
security in Hebron and everywhere else," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side is none too optimistic about an
imminent agreement on Hebron. Ahmed Tibi, adviser of President
Yasser Arafat, said, "We know that America honors agreements. We
will ask (Secretary of State Warren) Christopher to pressure
Israel not to try and reopen the agreement."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that on Hebron alone, there are
still differences concerning the issue of "hot pursuit" into
Palestinian-controlled Hebron.

Jiang, who is the general secretary of the CPC Central

Communists as his good friends," and pointed out that, since
Dr. Sun's death, the Chinese Communists have carried out his
wishes, and united all Chinese people of various ethnic groups and
all patriotic forces in waging an extremely hard and bitter
struggle, made enormous sacrifices, and eventually finished the
democratic revolution that had been left undone, and developed
that revolution into a socialist one, thus fundamentally changing
the destiny of the Chinese nation and bringing earth-shaking
changes to China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that, "We can comfort Dr. Sun Yat-sen that the goal
of invigorating China he sought all his life and the beautiful
prospects of a modern China he had in mind are step by step
becoming a reality and have even exceeded his expectations in many
ways."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen left behind a rich legacy of
patriotism, revolutionary will, and an indomitable spirit, a
heritage that we shall inherit."
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that Dr. Sun Yat-sen stood for safeguarding
China's sovereignty and unification, and opposing any attempt to
divide the nation. Dr. Sun once said that "unification is the
aspiration of all Chinese people, who will benefit from
unification or will be otherwise harmed."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun's great patriotic spirit and idea will continue to
enlighten, educate, and encourage all compatriots both at home and
overseas who dedicate themselves to national prosperity and
reunification, Jiang said.

BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here today that "Chinese communists have always been staunch
supporters, cooperators and successors of Sun Yat-sen's
revolutionary cause."
</P>
<P>
At a gathering marking the 130th anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's
birth, Jiang noted that Sun Yat-sen was an outstanding patriot and
national hero, and a great forerunner of China's democratic
revolution. Dr. Sun has high prestige among the entire Chinese
people and among all patriots, Jiang said, adding that during the
1911 Revolution, Dr. Sun led the people in overthrowing the Qing
Dynasty, thereby ending the feudal autocratic monarchy that lasted
for more than 2,000 years, something that is regarded as "one of
his great historic merits".
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that encouraged and inspired by the October
Revolution in Russia, Dr. Sun came to realize after the May 4th
Movement and the establishment of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) that the CPC and the powerful CPC-led worker-peasant
movement constituted a staunch force for revolution. Assisted by
the CPC, he developed the earlier Three Principles of the People
(i.e. Nationalism, Democracy and People's Livelihood) into a later
version, pursued the "Three Major Policies" of alliance with
Russia, cooperation with the Communists, and assistance to the
workers' and peasants' movements, realized the cooperation between
the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and pushed forward
anti-imperialist, anti-feudalist and democratic revolution, Jiang
noted.

becoming a reality and have even exceeded his expectations in many
ways."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen left behind a rich legacy of
patriotism, revolutionary will, and an indomitable spirit, a
heritage that we shall inherit."
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that Dr. Sun Yat-sen stood for safeguarding
China's sovereignty and unification, and opposing any attempt to
divide the nation. Dr. Sun once said that "unification is the
aspiration of all Chinese people, who will benefit from
unification or will be otherwise harmed."
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sun's great patriotic spirit and idea will continue to
enlighten, educate, and encourage all compatriots both at home and
overseas who dedicate themselves to national prosperity and
reunification, Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> University of Zambia Closed After Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The great east road campus of the
University of Zambia in Lusaka has been closed after violent
accidents took place in the last few days.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the University of Zambia last night said
that ''The senate of the University of Zambia has decided to close
the university with immediate effect'' because the atmosphere in
the campus was not conducive for the continuation of normal academic
activities as unacceptable behavior of the student body took place
causing damage to public and provate property and grievious
bodily harm to innocent members of the public.
</P>
<P>
Rampant activities started on last Saturday night when 17 British
airways officials and crew members were injured as students of the
university ran amok, blocking the great east Road of Lusaka and
stoning vehicles after a student was hit by a car.
</P>
<P>
More then 10 students have been arrested and the entire Students
Union executive expelled. On Monday hundreds of riot police
surrounded the university and fired teargas canisters to block the
rampaging students from marching to the State House where they wanted
President F. Chiluba to, among other things, ''assure'' them of peace
after this year's general elections.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Share Market Index Drops Pending Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's share market
analysts believe that the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index
is likely to drift between 930 and 970 points during the next few
days ahead of Sunday's general election.
</P>
<P>
Investors are awaiting the uncertain outcome of the election
after some of them were already taking profits, taking advantage
of the index rise by 55 points, about 6 percent, last week.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Thailand's share market took a sharp and abrupt
downward turn after a short period of marginal but steady rises
since October 31.
</P>
<P>
The SET index dived 20.32 points, or 2.1 percent, Monday to
close on 947.28.
</P>
<P>
A total of 39.5 million shares worth 2.5 billion baht (100
million US dollars) changed hands, compared with 80 million shares
worth 5.2 billion baht (208 million dollars) Friday, the last
trading day. Friday saw the SET index rise 15.12 points.
</P>
<P>
On October 30, the SET index plunged 18.45 points to a new low
of 906.11. The following day, however, it began to rise marginally
but steadily until it reached 967.60 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Share market analysts are not sure which was the key political
or economic factor which had led to the sudden U-turn Monday,
except that they say it resulted from profit-taking ahead of the
November 17 general election and releases of corporate
third-quarter earnings results.
</P>
<P>
Investors bought heavily last week and took profits on steady
share price rises ahead of the election.
</P>
<P>
Brokers say it is very difficult to interest anyone this week
ahead of the election. The uncertain outcome of the election
increased the risk of pre-poll speculation.
</P>
<P>
One broker said, "It's straight forward punt on the election,
but it is difficult to find a reason to go in this week."
</P>
<P>
Although the SET's near-900-point-mark level was bad enough for
investors, securities veterans believe that the worse is yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
Thai securities veterans, who met at a weekend seminar in
Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, believed that the SET's nose-dive
would continue regardless of which party takes control of the new
government.
</P>
<P>
They said since 1979, Thailand had had 11 governments and six
prime ministers, but none of these changes had seriously
threatened the existence of the SET.
</P>
<P>
They said the country's current economic woes were the result
of various factors, including global trends, and even a competent
government could not sustain the share market in the short term.
</P>
<P>
They expected the SET index to further plummet to the 850 point
level.
</P>
<P>
Yarnsak Manomaipibul, an executive with JF Thanakom Securities,
said earnings growth from the SET had been very disappointing,
down an average of 17 percent in the first half of 1996, compared
with growth in other ASEAN markets of 15-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Poor earnings would continue to haunt the SET next year and
drive the index further down, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Employers Asked to Let Workers Vote in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Interior Ministry
has requested employers to allow their workers to return to their
home provinces to vote Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By so doing, it will help increase voter turnout nationwide,
said Chanasak Yuwaboon, a senior official of the ministry, today.
</P>
<P>
However, failure to allow workers to exercise their voting
rights could face both a two-year jail and a 20,000 baht (800 US
dollar) fine.
</P>
<P>
Most workers from the provinces who work in Bangkok or other
big cities are on house registration in their home provinces.
</P>
<P>
If business owners comply with the ministry's request, workers
will have at least a three-day weekend, as the workers may not be
able to return to their workplace until Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Cabinet had also called on business owners to
cooperate with the government to let their employees exercise
their voting rights.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Armored Vehicle Explodes in Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- An armored vehicle of the
Afghan Taliban Militia was blown up in Kabul today, leaving four
Taliban fighters dead and three injured, said a report reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the morning blast ripped apart a BMP-1
armored fighting vehicle parked on the street outside a Taliban
residence in downtown Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The sharp explosion woke many foreigners in Kabul who thought a
long-range rocket had been fired into the city.
</P>
<P>
Speculation about the cause of the explosion centered on
possible sabotage by agents loyal to the ousted government troops
led by Ahmad Shah Masood, whose military forces were pushed out of
the capital by the Taliban on September 27.
</P>
<P>
"I think a magnetic mine had been placed on the side of the
tank," a local resident was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban said that the explosion was caused by
carelessness of one Taliban fighter who smoked a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
"One of our guys dropped ash into the vehicle and after some
time it blew up," a Taliban fighter at the scene was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Commemoration For Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Birth Anniversary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 10,000 people from all
walks of life gathered at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing
today to commemorate the 130th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, the forerunner of China's democratic revolution.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in
addressing the assembly, described Dr. Sun Yat-sen as an
outstanding patriot and a national hero.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on all patriots both at home and overseas who
respect Dr. Sun to unite to make a greater contribution to the
prosperity and might of the nation, and to the accomplishment of
the motherland's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, presided over the gathering, with other senior party
and government officials Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, and Rong Yiren
present.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Jiang and other party and government
officials met with the relatives of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and guests
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Today, in the great hall of the people, a portrait of Dr. Sun
Yat-sen hangs above the rostrum, with a date in gold figures
(1866-1996) and red flags on either side. the rostrum is decked in
pines, cypresses, flowers and green grass.
</P>
<P>
The meeting opened to the strains of the Chinese national
anthem.
</P>
<P>
At the commemoration meeting, Jiang said: "Dr. Sun Yat-sen left
behind many valuable ethical assets, particularly a rich legacy of
patriotism, revolutionary will, and enterprising spirit, a
heritage which is worthy of our efforts to carry forward."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people are now working hard to push socialist
modernization forward under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and the basic
party line.
</P>
<P>
"Our country has become increasingly stronger and more
powerful, and our society continues to progress. We sincerely hope
that Chinese of all ethnic groups, and patriots on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits who respect Dr. Sun Yat-sen to unite and strive
harder still for the country's prosperity and might and to
accomplish the great cause of the motherland's reunification, for
the purpose of world peace, and the common good, and still more
and greater contributions to mankind," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
The chairperson of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary
Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, He Luli, said that
safeguarding national unity and opposing separation was one of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen's constant objectives and something he long
struggled for. Dr. Sun held that peace and unity are "a new ray of
hope for China's future" and for "the happiness of the sons and
grandsons of the Chinese people", and that only when national
unity is achieved can the country be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
The major revolutionary activities of his life, either his
leadership of the Revolution of 1911, the campaign against Yuan
Shikai (who tried to become emperor) and upholding the
constitution, or the first cooperation between the Kuomintang
Party and the CPC, and his effort to go north and discuss state
affairs, in spite of illness, are closely linked to his desire for
national unity at the earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
He Luli said that what is saddest is that Taiwan and the
Chinese mainland are still separate. It is the common aspiration
of all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, including those
in Taiwan, to end this situation and achieve national unity. The
general trend of the age and the people's desire is reunification
of the country and the unity of the nation, and any attempts to
separate the country, or to go in for "two Chinas" or "one China
one Taiwan" are doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
He Luli noted that, because Hong Kong and Macao will return to
the motherland before the end of the century, the general feeling
about the reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
will grow more intense. She expressed the sincere hope that the
Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan will not forget the behest of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and will abandon their divisive activities in the
interest of the country, taking the proper stance, accepting the
proposal of the Communist Party of China, and join in negotiations
to accomplish the great cause of reunifying the motherland in
accordance with the principle of "peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Cai Zimin, chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League, said that, as we celebrate the
130th anniversary of the birth of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, at an important
time in history, as China inherits the past and ushers in the
future, "we must learn from and continue his advanced ideas, his
fine moral qualities, and his brilliant actions to provide a
glorious future for our country, we must adhere to the basic line
of the CPC and to reforms and the opening up, keeping economic
development at the center, and must do a still better job
of 'placing greater hopes on the people of Taiwan'. We must
increase understanding between the compatriots on both sides of
the Taiwan Straits, and follow the guidelines for 'peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems', and prepare for the
smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao in a down-to-earth way, and
for long-term prosperity and stability there."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cai said, "We must be firmly opposed to divisive
activities of advocates of Taiwan independence and attempts by the
Taiwan authorities to go in for 'two Chinas' or 'one China, one
Taiwan', and must develop cross-straits exchanges and
communication, promote the direct 'three links', and conduct
political negotiations so as to facilitate historical progress in
the peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
Among other officials present at today's celebration were Qian
Qichen, Wei Jianxing, Wen Jiabao, Wang Hanbin, Zhang Wannian, Chi
Haotian, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Lei Jieqiong, Li

KUWAIT CITY, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia expressed
hope that U.S. President Bill Clinton, during his second term in
office, would continue to help achieve comprehensive and just
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz told a Cabinet meeting Monday evening that he wished
Clinton would be able to "continue his contribution in achieving
the people's ambitions in achieving stability and prosperity" in
the region, Kuwait News Agency reported from Riyadh, Saudi
capital today.

<P>
Saudi King Fahd was among the first Middle East leaders who

<P>
U.S. co-sponsored the Middle East peace process after the
Gulf War when the land-for-peace agreement was reached between
Israel and Palestine.

Recent developments caused fear among the whole Arab world
that the process might be aborted because of Israeli
intransigence.

COLOMBO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan military have
set up camps in the wild life sanctuary of Yala in the deep South
of the country to prevent the Tamil rebels from infiltrating
further into the sanctuary, military sources said today.

This follows the burning down of bungalows in the sanctuary,
the abduction of sanctuary officials and civilians from the area
and the capture of vehicles of visitors to the sanctuary in recent
months.

several months and people have complained to the government of the
imminent threat to the area due to the presence of the rebels, the

Sweeping operations by the security forces have been regularly
conducted since then in the area, but according to reports, these
operations have not met with much success, the sources explained.
</P>
<P>
They added that the establishment of the army camps in the
sanctuary was done on the orders of President Chandrika
Kumaratunga who is deeply concerned about the infiltration of the
northern Tamil rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam into
the southern sanctuary.

The LTTE had turned to the South following several reversals
experienced by them at the hands of government security forces in
recent months.

<HEADLINE> High Oil Prices Expected for This Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A shrinking oil stockpile in
rich countries and growing demand for heating oil from Europe and
America are expected to keep oil prices at high level during this
winter season.
</P>
<P>
According to Dagens Industri, or Industry Daily, published here
today, oil analysts say commercial oil stockpiles in three major
markets in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries are expected to decrease by 100
million barrels by the end of next March, from 2.24 billion
barrels in September this year.
</P>
<P>
The predicted drop is about the total shrinkage over 1992-1995.
</P>
<P>
Oil stockpiles in the OECD countries have dropped by 119
million barrels during the past three years, to 2.325 billion
barrels last September from 2.444 billion barrels in September
1992.
</P>
<P>
The air temperatures so far this winter have been lower than
normal in both Europe and America, and are to blame for the
growing demand for heating oil, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Both oil prices and oil production have been higher than the
targets set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The OPEC member countries have been producing one million
barrels more than the production target of 25 million barrels a
day, and the crude oil prices rose to 23-25 US dollars a barrel,
compared with the planned price of 21 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oil production in non-OPEC countries has been rising.
</P>
<P>
North Sea oil output has increased by 7.2 percent during the
first nine months of this year, with Norway's oil production up
nearly 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The world's oil output growth averaged 2.4 percent to 70.7
million barrels a day during the past year.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the daily demand for oil within the coming
year will rise by 2.5 percent from the current daily output of
70.6 million barrels.

<HEADLINE> India's Congress Party Suffers Setback in Unity Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The unity move of India's
Congress party suffered a major setback when a major split faction
rejected a merger with it on Monday, according to the National
Herald today.
</P>
<P>
Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) leader G.K. Moopanar, who split
from the Congress party prior to the general elections earlier
this year, ruled out firmly a merger with the Congress party on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moopanar, together with some other Congress party leaders, set
up the TMC due to differences with former Congress party president
P.V. Narasimha Rao in choosing election allies in Tamil Nadu
state.
</P>
<P>
The split cost the Congress party all the 39 Lok Sabha (lower
house of parliament) seats in the state in the general elections,
which led to an unprecedented election debacle for the Congress
party since the independence of India.
</P>
<P>
In order to rejuvenate the Congress party, party interim
president Sitaram Kesri has initiated a unity move to bring back
factions separated from the parent party before. He recently held
a meeting with Moopanar to persuade him to rejoin the party.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from newsmen here on Monday, Moopanar
said the general mood among the partymen was not in favor of a
merger with the Congress party.
</P>
<P>
He said no significance should be attached to his recent
meeting with Kesri.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Opens Up Cellular Phone Service Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
signed an agreement with three private companies with a view to
making the cellular telephone market open, competitive and less
expensive, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the agreement, the state-run Pacific
Bangladesh Telecom Limited was the sole operator in the cellular
telephone market. So far, it has sold a large number of handsets
at a rate of 25,000 taka (about 625 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The new agreement will pave the way for an investment of around
200 million dollars. All the three companies had earlier signed
joint venture agreements with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The three operators will have to start their operations within
the next nine months. Each of the operators will have to pay 150
million taka (about 3.75 million dollars) as license fee within 15
years from the date of the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
With more private companies in the cellular telephone business,
consumers will be immensely benefited. Sources said that a
consumer can be a member of the mobile telephone family by
investing around 10,000 taka (about 250 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The companies that entered into the agreement are Grameen Phone
Consortium, Seba Telecom Ltd. and T.M. International.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: World Food Security Deserves Constant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 12 (Xinhua) -- State and government leaders from
all around the world will gather in Rome, Italy this week to
discuss the issues of world food security and the elimination of
hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Food security, as defined by the U.N. Food Agriculture
Organization (FAO), means that not only should there be a global
balance between food demand and supply but everyone in every
corner of the world should have an adequate access to food supply.
</P>
<P>
FAO held a World Food Conference in 1974 to discuss food
security at a time when mankind was experiencing a global food
crisis. Does that mean that a meeting at the highest level 22
years later also signals the coming of another food crisis?
</P>
<P>
This is not the case. Although some doomster scholars predict a
food crisis for the next century, most institutions, including
FAO, believe that the world as a whole will be able to feed itself
and a global food crisis will be unlikely for a considerably long
time.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO data, food production worldwide has increased
by 50 percent since the 1974 World Food Conference, outpacing the
40 percent growth of world population.
</P>
<P>
If converted into energy, the world food supply per capita per
day has risen from 2,440 calories in 1969-71 to 2,710 calories in
1990-92. With the exception of sub-Saharan Africa and the former
Soviet Union and East European countries, the energy intakes of
people in all other regions today are higher than 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
FAO forecast also indicates that by the year 2010, the world
population may increase to about seven billion, at an annual rate
of 1.3 percent. That means food supply per capita worldwide will
be slightly higher over the present level.
</P>
<P>
But that scenario cannot be taken for granted, for food
security is affected by many variables and there are already
signs of food insecurity that deserve serious concern.
</P>
<P>
First, world food production, including oilseeds, has been on
the decline for three years running, from 2,139 million tons in
1992 down to 2,007 million tons in 1995. While the 1995 output was
at the same level of 1985, world population in 1995 reached 5.7
billion, or 860 million more than 10 years ago. As a result, the
per capita food supply in 1995 was only 360 kilograms, which was
55 kilograms less than in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the world food stock has also been sliding for three
years, with the 266 million tons in 1996 being the lowest in
nearly 20 years. While the 1993 global food security co-efficient
- the percentage of the current year's stock in the total
consumption of the next year - was as high as 22 percent, that of
1996 has fallen to 14-15 percent, far below the 17-18 percent
safety line set by FAO.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, because of declining food production and stock, world
prices of main cereals began shooting up in August last year and
hit a record high in April and May this year.
</P>
<P>
These price hikes are undoubtedly a heavy blow to poor
developing countries, especially the low-income food-deficit
ones. Food imports alone would cost them an additional four
billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, hunger and malnutrition, which are results of food
insecurity, are still plaguing many developing countries. Despite
a global balance of food demand and supply, as many as more than
800 million people around the world are unable to obtain enough
food, of whom about 200 million are children under the age of
five. Most of the hungry are in the developing countries,
especially in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The world now produces enough food to feed everyone, but not
everyone has access to that food," FAO Director-General Jacques
Diouf said recently when pin-pointing the problems concerning
universal food security. Therefore, eradicating hunger and
malnutrition worldwide will remain a formidable challenge to
mankind.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, world population growth, though likely at a
leveling-off rate, will continue to exert tremendous pressure on
food security. The United Nations forecast indicates that over the
next three decades, food production will have to increase by 75
percent to keep up with an expected population of some nine
billion by then.
</P>
<P>
The list could be longer, but the above factors alone are
serious enough to be a major cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the forthcoming World Food Summit will enhance the
awareness of the leaders and the general public of all countries
in the world on the issue of food security and ensure that all of
them will incorporate the goal of food for all into their national
and international political agendas.

<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh Fail to Agree on Water-sharing </HEADLINE>

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Bangladesh were no
closer to an understanding on the contentious Ganges water-sharing
issue after bilateral talks held here on Monday, the Indian
Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held between visiting Bangladeshi Foreign
Minister Abdus Samad Azad and his Indian counterpart I.K. Gujral.
</P>
<P>
With the talks remaining inconclusive, the two sides decided on
a second round of talks on Wednesday when the complex issue will
be taken up in greater detail.
</P>
<P>
However, some progress has been made in the deliberations on
trade and other bilateral issues, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to speedily implement an agreement on
border trade signed in 1972 to facilitate cross-border commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
Another issue on which the two sides do not see eye to eye is
that of transit rights through Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
India has evinced its interest in obtaining transit facilities
in order to improve access to its north-eastern states. But Dhaka
sees a threat to its security in this demand.
</P>
<P>
Azad arrived here on Friday night for an official visit to
India.

VINA DEL MAR, CHILE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of 19
Latin American nations, and Spain and Portugal, today unanimously
criticized the United States Helms-Burton Law which tightens the
trade embargo on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In the Declaration of Vina del Mar, the final document at the
Sixth Ibero-American Summit, the leaders repudiated the law
because "it violates principles and norms of international law and
the charter of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. law also "contravenes the principles and norms of the
World Trade Organization and is contrary to the spirit of
cooperation and friendship that should characterize the relations
of all the members of the international community," said the
leaders, who signed the document before ending the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The document also tackled diverse issues including democracy
and human rights, sustainable development, the war against
poverty, illegal trafficking of drugs and related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The next Ibero-American summits will be held in Venezuela in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event was the first Ibero-American Summit attended
by all 23 heads of state from the 21 Spanish and
Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America, and Spain and

<HEADLINE> Germany to Slash Three Billion Marks Off Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- After more than four hours of
heated debate, the German cabinet last night approved a plan for
cutting expenditure by three billion marks put forward by Finance
Minister Theo Waigel .
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Germany's federal budget for 1998 would drop by
three billion marks, of which a billion marks would come out of
the Federal Labour office budget.
</P>
<P>
Waigel said before the cabinet meeting that if the plan was
approved, it would hold the level of new debt in 1998 to under
56.5 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
He came under attack after cabinet passed his plan on savings.
</P>
<P>
Labour Office head Bernhard Jagoda warned today that the plan
would hit job schemes and further lengthen dole queues.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to save money on job creation measures because that
will put more people out of work -- and they would have to receive
unemployment benefits," Jagoda told the Bild daily.
</P>
<P>
Jagoda said that next year's unemployment level would remain
the same as this year's, and the Labour Office's budget should not
be heavily reduced.
</P>
<P>
Germany's unemployment hit a seasonally adjusted four million
in October, the highest since the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Waigel's other cuts will come from Defense (200 million marks),
Transport (450 million), Economics (260 million ) and Research
(160 million), with smaller savings spread over other ministries.
(1.5 German marks = 1 U.S.dollar).

TOKYO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today named two prime ministerial aides to a newly

</P>
<P>
The news agency said the move signals Hashimoto's intention to

<TEXT>
<P>
But it warned that despite the general improvement in global
food supplies, several low-income food-deficit countries, most of
whom suffered civil conflicts, devastating floods and crop
failures, still face the problem of shortages.
</P>
<P>
FAO said cereal stocks for the 1996-97 crop year were expected
to increase by eight million tonnes, to 285 million
tonnes. However, the ratio of carryovers to expected consumption
in 1997-98 was estimated at 15.4 percent, which was still well
below the 17-18 percent considered by FAO as the minimum necessary
to maintain world food security.
</P>
<P>
The FAO's forecast for world cereal production in 1996 was
about 1.849 billion tonnes, 28 million tonnes up from the August
forecast, and seven percent above the revised estimate in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The expected wheat harvest was 581 million tonnes, an increase

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Fiscal Deficit Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's fiscal deficit
widened in the first six months of 1996, compared with the deficit
in the same period last year, according to the country's Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit during the first half of 1996 was 611.9
million US dollars while the figure for the same period last year
was 529.2 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The principal cause for this rise is attributed to the war and
the secondary cause to the drought which adversely affected the
domestic agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank also states in an "Economic Survey," that
there was a shortfall in revenue from import taxes and property
income.
</P>
<P>
In the plantation sector, there was an increase in production
by one percent and an increase by two percent in the rubber
sector. In the coconut sector, however, there was a decline by
three percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The worst-affected area was paddy production which experienced
a drop of 25 percent in production in the first six months this
year, the survey added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel is threatening that Germany will withdraw its support from
Bosnia unless the Moslem-Croat Federation speeds up progress in
setting up a workable federation.
</P>
<P>
Before the first anniversary of the foundation of the
Moslem-Croat Federation, Kinkel criticized all parties of Bosnia
for their slowness. In a letter published here today he said the
present achievement was far from the 1996 objective set in the
Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Bosnian Federation government to work extensively
and lay legal foundations for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The German minister believed that setting up a workable
federation was one of the important prerequisites for ensuring a
long-time implementation of the Dayton agreement, which was signed
on November 21, 1995, and which put an end to the 43-month war.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said Bonn would continue to provide support for the
setting up of the Moslem-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
But the cooperation of the Moslems and Croats was
"unsubstantive and will affect our support in some degree", he
said.

last year. Vietnam's annual rice export has averaged 1.6 million
tons since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will have more businesses joining in the export of rice
next year, with these businesses coming from all sectors of the
economy, provided that they are qualified by the standards of the

</P>
<P>
There are 17 state-owned enterprises licensed for rice
exportation at present, and about 70 percent of the rice exported
by those firms comes from private traders, who also cater for 80
percent of consumer needs. enditem

The world today has 800 million people suffering hunger and
malnutrition and 88 low-income food-deficit countries. At the same
time, commitments of external assistance to the agriculture of the
developing countries are declining: they dropped from 10 billion
dollars in 1982 to only 7.2 billion dollars in 1992. In addition,
the contradiction between population growth and reduced per capita
arable land has become increasingly acute.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, which was proposed by FAO Director-General
Jacques Diouf in 1994 and approved by the United Nations General
Assembly in 1995, heads of state and government are expected to
renew their commitment to the goal of food for all.
</P>
<P>
On October 31, the FAO Committee on World Food Security reached
consensus on two major documents: The Rome Declaration on
Universal Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of
Action. The documents will be adopted by the world leaders at
their opening session on November 13.
</P>
<P>
The documents set seven commitments laying the foundation for
food security at the individual, household, national, regional and
global levels with an immediate goal of reducing the number of
undernourished people to half the present level by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
Though the summit will not attempt to solve any specific
problems, it will enhance worldwide awareness of food security and
lay a foundation for the settlement of the problems in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Thai Gems, Jewelry Exports Up 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's export of gems and
jewelry maintained double-digit growth in the first eight months
of the year, according to the Department of Business Economics.
</P>
<P>
The exports totaled 36.49 billion baht (1.45 billion US
dollars) in value, 10 percent more than the 33.1 billion baht
(1.32 billion dollars) for the same period of last year, the
department was quoted today by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shipments in July and August grew more slowly than in the first
six months. This was particularly noticeable in diamond sub-sector
exports, where growth slowed from around 30 percent between
January and June to 21 percent by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local trade analysts had projected the value of
diamond exports would expand by at least 25 percent on that for
last year and bring in foreign exchange earnings of 22-25 billion
baht (880-1,000 million dollars). Now they say the final figure
may be 20.5-22 billion baht (820-880 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> 10th Asian-Pacific Water Conference Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The 10th Asian-Pacific Water
Conference opened here today with the presence of over 500
delegates and water supply experts from 37 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Titled as "Water Hong Kong '96", the conference focused on the
theme of "Meeting the challenge of the future and Asian
perspective."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, P. Giacasso, president of the
International Water Supply Association, said that the development
of cities with several million inhabitants has posed water
suppliers with enormous problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the main challenges that people face is to
secure water resources not only for the present day, but also for
the coming generations.
</P>
<P>
M.S. HU, director of Water Supplies in Hong Kong, said that
during the 1950s and 70s when Hong Kong experienced a rapid
population expansion and steady economic growth, water rationing
had to be imposed.
</P>
<P>
He said it was only until the early 1980s that Hong Kong was
able to get rid of the need to regularly restrict water supply to
its consumers.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's success in overcoming its long-standing
problem can be attributed to the steady and reliable supply of raw
water from Guangdong and the readiness in adopting the latest
experience and technology in the water supply industry.
</P>
<P>
He called for the training of more water professionals, both
technical and managerial, so as to help solve various problems
concerning water supply and water shortage.
</P>
<P>
About 90 thesis will be discussed at the biennial conference
involving water quality, water treatment technology, water supply
system and water supply management.
</P>
<P>
Along with the four-day conference, there is a large exhibition
on water supply system and water supply equipment opening to
communities.

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province shut down 295 polluting factories last month in an effort
to clean up the air and rivers in the region.
</P>
<P>
The closed firms were insufficient small and medium-sized
operations engaging in 15 polluting businesses including
paper-making, dyeing, leather or metal processing. They account
for 86 percent of the 343 polluters in the province.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily reported that the other 48 factories have
been ordered to stop operation in a given period of time.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 21 profit-making state-owned enterprises with
pollution problems were also required to improve their
environmental protection standards in a given short period of time.
</P>
<P>
About 900 million yuan (108 million US dollars) are needed to

<HEADLINE> Power Plant to Be Built through BOT Method in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's first power plant to
be built under BOT (build, operate and transfer) plan will rise in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "China Daily", the 600 million-U.S. dollar
Laibin B Power Plant will be capable of generating 700,000
kilowatts of electricity when it starts operation in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The consortium of Electricite de France and GEC Alsthom, which
chosen as cooperation partner by China, signed a draft franchise
contract last night with the autonomous regional government of
Guangxi. The arrangement should be submitted for approval from the
State Planning Commission and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"We are totally aware of the importance of Laibin B as China's
first BOT power plant and we will do our best in the coming 18
years to make it a demonstration power plant in China," the
newspaper quoted President Alphandery of Electricite de France as
saying.
</P>
<P>
One quarter of the installation's cost is to be provided by
shareholders and will be regarded as the registered capital of the
operating company. The remaining 75 percent will be raised through
limited resources project financing, which France's Banque
Indosuez, Britain's HSBC investment Bank and BZW Barclays have
offered to underwrite.
</P>
<P>
Export credit insurance offered by the French export credit
supplier Conface will cover 290 million U.S. dollars, 64 percent
of the required loans.
</P>
<P>
The term of the franchise is to be 18 years, after which
operation of the installation will be transferred without cost to
the government of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Project financing is scheduled to be completed six months from
now. Ground-breaking could begin as early as next May.
</P>
<P>
One of the installation's two 350,000-kw generating units is
scheduled to go on line in October 1999. By the end of the year
the power plant is expected to be ready for commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi plans to buy 3.5 billion kw/hour of electricity a year
from Laibin B.

<HEADLINE> Women Produce Half Food in the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- More than half the food grown
in the world is harvested by women, the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) says.
</P>
<P>
The FAO, in a document released here today, said women in rural
areas provide the largest amount of the labor required for
agriculture, from the preparation of the soil to the harvest.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Sahara Africa and the Caribbean, women produced up to 80
percent of food staples. In Asia, they accounted for between 50-90
percent of the labor force in the production of rice, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
In Latin America, domestic vegetable gardens cultivated by
women constituted a complex agricultural system, it said.
</P>
<P>
The FAO said the preparation of food was an additional burden
on women. Atop of tending crops and livestock in many countries,
they also had to collect firewood and carry water.
</P>
<P>
They were also expected to bear an increasingly heavier burden
as more and more men emigrated from rural areas to urban zones in
search of work.

<HEADLINE> Main Opposition Party Wins Lithuanian Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Lithuanian leader,
Vytautas Landsbergis, looks set to return to power today following
his party's second round win in the parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis' Homeland Union party won 35 seats of the 65 in
contention in the second round, held on Sunday. These are added to
the 35 already won in the first round on October 20, the Interfax
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
While they fall short of an overall majority in the 141-seat
parliament, the Homeland Union is committed to form a coalition
government with the Christian Democratic Party which scored 16
seats in the two rounds. This means a coalition with a
comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Democratic Labor Party, which swept Landsbergis out
of office in 1992, won only 12 seats in the two rounds, a sharp
drop from 72 seats in the former parliament.
</P>
<P>
Eleven other parties also entered the new parliament. Among
them, the Center Union won 13 seats and the Social Democrats,
seven.
</P>
<P>
The second round of the election works on a majority vote
system with 65 seats being contested.
</P>
<P>
Each seat is contested by the two candidates who garnered the
most votes in their electoral district in the first round, for a
total of 130 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis is expected to become chairman of the new
parliament, with an eye on the presidential election in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Arrest Anti-APEC Foreign Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
warned Monday that any foreigner who joins protest rallies during
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting this month
will be arrested and deported.
</P>
<P>
Jose Lopez, associate commissioner of the Immigration Bureau,
issued the warning after some foreigners attending anti-APEC
meetings here said they would join a mass anti-APEC march from
Manila to Subic, the venue for the APEC leadership meeting later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Lopez said these foreigners would be violating immigration laws
when they engage "in activities that tend to undermine national
security."
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely arrest and deport foreigners if we find
them participating in the so-called people's caravan to Subic," he
said. "They should never abuse our hospitality."
</P>
<P>
Lopez was referring to a 2,000 vehicle caravan to be organized
by the Bukluran ng Mangagawang Pilipina (BMP), a labor group, on
November 22.
</P>
<P>
Despite tight security measures being enforced by the
government, many unionists from Latin America, Europe, Australia,
Central and North America, Asia and Africa have arrived in the
country to attend anti-APEC meetings organized by the BMP and
other militant labor groups.
</P>
<P>
Last week, six South African unionists were denied visas by the
Philippine embassy and four Britons were arrested by intelligence
agents while attending a mass rally against the APEC in a central
Philippine town.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Immigration Bureau has already rejected the
entry of more than 100 East Timorese since last month and it has
drafted a list of 45 more potential foreign "troublemakers" who
will be barred from entering the country.

<P>
SANTIAGO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- In an attack on the United
States, Colombian President Ernesto Samper says "no one country
can reserve for itself the right to certify the conduct of
another."
</P>
<P>
Samper is in Chile for the two-day Ibero-American Summit, which
ends today.
</P>
<P>
"Each country has the right to write its own log and navigate
according to the map it chooses," said Samper in an interview
published today by "La Epoca", a Chilean publication.
</P>
<P>
The United States disapproved Colombia's war against drugs and
canceled the Colombian president's visa last July after the South
American country refused to extradite four drug traffickers to
U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
Samper described the sanctions imposed by the U.S. against
Colombia as "an attempt to isolate Colombia -- but it got
completely opposite results."
</P>
<P>
Colombia achieved solidarity from neighbors in the region, from
those of the Rio Group and from members of the Nonaligned Group of
which Colombia was the present president.
</P>
<P>
"My realistic aspiration is that our relations (with the United
States) will normalize," the president said
</P>
<P>
"We need to normalize the relations on the basis of two
ingredients, which are cooperation and mutual respect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Samper said following the re-election of U.S. President
Clinton, "At least there will be a lower level of tension between
the two countries; I believe ...that our relations can be
normalized."

<P>
SAN JOSE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Environment
Minister Rene Castro said today 86 percent of the country's
species in its tropical forests have yet to be identified.
</P>
<P>
He told a meeting of the Flora Committee of the International
Convention on Endangered Species (CITES) that Costa Rica was
making efforts to learn and use, in a rational way, its plant and
animal resources.
</P>
<P>
With only 14 percent of the country's tropical forest species
known, the minister said the country had an immense task to
classify and learn the interaction of its species with human
beings.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica possessed an enormous biodiversity which it was
trying to conserve through various measures on its land area of
50,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Experts warn that international trade in species of wild plants

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wants To Prolong Military Presence in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
exerting pressure on Panama to prolong its military presence in
the central American country after the year 2000, says a
Panamanian jurist.
</P>
<P>
Rolando Murgas Torraza, dean of the Law and Political Science
Faculty of the University of Panama, said: "We hope the Panamanian
government will take a firm stand to guarantee the disappearance
of foreign military bases in the country, for the sake of the
consolidation of our own national identity."
</P>
<P>
Under the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaty, the United States should
return the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government on December
31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has seven military bases and 7,500 troops
on the Panama Canal zone.
</P>
<P>
Murgas said U.S. planned to continue its military presence in
Panama after the year 2000 because it appointed John Dimitri
Negroponte as special representative in the country. He had wide
experience in covert activities in Honduras and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Murgas also said that areas where the military bases were
located would have a more fruitful economic future if the
U.S. troops left.
</P>
<P>
He denied claims that "the country would collapse if the
Americans withdraw their military sources". Panama's economic
potential would be greater without the military bases and the lack
of the U.S. military sources could be compensated for.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturers of health foods
have been urged to apply for a licence from the Ministry of Public
Health and to have their products tested by the National Food
Hygiene Inspection Institute within the year.
</P>
<P>
Unregistered products should not be sold as health foods
starting next year, and by March, the sale of unlicensed health
foods will be banned, according to Su Zhi, Division chief in
charge of food hygiene inspection under the Ministry of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, so-called health foods
include products that affect the functions of human organs but are
not targeted at special ailments.
</P>
<P>
"Yishoubao" brand tonic and 58 other similar foods including
two imported ones became the first State-licensed health food
products Monday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 59 kinds of products were selected from 100 kinds of
domestic and 18 kinds of imported products. All these licensed
products passed lab tests at the National food Hygiene Inspection
Institute, according to an official with the Ministry of Public
Health.
</P>
<P>
The action is a response to a ministerial regulation on the
management of health foods that took effect in June.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, the first of its kind in the country, is
designed to standardize industrial practices in the field and
upgrade the quality of health foods.
</P>
<P>
In line with the regulation, enterprises and foreign companies
wising to export such products to China will have to report to the
top health authority and receive inspections of their products.
</P>
<P>
The products must carry directions that describe their
functions and usages without any exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Ministry of Public Health indicates that
there are more than 3,000 enterprises producing these foods, and
that approximately 3,000 varieties of such foods are on sale
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health has designated 12 national health
food testing institutes to carry out lab tests.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a national quality inspection center for health
products has been established at the China Preventive Medicine
Association to provide guidance for enterprises and recommend good
products to consumers.

MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Yeltsin's recuperation after
his quintuple heart bypass operation is "proceeding ahead of

told a news briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said Yeltsin's condition was satisfactory. "His
stitches are healing well, his blood counts are very good and his
temperature is normal for the fourth day in a row."
</P>
<P>
The medical expert pointed out that the fact that Yeltsin
regained consciousness after two hours, and artificial respiration
was removed 14 to 15 hours after the operation, indicated he was
recovering faster than most bypass patients.
</P>
<P>
"Now he (Yeltsin) works two to three hours a day," Mironov
said. He added that Yeltsin could work at least eight to ten hours
a day after he completely recovered and such an active way of life
could last 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Mironov said that after recuperation there would be some limits
to be set on Yeltsin's diet, and Yeltsin should take special
respiratory training regularly.
</P>
<P>
Mironov revealed that the cost of this operation was between
25,000 to 50,000 U.S. dollars.

ZHENGZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan
Province has solved water shortages for three million people and
800,000 animals in its western mountainous areas over the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
The success is due to the completion of more than 6,000
drinking water projects, according to a provincial government
official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the mountainous areas in western Henan
have suffered from four years of droughts since 1990, one of the
worst periods in a century, causing the number of people without
drinking water to increase from 2.9 million to 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, when Premier Li Peng read a report on the situation,
he immediately telephoned the top leaders of Henan Province to get
them involved in the struggle against the disaster and to overcome
the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the State Council, China's highest governing body,
has allocated 200 million yuan, while local government has
provided more than 600 million yuan for building drinking water
facilities in water-deficient mountainous areas.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the leading
industrial and financial center inChina, will form 800
large enterprises in suburban areas over the next five years,
creating a new industrial force for the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Suburban
Industry, about 200 major and 600 middle-sized plants will be
built on the city's outskirts during the next five years,
including five conglomerates, each with yearly sales of five
billion yuan and pre-tax profits of 500 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 20 of the suburban enterprises will each have a
yearly sales of between two to three billion yuan, while
another 50 will have sales of more than 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a result of an overnight economic take-off in the city's
outskirts, the suburban enterprises expanded their share to one
third in the entire industrial force of the city.
</P>
<P>
But the suburbs have only 200 big and medium-sized plants,
lagging far behind the growth pace of the local industry as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Wenxuan, director of the Suburban Industry Bureau, said
that the marketing strategy of the suburban enterprises should be
further renovated and their technological progress should also be
accelerated.

<P>
XI'AN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- For 3,000 years Xifeng Liquor
produced in northwest China's Shaanxi Province has been a popular
tipple among discerning Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Now the alcoholic beverage has become one of China's best known
brands of liquor, and has found a growing market both at home and
abroad.

<P>
The Xifeng Liquor Distillery, the producer, is located in
Liulin Town, Fengxiang County, Northwest China's Shaanxi

Xifeng Liquor a year, as against just 300 tons in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The liquor, which has long been well received thanks to its
unique storage and distilling methods, was granted a gold medal at
the 1915 Panama International Fair, and was rated as one of the
most famous brands in the first national wine-assessment meeting
held in 1952.
</P>
<P>
The distillery was established in October 1956 under the care
of the late Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, and the factory's product
was then named "Golden Phoenix" Xifeng Liquor.
</P>
<P>
The factory has more than 3,000 employees, compared to only
100 when the factory opened in 1956.

<HEADLINE> US Federal Prosecutors Set to Crack Down on Freon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal prosecutors have
been set to crack down on smugglers of ozone-destroying
refrigerant, or Freon, which has become a new contraband running
second only to marijuana.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, they have been training hundreds of border
inspectors and prosecutors to crack down on thousands of tons of
Freon that enter the United States illegally each year, according
to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that Freon could bring serious damage to the
ozone layer which serves to veil the Earth from ultra-violet
radiation which is harmful to plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
In view of the reported worsening of ozone depletion in recent
years over both poles, more than 140 countries reached an
agreement nine years ago in Montreal, Canada, which, known as the
Montreal Protocol, is aimed to curb ozone-depleting gases.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal agreement lets developing countries continue
producing Freon 10 years longer than industrial ones, which had to
stop last year.
</P>
<P>
Since January this year, the United States has banned all
production and importation of Freon. But the continued demand for
it among American owners of more than 80 million old cars whose
air conditioners us it has sent black-market prices spiraling.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Montreal signatories are expected to meet
this month to decide how to stop the export from one country to
another.

NEW YORK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- New York stock indexes began
a second week climbing today as investors held in the belief that
consumer spending will be stronger for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 35.78 to 6,255.60,
topping Friday's record close and setting a new high for the

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.16 to a record 1,262.67,
reaching its first closing high since the 1,258.10 of October 15.
But the American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 0.66 to
579.73, closing well below its all-time high of 614.99 set last

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said that his independence
might be the main reason to trigger opposition from the United
States for his second term of office in the world body.

successful in my relationship with the principal actor" -- the
United States.

<P>
"It was a kind of incomprehension about the role of the U.N.
and its importance, not only for the community of nations, but
mainly for the U.S. itself," Boutros-Ghali said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N., after all, was created by the U.S., by President
Roosevelt, and has always served the interests of the U.S. -- the
Korean War, the Gulf War, decolonization, contacts with the Third
World -- in short, world leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is virtually alone in the 185-nation world
body to oppose Boutros-Ghali's bid for a second term in an openly
explained reason that the U.N. has not championed reform of it.
</P>
<P>
But Boutros-Ghali said that he was continuing to implement
major reforms of the world body. The departments and offices have
been restructured and the number has been cut from 20 to 12.
High-level posts in the Secretariat have been reduced from 48 to
37. The posts are now 40 percent less than 10 years ago, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that some 1,000 positions were phased out, or a
staff reduction of 20 percent since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali said that the new budget of the U.N. was 117
million U.S. dollars lower and would include additional cuts of
154 million dollars mandated by the General Assembly. "That's a
zero-growth budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Boutros-Ghali, the U.S. now owes 1.7 billion U.S.
dollars to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a U.S. senator criticized the U.S. government for
its opposition to Boutros-Ghali and said the position was
irrational and embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
Senator Paul Simon said the U.S. would be wrong if it vetoed
the secretary-general either because of domestic political reasons
or because he had on rare occasions shown independence from U.S.
wishes.

<HEADLINE> Some Economists See US Economy Accelerating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Some U.S. economists said
that the U.S. economy was accelerating in the fourth quarter and
the growth rate would be between 3 percent and 4 percent in the
quarter, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Their view is contrary to the view held by the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) and the majority of economists that the U.S. economy
is slowing down continuously at present.
</P>
<P>
The consensus estimate of 50 economists polled recently by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., for example, calls for
an annual growth rate of about 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
But some prominent economists, although small in numbers,
predict that the U.S. economy will increase faster because
personal income is growing, job security is coming back and the
downsizing of companies is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Chief economist at Morgan Stanley Stephen Roach predicted the
growth rate would be as high as 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
"A lot of weakness in the third quarter was transitory," he said.
For example, unusually wet weather in summer hit the construction
industry harder than in normal years.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that another reason for slower-than-usual
growth in the third quarter was the smaller government spending
because it was the end of the last fiscal year. The spending would
pick up speed in the present quarter.
</P>
<P>
They said that consumers in the U.S. would spend more liberally
at the end of this year because of wage gains over the inflation
rate this year, low unemployment, high confidence levels and an
unusually high savings rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economy increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in
the July-September quarter after a much quicker speed of 4.7
percent in the second quarter.

<HEADLINE> US Undecided on Troops Deployment in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States still has
not decided whether to commit its troops to an international force
in Zaire as the scope and mission of the deployment are not yet
clearly defined.
</P>
<P>
John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
agreed in a interview with CNN that the tragedy in eastern Zaire
is "very extensive," But he added, "Obviously, before you commit
troops, you have to understand very clearly what their tasks should
be, whether they are really the right solution."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said, "The
United States believes there will be a need for a humanitarian
force to go into Zaire, given the level of fighting. But you have
to consider the question before you send troops in."
</P>
<P>
Burns made his remarks aboard a U.S. Air Force jet carrying
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to an economic meeting in
Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. European command, based in Stuttgart, Germany, which
has geographic responsibility for most of Africa, is in charge of
doing the "prudent planning" and evaluation of a range of options
for such a mission, a U.S. military source said today.
</P>
<P>
And the Pentagon has been asked to come up with a plan by
Tuesday for possible options the United States might choose, a
State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops could be part of such international troops for
humanitarian intervention or the United States could limit its
role to providing supplies for the refugees or assisting in
delivering food and medicine to the area, U.S officials said.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the situation is being considered on an urgent
basis, with American diplomats in the area seeking to arrange a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 1 million refugees, mostly Rwandan Hutus
who fled the Rwandan Tutsi government to U.N. camps in eastern
Zaire. Recent fighting between Zairean troops and Zairean Tutsi
ethnics, who get military support from the Rwandan Tutsi
government, has forced hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee
the camps into forests and mountains without food or water.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said they strongly oppose any solution that
calls for resettlement of the refugees at the U.N. camps.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe it makes sense to force the refugees back
into the camps," Burns said. "We would like to see this crisis
lead to an avenue for them to return to their homes."

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Minister: Mideast Needs European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today the European role in the Middle East peace
should be activated in the coming period.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his talks with the European Troika delegation,
headed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, today centered on the
regional peace and the European role in the process.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Spring, Moussa said the
Europeans underline the necessity of putting into force the Oslo
accords and the parties' commitment to the principles agreed at
the Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Spring said that the European Union is interested in adding
momentum to the Middle East peace process and that the European
participation in peace efforts would be strong.
</P>
<P>
The Irish top diplomat reiterated that the European role does
not compete with the U.S. role but complements it, saying that the
EU is keen on playing a political role as strong as its economic
role in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the present situation regarding the stalled peace process,
Moussa said "we are frustrated and pessimistic."
</P>
<P>
But he expressed the wish that a solution could be found if the
Israeli government would return to the peace track and respect its
commitments on the West Bank city of Hebron and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Describing the peace process as "frozen on almost all tracks,"
the foreign minister admitted there is no comprehensive peace in
the region so far.
</P>
<P>
It is hopeful that more agreements would be signed and
implemented to boost confidence-building between the parties
concerned through the continuation of talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now engaged in talks with all parties that support the
peace process, including the U.S., the EU and other countries to
see what can be done if the situation remains as it is," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Middle East and North African economic
conference, which opens here tomorrow, provides an opportunity for
the normalization of relations with Israel, the foreign minister
said the conference is not geared for normalization.
</P>
<P>
"Normalization is difficult as Israel does not cooperate in the
peace process," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Troika delegation, which held talks with President Hosni
Mubarak and Moussa today, will also meet with the Israeli Foreign
Minister and the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher here
on the sidelines of the economic conference.
</P>
<P>
The Troika delegation also comprises the foreign ministers of
the Netherlands and Italy as well as the Vice Commissioner General
of the European Commission.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Restoration of Official Assistance Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese representative
Cui Ying today urged the international community to restore the
political momentum in favor of official development assistance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Second Committee (Economic and Financial) of the
U.N. General Assembly, Cui noted that the official development
assistance decreased to 0.27 percent of the GNP of the developed
countries in 1995, the lowest point in over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"This has naturally caused great concern on the part of the
developing countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Those developed countries with `aid fatigue' should realize
that official development assistance is not charity. It is an
indispensable complement to the effort made by developing
countries toward economic takeoff. Therefore, it is essentially a
form of investment for the future," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of shared responsibility and partnership, the
international community should seriously consider how to recover
the political momentum in favor of official development
assistance, she said.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that the developing countries with their limited
financial capability tend to suffer most from the negative effect
of the the financial market turbulences.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce systematic risk in international private
capital markets, especially portfolio markets, while the
investment flows are directed toward developing countries, she
suggested:
</P>
<P>
-- strengthening macroeconomic policy coordination, improving
budgetary and monetary policies and intensifying surveillance; and
</P>
<P>
-- giving due consideration to the special needs of developing
countries and supporting their efforts to attract foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
On the external debt issue, she said as many developing
countries are still faced with the difficulties caused by heavy
external debt burdens, it is imperative that further measures
aimed at a comprehensive, effective and durable solution of the
problem should be explored.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Palestinians Unconvinced to Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials said
today Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has failed to
convince Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
to conclude the negotiations on the Hebron issue.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Netanyahu telephoned Arafat in an effort to
move forward the negotiations on Israeli army's redeployment in
the West Bank town of Hebron, where 450 Jews live amid some
120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly assured Arafat of Israel's commitment to
implement the Oslo peace accord with the Palestinians, but
Palestinian officials said they consider this "a word commitment"
only.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's political adviser Ahmed Tibi said that the
Palestinians are demanding Netanyahu to set a timetable for
implementing the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
He added that he doubted that any breakthrough will be
achieved in the next few days before Netanyahu's scheduled
departure for the U.S. for talks with President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Nevah said that if
the Palestinians agree to Israel's demand regarding the security
arrangements in Hebron, the two sides could conclude the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Nevah said Israel has already committed to implementing the
rest of the Oslo peace accords, and there is no point for further
discussions on matters unrelated to Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
During their Sunday telephone conversation, Netanyahu stressed
that unless there were proper security safeguards for the Jewish
settlers in Hebron, there would be an explosion.
</P>
<P>
The telephone call was made following a meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu's advisers Dore Gold and Yitzhak Molcho on Saturday
night, Israel Radio reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat asked Netanyahu to personally
assure him that Israel remains committed to the Oslo peace
accords and will implement them fully.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also urged Arafat to conclude the redeployment
agreement, saying Arafat's "foot-dragging is enabling both
Israeli and Palestinian extremists to sabotage the entire
agreement."
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords, the Israeli army should have
completed its redeployment in Hebron by March 28. However, the
move was delayed following a series of suicide bombing attacks in
Israel in February and March and further delayed after former
prime minister Shimon Peres was defeated by Likud leader Binyamin
Netanyahu in the May general elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the Israelis and Palestinians started a
new round of talks on the Hebron issue in light of the violent
clashes between Israeli forces and the Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in September.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which were triggered off by Israel's opening of a
tunnel near the Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third largest shrine, in
Jerusalem's Old City, killed more than 70 people and wounded
hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
However, after four weeks of continuous talks, with the
participation of U.S. special coordinator Dennis Ross, the Israelis
and Palestinians failed to complete a deal on the Hebron
redeployment.

CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- For the first time, Israel, Jordan and the
Palestinian Authority (PA) will join force to promote tourism in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav is to appear together
with his Jordanian counterpart Salah Irsheidat and Bethlehem
Mayor Elias Freij, the tourism minister for the PA, at the World
Tourism Market (WTM), which is to open in London, Britain,
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The three are to hold a joint press conference there.
</P>
<P>
The WTM, which is among the most important of the tourism
fairs held throughout the world, is to have some 4,250
exhibitors with 680 stands, representing 150 countries. There
are to be some 200 exhibitors from Israel this year, compared
with 165 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- In what was called the biggest real estate deal in
1996, a complex bearing an incomplete skeleton at Ras Beirut,
Lebanon, has been sold recently for 53 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's Eco News business weekly reported today that the
6,297-square-meter seaside building, which was to be the
Sheraton Hotel, was bought by the International Gulf Company for
Hotels and Tourism in the United Arab Emirates from a group of
Lebanese and Syrian shareholders.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Livestock suffering from a disease called Brofila
was found aboard a ship at Beirut Port.
</P>
<P>
Three persons were detained on a charge of attempting to
import sick livestock, Beirut's Eco News business weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ship, originating in Turkey, had destined for Saudi
Arabia, but it headed for Beirut after the Saudi authorities
refused its entry.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Some 40 million U.S. dollars debts that Libya owed
Turkish contractors have remained unpaid despite a prior promise
for immediate repayment during the visit to Libya by Turkish
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted Chairman
of the Turkish Contractors' Association (TMB) Kadir Sever as
saying that he would submit a report to Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller on problems of the sector and
relations with Libya.
</P>
<P>
The chairman drew attention in his report to the point that
Libya had pledged during the Joint Economic Commission Protocol
in 1994 to have the debts repaid by March 31,1996, but no
developments to this end have been observed so far.
</P>
<P>
According to recent TMB figures, Turkish contractors, who are
members of both the TMB and the International Contractors'
Association, have been awarded a total of 441 contracts worth
more than 15.5 billion dollars in 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the projects were carried out in Libya and the total
value of the 227 projects in that country exceeded 8.6 billion
dollars, of which 6.8 billion dollars worth have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Libya's outstanding debts to Turkish contractors have been
estimated at 300 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan today reiterated that his government will
not let the Turkish Cypriots on the Cyprus island down, saying he
prefers "two states" on the island.
</P>
<P>
He remarks came as U.S. emissaries opened Cyprus contacts today
in Greece, a move considered to be a prelude to Washington's
anticipated new initiative for solving the Cyprus problem early
next year.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. delegation headed by Director of the State Department
Office of southern European Affairs, Carey Cavanaugh, currently in
Athens for talks, is due in Cyprus on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another team of U.S. high-ranking officials from the State
Department, the National Security Council and the Defense
Department is also expected to visit Cyprus later this week.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was quoted by Anatolia News Agency as saying he prefers
the "peaceful coexistence" of "two states" on the island.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey was determined to do whatever it could to
help northern Cyprus overcome its economic problems and attain a
growth rate greater than the current 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the new U.S. initiative aims to defuse tensions
between Greece and Turkey, particularly those related to the
continental shelf territory, air space and the natural resources
of the Aegean, and concentrate on confidence-building measures on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
to take control of one third of the island's territory following a
coup by Greek Cypriots supporting union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which
was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. blames the Turkish side for the deadlock in the
U.N.-sponsored peace talks for the reunification of the island.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 35,000 Turkish troops and more than 50,000
mainland settlers occupy northern Cyprus while 200,000 Greek
Cypriot refugees are now in the south.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeeping Force Likely to Remain in Bosnia: Rifkind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind said here today that a NATO-led peacekeeping force
was likely to remain in Bosnia next year when the mandate of the
current Implementation Force (IFOR) expires in December.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing on a London international
conference on Bosnia due to be held on December 4-5, Rifkind said,
"I believe it is likely that there will be a continuation force,
that there will be seen to be a need for some on-going
international military presence."
</P>
<P>
"The follow-up force will still be significant but I hope we
will see a phased reduction leading to a total military
withdrawal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that "there should be a clear exit
strategy in a finite period of time because we're now coming
towards the latter phase of the international military presence."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that NATO military chiefs would like to see the
60,000-strong Implementation Force reduced by about half and a
rapid reaction force was to be stationed outside Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary said that about 50 foreign ministers and
representatives from some international organizations would attend
the two-day conference to discuss reconstruction of the Bosnian
economy, creation of Bosnian police forces, return of refugees and
other urgent matters.
