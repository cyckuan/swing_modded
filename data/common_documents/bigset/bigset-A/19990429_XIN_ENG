<HEADLINE> Sao Tome Puzzled Over Belgian Mandate of Capture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Sao Tome and Principe said
Wednesday that it was puzzled by the order for worldwide arrest
issued by the Belgian government to capture the former governor of
the Sao Tome Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan News Agency ANGOP reported that Sao Tome confirmed
Belgium's move but its Chief Justice Paulo Jorge noted that the
case of the financial scandal with the involvement of former
governor Carlos Queresma should be tried in his own country.
</P>
<P>
The chief justice said the case is under investigation and the
governor was dismissed in this March for his involvement in the
alleged financial scandal.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the reports which says "Queresma is now at large",
adding that the governor is now detained.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the Belgian government may take some
measures to prevent the suspect from fleeing if it agrees to
cooperate with the Sao Tome authorities.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the Belgian police arrested three foreign
 nationals hot handed in illegal financial trading, recovering
five-million- U.S. dollar treasury bills issued by Sao Tome and
Principe.
</P>
<P>
Queresma said that he had issued the bills to the three foreign
 nationals (one American, one French and the other Belgian) only
to collect the much-needed foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that President Miguel Trovoada and two prime
ministers, Armindo Vaz Dalmeida and Raul Braganca Neto knew about
the matter. But all of them denied.
</P>
<P>
The tiny Atlantic island country has only a total of 15 million
dollars in its foreign exchange reserve.

<HEADLINE> Lebed Stresses Role of Russia in Ending Yugoslav Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The governor of Russia's
Krasnoyarsk region, Alexander Lebed, said here on Wednesday that
Russia is the only country which can help the United States save
its face in the Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
``Russia can play a decisive role, all the world has known
it,'' said Lebed after having a meeting with former French
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua.
</P>
<P>
He said that the visits to Moscow by U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State Strobe Talbott, the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
and several other Western personalities for the Yugoslav crisis
showed that Russia has returned to the international scenery.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, who is former Russian presidential security advisor and
an army hero in the Afghanistan War, said that the NATO bombings of
Yugoslavia ``have yielded nothing and will yield nothing,'' while
the Serbs have won ``a moral victory.''
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia will not send arms to Yugoslavia, but will
not follow the Western oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
Lebed and Pasqua also issued a communique calling for ``a
common step'' by the French and Russian governments to let the
United Nations Security Council play a major role in solving the
Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Pasqua, who will lead a separate list of candidates from the
Gaullist Rally for the Republic party in the European elections to
be held in June, is one of the few French political personalities
who oppose the NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> EU Trys to Tackle Barriers to European Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
executive body said here Wednesday that it has approved a
framework for the next phase of its market access strategy in a
bid to secure better access to world markets for European
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said that it is now focusing its
efforts on a targeted program of barriers removal. "This will mean
concentrating on a limited number of economically important
priority cases where the European Union can expect to achieve
concrete results in the near future," it said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of a set of key economic and legal criteria, the
EU branch said it will now draw up a target list of key barriers
to be tackled through the World Trade Organization (WTO), bilateral
action and the development of market access packages with non-WTO
countries.
</P>
<P>
EU trade commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said in a statement that
the EU had made a highly encouraging start with the market access
strategy but the bloc "can and must do more".
</P>
<P>
"It is now time to move to the next phase. I believe that by
concentrating our efforts, we can make a major step towards
tackling the more important specific barriers to our export
markets. This will also make an important positive contribution to
further market-opening negotiations in the forthcoming Millennium
Round of trade talks in the WTO," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Millennium Round of WTO's multilateral trade
talks will start at the ministerial level to be held in Seattle,
the United States, in November this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the commission, the EU has so far been able to
solve or make significant progress on nearly 250 individual trade
cases, using the full range of bilateral and multilateral
instruments at its disposal. Since 1996, the EU's executive body
has launched 41 dispute settlement consultations while requesting
11 panels in the WTO, and has participated in a further 39
consultations and panels launch by other WTO members.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Wednesday spoke to the Greek and Canadian
foreign ministers on the Kosovo crisis in advance of their trips
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that the United
States remains pessimistic that Belgrade is about to agree to NATO
conditions for an end to its bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Rubin told a briefing that the U.S. does not believe "there has
been sufficient movement in the position of Belgrade on the key
points to justify any overwhelming optimism or any optimism at
all."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Albright also spoke to Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott, who had talks in Moscow earlier in the week
and is now in Germany for Kosovo consultations.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou and Canadian Foreign
Minister Lloyd Axworthy are expected to visit Moscow, hoping that
Russia might persuade Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
accept NATO's conditions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Albright also spoke to Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott, who had talks in Moscow earlier in the week
and is now in Germany for Kosovo consultations.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Talbott and the Russians discussed details of how to
implement an agreement once Belgrade accepts NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
NATO has demanded the Serbian withdrawal from Kosovo and
agreement to let ethnic Albanian refugees go home.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Denies Killing Congolese Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army has rejected
reports by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that its
soldiers killed six Congolese rebels and 11 Ugandans in Kisangani,
north of DRC, in a protest against their presence in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
''This is false, it's a mere fabrication whose purpose is
obvious,'' Rwandan army spokesman Emanuel Ndahiro told Rwanda News
Agency, calling it a propaganda war by the Laurent Kabila regime.
</P>
<P>
Leon Kasonga, the DRC army spokesman, had said on state
television in Kinshasa that Rwandan troops opened fire on 400
disarmed Congolese rebels who had staged a protest march in Camp
Ketele, but did not say when the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
''We are not aware of any incident of that kind,'' Ndahiro
said, adding the Rwandans are in good terms with the rebels they
are backing.
</P>
<P>
Jean Pierre Ondekane, commander of the rebel Congolese Rally
for Democracy, also refuted the report by the government official.
</P>
<P>
''Rwandan soldiers are with us since the beginning of the
rebellion, they are helping us and we fully collaborate,''
Ondekane told the news agency on a satellite phone from Bendera
town, in Katanga province.
</P>
<P>
However, well-informed sources in Kisangani gave another
version of the alleged protest. It is said that the protest
actually took place and was directed against the Ugandan People
Defense Force (UPDF) army chief of staff, Brigadier James Kazini,
who had arrested one RCD commander in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
''The Congolese rebels appealed for the release of their
commander and used the local radio to call upon residents to
protest against the UPDF senior commanders who have messed up
themselves with the Congolese,'' the same sources said.

<TEXT>
<P>
A press release issued by the central bank said Wednesday that
those village banks are not banks and therefore their existence is
a breach of law.
</P>
<P>
Those organizations have never been authorized to do banking
business in Uganda, the press release added, explaining that the
word "bank" can only be used by a bank and the authority to use
the word can only be sought and granted by the Ministry of
Finance.
</P>
<P>
The central bank warned villagers and enterprises not to
deposit their money in these so called banks because they are
illegal.
</P>
<P>
Since these village organizations are not financial
institutions approved by the Ministry of Finance, the bank will
not be responsible for the activities of these village banks.
</P>
<P>
The village banks, which do not have qualifications required of
banks, offer extraordinary high interest rates to attract
depositors.

ADDIS ABABA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Vice-Minister of
Trade Vladimir Pakhomov said Wednesday that Russia and Ethiopia
are preparing to establish a joint inter-governmental commission
soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the remarks were made
by visiting Russian vice-minister when meeting Ethiopian Minister
of Trade and Industry Kassahun Ayele here.
</P>
<P>
Pakhomov, who is leading a Russian delegation to pay a five-day
visit to Ethiopia, said Russia wants to cooperate with Ethiopia in
the areas of trade, investment, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He said a meeting on the establishment of the joint commission
will be held in Moscow, Russia in August this year, adding that
"the establishment of the joint commission will further
consolidate the existing mutual cooperation between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Minister Kassahun said the current visit by the Russian
delegation " proves to be landmark in strengthening the trade and
economic relationship between Ethiopia and Russia".
</P>
<P>
He underlined the need to establish cooperation between the
Ethiopian and Russian chambers of commerce to strengthen relations
among the business communities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Other Side of Africa's Negative Image is </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOUSTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- American conceptions of Africa are
frequently formed through the prism of television news cameras,
which by nature are mostly drawn to human tragedy, including armed
conflicts and civil strife.
</P>
<P>
But while the camera doesn't lie, its lens captures a
relatively narrow field, often missing a quite different dimension
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The five-day "Attracting Capital to Africa Summit," which
concluded here on Wednesday, is aimed at an improved image that
Americans have of Africa as well as more trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
A broader view reveals a continent where some countries, such
as Botswana, Gabon, Ghana, Mauritius and Namibia, are success
stories in promoting economic growth and political stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Africa is a continent with vast natural and human resources. If
Africa's 700 million people share anything, it's a strong desire
to leverage that natural abundance into infrastructure and
enterprises that generate wealth and sustained prosperity.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill its economic promises, however, emerging Africa
clearly requires much greater investment, in particular by the
U.S. businesses. Equally important that is a U.S. government that
backs its words with deeds, and truly committed to what President
Bill Clinton recently called "a new era of partnership."
</P>
<P>
The five-day gathering follows on the heals of the U.S.-Africa
Ministerial Meetings held in Washington last month. Both events
are seen here as an integral part of the effort by the Clinton
administration to redefine the U.S.-African relationship.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Slater, secretary of transportation, William Richardson,
secretary of energy, and William Daley, secretary of commerce, and
several cabinet members of the U.S. Government, who were present
at the meeting, all acknowledged that the growth of U.S. trade and
investment in Africa is also beneficial to the United States, such
creating much more job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In attendance too were executives from some of America's
largest corporations. Some two dozens of practical workshops were
held to deal with the complexities of African-American trade.
</P>
<P>
Most important is the private time between leaders from the two
sides of the Atlantic. Frank and open dialogue is the best way to
start cutting through the tangle of regulations currently limiting
trade and boosting the confidence of potential investors.
</P>
<P>
There are concrete reasons for renewed confidence. While
economic growth in many African nations was measured inactive
numbers only a decade ago -- and in general remain much too low --
several countries now sport growth rates in excess of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, not all Americans have been aware the fact that
assisting Africa would be a beneficial piece of U.S. foreign
policy. For instance, the U.S. Congress is considering a measure
called the African Growth and Opportunity Act. It eliminates many
barriers to free trade with Africa and contains features that will
simulate African economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has spoken in favor of the bill, but
the Congress is not likely to pass it very soon. Its passage
apparently faces one peculiar problem. Since the United States
hasn't passed significant trade legislation in five years, there's
a pent-up inclination to attach other trade measures to the
African bill. Some of these issues will generate heavy opposition,
the attachments threaten to drag down a worthwhile piece of
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Congress should pass the Growth and Opportunity Act, taken
the quick trade victory and deal with other issues later. This
would send a strong signal to Africa, indicating that America now
realizes there is more to the continent than what they see through
the lens of a television news camera.

BRUSSELS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The NATO Secretary-General,
Javier Solana, said here Wednesday that the western alliance had
set out a perspective as to how NATO and the European Union (EU)
can work together to build the European Security and Defence
Identity of the future in a Trans-Atlantic context and in a way
which will involve all allies.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief told reporters that the alliance in Washington
set its vision of "a South-East Europe that would be at peace,
stable, prosperous and increasingly integrated into the European
mainstream".
</P>
<P>
"We will work hand in hand with the other institutions to
achieve this vision. But NATO will have an important role to
play," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
He said NATO welcomed the proposal of the European Union to
convene a conference on a stability pact for South-Eastern Europe
on May 27. "EU foreign ministers have also agree to consider ways
of strengthening their relations with Albania and the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO Chief also said the new strategic concept the allies
proposed during the Washington summit last week would give NATO
the ability to shape the international security agenda.
</P>
<P>
During his first briefing at NATO headquarters after the
Washington summit, Solana also said the NATO needs to look ahead
to the process of reconstruction of Yugoslavia "that must follow
the end of Kosovo crisis".
</P>
<P>
"The G7 and financial institutions like the World Bank and the
IMF stand ready to offer their financial help and practical advice
to the countries of the region," he added.

<HEADLINE> France: Purging of Draskovic Confirms Existence of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28(Xinhua) -- France said on Wednesday that the
purging of Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic seems to
confirm the existence of an opposition to the policy of President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
``We could ask if the declarations of Draskovic were made in
his personal name or if they engaged the authorities of Belgrade.
His purging brings the answer,'' said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the purging of Draskovic also seems
to confirm that an opposition to the ``disastrous'' policy of
Milosevic is coming to the surface and that the ``signs of split
are appearing'' in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Draskovic was sacked on Wednesday by Yugoslav Prime Minister
Momir Bulatovic for having expressed views ``contradicting the
positions of the government.''
</P>
<P>
A former opposer of Milosevic, Draskovic is the leader of the
rightwing Renewal of Serbia party.
</P>
<P>
While criticizing Milosevic for not telling the truth about the
massive exodus of Kosovars to the Yugoslav people, Draskovic has
called for a compromise with NATO and allowing an international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Annan: Security Council Permanent Members Must Forge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 28 (Xinhua)--A political resolution to the Kosovo
crisis will be possible only if the five permanent members of the
United Nations are in a unity, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan
said Wednesday in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing after his meeting with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Annan said: "It is only when the
Council comes together and the whole world cooperates on this
issue that we are likely to make progress."
</P>
<P>
Among the five permanent members in the Security Council,
Russia and China are strongly against the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia, while United States, Britain and France have launched
the air campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Annan and Schroeder agreed that the long and complex process to
solve the crisis just began, and there would be no swift success.
</P>
<P>
" We are at the early stage yet and I'd not want anyone to have
unrealistic expectations of immediate success," Annan said, adding
that the mediation would be "long, complex, and drawn out".
</P>
<P>
Annan praised Russia's role in seeking to resolve the crisis
with saying it was "constructive and useful". He is due to visit
Russia later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian mediator Viktor Chernomyrdin will arrive in Bonn on
Thursday for talks on Kosovo crisis, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
There were three candidates for the post of United Nations
Kosovo envoy, though it remained unclear whether all of them were
available, Annan told the press.
</P>
<P>
The three are former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky,
former Swedish Prime Minister karl Bildt and acting Swiss Foreign
Minister Flavio Cotti.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would soon recommend one of them to the U.N.
Security Council, and he was considering the Slovak Foreign
Minister Eduard Kukan as deputy envoy.

stressed.
</P>
<P>
"If it (the bombing attack) had been launched by a poor
country, such action would surely entail cut on aid and would be
openly denounced by the West," the statement said.

The Mozambican media offered comprehensive coverage of the NATO
bombing on Yugoslavia, but there had been few comments.

<HEADLINE> France Supports Saudi Bids for WTO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- France Wednesday promised
to support Saudi Arabia in its bid to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), according to Saudi Press Agency monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by visiting French Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs Jacques Bondoux in his meeting with Saudi
Crown Prince and Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and the WTO have conducted, during the past
four years, five rounds of negotiations on Riyadh's accession
to the organization. The WTO has been requiring Saudi Arabia
to be flexible in its trade policies to ensure conformation
with the terms of membership.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Bondoux also conveyed Prince Abdullah a
message from French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who expressed
Paris' position on ways of cementing bilateral ties,
international developments of common concern and the on-going
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>

<P>
BEIRUT, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prince Ali Bin Hussein,
held talks with Lebanese leaders Wednesday on bilateral ties and
regional affairs.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud, Prince
Ali told reporters that his visit to Lebanon aimed at seeking ways
to boost ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He added he had delivered a formal visit invitation message
to Lahoud from King Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between Lebanon and Jordan are very good. We are
looking to developing it," the Prince said.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ali, who came to Beirut Tuesday night to inaugurate a
Jordan exhibition there, was the first member of the royal
Heshemite family to come to Lebanon in the last 24 years.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has maintained lukewarm relations with Jordan, whose
1994 peace treaty with Israel was opposed by Beirut and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
But Syrian President Hefez Assad's February visit to Jordan to
extend his condolence for the late King Hussein and new King
Abdullah's return visit last week appear to have ushered in a new
era of inter-Arab relations.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Honored for Primary Education Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been honored for its
achievements in primary education since the introduction of the
Universal Primary Education (UPE) two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Education Now Pencil award, first of its kind, has been
bestowed on Uganda by the World Bank and Oxfam, a British
non-governmental organization, in Washington, the United States, a
press release from the President's Office said Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies paid tribute to Uganda for having raised
primary school enrolment from 54 percent to more than 90 percent
of all primary school- going age within just two years.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has now become a case study of an effective national
commitment to education, Oxfam President Raymond Offenheiser was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
By setting up the Poverty Action Fund, Uganda has used the
additional resources made available through debt relief to invest
in its own people and pay for the fund, thus demonstrating that a
nation can use debt relief to improve its education system.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the award on behalf of Uganda, Ugandan First Lady
Janet Museveni referred to universal primary education as the most
important legacy any government in the developing world can leave
in place.
</P>
<P>
Education is a powerful weapon of liberation because it gives
people a voice and enables them to improve their lives, she added.
</P>
<P>
The Education Now Pencil is part of Oxfam's campaign to support
efforts to see that every school-aged child in the world goes to
primary school.
</P>
<P>
The campaign promotes the idea of using debt relief to mobilize
 resources to expand education.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Import Maize to Ease Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
has entered into contracts with four companies to import 100,000
tons of maize at a cost of 15.6 million U.S. dollars to alleviate
the shortage of food in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ismail
Ivwata, told reporters in here Wednesday that the move came after
an appeal made by the Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye to import
200,000 tons of emergency food.
</P>
<P>
More than one million people across the country have been
plagued by a crop failure due to a drought starting last October,
while the government's own grain reserves have been virtually
depleted.
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts, each of the companies would import 25,000
tons of maize, with each ton valued at between 135 U.S. dollars
and 176.5 U.S. dollars, Ivwata said.
</P>
<P>
He named the contracted companies as EECO Traders of Britain,
Andrea &AMP; CIE SA, Mbutano Investment Company, and Sky Coach
Services Limited.
</P>
<P>
The deputy agriculture minister said that food situation in
several regions especially Dodoma and Tabora and some districts in
Morogoro, Mbeya, Arusha, Iringa, Coast and Kilimanjaro regions is
still a problem of concern.
</P>
<P>
According to assessment made by the ministry, the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP),
Tanzania is short of 600,000 tons of food in the first half of
this year.

PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Russian Communist
Party Gennady Zyuganov said on Wednesday that the long-term
strategy of the United States is to divide Europe.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press when attending a conference of the
Council of Europe in Strasbourg, eastern France, Zyuganov also
condemned the NATO bombings of Yugoslavia, describing them as
``acts of immoral barbarity.''
</P>
<P>
``There is not any difference of mentality between the American
youths who shot their classmates in a school in Colorado and the
pilots who bomb the targets in Yugoslavia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a shooting rampage which took place in a
high school near Denver, the United States, last week.
</P>
<P>
``It is not in the interests of the United States that Europe
be united, that the Council of Europe represent the human rights
and that euro exist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that there will be no winner in the war against
Yugoslavia, and that Europe is faced with the problem of ethnic
Albanian refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
``The Danube river is paralyzed, the refugees will be dispersed
in the cities and countries of Europe, and that will only provoke
a rising of terrorism,'' he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis reiterated here Wednesday that Greece would not
participate in any NATO military operations against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ruling Panhellenci Socialist Movement's
parliamentary group, Simitis warned that the dramatic development
in Yugoslavia had influence on the entire Balkan region and
constituted a potential threat to both the Balkans and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Greece's policy towards the crisis in Yugoslavia was based on
the need of a political solution the humanitarian problems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece is pursuing these objectives with
intense diplomatic activities at all levels in cooperation with
other European countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the refugee problem resulting from NATO's airstrikes on
Yugoslavia, the prime Minister said that only all the relevant
countries make joint efforts could the refugees stay as near as
possible from their homes, and return home eventually.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's weekend summit in Washington, Simitis said NATO's new
role of "crisis handling" raised the question of the legal basis
for any intervention.
</P>

He added that everyone agreed the legal basis must be the rules
of international law and the U.N. Charter.

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
does not support a mission to Yugoslavia by civil rights leader
Rev. Jesse Jackson, who wants to secure the release of three
captured American soldiers, the White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We don't support this mission," said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Jackson and a delegation of Christian, Moslem and Jewish
leaders are travelling to Yugoslavia on Wednesday in hopes of
securing the release of three captured American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a pilgrimage of faith, not of politics," Jackson said
on Tuesday. "We go to Belgrade as religious leaders who are
concerned about all who suffer in that region."
</P>
<P>
Jackson expected to visit the three U.S. Army soldiers taken
prisoner last month on the Macedonian border "and to share our
prayers for their safety and swift release."
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he has a written promise from Yugoslavia's U.N.
mission that he will be given an opportunity to meet the captives,
to deliver tape-recorded messages from their families and to
present each of the three men with a Bible signed by the religious
leaders travelling with the delegation.

WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A landing gear problem is
being blamed for the latest crash of an F-16 jet fighter at Luke
Air Force Base in Arizona State of the United States, U.S. Air
Force officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 20-million-U.S.-dollar fighter crashed Monday while on a
training mission, the sixth such crash in six months. Both pilots
of the jet fighter ejected safely.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force grounded about 200 F-16s and ordered
inspections for about 100 equipped with similar landing gear.
</P>
<P>
It's the second grounding and mass inspection this month. After
a crash on March 26, inspectors found hairline cracks in the
engines of 18 of the 190 F-16s at Luke equipped with Pratt &AMP;
Whitney 220 engines.
</P>
<P>
The plane involved in the latest crash had passed the engine
inspection. Four of five crashes have been linked to engine
trouble.
</P>
<P>
Luke is the premier training ground for F-16 pilots in the
United States.

PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Director General of the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural organization
(UNESCO), Federico Mayor, Wednesday criticized the NATO bombing of
one of Yugoslavia's official television stations.
</P>
<P>
``Once more, we have seen that the media, official or
independent, are paying a heavy price to the war,'' said Mayor in
a communique.
</P>
<P>
``The freedom of expression and the pluralism of the media are
the fundamental objectives of UNESCO, whose constitutional act
guarantees the free circulation of ideas, by word and by image,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that whatever the political situation it is in a state,
nothing could justify the attacks or destructions of the buildings
housing the media.
</P>
<P>
``The media should not be considered as military targets...
Journalists who accomplish dangerous professional missions in the
zones of armed conflict are considered as civilians protected by
the Geneva Convention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO destroyed a great part of the building housing the
official Serb television station in Belgrade last week, killing at
least 10 people working in the building.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A two-day relief campaign
launched by Kuwait Television Station (KTV) Monday raised over 13
million U.S. dollars for the Kosovo refugees, official Kuwait
News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, titled "the International Solidarity Day with
the Kosovo People", was previously planned for one day and had to
be extended for anther day as the turnout for the humanitarian
activity was much higher than anticipated, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Mohsen Al-Bnai, who is in charge of the KTV educational
programs, said that during the working hours on the first day of
the campaign, up to 7 million dollars were collected.
</P>
<P>
Many people rushed to the headquarters of the Information
Ministry for donation, Al-Bnai said.
</P>
<P>
Some Kuwaiti women even donated their personal jewelry and sale
of land lots in Lebanon, he said.
</P>
<P>
A woman, who contacted the KTV from Qatar, offered to construct
72 residential units for the Kosovo refugees taking shelter in
Macedonia, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti officials said some of the collected money would be
used in setting up housing units for the refugees, while the rest
would be used for buying needed relief materials or forwarded
directly to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah has ordered another plane
for transferring relief aid donated by the society and the Kuwaiti
people.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Kuwait had already airlifted several batches
of relief supplies to the refugee-stricken countries in the Balkan
region. Kuwaiti volunteers helped distribute the supplies there.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, Emir Jaber, on behalf of the royal family, donated
1 million dollars for the Kosovo people.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kosovars have fled their homes to
neighboring countries since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) launched intensive air strikes against Yugoslavia on

<HEADLINE> Final Decision on Statehood Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official said a
statement on Palestinian statehood can be finalized at the
Wednesday evening meeting of the Palestinian Central Council
(PCC).
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Palestinian National Authority Ahmed
Abdurrahman told Xinhua that a committee was formed to phrase out
a final statement that is still under general debate.
</P>
<P>
The 124-member Palestinian Central Council is an intermediary
body between the ruling Palestine Liberation Organization
Executive Committee and Palestinian National Council.
</P>
<P>
The PCC, which is to make a final decision on whether to
declare an independent state on May 4 when the five-year interim
self-rule period under the 1993 Oslo Accord expires, wound up its
third session of debate Wednesday afternoon without any decision.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat repeatedly hinted declaration
of a state on May 4 and traversed the globe to rally support for
the move.
</P>
<P>
But some countries suggested that the Palestinian side postpone
statehood proclamation to avoid complicating the already fragile
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to
take tough actions against the possible Palestinian step,
including annexing parts of the West Bank that are still under
Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Palestinian Democratic Front Kassi Abdul-Karim
said a decision should be unanimously adopted due to its
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that there are three options in this respect.
</P>
<P>
First, the session of the council can last till early June so
that a final decision can be taken in the light of the results of
the coming Israeli general elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the PCC starts to work out the phraseology of
the Palestinian constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
Second, the PCC can set a deadline for the declaration of an
independent state according to the developments of the situation
or mandate the PLO Executive Committee to do so.
</P>
<P>
Third, the PCC sticks to May 4, the date previously slated for
statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
All the participants were unanimous on the necessity of ending
the interim stage on May 4, according to Kassi.
</P>
<P>
The PCC will meet again this evening to make a final decision.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Says Ethiopia Launches Air Raid on It </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Ethiopian Antonov planes
escorted by fighter jets bombed nomadic grazing areas along the
Binbina-Kuluk Road in western Eritrea at 11:00 a.m. Wednesday, the
Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
The release reaching here Wednesday afternoon said that there
were no casualties although several cattle were killed in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The air strike today was deliberately timed to coincide with
the visit of U.N. Special Envoy, Ambassador Mohamed Sahnoun, to
the region," it charged.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun is currently touring the Horn of Africa, aiming at
ending the 11- month conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The release said Ethiopia launched the attack because of its
anxiety over the efforts of the international community which will
create an environment for lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no comment from the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson
Selome Taddesse said in a statement that Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi reiterated Ethiopia's position on the withdrawal of
the Eritrean troops.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea needs to officially declare that it will withdraw its
troops from "all Ethiopian land and agree to set a short time
frame for the withdrawal," Meles said when meeting with Sahnoun in
Addis Ababa Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank to Meet U.N. on Financial Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) --Bretton Woods leaders will
meet with the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to discuss
the recovery of emerging market countries hit hard by financial
contagion, and possible adjustments in global structures
monitoring finance flows and providing liquidity in emergency
situations.
</P>
<P>
ECOSOC President Paolo Fulci and U.N. Under-Secretary-General
for Social and Economic Affairs Nitin Desai announced at a press
briefing Wednesday that leaders of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and World Bank will gather here with ECOSOC officials
Thursday for the second time in a year.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, World Bank President
James Wolfensohn, Development Committee Chairman Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda and Interim Development Committee Chairman Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi are among the panelists who will speak on behalf
of the Bretton Woods institutions.
</P>
<P>
They will travel to New York at the end of the annual meeting
of World Bank and IMF Interim and Development Committee in
Washington April 27-28.
</P>
<P>
It was said that there would be no agenda for the informal
meeting, but a document prepared by the U.N. Secretariat in 1994
suggests some likely areas of discussion.
</P>
<P>
The document covers how to promote economic recovery in
developing and transition countries, reform of international
financial architecture and increasing long-term finance flows for
development.
</P>
<P>
Debt relief for poor countries, relations between a possible
World Bank "Comprehensive Development Framework" and the U.N.'s
"Development Assistance Framework" as well as role of Bretton
Woods in the planned-for conference on "finances for development"
will probably also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
The first such meeting took place in New York a year ago, which
was considered important and useful by U.N. member states and
welcomed by the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Assembly invited the Secretary-General to
further support the Council in the organization of the high level
dialogue with the Bretton Woods institutions in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Since then consultation between the three multilateral
institutions has intensified, spurred by the unexpected length and
severity of global financials instability and its unexpectedly
harsh impact on living standards.
</P>
<P>
Preparations has already begun in the U.N. for an upcoming
world conference on the theme of "finances for development", which
would focus on issues central to the work of the World Band and
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The press will be briefed on the panel discussions at the end
of the one-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> Women Play Important Role in Bangladeshi Development: Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Women are playing an increasingly
important role in the development of Bangladesh, although more
time is needed before their full potential can be realized,
speakers at a seminar said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi women contribute significantly to the development
of the country's industry, particularly in the garment and textile
industries, they told a seminar on "The Role of Women in the
Economic Development of Bangladesh and China," organized by the
Bangladesh-China Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the work force in the several thousand
garment and textile factories in the country are women, who have
proved their aptitude in developing skills in these fields to make
the industries competitive in the international market, they said.
</P>
<P>
They noted that women should be empowered to play their due
role in an equal manner with men, in all fields of national
planning for development, covering education, family planning,
allocation of resources and setting of development priorities and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
They admitted that the literacy rate among women in Bangladesh
is still very low, at 25.5 percent at present and more should be
done to remove illiteracy by encouraging female education.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Bangladeshi government introduced free education
and semi-scholarship for female students and since then, the
number of girl students has doubled, they said.
</P>
<P>
There are 46,000 primary schools in Bangladesh, with women
constituting 95 percent of the teachers, clearly indicating
women's role in the country's overall development, they pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the seamier, Bu Jianguo, political counselor of the
Chinese Embassy in Bangladesh, said women, as an important member
of mankind, are a great force in creating human civilization and
promoting economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
She called on both the Chinese and Bangladeshi governments as
well as social organizations to promote the role of women in
social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The participants also discussed small credit and savings
schemes for women in the rural areas and women's role in family
planning in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> British Tourism Unaffected by London Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- British tourism authority said on
Wednesday recent racist bombings and the killing of a television
star failed to prevent overseas tourists from coming to Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We have had (telephone) calls to our New York center...but
nobody is cancelling trips as a result," said British Tourist
Authority spokeswoman Jo Leslie. "Our response is that the
bombings so far seem to be isolated to non-tourist areas."
</P>
<P>
"Our bigger concern is what is happening in the Balkans in
terms of what effect that might have on travel into Europe. It
hasn't (impacted yet), but it could well," she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major airlines British Airways, American Airlines
and Virgin Atlantic Airways all said the high-profile violence, in
a nation which prides itself as being among the safest in the
world, had had no impact on their bookings.
</P>
<P>
"We have not noticed any impact (on bookings and arrivals) at
the moment," said Virgin Atlantic spokesman Paul Moore. "I don't
think our market is as susceptible to change as perhaps it was in
the past," he added.
</P>
<P>
British Airways said its tourist arrivals so far this month
were even one percent higher than at the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, two nail bombs exploded in London,
injuring altogether 45 people.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a leading BBC television presenter, Jill Dando, was
shot dead outside her west London home in an apparently unrelated
incident.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Categorically Opposed to Ground Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Wednesday expressed his categorical opposition to a ground
intervention in Kosovo by NATO, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted
some French senators as saying after they had a meeting with
Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said a ground intervention in Kosovo would bring Russia
into the war and will enlarge the war to a ``new dimension'',
according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he is ``fairly optimistic'' about the
evolution of the war.
</P>
<P>
On the NATO summit held last week in Washington, Chirac
described the compromise on NATO's new strategic concept as a
``great diplomatic victory'' for France.
</P>
<P>
France insisted that the new concept include the recognition of
the primordial role of the United Nations Security Council in
international security affairs, and the growing importance of
European identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also criticized some unnamed European members of NATO
for failing to play an active role during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Only the United States and France have been active at the
summit, he said.

While in Moscow, Minister Axworthy will also meet with UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. "They will discuss possible UN and

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations on the
Limits of the Continental Shelf will convene its fifth session on
May 13-14, 1999 to resume its work on the Scientific and Technical
Guidelines, U.N. sources said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Scientific and Technical Guidelines were adopted
provisionally at the end of the fourth session on September 4,
1998, pending final and formal adoption at the up-coming session.
</P>
<P>
The Scientific and Technical Guidelines are meant to provide
assistance to coast states regarding the technical nature and
scope of the data and information to be included in the submission
addressed to the Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Guidelines are of a highly scientific nature and they deal
with geodetic and other methodologies for the determination of the
outer limit of the continental shelf using such criteria as
determination of the foot of the slope of the continental margin,
sediment thickness, and structure of submarine ridges and other
underwater elevations.
</P>
<P>
At its fifth session, the Commission will consider those
sections of the Guidelines on which consensus has yet to be
reached, and may introduce further changes to the text.
</P>
<P>
It will also continue working on Annex II to the Guidelines,
which will contain, among other material, illustrations depicting
specific cases of delineation of the outer limit of the
continental shelf.

<HEADLINE> Daimler-Chrysler Profits Rise 16 Per Cent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN April 28 (Xinhua)--The German-U.S. automobile giant
Daimler-Chrysler reported Wednesday at its headquarters in
Stuttgart the net profits in the first quarter of year 1999 were
up 16 per cent to 2.8 billion euros (2.98 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement the turnover in the quarter
came to 35 billion euros, up 10 per cent from the same period last
year, and the adjusted net profit was 1.6 billion euros, up 23 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
The basis for comparison were the total results of the
separated Daimler and Chrysler companies, which merged in November
1998 to form the world's third largest automobile group.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted earning per share of the company has reached 1.64
euros, up from 1.43 euros. For 1999 as a whole, Daimler-Chrysler
expects a 4-per-cent revenue rise, to 137 billion euros, and at
least the same rate of profit growth.
</P>
<P>
The company is confident that in the year 1999 it will surpass
this target, Daimler-Chrysler chairman Juergen Schremp said.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairman Robert Eaton said the two sides, formerly the
German Daimler and the U.S. Chrysler, were ahead of the schedule
in completing the integration, and he was confident that the cost
advantages from the merger would be achieved.

<HEADLINE> More French, Italian Soldiers Arrive in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- About 294 French soldiers and 400
Italian soldiers arrived in Albania Wednesday to join their NATO
counterparts who have already been deployed in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The French soldiers landed at the Albanian port of Durres on
Wednesday morning while the Italian soldiers came by the Italian
navy ship "San Giorgio" to the southern Albanian port of Vlore.
</P>
<P>
An assistant commander of the French unit, Susanna
Fras-Vitanen, was quoted by the Albanian news agency ATA as saying
that they will help repair roads and transport NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
The assistant commander said that the number of French troops
will be as high as 800 in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Italian soldiers of the "San Marco" battalion, with nearly
100 armored vehicles, headed to north Albania two hours after
their arrival at the Vlore port.
</P>
<P>
They will be deployed in the areas around Kukes, a city in
north Albania, the ATA said in a separate report.
</P>
<P>
Last week, 1,200 Italian soldiers arrived in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-seven Danish soldiers and scores of vehicles landed on
the Vlore port Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the new arrivals, the number of NATO troops in Albania for
humanitarin tasks has reached 5,300.
</P>
<P>
NATO has decided to deploy 8,000 soldiers in Albania to carry

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The criminal court in northern
Rwanda's Ruhengeri district Tuesday sentenced to death seven
genocide suspects accused of involvement in the genocide in the
area in April-July 1994, according to judicial sources in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The seven were part of a group of 25 genocide suspects who were
brought to court in a ''mega-trial,'' the Rwanda News Agency
Wednesday quoted the same sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
They were found guilty of five accounts including the creation
of terrorist gangs which rampaged Ruhondo commune, throwing
corpses in pit latrines, as well as illegal possession of arms.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 25 accused were found not guilty and subsequently
released,

while five others were sentenced to life imprisonment. One man
got a one- year jail term.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan prisons are crammed with over 124,000 genocide suspects
waiting for trial. In a two-year period, Rwandan criminal courts
have handled over 1, 000 cases, with over 150 death penalties.
Twenty-two genocide culprits were publicly executed in April of
last year.
</P>
<P>
At this pace, trials of genocide suspects could continue to the
next century, some legal experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has an ambitious plan of accelerating
trials by resorting to traditional courts commonly known here as
''Gacaca.''

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Bourse Plunges to Three-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE)
crashed to a three-year low this week, with the KSE index closing
at 1,478.5 points Wednesday, down 29.6 points or nearly 2 percent
from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the KSE index dived to 1,477.6 points, the lowest
level within the week.
</P>
<P>
Other three indicators were also among the lowest in many
weeks. The average daily turnover this week fell to 2.08 million
Kuwaiti dinars (6.86 million U.S. dollars) from 6.12 million
dinars (20.2 million dollars) a week ago.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the volume and transactions changed hands, a drop
of nearly 50 percent was witnessed this week, during which only
61.68 million shares were traded in 1,631 deals within five days
as against 132.95 million shares in 3,217 deals in the four
trading days last week.
</P>
<P>
On the lull in KSE trading, brokers said a looming crisis
between the government and parliament had undermined the
investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Parliament members called for a grilling of Justice and
Islamic Affairs Minister, Ahmad Kulaib, over misprints of some
120,000 copies of the holy Quran.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sheikh Ali Al-Salem is also under fire for
the cancellation of a six-month-old share sale, which, opposition
parliamentarians blamed, cost some 60 million dollars of public
funds.
</P>
<P>
Stories carried by local media earlier this week said a
growing conflict between the executive and legislative authorities
might result in resignation of the cabinet and a dissolution
of the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers should have good reason to expect a rally for
the KSE next week, because the Kuwait bourse announced late
Wednesday a restructuring of its administration aimed at
enhancing the stock market's performance.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Saad Al-Abdullah
Al-Salem Al-Sabah had also reportedly held a successful meeting
with parliament members Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM: Embargo on Northern Cyprus Backfiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit said on Wednesday the longstanding economic embargo on the
Turkish Cypriots has led to the deepening of the ties between the
Turkish Cypriot side and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remarks during his five-day holiday visit to
the northern third of Cyprus which is under the control of the
Turkish Cypriot side, according to Turkey's Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that as long as the embargo is there,
the ties between Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side will improve
more and more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
He said the continuation of the embargo will help the
international community realize that the Turkish Cypriot side is a
separate state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish State Minister Sukru Gurel, who is
accompanying Ecevit, said the embargo on the Turkish Cypriot side
has accelerated the economic integration between Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have signed a series of agreements aimed at
easing the economic difficulties on the part of the Turkish
Cyriots and have decided to establish a common economic area.
</P>
<P>
The economic embargo on the Turkish Cypriot side began after
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash declared the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north after Turkey
landed its troops on and took over the northern third of the
island in 1974 in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nearing Decision on Mobil-Iran Oil Swap Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- the United States is about to
make a decision on Mobil Corp's request for a "swap" oil deal with
Iran, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering it and we are getting closer to a
decision," Eizenstat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while announcing that U.S. sanctions would
be eased to permit the sale of food and medicine to Iran, Libya
and Sudan. But he said the Mobil deal was a separate case to be
considered.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, Mobil filed a request with the U.S. Treasury
Department to ship crude to northern Iran from the company's
nearby oil fields in the region and swap it for Iranian oil that
would be shipped from the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would make it easier for Mobil to get its oil out
of the Caspian Sea region, which has a lack of pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Mobil Chairman Lucio Noto has said the company's oil swaps
request could provide an opportunity for the United States to
improve its relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great way to start some sort of limited,
controllable dialogue" with Iran, he said at the company's
shareholders meeting last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Makes Changes on Sanctions against Iran, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration on
Wednesday announced a major revision in U.S. sanctions policy that
will permit sales of food and medical items to Iran, Libya and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The new policy calls for an exemption of such items from
future sanctions, but will not affect sanctions against Iraq,
Cuba and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told reporters that
the announcement was the result of a two-year review of overall
U.S. sanctions policy which concluded that allowing food and
medicine sales to above-mentioned countries "doesn't enhance a
nation's military capability or ability to support terrorism."
</P>
<P>
In fact, banning such sales can backfire in the United States
by eroding support for its policies and resulting in lost
business for its economically hard-hit agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions change would cover sales of wheat, corn, feed,
soybeans, edible oils, meat, fish, baby food and formula. No
decision had been made on whether fertilizer, pesticides and
agricultural equipment can also be sold, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions on the energy sectors of these countries were being
considered separately and were not affected by Wednesday's
announcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions change could clear the way for administration
approval of a request by Iran to purchase more than 500 million
U.S. dollars worth of grain and sugar.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Cypriot Entry in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Deputy Foreign Minister
Umberto Ranieri said here Wednesday that Italy supports Cyprus'
accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Ranieri made the remark after a meeting with Geroge Vassiliou,
Cypriot chief negotiator in the EU accession talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy appreciates very much the efforts made by Cyprus
to meet the accession criteria.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Cyprus can join the EU before a solution to the
Cyprus problem, Ranieri said "these are two separate issues, but
which mutually influence each other."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in the wake of the failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the peace talks
between the two sides have been broken up since summer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ranieri pointed out that Cyprus' political problem as a result
of the Turkish invasion has been "going on for too long," hoping
Cyprus can as rapidly as possible become a full member of the EU
and its political problem may be solved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, Slovenia, Estonia, Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the EU in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Vassiliou reiterated that President Glafcos
Clerides' invitation to the Turkish Cypriots for joining forces in
the accession talks is still valid.
</P>
<P>
Ranieri arrived here ealier in the day on a two-day visit,
during which he will also inaugurate the Italian Cultural Month
on the island.

TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
regional director for Europe, Eiric Jo Asvall, said Wednesday that
he is worried about the danger of an epidemic among the Kosovo
refugees as the Summer is drawing close.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, Asvall
said that "The fact that no epidemic has occurred so far is very
important, but the danger of an epidemic spread increases as the
Summer is drawing close."
</P>
<P>
"That is why the preliminary measures to avoid these diseases
is a necessity," the WHO director said.
</P>
<P>
He said the WHO will deliver a long-term assistance to help
Albania cope with the emergency situation arising from the arrival
of more than 360,000 Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Majko said that his government has taken strict measures to
control the health assistance delivered for the Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Asvall also held a working meeting with Albanian Health
Minister Leonard Solis.
</P>
<P>
Their talks centered on the current health situation of the
Kosovo refugees in Albania.

LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Despite London's blue chips ended

ground as investors took a contemplative step back.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE-100 Index crept beyond the previous session's

TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The tension in the border areas
between Albania and Yugoslavia has caused depopulation of villages
in the north Albanian district of Tropoja.
</P>

"Over 4,000 inhabitants of the Prush, Zogaj, Zherke and Lucidol
villages have been evacuated," Secretary of the District Council

Kuliqi said that only a few of the villagers have moved to
Bajram Curri town and the others have gone to stay with their

<HEADLINE> House Votes to Restrict Clinton from widening Kosovo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives on Wednesday voted to limit President Bill
Clinton's ability to widen the Kosovo war, saying the president
should get congressional approval before injecting "ground
elements" into the ever-expanding conflict with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The 249 to 180 vote showed a great contrast to Clinton's
appeal for a "single voice" in Congress on the Kosovo crisis as
he said NATO had done.
</P>
<P>
Majority-party Republicans said Congress was merely exercising
its constitutional responsibility and forcing Clinton to keep
his word on not sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions set by the vote could even make it hard to use
the Apache attack helicopters that have been recently sent to
Albania, poised for attacking Serb ground forces.
</P>
<P>
"We should not even be in the Balkans," said Republican
representative Floyd Spence, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee. "The national security of this country is not at stake."
</P>
<P>
But Democrats said Clinton had promised them several hours
earlier at a White House meeting with lawmakers that he would
not attempt to put combat troops into Kosovo without first
seeking congressional consent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the White House meeting with lawmakers, Clinton
expressed reservation about measures like the one the House had
just passed, saying 19 NATO nations had expressed unity over the
weekend and "America must continue to speak with a single voice
as well."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also pressed for quick approval of his 6 billion U.S.
dollars request to pay for the expanded bombing against Yugoslavia
and urged lawmakers to resist Republican-led efforts to double it.
"We must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk now,"
he said.

BONN, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The German government said Wednesday
in a report that 16 people have been killed in German neo-Nazi
attacks since the country's unification in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The killings were carried out with an anti-Semitic, racist or
neo-Nazi ideological motive, and a total of six people were
convicted for these crimes or cases of attempted murder, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the government admitted its figure of 16 deaths caused
by neo-Nazis might be incomplete. Because of Germany's strict
privacy laws, the authorities may have erased data kept in police
computers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, an annual report from the Interior Ministry
said totally 28 people were killed in far-right attacks from 1991
through 1998.

<HEADLINE> African Finance Institutions Discuss Ways for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 leaders of African
micro-financial institutions, which offer under 300 U.S. dollars
loans, gathered here Wednesday to search for ways to help the
poor help themselves.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop opened Wednesday will focus on the
building of regional and country-level networks to provide more
effective and extensive loans to the poor.
</P>
<P>
"The real experts in micro-finance institutions (in Africa) are
not foreign consultants or donors. They are those struggling to
build efficient credit and savings services for the poor
majority," said Nancy Barry, president of the World Women Banking
(WWB).
</P>
<P>
Barry noted that micro-finance institutions and hundreds of
thousands of poor clients are working with governments and banks
to reshape financial sector policies and legal structures to
serve the poor in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The three-day workshop, organized by the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) and the World Women Banking, brought together
micro-finance leaders from 15 countries in western, southern and
eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The representatives will exchange best practice on reducing
costs while expanding micro-finance services and discuss how to
set up regional networks.
</P>
<P>
The research carried out by the World Women Banking and UNDP
indicate that more than 100 micro-finance and rural financial
institutions operate in Africa, which are reaching large number
of the poor, mostly women, with their special service.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Riria, managing director of the Kenya Women Financial
Trust, told Xinhua that the average loan size of micro-finance
institutions is under 300 U.S. dollars, which most African banks
consider too small to lend.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the institutions don't require clients to offer a
 collateral like a house, car or other property, but only "a
guarantee from a group of 20 to 40 people", she said.
</P>
<P>
Jennifer said if the loan recipient is not able to repay the
loan and interest, the other members of the group are responsible
for the debt.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of these institutions have a repayment
rate of 90 percent or more, according to the survey by the UNDP
and the World Women Banking.
</P>
<P>
The World Women Banking, established in 1979, is a global
non-profit organization aimed at helping poor women build their
own small businesses.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fighting erupted on the
outskirts of Masiaka in Sierra Leone, a senior officer of the west
African peacekeeping force ECOMOG said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We reached the gates of the town yesterday (Tuesday) and since
then the small arms battle and artillery exchanges for the town
have intensified," a report reaching here quoted the officer as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Masiaka is on the main road from the capital Freetown to the
interior parts of the west African country and the rebels holding
the town have blocked road traffic to the interior from the
capital.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels are fighting us fiercely for the town with heavy
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades," the officer noted.
</P>
<P>
According to military officers, ECOMOG troops and Kamajor
traditional hunters besieged the town Wednesday, shelling rebel
positions there.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings were also reported around the northern Sierra
Leone town of Yele in Tonkelele district following a rebel attack
Tuesday, in which at least thirty people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Septimus Kaikai, spokesman of the Sierra Leonean government,
said "the government is implementing a dual track approach,"
adding it would continue dialog with the rebels but at the same
time continue to fight to clear them from strategic positions in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In the war-ravaged country of Sierra Leone, the Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah government supported by the ECOMOG troops now holds
Freetown and its vicinity while the rebels control several
strategic points.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast speech to mark 38 years of independence,
President Kabbah Tuesday urged the rebels to "renounce violence
and terror" and challenged them to "meet us at the polling booth
in less than 15 months' time."

smuggled goods worth more than 900 billion Vietnamese dong (nearly
83 million U.S. dollars) into Vietnam from 1994 to August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Phung Long That, former chief of the anti-smuggling division 1

of charges including smuggling, bribing, acting as intermediates
for bribing, hiding and selling properties acquired illegally,
abusing positions and power and hiding criminals.

<HEADLINE> EU Decides to Suspend Beef Imports From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Thursday that it formally decided to suspend imports of beef
and bovine liver from the United States as of June 15.
</P>
<P>
This action was taken to protect consumers' health in 15 member
states of the European Union (EU) following the discovery by an
independent study of residues of certain synthetic growth
promoting hormones in beef and bovine livers imported from the
U.S., the EU executive branch said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The commission also decided to check 100 percent of U.S. beef
and bovine liver imports. The European Commission said its
Standing Veterinary Committee supports this action.
</P>
<P>
But the commission said both decisions will be reviewed on the
basis of evolution of the situation and guarantees supplied by the
competent authorities of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner of Agriculture and Rural Development, Franz
Fischler, said that the commission is ready to work closely with
the U.S. authorities to resolve this problem and welcomed the fact
that the first round of discussions between the two sides last
week were constructive.
</P>
<P>
However, the commissioner insisted that the decisions could not
be changed until the European Union is satisfied that its "Hormone
Free Cattle Program" is operating effectively, ensuring that these
imports were produced without the use of hormones.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said on Thursday that France does not exclude Kosovo's breakaway
from Yugoslavia, although it does not envisage it now.
</P>
<P>
"We don't envisage at this stage a breakaway (of Kosovo), but
we will see where we will lead this conflict," Agence France-
Presse quoted Jospin as saying during a meeting of his government
ministers on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that France now has not changed the orientation adopted
at the Rambouillet conference two months ago, which calls for a
substantial autonomy of Kosovo under a possible provisional
administration by the international community, in particular the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a French leader to hint at a
possible breakaway of Kosovo from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac has on several occasions
expressed his opposition to the idea of a breakaway of Kosovo from
Yugoslavia, but he has called for an EU administration in Kosovo
once a political settlement is reached.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Economy Expected to Grow by 6 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said on Thursday his country's economy is expected to grow by 6
percent this year and 6.8 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
"We have walked on the right path," Mubarak said in a speech to
mark the Labor Day on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptians have regained confidence in the national economy,
and a new atmosphere is giving a strong push to the massive
investments in all fields, the president told 3,000
representatives of labor unions of Egypt's 22 million workers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mubarak cautioned that the Egyptian economy needs to
grow by 7-8 percent to create about 500,000 jobs a year to erase
its growing unemployment. The official unemployment rate is 10-13
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Mubarak's economic growth forecast is to be
strengthened by the domestic private sector investment, which is
seen as a sign of confidence in Mubarak's economic liberalization
program which started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector has controlled about 71 percent of
the economy, which during his predecessors' rule was almost
entirely under state control.
</P>
<P>
The private sector investment is now 22 percent of the gross
domestic product, and the challenge is to raise it to 25 percent
so that the economy grows at about 7 to 8 percent, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's privatization program, which envisages selling off 314
inefficient state-run enterprises, has won praise from the
International Monetary Fund. The reforms also involve loosening
investment restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said a growing burden on the economy is the trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the 1998-99 fiscal year ending on June 30 are
expected to reach 17.5 billion U.S. dollars while exports would
only stand at 5.14 billion dollars, Mubarak said, calling it a
"disturbing figure."
</P>
<P>
The government plans to reduce imports to 14 billion dollars
annually and increase exports to 6.3 billion dollars, he said. One
way to do it will to produce goods in Egypt that are as good as
imported ones, he said.

<P>
BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) militia was wounded Thursday by a roadside bomb
in south Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The SLA member was hurt when his car was hit by a roadside bomb
near Kafarhoun village just outside the Israeli occupied border
zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Beirut, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
claimed responsibility for the bombing, which raised the number
of wounded SLA since the start of this year to 20. A militiaman
was killed during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces out of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 Palestinian students
held demonstration Thursday to protest against the decision of the
Palestinian leadership to postpone a statehood declaration.
</P>
<P>
The students from the Palestinian Bir Zeit University, which
lies to the north of the major West Bank city of Ramallah, also
clashed with Israeli soldiers when marched on a main road between
Ramallah and the town of Bir Zeit.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that the clashes broke out after the
students stoned Israeli vehicles on the road, which is under
Israel's control. But no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Central Council voted on Thursday morning to
delay a decision on statehood declaration until after Israeli May
17 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had repeatedly hinted that he
will declare an independent state on May 4 when the five-year
interim self-rule period enshrined in the Oslo peace agreements
expires.
</P>
<P>
But dozens of world leaders have urged him to hold off the move
to avoid playing in the hands of Israeli hard-line Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in the coming elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also has threatened to take tough actions against the
possible Palestinian statehood proclamation, including annexing
parts of the West Bank that are still under Israel's control.

that China and Japan should adhere to the principles enshrined in
the Sino-Japanese joint statement and the bilateral treaty of
peace and friendship, view and conduct bilateral ties with a long-

China is deeply concerned about the approval of relevant acts
of the New Japan-U.S. Defense Guidelines by the Lower House of the
Japanese Diet, he said, because it involves Taiwan and exposes
Japan's aim to expand its military function, he said.

"We strongly urge Japan to honor its commitment, and keep on a
peaceful track, which not only will benefit Japan itself, but also
win the trust of Asia and the world at large," he said.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, said today that The Chinese Communist Party and
government attach great importance to friendship and cooperative
ties with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Li, also chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the
remark at a meeting with Jose Ramon Machado, a member of the
Political Bureau of the Cuban Communist Party Central Committee
and vice president of the Council of State.
</P>
<P>
After its successful revolution, the Cuban Communist Party
headed by Fidel Castro led the Cuban people to overcome many
difficulties, and firmly safeguard national independence and
sovereignty, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba has also revitalized and developed its economy, and
strengthened its friendship and cooperation with other nations,
winning the understanding and support of more and more countries,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
For the past few years, China and Cuba have expanded friendship
and cooperation fruitfully in all fields, including politics,
trade and economy, and culture, Li added.
</P>
<P>
High-level officials of the two nations and parties have
exchanged extensive contacts, and increased mutual understanding,
belief and friendship, and the good relations existing between the
two sides were intensified, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The CPC and the Chinese government are ready to share efforts
with the Cuban side in order to make the long-term, stable and
comprehensive Sino-Cuban friendship and cooperation more fruitful,
and bring it into the new century, he stressed.

He said China should adhere to Marxism in its reform and
opening-up. "We should insist on the basic principles of Marxism,
because Marxism came into being from practice, and has been proved
true by practice," he added.
</P>
<P>
We should also combine Marxism with constantly changing
realities, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China should believe firmly in the socialistic
system, because it is an irresistible and objective historical
process, which needs to be further explored and improved
constantly in practice.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up is a practical application of Marxist
principles, and the self-improvement of the socialist system, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Many problems will occur inevitably. Some will be about
theories, but many will be about practice. Without the direction
of Marxism, many problems will remain unsolved. And the solving of
those problems will enrich Marxist theories, and vitalize
socialism, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Machado said Cuba and China both insist on socialism each with
its own situation considered.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it is extremely important to consolidate
and develop bilateral ties, in a deeply changing world.

<HEADLINE> Most Workers Need Further Training in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has said four out of five workers in his country need
further training and education to update their skills and they
must quickly sharpen skills and increase capabilities.
</P>
<P>
Goh made the point in his May Day Message 1999 which was
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Goh stressed that workers must continue to
learn and re-learn to keep up with the changing needs of
Singapore's economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are now strong in electronics and chemicals. For the future
we need to nurture new areas like biotechnology and the life
sciences. We will also have to focus on services like finance,
healthcare, education, logistics and IT (information technology).
These new sectors will require new skills," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh said a knowledge economy does not mean just hi-tech
activities or jobs which require a university degree.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that a knowledge worker is one who works smartly
and learns relevant skills quickly to improve himself and to raise
his productivity.
</P>
<P>
A cleaner who knows the properties of the chemicals and the
performance of the mechanized equipment he uses to clean offices
and housing estates is a knowledge worker, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said it is more difficult to get all workers to constantly
learn new skills and acquire new knowledge than to produce a few
thousand workers with good knowledge. The prime minister stressed
that Singapore has to move the entire workforce up the knowledge
ladder, not just a few at the top, in order to continue to attract
high value investments.
</P>
<P>
"The higher our average and collective knowledge, the easier it
is for us to attract high-value investments and high-paying jobs,"
he said.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and visiting United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan agreed
Thursday that the Yugoslavia crisis should be resolved in line
with the U.N. Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Annan, Yeltsin urged the world body to
play a "special" role in seeking a political solution to the
raging conflict in the Balkans, said Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ivanov said, Annan hoped Russia will firmly
support the United Nations to play such a role. The two also
agreed that Russia and the United Nations will cooperate closely
to put an end to the Balkan crisis which has lasted more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said both Yeltsin and Annan expressed deep concern over
the protracted Yugoslavia conflict because it has menaced global
stability and security.
</P>
<P>
They expressed confidence that a political solution to the
crisis is "in the interests of all peoples in the Balkans" and
will "help restore stability in the region."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told Annan that Russia will continue to provide
assistance to all victims of the conflict, which has displaced
tens of thousands of civilians in the secessionist Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, which,along with other parts of Yugoslavia,
has been bombed by NATO warplanes since March 24.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Annan earlier Thursday, Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov also urged the U.N. to play a critical
role in solving the Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told Annan that NATO should immediately halt its
destructive air campaign against Yugoslavia and that negotiations
should be held to seek agreement on Kosovo's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who arrived here Wednesday night from Germany, will
travel on to London Thursday. He met Yeltsin's peace envoy Viktor
Chernormyrdin Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> 50 Killed in Taliban Jet Bombardment: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 persons have been
killed in northern and central Afghanistan in the Taliban's jet
bombardment since Tuesday, a top opposition military commander
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Taliban jets bombed the towns of Jabel Saraj, Taluqan and
Bamiyan killing 10, 30 and 10 respectively," said General Sayed
Hussain Anwari, one of chief military commanders of the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Anwari said the bombings Tuesday on the three towns were
ferocious and caused widespread damage to the towns' limited
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said that following the fall of Bamiyan last week, the
Taliban launched a major offensive on Darre Suf in the northern
province of Samangan in a bid to limit the advance of the Northern
Alliance toward the neighboring Balkh province.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban were dealt a heavy blow Wednesday when the
opposition troops advanced into the towns of Chapchal in Samangan
on the border with Balkh Province and Keshende in Balkh, according
to Anwari.
</P>
<P>
The general said the alliance's troops have now overrun the
town of Shebar in eastern Bamiyan, capturing Sheikh Ali in Parwan
Province near the Bamiyan border.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Wardak Province in central Afghanistan "remains
firmly in the alliance's control," according to the general.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the Taliban's recent offensives, the alliance has lost
little territory in central and northern Afghanistan," he said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in S. Mogadishu Kills At Least 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- At least seven people were
killed and more than 17 others including civilians wounded during
the early hours of the fighting between rival militiamen in south
Mogadishu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy and sporadic exchange of gunfire still continues between
three Islamic courts in south Mogadishu and the militiamen loyal
to faction leader Mohamed Qanyarch Afriah.
</P>
<P>
The fighting which has lasted for two days is very much
concentrated over the control of the strategic strong point of
Bakara junction, at the southern end of Mogadishu's main business
center, where the militiamen of Afrah are still in control.
</P>
<P>
The serious shooting has made the main Wadnaha street almost
deserted with the public transport and pedestrians having come to
a halt.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has similarly forced the closure of many stores and
shops in fear of the fighting in the market. . Both sides are
using more than six double barrel ant-aircraft heavy machine guns
and about a dozen battle wagons mounted with different heavy
machine guns supported by hundreds of militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Intensive peace talks between religious leaders, clan elders
and businessmen from the warring sides are now continuing in south
Mogadishu in an effort to contain the hostility which seems to be
degenerating into a clannish war.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close the meeting, both sides have
accepted a formal cease-fire. But a difficult point is over an
argument that the Islamic courts should pull their militiamen out
of the new positions around the former Hawlwadag police station
which they had occupied two nights ago.
</P>
<P>
Apart from all these peace negotiations, the fighting is
further spreading to new areas in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Trouble is not confined to Mogadishu alone, but the town of
Baidoa, some 245 kilometers south of the capital city, has also
experienced night armed confrontations between militiamen from the
Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) and others loyal to Hussein
Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
At least nine people were killed and more than 15 others were
wounded when the RRA fighters had infiltrated into the town,
shelling the militia
bases of Aidid there.

<HEADLINE> Arabs, Switzers Keen on Boosting Ties: AL Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in Geneva on Thursday that the Arabs and
Switzers share a desire to promote cooperation in all domains,
especially in economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid made the remarks in an interview with Egypt's
Voice of Arab radio over telephone. He described the Arab-Swiss
relations as "good."
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid arrived in Switzerland Tuesday to attend a meeting
of the Arab-Swiss Chamber of Commerce and Industry on the occasion
of the 25th anniversary of its establishment.
</P>
<P>
When addressing the meeting, the league chief stressed the
Arabs' keenness to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East, the Cairo-based radio said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Swiss side to support the Arab cause and
bolster trade with the Arab countries, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said he held talks with Swiss officials on ways of
enhancing economic and trade relations between Arab countries and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Arab countries and Israel, which began
in 1991, are stalled due to Israel's intransigent policy in the
peace process.

<HEADLINE> S. African President to Visit Pakistan Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela is to visit Pakistan early next week at the head of a
high-level delegation to discuss prospects for enhancing political
and economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Foreign Office Thursday, Mandela
will arrive here on May 4 on a day-long visit at the invitation of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual
interest, including the Kashmir dispute, will come up for
discussion during the talks between Mandela and Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, in his capacity as chairman of the Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM), called for a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir
dispute in his inaugural address to the 12th NAM Summit in Durban
in September last year.
</P>
<P>
"All of us remain concerned that the issue of Jammu and Kashmir
should be solved through peaceful negotiations and should be
willing to lend all strength we have, to the resolution of this
matter," Mandela had said, urging the 114-member grouping to lend
its full weight to "this outstanding issue which is a matter of
concern to the whole world."
</P>
<P>
Besides the political issues, the leaders of South Africa and
Pakistan will also explore possibilities of increasing commercial
and economic ties between the two countries.

HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive in Council
has agreed that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
Government should proceed with detailed discussions with the
Pacific Century Group (PCG) on the development of the Cyberport
based on the Letter of Intent signed with the Group.
</P>

which was announced by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang in his
Budget Speech in early March.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wages and Benefits Rise Slightly in the First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Wages and benefits for U.S.
workers rose only 0.4 percent in the first three months of the
year, indicating the lowest unemployment in 29 years is still not
generating wage pressures, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the first-quarter gain followed a much
larger, 0.7 percent advance from the final quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the slight wage pressures is occurring at a time
of low inflation, meaning that workers' take-home-pay is not being
eroded by higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
The slack wage pressures are occurring even though the overall
unemployment rate dipped to a 29-year-low of 4.2 percent in March.
For all of last year, unemployment averaged its lowest level in
three decades.
</P>
<P>
The combination of slight wage pressure and low unemployment
has given the Federal Reserve the leeway to allow the economy to
continue growing at a rapid clip without feeling the need to start
raising interest rates to prevent inflation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Labor Department said new claims for
unemployment benefits declined by a larger-than-expected amount
last week, falling to 294,000 new claims, down 20,000 people from
the week before. It was the biggest one-week decline in three
months.

<HEADLINE> New Guidelines on Princes Issued in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's press watchdog the Press
Complaints Commission issued new guidelines on Thursday about the
coverage of Princes William and Harry.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged editors to continue to show restraint on
covering news about 16-year-old William and his 14-year-old
younger brother, but called for more news to be officially
released about the princes -- sons of Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
It said reports about Prince Harry -- which included stories
about his haircut and his prowess on the soccer field -- had not
violated a tough code of practice on children of the rich and
famous adopted by the British media after the September 1997 death
of the princes' mother, Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
Both William and Harry are studying at Eton College.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Prince Charles's press office officially
dropped complaints against two newspapers -- the Mirror and the
Daily Star -- of unauthorized intrusion of Privacy of the two
princes.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that Charles and the palace have withdrawn this
complaint, which should never have been made in the first place,"
Mirror editor Piers Morgan wrote.

HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sotheby's inaugural Asia Week
Hong Kong auctions of Chinese classical and contemporary paintings,
ceramics and works of art, and watches and jewels raised more than
19 million HK dollars (2.4 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: PLO wisely Postpones Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council decided here Thursday to
postpone declaration of an independent Palestinian state
proposed for May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
The 124-member council also decided to reconvene its meeting
in June and make its final decision on the statehood issue after
Israel's elections on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council decided to form committees charged with
preparation works on statehood, such as formulating the
Palestinian constitution and election laws.
</P>
<P>
Declaring an independent Palestinian state on May 4 is a major
political issue not for the Palestinians alone, but for Israel as
well. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has stated on many
occasions that the 1993 Oslo Accords between the Palestinians and
Israel entitled him the right to do so.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has threatened to cancel the Oslo process and annex
parts of the West Bank now under its control if Arafat decides to
declare statehood on May 4, the date when the five-year
transitional period of Palestinian self-rule expires under the
Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the council's postponement decision
can not be regarded as a political defeat of the Palestinian side
facing presure and threats from Israel. Instead, it showed that
the Palestinian leadership has achieved what it has planned for.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the council's decision to keep the proceedings going
until after Israel's May general elections will keep those parties
from claiming that their strong anti-peace policy stopped the
council's declaration.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Arafat has succeeded in making a major diplomatic
and political coup on both international and domestic fronts in
the statehood issue.
</P>
<P>
His recent diplomatic efforts have left him in a strong
position to be able to declare a state with or without prior
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the international level, he had toured countries of Arab,
Islamic, West and East, drumming up support for the Palestinian
right to declare an independent state. He specially managed to
attain a political backing from the European Union and the
United States that the Palestinian people have the right to
decide their future on their land, and the final peace talks with
Israel to be viting the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to attend
the council meeting as observer.
</P>
<P>
Having all these jobs done, Arafat's real intention is to force
Israel to implement the signed agreements, to move the peace
process forward and force Israel to solve the remaining issues
such as the status of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, the
settlements within a time frame through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The postponement of the decision-making until after Israeli
elections will serve all these purposes.

<HEADLINE> Flexibility for Overseas-Invested Power Plants in Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China will treat overseas-
invested power plants with "flexibility" in the on-going price
reform of electricity, a senior Chinese economic official said
here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, told visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai and the Thai delegation that China will take the concerns
of overseas-invested power plants into consideration while
carrying out the reform.
</P>
<P>
"Some overseas-invested power plants have worries as to whether
their set rate of returns will be affected by the reform," he said.
"I can say that the government will treat this problem, which left
over from the past, in a flexible manner."
</P>
<P>
Due to a power-supply shortage in the past, many overseas-
invested power plants were offered set rates of return, which
resulted in a relatively higher price for electricity, according
to the minister.
</P>
<P>
As the situation has now changed from shortage to over-supply,
problems with the price of electricity price have appeared. The
current "chaotic" pricing of electricity must be reformed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The target of the reform, Zeng said, is to separate power
plants and operators of power network. Power plants will have to
compete to win the right to enter a network, after the reform is
completed.
</P>
<P>
"A flexible treatment does not mean we encourage the set-rate
return mechanism," he said. "We hope, therefore, that overseas-
invested power plants will raise their competitiveness and take a
long-term development perspective."

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China continues to slash the
production capacity of its cotton-weaving industry despite the
increasing pressures of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Du Yuzhou, director-general of the State Administration of
Textile Industry, told a press conference here today that in the
first three months of the year, China dismantled a total of 780,
000 spindles in its cotton mills and laid off 100,000 textile
workers. As a result, state-owned textile enterprises reduced
losses by 650 million yuan in the period.
</P>
<P>
Exports of textiles and garments were valued at 7.62 billion U.
S. dollars for the quarter, a decrease of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars,
or nearly one-fourth of the total, from the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
Du said that retail prices of textiles continued to drop from
January to March, decreasing by 10.7 percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the domestic market for textiles has grim
prospects because prices are unlikely to bounce back in the short
term.
</P>
<P>
China has targeted the textile industry as the sector for
achieving breakthroughs in turning around money-losing state-owned
enterprises. It has set the target of state-owned textile
enterprises turning losses into profits by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China exceeded the target of cutting redundant
capacity by 4.8 million spindles and streamlining textile
employment by 600,000 people. Actually, it dismantled 5.12 million
spindles, and laid off 660,000 textile workers.
</P>
<P>
However, the additional 4.4 million spindles it plans to smash
this year are mostly new and running at full capacity. A majority
of them are in mills in interior areas that are economically
lagging behind other parts of the country, and laid-off textile
workers will increase unemployment pressures in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Du said that the task of restructuring the textile industry in
the next three quarters of the year will be very arduous. The
State Administration of Textile Industry has already dispatched
work panels to various localities to supervise and push ahead the
dismantling of spindles.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that about two million more spindles will be
smashed in the first half of this year, increasing the total
number of dismantled spindles to about seven million for the 18-
month period.
</P>
<P>
He said that for the rest of the year, the textile industry
will focus on renovating product structures and exploring markets
in the rural areas, and in the fields of decorative and industrial
textiles. He also called on the industry to set up a number of
technological innovation projects to increase their
competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> International Labor Day Marked in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Vice President Hu Jintao extended
cordial greetings to all workers at a meeting held today marking
International Labor Day on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee,
delivered a keynote address at the celebration which was attended
by more than 3,000 people at the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Hu spoke highly of the great contributions the Chinese workers
have made to the Chinese revolution, construction and reform. He
said that the year 1999 is of special significance in Chinese
history, urging all workers to carry on their fine traditions, and
make greater efforts to deepen reform, promote economic
development, and maintain stability.
</P>
<P>
Reform is a powerful motive force to the socialist cause, and
also the key policy of decisive importance to China's future.
Improving state-owned enterprises is not only a major issue for
the national economy and long-term development, but also a major
political issue that concerns the prospects of the socialist
system, the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
He called on workers to advance in the face of difficulties,
and to unswervingly support the Party and the government in their
efforts to reform and restructure the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Stability is the basic prerequisite for reform and development,
and without stability nothing can be done, and the achievements we
have made could be lost, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He called on workers to dearly cherish the good political
situation of stable public order and social unity, to further
enhance their awareness of socialist democracy and law, and to
fight any attempts to jeopardize national unity, state security,
or social stability.
</P>
<P>
The vice president encouraged workers to learn more about
modern science and technology and improve themselves in order to
adapt to the fast-changing world and the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the workers' status as masters in enterprises
of public ownership will never be allowed to change, adding that
workers in non-state sectors are also masters of the State, and
their rights and interests must be protected.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 outstanding workers and collectives were presented
with awards at today's celebration.

<HEADLINE> Trade Minister Urges Guangdong to Export More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Trade Minister
Shi Guangsheng on Thursday urged south China's Guangdong Province
to increase exports and attract more overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Shi made the remark during a meeting with Guangdong Provincial
Governor Lu Ruihua and many other senior local government
officials. The meeting was also attended by Vice Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Ministers Chen Xinhua and Zhou Keren.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts must be made to expand exports and lure more overseas
investment by all possible means," Shi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that policies encouraging exports and overseas funds
must be implemented by down-to-earth measures to improve the
export mix and diversify the export market.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the legal rights and interests of export
enterprises and overseas-funded firms must be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong, a pioneer of China's market economy reforms, was the
country's largest exporter with a volume of more than 75 billion U.
S. dollars last year, 41.2 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the Asian financial crisis, however, Guangdong's
exports plunged 20.5 percent in the first quarter of this year,
with the rate for exports of general goods declining by as much as
55.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, China's exports totaled 37.2 billion U.S. dollars
in the first three months this year, down 7.9 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that contracted overseas
investment in China reached 8.72 billion U.S. dollars in the first
quarter, roughly the same as in the same period last year. The
quarterly volume of actual overseas investment in China, however,
declined 14.6 percent in the first three months.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missile Hits House in Sofia's Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A NATO missile slammed into a
suburb of Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, damaging a house but causing
no casualties, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The AGM-88-HARM air-to-surface missile hit through the roof of
a two-story house in the western suburb of Gorna Banya at 10:00 p.
m. on Wednesday night. A child suffered shock from scare.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the missile was launched by a NATO plane, Bulgarian
Defense Minister Georgi Ananiev told a press conference that
Bulgaria had informed NATO of the incident, urging bilateral
coordination to prevent a recurrence.
</P>
<P>
The radar system of the Bulgarian air force spotted a NATO
plane violating the country's airspace shortly before the missile
hit Gorna Banya.
</P>
<P>
There have been several reports of NATO missiles or missile
wrecks falling into Bulgaria's territory, but Thursday's incident
was the first to have occurred near the capital, which is only 45
kilometers from the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government has reached an agreement with NATO
allowing the alliance to use its airspace for attacks on
Yugoslavia. However, the agreement has yet to be ratified by the
parliament.

<HEADLINE> HK Public Confidence in Economy Improved: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite the difficult times,
public confidence in the economy has begun to improve in recent
weeks, Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Tsang told the media after chairing the Task Force on
Employment (Task Force) that contributing to the better economic
sentiments are the easing in bank liquidity and interest rates,
the stabilization of share and property prices, the tax rebate and
other measures in the budget and the results of the recent land
sales.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, whether this improvement is sustainable
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
At the Task Force on Employment, members were informed that the
number of tourist arrivals in the first three months of 1999 was
around 2.47 million, an increase of 13.4 percent as compared with
the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"A whole series of initiatives aimed at promoting Hong Kong to
visitors and enhancing Hong Kong's attractiveness has been planned
and will be actively pursued, " Tsang said. "These should
translate into more job opportunities in the industry."
</P>
<P>
As regards the capital market, small and medium enterprises
should find it easier to secure bank loans to tie over temporary
liquidity problems as a result of the improvement measures in the
Special Finance Scheme, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department's efforts to improve its employment
services have achieved encouraging results, according to Tsang. In
March, the department secured 13,000 job vacancies, an increase of
93 percent over the number secured in February. The number of
successful placements had also exceeded 3,500.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Set up Petroleum Export Free Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
scheduled to establish an oil and gas Export Free Zone to attract
international investors for the development of the country's
petroleum industry, This Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Nigeria's National Petroleum Investment
Management Services Grey Ero revealed this in a statement issued
at a briefing of the Exploitation and Production Committee for
Conferences in the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
Ero said that the export free zone would group together
industries operating in the oil and gas sector throughout west
Africa to facilitate registration to enter the oil and gas market.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the zone would also provide opportunities to
sell products and devices to the entire west African market, and
to stream stocks between various countries within the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Ero noted that "the Export Free Zone would guarantee free
movement of cargo arriving in the zone as it does not require
pre-inspection from countries of origin, exempts the operators in
the zone from taxes and permits repatriation of profits."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the zone would aid investors coming into
the country to help realize its dream of reaching a daily crude
oil production of four million barrels per day, and a target of 40
billion barrels reserve by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Ero will lead some members of the committee to debut at the
offshore technology conference in Houston, Texas of the United
States, from May 3 to 4 at which Nigeria would cash in on the
opportunity to showcase its huge oil and gas reserves and
incentives including the oil and gas Export Free Zone to the
world.

<HEADLINE> China Warns Local Governments To Cease Illegal Rural Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's central government has
announced it is stepping up the nationwide crack down on local
authorities that charge farmers excessive, unfair and often
illegal fees merely to try and fill their own coffers.
</P>
<P>
It has also warned that in cases considered serious offenses,
the heads of the local authorities and the persons held directly
responsible will be dealt with harshly according to the law.
</P>
<P>
As the Ministry of Finance prepares a major shake up of its
fiscal revenue system later this year it has targeted the practice
which it says places unfair burdens on the rural communities and
has warned in an urgent circular distributed to all government
institutions today that it will no longer tolerate these
activities.
</P>
<P>
It is part of the central government's efforts to flex its
macro-economic muscles by increasing the tax base. The central
government is in the process of pushing a proposal in this respect
through the National People's Congress (NPC), China's highest
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance also announced that it is drawing up a
series of regulations that will eliminate various levels of fees
that local authorities collect from farmers but says it will
substitute some of them with a nationally levied tax.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime one of the central government's primary
economic targets this year is to raise the income of farmers. It
is aware that the country's 900 million rural residents represent
a potentially huge growth area in terms of consumer demand for
boosting the economy which is still feeling the bite of the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, per capita income of rural residents has witnessed a
decreasing growth rate in the past two years, a situation the
government wants to reverse.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance pointed out in the hard-hitting
circular that a number of local authorities have continued to
increase the burden on farmers by wantonly forcing them to pay
excessive and irrational fees, despite being repeatedly prohibited
from doing so by the central government.
</P>
<P>
These fees, which are listed under the titles of "common
production," "universal service" and "labor substitution", go far
beyond the percentage that the central government allows rural
authorities to levy on the average income of local farmers, it
points out.
</P>
<P>
In particular the Ministry has also insisted that local
authorities stop immediately collecting four kinds of fees related
to the enrollment of children into rural schools, three kinds for
housing construction and a further three demanded when a marriage
is registered.
</P>
<P>
"All these fees are illegal and irrational and must be wiped
out. All the proceeds from levying these illegal fees must be
turned over to the treasury," the Ministry stressed.
</P>
<P>
It asks local authorities to stop imposing any new levies on
farmers until the end of 2000 and now requires them to publicize
details of fees collected.

<HEADLINE> China Largest Auctioneer Sells Lots Worth 51 Million Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's largest auction house
today announced that its latest auctions did business worth some
51.53 million yuan (6.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
China Guardian Auctions Company sold roughly 60 percent of its
offered lots, including the featured oil painting by Chen Yifei
called Lingering Melodies from the Xunyang River, which fetched 2.
97 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese traditional painting titled Lijiang River -
Sailing Home, created by the late renowned painter Li Keran, was
also hotly bid for at last week's auctions. A domestic businessman
paid 1.76 million yuan to obtain this master's work.
</P>
<P>
A painting by Zhang Zongcang, a well-known imperial painter of
the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), was sold for over one million yuan,
almost doubling the auctioneers' previous estimate of 550,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four volumes of ancient books dating back to the
Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), aroused heated competition
among potential buyers and were finally sold for 1.76 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guardian Auctioneers also sold jewelry and ornaments without
open bidding prices, and these items also attracted many
collectors to the auctions.
</P>
<P>
The auction house also promoted a special stamp auction marking
the China 1999 World Philatelic Exhibition in August.
</P>
<P>
The company's president Wang Yannan said that she is satisfied
with the results, especially since the auction market has been
somewhat sluggish.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Local Councils Start Work Amid Factional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Amid spiraling factional
struggles, Iran's first local councils officially started work on
Thursday morning with a ceremony in Tehran attended by President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Showing his support for the local councils, Khatami cited the
councils as a symbol of national unity and pledged to continue his
open-minded policies and to keep his promises made to the Iranian
people.
</P>
<P>
The nation should be trusted and granted freedom and an
atmosphere should be created in which people can determine their
own fate, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Khatami as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president lashed out at his conservative opponents,
saying that there is an interpretation in which a certain group
intends to preserve special privileges for itself and to impose
its preferences on others.
</P>
<P>
This interpretation of unity will never lead to stability and
calm in the society, he said, adding that if the society is
expected to enjoy calm and comfort, people's rights should be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said
in a message that the local councils, which are responsible for
choosing local chief administrators, should refrain from being
involved in political and factional disputes.
</P>
<P>
The involvement in any measure, which affects the unity of
council members, is harmful to the councils, he said, adding that
the council members should fully recognize their responsibilities
and make efforts to realize them.
</P>
<P>
The councils for cities, towns and villages throughout the
country held their first meetings after the Interior Ministry
rejected the latest bid by the conservatives to disqualify five
leading moderate figures from Tehran's city council.
</P>
<P>
The elections supervision committee on Monday confirmed the
result of the February 26 local elections, the first ever since
the Islamic revolution in 1979, but it nullified the elections of
five moderates, including former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri,
a close ally of Khatami, for lacking qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The supervision committee claimed that it disqualified the five
candidates elected to Tehran city council because they had never
been approved to run for the city council.
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Ministry replied on Wednesday that the
committee has no mandate to disqualify candidates after the poll
and warned against any move to "disturb" public opinion.
</P>
<P>
The elections for local councils were seen in Iran as a major
success for Khatami's political reforms as his supporters took
over most of the council seats throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers noted that the disputes over the five
members of Tehran city council would further intensify the
already heated factional struggles between the moderates and the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Following their political setback in the local elections, the
conservatives, which still dominate most of the country's state
organs, will not forgo any opportunity to strengthen their
positions and marginalize the moderates, they said.

<HEADLINE> China Adopts Law on Administrative Appeals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese citizens will be entitled
to appeal against government infringement of their rights and
interests, and also against "illegal" government documents,
according to the Law on Administrative Appeals adopted today.
</P>
<P>
The 7-chapter, 43-article law will take effect on October 1
this year with a presidential decree signed by President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Citizens may also choose to file lawsuits with the courts if
they believe their appeals were inappropriately handled, or appeal
to a higher level of the government, as high as to the State
Council, the new law says.
</P>
<P>
These reforms represent "major breakthroughs" for China in its
effort to defend the legitimate rights and interests of the people
and demand that government bodies obey the law, observers in
Beijing said.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts pointed out that judicial review and involvement
of the highest level of government will help to abolish the
negative influence of departmentalism and local interests, and
serve to safeguard justice.
</P>
<P>
This law is also applicable to complaints raised by foreigners
and overseas organizations in China.
</P>
<P>
The law states that citizens, and companies and other
organizations may appeal against government documents if they are
considered to have caused an infringement on their legitimate
rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
All government documents can be appealed against, except those
signed by the premier, ministers, and provincial governors, which,
according to law, are subject to examination by national or local
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Government documents were considered as laws at the time when
there was no actual legal system in China. And even today, they
remain powerful.
</P>
<P>
Legislators said in discussions that the most common complaints
of the public, such as the essentially illegal collections of
exorbitant fees by local governments, directly derive from "
illegal" and unreasonable government orders and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes these law-breaking activities on the part of certain
government employees are carried out in obedience to written
government orders, they said.
</P>
<P>
The new law allows greater convenience for those bringing
complainants, and holds government bodies accountable for
efficiency and fairness in handling complaints.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also said that with the law on administrative
procedure, administrative punishment, and state compensation
already in place, the new legislation will further complement
China's legal system for human- rights protection, and promote
government that is "clean, honest and efficient."

<HEADLINE> Tripartite Meeting on Gas Pipeline Held in Islamabad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A tripartite meeting involving
Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan on a massive gas pipeline
project was held here Thursday with the three parties renewing
their strong commitment to the project.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Nisar Ali Khan, Pakistan's minister
for petroleum and natural resources, Batyr Sardjaev, deputy prime
minister of Turkmenistan, Redjepbai Arzov, Turkmenistan's minister
for oil, and Ahmed Jan, the Taliban official for industries and
mines.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have agreed that the 2-billion-U.S.-dollar
gas pipeline project will have an immediate positive impact on the
current situation prevailing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A joint declaration issued after the meeting said the
implementation of the project will not only help restore peace in
Afghanistan but also give an impetus to the process of the
economic revival of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
The planned 1,280-kilometer gas pipeline is designed to carry
gas to Pakistan from Turkmenistan via Afghanistan. It will connect
the Dauletabad gas field in southeastern Turkmenistan to Multan in
Pakistan's Punjab Province.
</P>
<P>
The gas pipeline, which will be 48 inches in diameter, is
designed to carry 20 billion cubic meters of gas every year.
</P>
<P>
It is the first major investment in Afghanistan in the last two
decades and will run through the west and south of the country
which is now under the Taliban's control.
</P>
<P>
"This project will definitely have long-lasting positive
effects not only for the participating countries but also for the
people of the entire region," said the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
The three parties agreed to meet every three months to review
progress and take required decisions.
</P>
<P>
They reaffirmed their resolve to work closely to expedite the
start of the project at the earliest time.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Rebels Claim Capturing Northern Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A rebel leader in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) Thursday claimed that his forces had
captured Bondo, a town in northern DRC, driving the government
troops to flight, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Bemba, the rebel leader who is reportedly supported
by Uganda, said his Congolese Liberation Movement forces took
Bondo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that his forces had put to flight the troops loyal to
DRC President Laurent Kabila, adding that they hald taken the
smaller town of Kateke in the same area Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader said that his forces would continue to
advance. "We want to control all the north of the country before
getting down to Kinshasa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bemba disclosed that he had no plans to attend a planned
Congolese national debate in Kenyan capital Nairobi next month,
dismissing it as "unrepresentative".
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebels who were allegedly supported by Rwanda and
Uganda took up arms against Kabila early last August and now hold
much of the east and the north of the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
Bemba emerged at the head of a separate group in the north
later. Another rebel leader is Chairman of the main rebel
movement Congolese Democratic Coalition, Wamba dia Wamba, a former
professor in a Tanzanian university.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress, said here today
that China cherishes its good-neighborly friendship and
cooperation with Thailand and will continue efforts to push
forward this traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, Li said both China and Thailand are developing Asian
countries, and share many common points. Thailand is China's
reliable partner and neighbor, he added.
</P>
<P>
Li, who recently visited Thailand, expressed thanks for the
warm hospitality he received during his stay, saying he felt once
again the profound friendship that Thai people cherish with the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the National People's Congress has maintained
close contact with the Thai parliament. And he expressed the
conviction that through the exchange of visits and contacts at
various levels, relations between the two legislatures will be
consolidated. China welcomes more Thai parliament members to come
and visit, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chuan highly praised Li's recent visit, saying it has kept the
momentum of high-level contact, and further tightened relations
between the two countries.
</P>

trusting partnership with Asean is an important part of China's
overall foreign policy. Since China became a full-dialogue partner
in Asean in 1996, their mutually beneficial cooperation in various
fields has been increased, and they have consulted and cooperated
with each other in both regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is quite satisfied with this, Li said, adding that his
country supports Asean unity and its active role in the world
arena, and hopes to intensify China's cooperation with the
organization in many fields.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand Vow to Expand Trade and Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China and Thailand have agreed to
expand mutual trade and investment, saying it will benefit both
economies in the wake of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here today with Zeng Peiyan, minister in
charge of the State Development Planning Commission, visiting Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said that Thailand hopes to increase
exports to China and that more Chinese investments would come to
his country.
</P>
<P>
Stricken by the economic crisis last year, Thailand's economy
declined 7.8 percent in 1998, but is now well on the road to
recovery. Thailand is expected to have an economic growth rate of
close to one percent this year, said the Thai prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Thailand supports China's early entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) this year, saying this will help
build a better world trade system.
</P>
<P>
Zeng said that China was also hit hard by the economic crisis
last year, resulting in a decline of exports and a sluggish
domestic market. He said an increase of trade and investment
between China and Thailand will benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister and Zeng also exchanged ideas on the
possibility of establishing two joint ventures, one a paper-pulp
mill and the other a potash fertilizer plant, in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Chuan today, Yu Xiaosong, president
of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (
CCPIT), said he anticipates that more Chinese investors will come
to Thailand, as China recently simplified procedures for overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between China and Thailand hit 3.515 billion U.
S. dollars in 1997, with China importing 2.015 billion U.S.
dollars of Thai goods and exporting 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth
of Chinese goods to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
China's exports to Thailand plummeted 23.5 percent last year as
a result of the Asian financial crisis, reaching only 1.148
billion U.S. dollars. At the same time, however, Thai exports to
China surged 19.8 percent to 2.413 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter this year saw an increase in both imports and
exports between China and Thailand. China's exports to Thailand
topped 267 million U.S. dollars, up 6.7 percent, and imports from
Thailand were 583 million U.S. dollars, up 13.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Aid Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Most of the 62 Tibet aid projects
set up by the Chinese government have been completed and the rest
are expected to be completed within this year, said Li Dezhu,
Minster of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission today.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses NPC's Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng
stressed here today that supervision by the legislature is still
very weak and in urgent need of improvement and enhancement.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), made the statement at the four-day NPC session,
which concluded this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The general thinking of the NPC's guidelines for this year is
to place equal emphasis on legal supervision and the formulating
of laws, while enhancing and improving supervisions, and
supporting the major policy of reforms, developments and stability,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that first of all, efforts must be made to raise the
importance of the supervisory role played by the NPC.
</P>
<P>
"The NPC's supervision constitutes an important part of the
country's efforts at ruling the country by laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Its aim is to help the administrative and judicial departments
work according to the laws, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The top legislator stressed that the NPC should first of all
work for the party's central work, and focus its efforts on major
social issues.
</P>
<P>
This year, the NPC will inspect the implementation of four laws
concerning air pollution, forestry, the quality of products and
compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, we should also put emphasis on the
effectiveness of supervision," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Li also revealed that the top legislature is planning to draft
a law on the NPC's supervision, which could help regulate and
improve NPC's performance in this aspect.

<HEADLINE> Clone Technology Expected to Be Used in Water Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Clone and other biological
technologies may be used in controlling pollution of rivers and
lakes, Chinese environment experts said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Huiguang, director of the Yunnan Institute of
Environmental Sciences, said that the technology has made it
possible the transition of China's agriculture from traditional to
ecological agriculture.
</P>
<P>
By means of clone technology, he said, some bacteria can be
turned into a kind of bacterial fertilizer to absorb and solidify
nutritious substances in soil and air.
</P>
<P>
"The bacteria fertilizer will not cause pollution as chemical
fertilizer does. On the contrary, it can provide plants with
balanced full range of nutrients," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Plants will grow stronger and become more resistant to
diseases and pests and their quality will be much improved," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria have the functions of solidifying nitrogen in soil
and air and to dissolve phosphorus and potassium that are
essential to plant growth.
</P>
<P>
Guo, also deputy director of the Chinese Research &AMP; Engineering
Center of Lake Environment, said that he still insisted on banning
sale and use of phosphorus-containing washing powder around the
Dianchi Lake in Kunming and urged to tackle another pollution
source, fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
As the sixth largest lake in China, the 307 square kilometer
Dianchi Lake is situated in the southwestern part of Kunming City,
capital of Yunnan Province. The Chinese government has set the
goal of totally controlling the pollution in the three major lakes
including the Dianchi Lake.
</P>
<P>
One of major polluting sources to the lake is chemical
fertilizer, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 70 to 80 percent of the chemical fertilizers applied are
washed away into rivers and lakes, he said.
</P>
<P>
In China, a large agricultural country in the world, more than
half of the pollutants to rivers, lakes and seas come from farm
production.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the abuse of chemical fertilizer hardens the
soil.
</P>
<P>
Dai Li, a researcher engaged in bacteria fertilizer at Guo's
institute, said that parsley (celery) with bacteria fertilizer
grows better than that with chemical fertilizer," Dai added.
</P>
<P>
As bacteria fertilizer can turn solid nitrogen in soil into
ionic nitrogen which can be easily absorbed by plants, it is
suitable for application to hardened soil.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tao, an engineer at the Yunnan Institute of Environmental
Sciences, said that no matter what kinds of bacteria are used to
make fertilizer, the biological technology is the key to reducing
pollution in rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
To check the pollution in the Dianchi Lake, Zhang Tao and his
colleagues are planning to open up a lakeside belt with swamps or
shallow waters to raise water plants.
</P>
<P>
"The water plants can further lower the proportion of nitrogen,
phosphorus and potassium in the polluted water and let clean water
run into lakes," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is convinced that the biological technology
applied to pollution control project in Dianchi Lake will set an
example in the country.

<HEADLINE> SADC Troops to Withdraw from Lesotho </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Security forces from South
Africa and Botswana, under the auspices of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) will begin their withdrawal from
Lesotho on April 30 or Friday.
</P>
<P>
A South African government press release said Thursday that the
 withdrawal is expected to complete by May 15.
</P>
<P>
However, the release said, a SADC training team will remain in
the kingdom in order to assist with the reconstruction and
training of the Lesotho Defense Force.
</P>
<P>
The 14-member SADC has agreed that South Africa and Botswana
will each create a standby force for rapid intervention until the
next elections in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho fell into a political and social crisis last September
following a sharp disputes between the government and the
opposition parties over the May election result which was in favor
of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
A decision to intervene was taken after a written request from
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili to the heads of state of
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Six hundred troops from South Africa and 200 Botswanan soldiers
were sent to Lesotho on September 22 to help the government of the
country restore stability and order.

MADRID, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid and Juventus have had
a talk on a swap trade involving several top footballers of the
two giant clubs on Thursday in Barcelona, Spain, Spanish
newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
Real president Lorenzo Sanz and Juve vice-president Roberto
Bettega will talk for a series of transfers, seeing Real putting

while Juventus likely packing Paolo Montero, or even Zinedine
Zidane.
</P>
<P>
Juventus focuses on the 23-year-old Dutch Seedorf, whom Real
rates at 3,000 million pesetas (19.16 million U.S. dollars) for a
player-plus-cash deal with Uruguayan defender Montero.
</P>
<P>
Real would like to acquire world footballer of the year Zidane,
which will be a complicated one.
</P>
<P>
Real also wants to trade Brazilian left back Carlos or Yugoslav
striker Mijatovic plus around 2,000 million pesetas (12.77 million

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added Chinese Legislature Rejects Draft Amendments to Highway Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Planned reforms of China's
Highway Law which would have replaced existing road tolls with
fuel taxes have been rejected because of fears they could place
extra financial burdens on the country's farmers which the central
government has pledged to ease.
</P>
<P>
However, it was a close run issue with only one vote tipping
the balance when China's top legislative body, the Standing
Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), met today
to consider the draft amendments.
</P>
<P>
The legislature rejected the draft amendments proposed by the
State Council for fear that it could result in unjustifiable
burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were drawn up by the State Council but of the 125
members of the NPC Standing Committee present at the meeting, 77
voted for, six voted against the draft law, and 42 abstained.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, with a total of 154 members of the
Standing Committee, 78 votes are required to have a bill approved.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers were generally in favor of such a reform,
believing it would help reduce the random and sometime exorbitant
fees collected along the country's highways.
</P>
<P>
However, they also agreed that if it was adopted farmers would
have to pay out more for using farm machines, which obviously need
fuel, and this would put a heavier economic burden on their
already difficult finances.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with the NPC Standing Committee, the
State Council attached great importance to the opinions of the
legislators. After preliminary discussions of the law last year,
the government formed a special investigation team to improve and
refine their reform plan.
</P>
<P>
However, at this session of the NPC meeting, many legislators
still aired their worries and concerns that the problem has not
been completely solved.
</P>
<P>
The legislature said that it will advise the State Council to
further revise the reform plan and table the draft law for further
discussions at future legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
"The failure to pass the draft law today was an indication that
the lawmakers are very earnest and responsible, and China's
legislation is democratic," an official with NPC Standing
Committee said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, this was the second draft law that
the national legislature has rejected in the last decade. The
first was focused on urban neighborhood committees during the term
of office of the Seventh NPC Standing Committee (1988-1993).

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Prepares for All Africa Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has started
preparing the 7th All Africa Games due to be taking place in
Johannesburg between September 10 and 19, the Star newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Danie Malan, chief executive officer of the Games, said at a
function in Johannesburg Wednesday that the organizing committee
would try to make the All Africa Games the biggest and best of its
kind in African continent.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a failed bid to host the Olympics, Malan said: "we
are determined to show the prophets of doom that South Africa can
succeed."
</P>
<P>
"Once these All Africa Games have proven successful, doors will
open for future Olympic bids, and South Africa's hopes of hosting
the 2006 World Cup (soccer) finals will have been given a
tremendous boost," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malan also quoted economists as saying that the Games would
boost the economy of South Africa to the tune of three billion
rand (500 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (ABSA) announced at the
party that it would be launching some 15 initiatives over the
coming weeks to create awareness of the important sport event
among the general public.
</P>
<P>
"The All Africa Games are the Olympics of Africa, but the
average man on the street does not see them this way, and we aim
to change that perception, " said Brendan O'Donnell, ABSA's
marketing and sales general manager.
</P>
<P>
As part of the company's campaign, ABSA will be publishing a
comprehensive information booklet in mid-August which will contain
details on every aspect of the event, including maps, venues,
timetables and competition schedules.
</P>
<P>
Also the banking group will purchase two of the units in the
athletes' village overlooking the Alexandra black township, the
village will become a low-cost housing development after the
Games, and all competitors will have a chance to win one.

<HEADLINE> Stop Air Strikes, Start Talks on Balkans, Says Russian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A halt to NATO's air strikes is
the main condition for the start of negotiations to solve the
Balkan crisis, Russian president's Kosovo envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin said here Thursday before boarding a plane for Bonn
on a two-day mediation mission in Germany, Italy and Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Yugoslav government has agreed to an
international presence in Kosovo under the U.N. auspices and
widely joined by Russia, while preparing a phased withdrawal of
Serbian troops from Kosovo and to grant broad autonomy to the
province.
</P>
<P>
It is now time for NATO to take effective measures, and, above
all, to stop air strikes against Yugoslavia, Chernomyrdin
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he was taking to Bonn and Rome "concrete
proposals about solving the Balkan crisis which have been agreed
on with the president (Boris Yeltsin)."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Ambassador to Russia Borislav Milosevic, who saw
Chernomyrdin off at the airport, said Belgrade allows the entry
into Kosovo of an observation team composed of civil servants
under the U.N. flag and with wide Russian presence.
</P>
<P>
He cited Belarus, India, Cyprus and Argentina as well as
African and other Latin American countries as among those that can
send representatives to the observation team. But he said NATO
members countries involved in the bombing of Yugoslavia must be
kept off the team, stressing that the constitution of the U.N.
team must be approved by the Yugoslav government.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Prime Minister Leaves for Official Visit to United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi left here Thursday evening for a week-long visit to the
United States for talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on
economic issues and global affairs.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which will take Obuchi to Los Angeles, Chicago and
Washington, is the first official visit to the United States by a
Japanese prime minister in 12 years, although Japanese prime
ministers often make working trips to the country.
</P>
<P>
Economic issues are expected to be a major topic of the summit
between Obuchi and Clinton scheduled for Monday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi plans to explain Japan's efforts to achieve its avowed
target of 0.5 percent economic growth in the current fiscal year,
but Washington, which is skeptical of Japan's economic recovery,
is expected to push for further stimulus measures, Japanese
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda of their talks are security issues,
including the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation guidelines,
under which Japan will provide new military support to U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are also expected to reaffirm the importance of
maintaining close cooperation among Japan, South Korea and the
United States in dealing with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), the officials said.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Obuchi will explain Japan's efforts in helping
refugees fleeing the war-torn Yugoslav province, including a fresh
aid package expected to be announced next week, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Refutes Report of Rift With Rwanda in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Defense Ministry has
refuted the media reports that Rwandan army had recently killed 11
Ugandan soldiers deployed in eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Barigye Ba-hoku, press assistant to State Minister of Defense
Steven Kavuma, told Xinhua in a telephone interview Thursday
morning that the reports are purely fabrication.
</P>
<P>
He said:"We do not have any rift with our Rwandan friends in
the DRC. It must be part of Kabila's propaganda work. If we have
any rift with each other, we would not be together there."
</P>
<P>
The New Vision Thursday also reported that the Rwandan
authorities denied killing Ugandan troops in the DRC. It quoted
Rwanda Army Spokesman Emmanuel Ndahiro as describing the report as
groundless.
</P>
<P>
The Monitor daily Thursday said that Leon Kasonga, spokesman
for the Congolese Armed Forces, had told state television that the
Rwandan troops had opened fire on Ugandan soldiers in Camp Ketele
in the rebel-held third city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda are said to back the rebellion aimed at
ousting President Laurent Kabila and they deployed troops in
eastern DRC, allegedly for the sake of their borders' safety.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports from time to time on the alleged rift
between Rwandan and Ugandan troops there. But these reports have
all been refuted by army authorities of the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar has commenced a nationwide valedictory tour
of military installations before the scheduled hand-over of power
to a democratically- elected civil government on May 29.
</P>
<P>
Addressing military personnel and police officers in Ibadan,
capital of Oyo State, he stressed the need for military men to
subordinate themselves to civil leadership as they go back to the
barracks, The Post Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said that it was desirable for the military
to go back to the barracks, detach themselves from politics and
face their assignments as defined in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar noted that "during the cold war period, the military
received supports, but now no new military government will enjoy
any support locally and internationally," adding the era of
coup-making was gone for ever.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, he announced that the various special task
forces set up by his administration would all be disbanded by the
end of May and their members sent back to the barracks.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Take in 2nd Group of Refugees, But Only 160 in Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A second group of ethnic Albanian
refugees from Kosovo is due to arrive in Britain from Macedonia
later Thursday, but consisting of only 160 people, press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
The 160 people, including some 20 children, are to be housed in
two refugee centers in central England.
</P>
<P>
Although Prime Minster Tony Blair has said repeatedly that
NATO's bombing on Yugoslavia was intended to save the refugees,
they were actually pouring out of Kosovo only after the air
strikes began.
</P>
<P>
Since the air strikes began a month ago, hundreds of thousands
of refugees have been on exodus from Kosovo, with Britain only
taking in its first wave of 161 people last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, has
urged Britain to harbor more of the refugees who have overwhelmed
the meager resources of neighboring countries like Macedonia and
Albania.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Liberal Democrats have criticized the government for
little action on receiving refugees, noting that Germany has
already taken in 10,000 refugees.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Increase Share in African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's equity share in the
African Development Bank (ADB) will be increased in the immediate
future to demonstrate its commitment to the development of the
African economies, according to a senior Nigerian official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of an international workshop here
Wednesday, National Planning Minister Chief Rasheed Gbadamosi said
that if Nigeria increases its equity in ADB, it would serve as a
better and surer way of establishing some influence on the African
scene, This Day newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted at the workshop on the ADB that "the
much-touted perception of Nigeria as the giant of Africa can only
be realized through its contributions and influence in
sub-regional and regional organizations such as ECOWAS (Economic
Community of West African States) Fund and ADB".
</P>
<P>
At present, Nigeria is the largest African shareholder with
about 10 percent equity. African owners have 60 percent equity
shares of the ADB while non-Africans control the remaining 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides its substantial equity in the ADB, Nigeria also
established the Nigerian Trust Fund in 1976 with a resource base
of more than 400 million U. S. dollars managed by the ADB to
provide assistance to needy African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the ADB group has demonstrated its
commitment to the development of African economies, having
committed 2.7 billion dollars to 28 projects and studies in
Nigeria between 1986 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Gbadamosi noted that the continued emphasis by the ADB on
economic integration within the framework of African Policy Reform
will provide an important market outlet for Nigeria's industrial
products.
</P>
<P>
"There is a potential for expanding Nigeria's industrial
capacity to meet the additional demand that will result from
regional economic integration," he added.
</P>
<P>
ADB member countries are expected to converge in Cairo on May
25 this year to work out modalities for increasing working capital
by 35 percent from 21 million dollars to 28.5 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> High Quality Test Results Made Known </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's State Bureau of Quality
and Technical Supervision today expressed satisfaction with the
quality of products made by large state-owned and foreign-funded
enterprises in the first quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
A series of quality tests conducted by the bureau shows that a
relatively high ratio of these products have met strict targets
and some have even been given a 100 percent approval rate.
</P>
<P>
The bureau announced the results today, after selectively
examining more than 2,000 products of more than 1,500 enterprises.
The average qualification rate is 77.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The test showed that 93 percent of the products made by large
enterprises are qualified while the products of medium-sized and
small enterprises are given a qualification rate of 83 percent and
70 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the tests, 86.5 percent of the products of the
state-owned enterprises and 87 percent of those of the foreign-
funded ones are qualified, while private firms only have 36.6
percent of their products pass the tests.
</P>
<P>
Among the 42 kinds of products under examination, color
kinescope, car radial-type tires and petrol are 100 percent
qualified. The main problems lie in the quality of some
agricultural capital goods which are not ideal, and petrol
products are expected to fully meet the standards laid down for
environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will hold elections to
the Southern Provincial Council (SPC) on June 10 following polls
to six provincial councils early this year, the Commissioner of
Elections announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"There are 707 candidates in the contest to compete for 55
seats including two bonus seats," said Commissioner Dayananda
Dissanayake.
</P>
<P>
Nominations for the SPC closed at noon Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ten recognized political parties and nine independent groups
are contesting in the polls to the provincial council which
consists of the three districts of Galle, Matara and Hambantota.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the main battle will be fought between the
ruling People's Alliance (PA) and the main opposition United
National Party (UNP), while the People's Liberation Front or
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will pose as the third force.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka held the North Western Provincial Council elections
on January 25, with the PA beating the UNP with a big margin.
</P>
<P>
On April 6, the PA swept the polls in the Western, North
Central, Central, Uva and Sabaragamuwa provincial councils,
defeating the UNP with a small margin. However, the JVP staged a
comeback with 15 seats in the five provinces.

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Discusses Draft on Macao Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The drafting of a law related to
the garrisoning of troops in Macao is necessary and should be
approved as soon as possible, said participants in the ninth
session of China's top legislature today.
</P>
<P>
Liang Guangda, a member of the Standing Committee of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), said the draft is of
great importance to Macao's return to the motherland in December
this year and to the motherland's ultimate unification.
</P>
<P>
"Stationing troops in Macao will not only help maintain social
stability, but will also create a good investment and living
environment there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang expressed the hope that the draft will become law in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Tong Zhiguang, also a member of the committee, said that
stationing troops in the Macao Special Administrative Region is of
symbolic significance to the world.
</P>
<P>
Some members saw much similarity between the draft and the law
concerning stationing troops in Hong Kong, which is being
implemented smoothly there.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which is an improvement over the law on stationing
troops in Hong Kong, will also see smooth implementation, they
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled on
Singapore Stock Market Thursday, giving up some of the hefty gains
it made over the past month.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index was down 18.67 points to
1,818.49 at the close, weaker but well off the intraday low of
1,781.25 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume decreased to 512.63 million shares valued at
647.48 million Singapore dollars (380.83 million U.S. dollars).
Decliners outstripped advancers by 243 to 85 with 110 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 68.80-million stock parcel by the
PohTiong which was transacted at 0.375 Singapore dollars per
share. Poh Lian was the second most heavily traded stock with a
turnover of 15.74 million units. GES was the next which saw 14.93
million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Hwa Hong was the top mover of the day running up 33 cents to

cents to end at 9.35 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market index had earlier tumbled 3.1
percent but the rebound in Hong Kong helped the local market to
cut some of its losses.
</P>
<P>
They said this is the first serious correction since the latest
market rally began, noting bank and property shares were the first
to rise and the first to get hit on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the correction to growing concerns over the
stretched valuation which will allow a more sustained correction.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Bombing of Yugoslavia Blocks Disarmament (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Association
for Peace and Disarmament (CPAPD) expressed here today great
indignation and strong condemnation over the United States and
NATO's brutality against the Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
"The military actions of NATO, headed by the United States, is
escalating at present," said an announcement by CPAPD. "NATO's air
strikes against Yugoslavia have caused heavy casualties and loss
of property in Yugoslavia and millions of refugees have lost their
homes."
</P>
<P>
Since March 24 when NATO began its air strikes against
Yugoslavia, the Chinese people, who always love peace and oppose
aggression, have expressed a sense of justice and sympathy by
showing their deep concern over the developing situation,
condemning NATO's military actions in various ways and expressing
sympathy and support for the Yugoslav people, the announcement
said.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese people firmly support the stand of opposing the war
and peaceful settlement of the Kosovo issue which is maintained by
the Chinese government and President Jiang Zemin, " it noted. "We
also support their efforts to this end. "
</P>
<P>
It pointed out the NATO, which is conducting military actions
against a sovereign state, has violated the international law, and
its act of bullying a small country by using the strongest
military strength and most advanced weapons contradicts natural
human justice.
</P>
<P>
CPAPD cited NATO's act as an anti-humanitarian one with the
excuse of safeguarding humanitarianism, and aggression on the
pretext of settling ethnic conflicts.

<HEADLINE> NATO's Bombing of Yugoslavia Blocks Disarmament (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NATO's action embodies the hegemonism and power politics, and
the "gunboat policy", which has completely gone against peace and
the development trends of the world.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War, the international situation began to ease,
and with the dismantling of the Warsaw Pact, NATO lost the
foundation for its existence, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the western countries headed by the United States has
stubbornly stuck to the Cold War mentality by expanding and
strengthening military alliances in Europe and Asia, and the
United States has also largely increased its military expenditure
and speeded up its research of hi-tech weaponry including missile
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States and its military allies have
increased their military interference in other countries' internal
affairs in order to spread their own values and pursued their own
selfish interests in the region and in the world at large, while
safeguard their hegemony, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The act, which goes against historic trends, has seriously
threatened international security, shattered the international and
regional strategic balance, and brought a great threat to world
peace and development in the 21st century," it said. "This should
make other peoples maintain a sharp vigilance over these actions."
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Kosovo is resulted from the wanton
interference of the western countries into the internal affairs of
Yugoslavia by imposing their will on others and disregarding the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
It continued that NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia have
trampled on the classical principles enshrined in the UN Charter,
which include: aggression is the most serious crime against peace,
the border of a country is sacred and inviolable, any country can
not interfere in other's internal affairs, and all countries have
the right to guard against splitting.
</P>
<P>
NATO's wanton support of the splitist forces has set a vile
example for international relations, it added.

<P>
In fact, the act has thrown away the international organization
and multilateral institution which have been playing the most
important role in maintaining world peace and stability. Therefore,
it has imposed an adverse influence on international relations,
the announcement noted.
</P>
<P>
The military expanse of the United States and its alliance has
also obstructed the disarmament cause and the international
military control, and blocked the development of the world's
economy because it will contain the sound trend of disarmament and
economic development appeared after the Cold War, and it is
possible to cause another round of armament race, it added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the war has not only seriously damaged the
economy of Yugoslavia, but also brought a heavy burden to the
economies of other countries in the Balkan region and relevant
NATO countries, it noted.
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, peace and development is the
common aspiration of the people in the world and follow the trends
of the time," it said. "Power politics and hegemonism is unpopular.
"
</P>
<P>
In the last month, the large-scale anti-war movements in many
countries in the world, especially in the NATO countries, have
reflected people's opposition to the war and their call for the
peace, it said, adding that urging NATO to halt the military
attack and peacefully solve the Kosovo problem has become the
common aspiration of most people in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that justice will overcome evil and peace
will beat the war," it said. "Justice stands on the side of the
Yugoslav people and the victory will be won by the brave and
glorious Yugoslav people."

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Up Offshore Natural Gas Development(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up efforts to
develop offshore natural gas in the country's coastal areas, in a
bid to adjust its energy structure and increase the supply of
clean and high-quality energy for the developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao Xiuguang, a senior official with the China
National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC), Shanghai and the provinces of
Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu are the most economically
vibrant coastal regions in China, with a 13 to 19 percent annual
increase on average in their GDPs, far exceeding the national
average.
</P>
<P>
Their combined energy demand will top 360 million tons of coal
by the year 2000, 470 million tons by 2005, and 610 million tons
by 2010, said the expert, stressing that developing offshore
natural gas is important for sustained economic growth in the
region.
</P>
<P>
However, for a long time, the use of coal has caused problems
for the environment and transport in coastal areas, and it should
be replaced as a matter of some urgency with clean and efficient
natural gas to meet the needs of continued economic expansion, the
expert said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is very rich in offshore natural gas
reserves, and the country has developed a group of important gas
production centers in the South China Sea, Bohai Sea and the East
China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that the western part of the South China
Sea is a key gas source and four gas fields and 15 gas-bearing
structures have been found there.
</P>
<P>
The Nanyacheng 13-1 gas field off the island province of Hainan
now provides 2.9 billion cu m of natural gas for the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region annually via a 780-km sub-sea
pipeline, and 500 million cu m of gas for the province's
fertilizer plants and power plants via a 100-km pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the western sea area of the South China Sea will
add three billion cu m of gas by year 2005, and another three
billion cu m by 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
had launched a 500-million-Australian dollar (about 326.5 million
U.S. dollar) public bond issue in the Australian domestic bond
market, a news release of ADB said Thursday.

According to ADB, the bond issue, launched on Wednesday with a
coupon rate of 5.25 percent per annum payable semiannually and a

<HEADLINE> PLO Central Council Delays Decision on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Central Council has decided to postpone making
a final decision on the declaration of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
In a statement adopted in Thursday's session, the council
decided to reconvene meeting in June, after Israel's May 27
elections, and make its final decision on the statehood issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement said, the council has decided to form
committees charged with preparation works for statehood, such as
formulating the constitution and election laws.
</P>
<P>
The council strongly criticized Israel for not implementing the
sighed agreements with the Palestinians and for its expansion of
Jewish settlements, demolition of Palestinians' homes, and
confiscation of their lands in the occupied territories, it said.
</P>
<P>
The council has authorized the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) and other Palestinian institutions to take proper measures
to react to those Israeli policies, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process, it said that moving the peace process
forward is the national policy of the Palestinian people and they
will continue the peace talks with Israel under signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced the Israeli government's decision to
close several Palestinian offices in the Orient House in East
Jerusalem, saying those offices are absolutely legal.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed thanks to those countries which have
voiced their support to the Palestinian people's right of
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the statement mentioned the United States for
its recent policy towards the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It thanked U.S. President Bill Clinton for his letter to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in which he called for
accelerated Israel-Palestinian final-status talks to be concluded
within a year and for his recognization of the Palestinian
people's right of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed its thanks to Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,
the spiritual leader of the radical Palestinian Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), saying his participation in the council meeting
as an observer represented a big step forward in the direction of
national reconciliation, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the importance of legal constructions of
various national institutions and the formulation of laws.
</P>
<P>
The 124-member council on Tuesday started discussing the issue
on whether to declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4,
when the five-year transitional period stipulated in the 1993 Oslo
accords expires.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has stated many times in the past that he has the right
to do so under the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes the idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank now under its control if the Palestinians take
unilateral steps in this respect.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A rally in resources stocks was
not enough to drag the Australian sharemarket into positive
territory Friday as major industrial shares slid lower.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the market continued to trade on sentiment created
Wednesday by inflation figures that appeared to dash hopes of an
interest rate cut in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index fell 17.8 points to 3,104.9,
down from an intra-day high of 3,127.4 points.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian sharemarket has seen another bout of
profit-taking with most larger shares moving lower," said Morgan
Stockbroking's Simon Reed.
</P>
<P>
The slide in the all ordinaries came despite an initial brief
move higher at the open after the Dow Jones Industrial average
picked up a slight 13.74 points to 10,845.45 for its second
consecutive closing high.
</P>
<P>
Most of the positive action in the Australian market was
confined to the resources sector.
</P>
<P>
While the all resources index rose 28.3 points to 1,200.9, the
all industrials index shed 61.4 points to 5,479.9.
</P>
<P>
Resource giant BHP raced 42 cents or 2.6 per cent higher to
16.58 Australian dollars while global miner Rio Tinto surged 62.5
cents to 25.79 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate sensitive banking sector was again lower but
performing a little better than Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National Australia Bank offloaded 9.6 cents to 29.61 Australian
dollars and Westpac bank eased 11 cents to 11.77 Australian
dollars, while ANZ bank slid 4.3 cents to 12.20 Australian dollars
and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia was steady at 27.95
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the resources sector, the gold index added 9.1
points to close at 993.2.
</P>
<P>
The spot price of gold bullion in Sydney Thursday afternoon was
282.55 U.S. dollars an ounce, compared to a close of 282.70
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 515.46 million stocks traded for a value
of 993.32 million Australian dollars. Falling stocks outnumbered
rising stocks by 769 to 675 and 502 stocks remained steady.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Little Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar Thursday
ended little changed after lower than expected wages data dampened
the currency's earlier excitement over the prospects for steady
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, treasury manager of Colonial State Bank, said
the Australian currency spiked to an early session high of 65.62
U.S. cents as stop-loss buy orders were triggered, with support
from improved gold and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished in Sydney at 65.35 U.S. cents,
from Wednesday's close of 65.27 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
During the day it fell to a low of 65.26 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"It was a reasonably quiet day for Aussie," Volanakis said.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was buying 0.6150
euro from 0.6106 euro Wednesday and 77.91 Japanese yen from 77.71
yen.

<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In a signed article published in Liberation, French
philosopher Jean Baudrillard said that after coming out victorious
in its rivalries with the Soviet Union in ideological terms and
Japan in economic terms, the United States is now trying to divide
Europe by luring it into a trap of war which it does not want. The
United States is "coming to the rescue" of all the minority groups
in Europe like Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo and Kurds in Iraq, who
actually have nothing to do with America.
</P>
<P>
-- Kosovo's capital city, Pristina, has become a ghost town
with an agonizing quietness, abandoned to stray dogs and
paramilitary forces patrolling in speeding vehicles on the streets,
according to the few refugees from Pristina who fled to Macedonia
lately. They said that 80 percent of the city's inhabitants have
left, and only the elderly, women and children can still be seen
on the street from 11 o'clock till 13 o'clock buying food.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic was sacked on
Wednesday for making public declarations contrary to the
government stand and for "harming the prestige of the government."
Immediately after that, the Serb Socialist Party of President
Slobodan Milosevic said it was ready to accept "a UN mission" in
Kosovo. It did not specify the nature of such a mission, but
stressed that an approval by the Yugoslav government is a
precondition.
</P>
<P>
-- The war of Kosovo is playing not only in the sky of
Yugoslavia, but also within the wall of the Kremlin and in the
subtle combinations of the political checkerboard of the old
Russia. The nomination of former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin -- who is a "dove" -- as the his envoy to Belgrade by
Russian President Boris Yeltsin was clearly a counter-offensive by
Yeltsin against the "hawks" led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.

<HEADLINE> China's Real Estate Prices Slightly Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's real estate prices
dropped slightly in the first quarter this year, according to an
official survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey jointly conducted by the State Development Planning
Commission and the National Bureau of Statistics in 35 major
cities found that the average real estate price dropped by 0.3
percent in the first three months from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in
south China recorded the most drastic drop of 10.6 percent, while
the highest price gains were reported in Yinchuan, capital of
midwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where the real
estate price was 9.8 percent up year on year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent drop in the general price level, the survey
said real estate costs are still far beyond the income level of
ordinary Chinese, which has resulted in a sluggish market.
</P>
<P>
The cost of land was 2.5 percent up in the first three months
on a yearly basis, but was 0.4 percent down from the fourth
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the drop in land costs was partly due to the
downward adjustment of land prices by some regional governments in
support of residential housing development.
</P>
<P>
The rental price of residential houses, offices and hotels
declined by 3.4 percent, four percent and 7.4 percent,
respectively, while that of industrial houses and warehouses was 0.
2 percent up, producing a 4.4 percent fall in the general level of
house rents.

<HEADLINE> Commemorating May 4th Movement by Following Historical Tide (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- With the 80th anniversary of the
May 4th Movement imminent, Shao Huaze, president of the People's
Daily, said today in a full-page article that following the
historical trend of the times is the best way for Chinese people
to commemorate the movement and carry forward its spirit.
</P>
<P>
They must hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
adhere to the basic line of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core, comprehensively carry forward the
great cause of building socialism with the Chinese characteristics
into the 21st century, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
The May 4th Movement, also known as the New Cultural Movement,
was led by Chinese intellectuals, who went with the then tide of
historical development, to pursue democracy and science.
</P>
<P>
It was a great patriotic movement fighting against imperialism
and feudalism, and an inevitable outcome for Chinese people at the
time, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
With the start of the Opium War in 1840, China gradually fell
into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, which suffered
fierce domestic political and economic contradictions and
conflicts with imperialists.
</P>
<P>
After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 -1895, various imperialist
powers were ready to divide up China.
</P>
<P>
At that time, China faced national subjugation and genocide
launched by those powers, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
Many advanced intellectuals struggled to rescue the nation. But
after the failure of the Reform Movement of 1898, led by liberal
intellectuals Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, and the bourgeois
democratic revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen which
overthrew the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the Chinese people fell
into dire straits.

<P>
It is imperative to have in advance a clear view of the
essential movement of the historical development which resulted in
the May 4th Movement, the article said.
</P>
<P>
To do so, all classes, parties, social groups and individuals
must have a firm command of scientific thinking, recognize and
grasp the law governing social and historical developments, and
combine them with patriotism and the fundamental interests of the
nation and people.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be made in the following aspects:
</P>
<P>
Firstly, it is essential to have a correct understanding of the
basic contradictions of society.
</P>
<P>
During the May 4th movement, the Chinese people chose Marxism
and socialism, among other then political mainstream thoughts,
only after repeated practice and comparisons.
</P>
<P>
They realized that in China's semi-colonial and semi-feudal
society, where the contradictions between the working masses and
imperial and feudal forces prevailed, it was imperative to launch
a revolution against such forces in order for China to achieve
independence and liberation.
</P>
<P>
All the changes that took place after the May 4th Movement
can't be separated from the deepened understanding of the
essential contradictions of Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it is essential to have a scientific grasp of the
basic national conditions, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The success of China's new democratic revolution lies in the
fact that the Chinese communists led by Chairman Mao Zedong,
guided by Marxism and Leninism, analyzed and understood the
national conditions in a scientific way.
</P>
<P>
They concluded that the Chinese revolution must rely heavily on
the country's overwhelming number of peasants to set up rural
revolutionary bases which would ultimately encircle and conquer
the cities.
</P>
<P>
Only by following this path did the Chinese revolution overcome
numerous difficulties and obstacles, defeating both domestic and
foreign enemies, achieving victory and establishing the People's
Republic of China 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> China Slows Down Nuclear Power Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China will not start any new
nuclear power projects within three years, a high-ranking nuclear
industry official has announced.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been taken in a bid to cope with decreasing
demand for power supplies as a result, mainly, of the negative
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"There has also been under capacity at a number of large state-
owned enterprises," said Shen Wenquan, director of the Nuclear
Power Department under the China Nuclear Industry Corp., at the
Third International Nuclear Power Industry Exhibition which ended
here today.
</P>
<P>
Shen also pointed to low prices which are hindering nuclear
power development in the country. China has relied on
international cooperation for key nuclear power equipment and
related technology, and that has increased the cost of nuclear
power, pushing its price to a much higher level than that of both
thermal and hydro-electric power.
</P>
<P>
Over the next three years, Shen said, China will focus on
upgrading its existing power grids and eliminating excessive small
thermal power plants that are badly equipped and cause pollution,
in a bid to enhance power quality and returns.
</P>
<P>
"However, this does not mean bleak prospects for nuclear power
development in China," Shen noted, adding that the decline in
demand for electric power is just temporary and that there will
conversely be a shortage of power for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Both domestic and overseas investors should not lose sight of
a great potential market demand for nuclear power in this country,
" Shen said. "Be patient and far-sighted."
</P>
<P>
At present, China has two nuclear power stations under
commercial operation, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station of east
China's Zhejiang Province and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station
in south China's Guangdong Province, with total electric
production of 12 billion kwh and 50 billion kwh, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the second and third phases of Qinshan and
Ling'ao nuclear power stations and Lianyungang Nuclear Power Plant
are in full swing.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that by the year 2006, when all the projects
are completed, nuclear power will contribute about three percent
of China's total power output, some two percentage points more
than the present figure, but still much lower than the world
average of 17 percent, and an even bigger gap to that of developed
countries like the United States, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
China's State Development Planning Commission is now working
out an overall nuclear power development plan, aiming to bring the
country's nuclear power generating capacity up to 20 million
kilowatts by 2010, and 40 million kilowatts by 2020, accounting
for five percent of the country's total power production.
</P>
<P>
Over a dozen provinces, such as Shandong, Fujian, Hainan,
Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei and Sichuan, have all been active in making
preparations for building their own nuclear power stations.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Shandong, has already selected a site for four
generating units each with installed capacity of one million
kilowatts.

<P>
The most important thing is to carry out well the current work
while following the historical tide.
</P>
<P>
The article emphasized that the marking of the "May 4th
Movement" is not because of its importance in China's modern
history, but also to better inherit the spirit of the "May 4th
Movement".
</P>
<P>
It said the best way for commemorating the "May 4th Movement"
is to have the present tasks well done.
</P>
<P>
The article said the as China is at the primary stage of
socialism, it must focus on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Chinese revolutionary pioneers recognized through their hard
struggles since the "May 4th Movement" that only socialism can
save China.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) has come to the conclusion
that China could only achieve development by insisting on building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, which was confirmed by the
Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, by
summing up historical experience, especially the experience of the
revolution and economic construction after the founding of new
China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is made by the party's scientific determination
of the national conditions, getting rid of the interference of
wrong ideas and firmly sticking to the principle of seeking truth
from facts.

<P>
Thirdly, it is essential to follow closely the development of
the times, the article said.
</P>
<P>
To commemorate the 80th anniversary of the May 4th Movement, it
is imperative to view it now with a sense of development, and put
new connotations into the movement's spirits.
</P>
<P>
"We must put great emphasis on prosperity, democracy and
civilization, and never neglect any of the three, in the process
of building a modern, socialist country in China," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The democracy we talk about today has far surpassed in
contents the one promoted during the May 4th Movement. Without
democracy, there will be no socialist modernization," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Socialism and democracy go hand in hand and represent the
consistent objective of CPC's struggle to develop socialist
democracy.
</P>
<P>
"With the guidance of the Party, we must proceed from the
national conditions, and steadfastly promote socialist democracy
in an orderly, step by step manner," it said.
</P>
<P>
It can be said that this is the new scientific connotation that
we should put into the "democracy" element of the May 4th Movement
spirit, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, it is essential to keep to the viewpoint of the
people.
</P>
<P>
Doing this constitutes another major factor in deciding whether
one has a clear view of the basic historical development and
conforms with development of the times, the article added.
</P>
<P>
The people are the main body of social practice and masters of
history. Thus, reflecting their viewpoint and representing their
interests are in unison with recognizing the rules governing
social development and following the changes over time.
</P>
<P>
Without a deepened understanding of the law governing social
development, it is impossible to steadfastly keep to the attitude
of the people.
</P>
<P>
As a proletarian party, the Chinese Communist Party has deeply
rooted itself in the people, its sole purpose to serve the people
wholeheartedly, and to regard the people's interests as its very
lifeforce.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can it be ensured that the Party will follow
historical development, the article noted.

<P>
Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, the CPC has recognized once again that the major
problem for China is the contradictions between the people's
increasing demand for a better material and cultural life and the
backward social productive forces.
</P>
<P>
The situation determines that the CPC and the government should
focus on economic construction and all the work should be
subordinated to the task.
</P>
<P>
The key part of unswervingly sticking to the party's basic line
is to firmly stress the importance of economic development as the
country's top priority.
</P>
<P>
The development of the productive forces relies on
implementation of the reform and opening-up policy which is now
believed to be determining China's fate and the only way for
building China into a powerful country.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the Party has opened the new road of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which enabled the
country to win great achievements in various fields and laid solid
foundations for China's future development.

<P>
Meanwhile, well known scholars, such as Li Dazhao, Lu Xun, Hu
Shi, Qian Xuantong, Liu Bannong and others, wrote articles for
progressive journals.
</P>
<P>
Thus, these forward thinking intellectuals ignited the May 4th
Movement upholding the new culture with the declared intent of
pursuing democracy and science.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that only this path could help China march out of
the political, ethical, academic and ideological blackness.
</P>
<P>
Under this banner, the intellectuals fiercely fought against
outdated beliefs and taking into account the times found ways to
reform the country.
</P>
<P>
After seeing the success of the October Revolution in Russia
and inevitable contradictions raging among imperialist powers, the
intellectuals recognized the limitations of bourgeois "new culture
" and began to doubt the values of Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they turned to Marxism, Leninism and socialism.
These were rapidly spread throughout the country and accepted by
more and more young people. Thus, the intellectuals became firm
Marxists and were the backbone of the newly established CPC.
</P>
<P>
Considered as one of the most important events in the history
of modern China, the May 4th Movement reflected the level of
productive forces and the class structure, the given social
environment in China and the country's needs for social
development.
</P>
<P>
So, facts over the past 80 years have proved that the choices
made by the Chinese people in supporting the movement are correct
and comply with the historical development of the nation.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for Permanent Peace in Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua)-- China believes that the
establishment of a peace mechanism in the Korean Peninsula through
the four-party talks will serve to maintain peace and stability in
the peninsula and in northeast Asia as a whole, and it is also in
the interests of relevant parties.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remark
when asked to comment on the fifth round of four-party talks on
the Korean Peninsula issue.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the four-party talks will achieve gradual
progress, and that a permanent peace in the peninsula will be
realized, as long as all relevant parties maintain patience and
continue their efforts in a practical manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fifth round of four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula
issue was held in Geneva from April 24 to 27.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that during the talks, relevant parties engaged in in-
depth discussions about the establishment of a peace mechanism in
the Korean Peninsula and relaxation of the tensions there based on
the progress of the previous talks, and that they promoted
understanding of their respective stances.
</P>
<P>
The four parties agreed that during the next round of talks,
they will continue discussing such substantial issues as the
topics of the working groups, the measures to ease tensions, and
the outline of the future peace mechanism in the peninsula, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, they still have different views on some issues due to
historical reasons, Sun said, and the attainment of the objectives
of the four-party talks will be a long-term and step-by-step
process.

<HEADLINE> ADB Experts Call For Efforts for Rapid Agricultural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Economists of the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) Thursday called for greater efforts by the
Asian economies to prod rapid agricultural growth.
</P>
<P>
In a study of rural Asia conducted by the ADB and presented
during a seminar on the eve of the bank's 32nd annual meeting, the
economists said that the public sector of economies has to play a
key role in this process.
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural growth is dependent on a regulatory environment
and levels of investment in agricultural research and rural
infrastructure that the private sector has insufficient incentive
to provide," they said.
</P>
<P>
In the study titled "Rural Asia: Beyond the Green Revolution,"
the economists suggested investments in agricultural research and
extension to provide a continuous stream of yield-enhancing
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Investments in rural infrastructure, especially irrigation,
roads and electricity are also important factors in agricultural
growth, they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, attention should be paid to investments in the
education, nutrition, and health of rural people to increase their
productivities, they said.
</P>
<P>
Efficient rural financial markets are also important to provide
a broad range of financial services at minimal transaction costs
to the rural population, they said.
</P>
<P>
The economists believed that a key challenge for policy makers
is to continue to promote rapid growth in rural areas while at the
same time making growth more pro-poor and keeping management of
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, the economists said that rural Asia has
undergone an unprecedented technological and economic revolution
in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
The revolution "has dramatically improved the region's food
security, reduced poverty, and raised incomes," they said.
</P>
<P>
This transformation was initiated by the green revolution in
agriculture, the expression of the application of modern science
to Asia's agriculture problems, they said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Approved To Experiment With RMB Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Asia's financial turmoil will
not alter China's policies to open up its financial sector and the
People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central Bank, will
continue to allow more eligible foreign banks to run RMB business
on a trial basis, said Wu Xiaoling, head of the PBOC Shanghai
Branch at the China 99' Business Summit which ended Wednesday in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Wu emphasized that China has been persistently implementing
safe finance-opening policies in a proper sequence, adapting the
opening speed to domestic economic growth level and taking into
account financial supervision abilities.
</P>
<P>
Qualified foreign banks will be authorized to experiment with
RMB deals in an increasing number of areas in China, Wu added,
saying that Shanghai is slated to turn into an international
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Wu urged more effort to tighten financial supervision by
drawing up a series of guidelines and to create a good environment
for foreign banks by providing them with training and other
services involved in the Chinese currency business.

BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's capital has been trying
hard to create a favorable environment for a fast expansion of its
high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Liu Qi told reporters today that the 33-article
preferential policies that came off the press today are designed
to serve that very purpose.
</P>
<P>
He explained that high-tech industries are Beijing's new
economic powerhouse and that the city has unique advantages to
push forward their development.
</P>
<P>
The mayor expressed the hope that the newly published policies
would help attract and retain high-tech industries and creative
people, and form an industrial chain consisting of scientific
research, manufacturing and marketing in Beijing..
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that last year, high-tech industries
contributed 54.6 percent to Beijing's industrial economic growth
and the ratio went up to 63.7 percent in the first quarter of this
year.

<HEADLINE> China Condemns NATO Bombing of Yugoslav TV Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- NATO's wanton bombing of a
Yugoslav TV station, which killed and wounded dozens of its staffs,
constituted a particularly severe violation of relevant
international conventions and ethical standards, said a Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi made the remarks at a regular press conference where
he was asked to comment on the recent bombing of the Serb TV
Station.
</P>
<P>
"The bombing intruded seriously into the basic human rights
and freedom," Sun said, adding that NATO's continuing military
strikes against Yugoslavia has caused a great deal of property
losses and human casualties.
</P>
<P>
Such acts have aroused strong condemnation from all peace
proponents including Chinese people, he said, adding that "the
Chinese government has always held a consistent and clear attitude
toward the issue of Kosovo, which I have repeatedly addressed here.
"
</P>
<P>
"We have particularly called for an immediate stop to the
airstrikes against Yugoslavia," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on NATO's "New Concept" (Details added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua)-- Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Sun Yuxi said here today that at a time when seeking peace is the
common aspiration of the world people, the reinforcement of
military alliance goes against the historical trend.
</P>
<P>
Sun made this remark at today's routine press conference when
asked to comment on NATO's "new concept" and "new strategy" put
forward when it celebrated its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
NATO is the result of the cold war era, and today the world
situation has witnessed profound changes, Sun said, adding that
seeking peace, cooperation and development has become the common
aspiration of all the world people.
</P>
<P>
Under such a background, seeking reinforcement of military
alliance and expanding its external military interference function
will produce serious results, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
To interfere in a sovereign state's internal affairs or try to
seek solutions to regional and international conflicts by
surpassing the UN Charter and universally recognized norms of the
international law is not only harmful to the world peace and
security, but also runs counter to the historical trend, the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that during the post-cold war era, how
European security should be guaranteed and what kind of role NATO
should play are questions not only faced by European countries,
but also concerned by the world community.
</P>
<P>
Recently, NATO, surpassing the UN, conducted military
interference in a sovereign state like Yugoslavia, and such an
action seriously violates the UN Charter and the international law,
and is strongly opposed by all peace-loving countries and peoples,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Three New Banks Licensed in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya has
licensed three new banks which will start their operations at any
time.
</P>
<P>
The three news banks are the Majestic Bank, Mesacom Bank and
K-Rep Bank. One of them is converted from a micro finance
non-governmental organization, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A central bank source said the banks were licensed in March but
are yet to meet the statutory capital requirements of 200 million
shillings (some 3.1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
All the three banks were locally-owned and had met most of the
requirements, the source added.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, the banks are beefing up their capital
bases to 500 million shillings as required by the new regulations
of the central bank which demand that existing commercial banks
need to raise their statutory capital base to 500 million
shillings by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
The licensing of the three banks brings the number of
commercial banks to 59 in Kenya nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Last year, five local banks collapsed due to liquidity problems
while the government stepped in to save the National Bank of
Kenya.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Control on Foreign Exchange Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's State Administration of
Foreign Exchange (SAFE) announced today that, together with the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), it
has formulated provisional procedures to check on the foreign
exchange income of foreign trade firms.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SAFE said that effective supervision on the
foreign exchange income and payment of foreign trade enterprises
is an important component in China's foreign exchange
administrative system as the prevention of illegal practices in
foreign exchange income and payment can help maintain balanced
international payments.
</P>
<P>
According to the procedures, which will take effect on May 1,
the check will be focused on the foreign exchange collection rate
of exports, and foreign trade firms will be graded according to
their foreign exchange collection rate.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the SAFE and the MOFTEC will use policy
and banking measures to reward or punish enterprises in line with
their gradings.
</P>
<P>
The procedures will be applicable to both foreign trade
companies and productive and other enterprises with import and
export rights, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The allegations by the U.S. side,
especially Cox's report on the so-called espionage case, have no
factual basis, and are "sheer fabrication with ulterior motives",
a Foreign Ministry spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sun Yuxi made the remark when asked to comment on a report that
is said to be released and declassified early next month by the
committee of the U.S. congressional representative Christopher Cox,
in which there is alleged conclusive evidence that the Chinese
government continues to conduct espionage in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"Leaders of the Chinese government have solemnly declared that
China has never stolen any technology or conducted espionage," Sun
said. "The allegation that China steals nuclear weapon technology
is absolutely groundless."
</P>
<P>
Sun also denied that China is behind the alleged theft of U.S.
nuclear weapon secret.
</P>
<P>
If there is secret leaked out of the U.S. laboratory, then it
is only business of their own, Sun said, adding that so it is the
business of the U.S. to strengthen its security measures.

KAMPALA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Ugandan President Milton
Obote is allowed to return home soon from his exiled life in
Zambia where he has been living since he was ousted in a coup in
July 1985 by an army led by President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's Monitor daily reported that the cabinet made the
dramatic decision Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Obote, who is an outspoken critic of President Museveni, was
allowed to come back on grounds that he agreed to drop all his
previous political conditions for returning to Uganda and to
retire from politics.
</P>
<P>
He previously demanded Museveni to step down from power and
some constitutional article to be dropped if he should come back.
</P>
<P>
Once returning to Uganda, Obote, who is president of Uganda
People's Congress, shall be given security, and enjoy all the
benefits provided for a former head of state under the 1995
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted minister in charge of Presidency Ruhakana
Rugunda as saying that Obote will be able to vote in the
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Worst May Be Over for East Asian Crisis: Singapore PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said Thursday that the worst may be over for the East
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Goh said this while addressing the U.S. Economic Strategy
Institute's Annual Global Economy Conference in Washington D.C.
via videoconferencing this morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is optimistic about that as there are signs of
recovery in the East Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
The financial markets in the region, as well as the foreign
rates, have stabilized, Goh said, adding that interest rates have
also returned to pre-crisis levels and confidence in the Asian
stock market is regaining.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the region will bounce back if all
countries hit by the crisis succeed in correcting the structural
flaws in their economies
</P>
<P>
"I believe the region will emerge from the crisis stronger,"
said Goh.
</P>
<P>
He called on the U.S. to lead in keeping the global trading
system open as the move will lead to more economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"This will help Asia recover, and in turn, Asia will regain
quickly its status as a major growing market for the U.S., setting
in motion a virtuous cycle," Goh noted.
</P>
<P>
He also called for China to be admitted early as a member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
He said this will open up the huge Chinese market and ensure
that China becomes a responsible member of the international
trading community.
</P>
<P>
"In November this year, the Third WTO Ministerial Meeting in
Seattle will consider the launch of a new round of multilateral
trade negotiations," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Seattle will be an important crossroads for trade
liberalization and globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh also urged Japan, which he said is the region's largest
economy and the key to Asia's recovery, to open its market wider.
</P>
<P>
"If Japan recovers and opens up its markets, the Asian recovery
will be speeded up," he said.

<P>
The number of votes for the draft amendments is only one vote
fewer than the required number for approval.
</P>
<P>
A number of the Standing Committee members voted against the
draft amendments for fear that the adoption of the draft
amendments would increase farmers' burdens, according to sources

</P>
<P>
The amendments to the Highway Law were made to pave the way for

<HEADLINE> HK Media Worry About Influx of 1.67m Mainlanders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong newspapers Thursday
in editorials or commentaries expressed their worries about the
consequences of the influx of 1.67 million mainlanders to Hong
Kong if the Court of Final appeal Ruling on right of abode is
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Regina Ip, secretary for Security, announced Wednesday that
more than 1.67 million people from the mainland are eligible to
live in Hong Kong following a controversial court ruling.
</P>
<P>
According to Ip, the figure can be underestimated because
mainland children of former Hong Kong residents who had migrated
or died were not included. Also wives of Hong Kong residents
still in the mainland were continuing to have children so the
number of people eligible for the right of abode will increase.
</P>
<P>
The papers said that it will bring a heavy burden to the Hong
Kong society.
</P>
<P>
Wen Wei Po said in an editorial that under the circumstances of
its downward economy, a rising unemployment rate and large
financial budget, it is hard for the Hong Kong society to cope
with such a problem. Hong Kong has currently a population of
nearly 7 million.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Ta Kung Pao described the figure released by
the government as shocking.
</P>
<P>
It said such a large number of mainlanders to Hong Kong will
directly affect its social stability, economic recovery and long-
term development in the future.
</P>
<P>
The right of abode issue should be solved in accordance with
the articles of the Basic Law, it said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in a commentary that most of
mainlanders who are eligible to live in Hong Kong according to the
court ruling are not competent professionals and they will surely
exert tremendous impacts on a wide range of areas of housing,
medical and health work, education and social welfare in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong media also made some suggestions to properly
settle the issue.

<HEADLINE> ADB Proposes Partnership in Infrastructure Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A public-private partnership in
infrastructure development in Asia is very important, especially
at a critical time when the region was hit by a financial crisis,
an Asian Development Bank (ADB) expert said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"With Asia's population growing at a rate of 60 million per
annum and expected to more than triple in a decade, demand for
infrastructure is also set to increase," said Christine Wallich,
head of the ADB financial sector, at a seminar on "Commercial
Co-financing and Guarantees."
</P>
<P>
Wallich said that the share of infrastructure -- now about 4
percent of gross domestic product (GDP) -- is expected to rise 7
percent early next century.
</P>
<P>
In India, the expert said, investment needs will likely rise
from about 14 billion U.S. dollars now to about 42 billion dollars
by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"Even assuming better demand management and operating
efficiency, rapid urbanization and the rise of megacities will
place considerable pressure on infrastructure across Asia,"
Wallich said.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, some 80 to 90 percent of infrastructure
investments in developing countries come from public finances or
are supported by governments.
</P>
<P>
"Such levels of public funding are clearly unsustainable and
the amounts involved are unlikely to be available," Wallich said.
</P>
<P>
But the private sector has limited capacity to influence
policy, establish laws and regulate markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that only through a combined effort, or a
public-private partnership, can the infrastructure challenge be
met.
</P>
<P>
However, Wallich said, public-private partnerships will not
materialize and be sustainable unless reforms in the
infrastructure sector are undertaken seriously.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Local Councils Start Work Amid Factional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Amid spiraling factional
struggles, Iran's first local councils officially started work on
Thursday morning with a ceremony in Tehran attended by President
Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
The councils for cities, towns and villages throughout the
country held their first meetings after the Interior Ministry
rejected the latest bid by the conservatives to disqualify five
leading moderate figures from Tehran's city council.
</P>
<P>
The elections supervision committee on Monday confirmed the
result of the February 26 local elections, the first ever since
the Islamic revolution in 1979, but it nullified the elections of
five moderates, including former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri,
a close ally of Khatami, for lacking qualifications.
</P>
<P>
However, the moderate Interior Ministry replied on Wednesday
that the committee has no mandate to disqualify candidates after
the poll and warned against any move to "disturb" public opinion.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, any attempt aimed at disturbing public opinion
will have the least effect on determination of the (Iranian)
Muslim people and those who are serving the people within the
government," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry argued that the committee has no authority to defy
the qualification of the five elected after the five-member
arbitration committee, appointed jointly by President Khatami and
Majlis (parliament) Speaker Nateq Nouri, ruled that they are
eligible for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The supervision committee had attempted to bar some moderate
supporters of President Khatami, including the five, from running
the councils, but was forced to back down following the
intervention of Khatami and the arbitrary committee hours before
the elections.
</P>
<P>
The elections for local councils were seen in Iran as a major
success for Khatami's political reforms as his supporters took
over most of the council seats throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers noted that the disputes over the five
members of Tehran city council would further intensify the
already heated factional struggles between the moderates and the
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Following their political setback in the local elections, the
conservatives, which still dominate most of the country's state
organs, will not forgo any opportunity to strengthen their
positions and marginalize the moderates, they said.

<HEADLINE> Discovery of Earlier Fossil Man in China Hopeful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YUXI, YUNNAN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The conclusion that human
was originated in Africa should not be final and earlier fossil
man may be found in China, according to Chinese archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
"We're expecting some new and exciting discoveries, that is,
the discovery of the oldest fossil man ever found in China," said
Mr. Jin Changzhu, director of the Zhoukoudian International
Research Center of Paleoanthropology at the Seventh Annual Meeting
of the China Society of Vertebrate Paleozoology here in Yuxi,
Yunnan Province, on the eve of the '99 International Horticultural
Exposition scheduled to open in Kunming on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have started a new round of excavation
in Fanchang County of east China's Anhui Province with the hope to
find much earlier fossil man.
</P>
<P>
"If we find fossil man dated back more than two million years
ago or even earlier in China," said Qiu Zhuding, head of the
Institute of Vertebrate Paleozoology and Palaeoanthropology under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, "it will touch off another round
of debate on the place of origin of man."
</P>
<P>
During their last excavation in Fanchang at the end of last
year, Chinese anthropologists found fossils of advanced primates
and stone- and bone-ware suspected of artificial manufacture dated
back to more than 2 - 2.5 million years ago, the first such
discoveries along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Major breakthrough has also been made in the excavation efforts
in the Three Gorges area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
where the world's largest water conservancy and hydropower project,
the Three Gorges Dam, is under construction. The discoveries will
provide the basis for establishing whether Wushan Man ever existed
in China more than two million years ago.
</P>
<P>
A currently dominant theory in the world holds that man was
originated in Africa and started to move to other parts of the
world some two million years ago.
</P>
<P>
This theory also describes the origin of man as the result of
the emergence of the Great Rift Valley of Africa, which
drastically changed the living environment of anthropoid and
forced them to evolve into a higher stage.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Ye Jie, president of the China Society of
Vertebrate Paleozoology, the rise of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
also created a natural environment very similar to that in ancient
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"China is one of the few countries in the world blessed with
the richest fossil resources and living things in each historical
period have representative fossils," Ye said. "There is great
possibility to find fossil man of much earlier periods."
</P>
<P>
China has discovered the world's oldest fossils of advanced
primates, including those dated back to nearly 40 million years
ago, anthropoid at Lufeng dated back to eight million years ago
and Yuanmou fossil man in Yunnan dated back to some 1.7 million
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the annual meeting were unanimous that the
conclusion that man was originated in Africa should not be final,
because fossil study shows that some of the features of Peking man
have inheritance relations with those of modern man.

CAIRO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- An international tender has been
announced for building another car tunnel under the Suez Canal,

<P>
The tunnel is a strategic project that links the Sinai
Peninsula with the valley of the northern Kantara area, Minister

</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 400 million
Egyptian pounds (about 120 million U.S. dollars), half of which
will be covered by investor groups of the Port Said industrial
area.
</P>
<P>
In return, the groups will collect transit fees of the new
tunnel and have rights to a piece of land near the location.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has built a car tunnel at the middle of the Suez Canal
near Ismailia, 110 kilometers east of Cairo.

<HEADLINE> HK Expects to Cooperate with Israel on IT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Thursday
expressed the hope to conclude a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
on Information Technology Co-operation with Israel soon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a breakfast meeting in honor of visiting Israeli
President Ezer Weizman, Secretary for information technology and
broadcasting K. C. Kwong said that he felt confident that closer
bilateral co-operation between Israel and Hong Kong in information
technology would be mutually beneficial and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
He said the areas of common interest could include hardware and
software products and services, electronic commerce infrastructure
and policy, data communications, broadband networks, and
multimedia and Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to say that we have met with an enthusiastic
response from the government of Israel when we raised the proposal
through the Israeli Consul-General in Hong Kong," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
"And I look forward to the successful conclusion of an MOU
between Israel and Hong Kong before too long," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has so far signed MOU on IT co-operation with Canada
and Australia, the primary objectives of which are to promote two-
way commercial and industrial exchanges, to facilitate the
formation of business and technology partnerships, and to
encourage the sharing of information and strategy on IT.
</P>
<P>
Kwong also spoke briefly on the development of the Cyberport in
Hong Kong which will provide an ultra-modern intelligent building
complex, equipped with state-of-the-art telecommunications and
information backbones to meet the needs of IT and information
services companies.
</P>
<P>
"The companies we are aiming to attract are primarily companies
applying leading edge IT to create applications, solutions and
services and also those adopting innovative ideas to create
multimedia contents," Kwong said.
</P>
<P>
Phase I of the Cyberport will be available for occupation by
end 2001/early 2002, Kwong said. "I am glad to say that eight
leading IT and information services companies have already signed
letters of intent to become anchor tenants of the Cyberport," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We would warmly welcome leading Israeli information technology
and services companies to become tenants of the Cyberport as well,
" Kwong added.

<HEADLINE> Australia Unveils Immigration Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Australian Immigration Minister
Philip Ruddock said Thursday Australia's migrant intake would rise
by 2,000 to 82,000 in the fiscal year of 1999-2000 following
drastic cuts in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock said the government had responded to calls by industry,
local governments for more skilled migrants by earmarking a
"contingency reserve" of 5,000 skilled places if they were needed.
</P>
<P>
The 1999-2000 fiscal year humanitarian program remained stable
at 12,000, which included about 10,000 places for overseas
applicants from places like the former Yugoslavia, he said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The non-humanitarian program had been set at 70,000 places, up
from 68,000 in the current fiscal year, which ends on June 30, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There were 32,000 places for family reunions, 35,000 places for
skilled migrants and 3,000 in a special eligibility category.
</P>
<P>
Liberal member of the ruling Australian Liberal Party and
business groups have been calling for increased intake of
immigrants to boost the country's economy, while some are against
such increase on employment and environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
Australians needed to spread the word to families, friends, and
employees about the need for more immigration, given Australia's
aging population and declining fertility rate, Jeff Kennett,
premier of Australia's second richest state Victoria, told radio
3AW.
</P>
<P>
The Victorian government has called for skilled migration
levels to be more than doubled in a bid to increase Australia's
population to 28 million by 2060 from 18 million in 1998.

NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi

instead to explore other means to end the conflict in the

</P>
<P>
President Moi made the remarks when he met the envoys of the

"It should be clear from damage done to property and the loss
of human life that the time has come when peaceful means should
be used to resolve the problem," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that the current crisis in the Balkans had
threatened world peace, and air and missile strikes for over a
month had caused great damage to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts For Sustained Economic Growth: Economists(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China needs to improve its
financial services by developing a diversified financial system to
sustain the growth of its national economy, according to an
article analyzing the issue in Thursday's China Securities Daily.
</P>
<P>
Economists pointed out that existing problems including a weak
domestic market, declining exports and falling commodity prices
will be better addressed by promoting financial services.
</P>
<P>
China's pro-active fiscal policies paid off in the first
quarter of 1999, but will need to play an ongoing and important
role in the long term, according to the analysis reflecting the
views of a group of research institutions, including the
macroeconomics desk under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.3 percent in the
first quarter, well above the targeted 7.0 annual growth rate.
</P>
<P>
During the period, industry's value-added output increased by
10.1 percent year on year, and the growth in sales volume of
retail commodities between January and February rapidly reached 8.
1 percent achieving 520 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, major indicators for economic growth in March went
below that of earlier months, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
A healthy growth of the light industry and private sectors is
of crucial importance under such circumstances when the
accelerated state investment aimed to stimulate domestic demand
has flowed instead to infrastructure construction and the state-
owned sector, economists said.

BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Total assets of Lebanese banks
rose to 36.9 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this
year, an increase of 16 percent compared with 31.1 billion dollars
in the same period in 1998, the Daily Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The consolidated balance sheets of commercial banks rose 0.73
percent in March compared with 0.16 percent in February,
indicating that average banking growth is unlikely to exceed 20
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank expects net profits of banks to reach 126
million dollars in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits in the first quarter rose to 31.2 billion
dollars compared with 26.4 billion dollars in the same period last
year. In 1998, total deposits stood at 30.5 billion dollars, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese pound deposits represent 34.4 percent of the total
deposits while foreign currency deposits, mainly in U.S. dollars,
stood at 17.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Iskandar, regional manager of Thomson BankWatch, an
international rating company, said Lebanese banks are still
achieving good growth.
</P>
<P>
"An annual growth rate of 10-11 percent is still good. This
means that banks are still growing but not at the rate of previous
years,"Iskandar said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Declares Progress in Solving Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has announced that
the critical problems related to computer Y2K bug have been
resolved after making serious efforts over the past months.
</P>
<P>
To fulfil the task, the country has selected a dozen of key
sectors, according to the Tanzania National Committee for the Year
2000 Millenium Bug Problem.
</P>
<P>
Y2K Project Manager, A. B. Kowero, named the sectors as energy,
water, food, communication, transportation, finance, emergency,
health and environment, as well as law and order, defense, trade
and industries.
</P>
<P>
Of these, energy, communication, transportation and fiance are
being given priority, Daily Mail newspaper Thursday quoted the
manager as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda met in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha some three months ago and agreed
to jointly resolve the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem means that computer systems may fail, with
potentially disastrous results, if internal clocks that record
only the last two digits of each year are unable to cope with the
change from 99 to 00.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure the nation that we have passed the dangerous mark
of the problem," Kowero said.
</P>
<P>
However, the official acknowledged that the country is still
short of funds to deal with the computer problem.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Tanzania needs 440,000 U.S. dollars to
solve the problem. Earlier, the World Bank donated 100,000 U.S.
dollars to the committee.
</P>
<P>
A task force set up by the government, with technological and
financial assistance from Britain, has started to work for the
aviation sector to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
The government has also urged the private sector to step up
efforts in charting out strategies to combat the looming millenium
bug problem.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gardening Masterpiece Add to Expo Splendor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The novel design has made the
China Garden quite stand out at the '99 Kunming International
Horticultural Exposition due to open on May 1.
</P>
<P>
The garden is situated in the northwestern part of the main
site of the exposition, tilting from northwest to southeast, very
much similar to the topography of China. Prompted by this
similarity, the garden designer, Sun Ping, designed two green
belts to represent the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the two
longest rivers in China known the "mother of the nation". The
green belt representing the Yellow River is 300 meters long and
the other one is more than 200 meters long, with 31 small gardens
representing 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions
distributed along the two belts according to their actual
geographical locations.
</P>
<P>
The design does not only exhibit the extensive and profound
gardening art but also facilitate visitors to view the gardens.
</P>
<P>
China's gardening art has a long history, featuring different
styles in different geographical locations.
</P>
<P>
The "Yu Garden", or garden of Henan Province in central China,
brings the visitor back to the culture of the Yin and Shang
dynasties (16th-11th century B.C.). The first thing to catch the
eye is a life-size bronze tripod with magnificent motifs and an
eight-meter high jade pole, an object used to pay sacrifices to
the heaven and earth.A section of arched stone wall are inscribed
on both sides with pictographic designs and writings that used to
be found on bones and turtle shells during the Yin and Shang
periods as well as family names that were originated in Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The "Qilu Garden", built by east China's Shandong province,
features Mount Tai, the Baotu Spring and Confucius for which the
province is reputed. All the ancient structures were built by
hand, with the surfaces treated with high-tech materials. Inside
the garden are also a bronze relief carving on which the exploits
of ancient Chinese sage Confucius and a tablet that represents the
treasure of China's calligraphic art.
</P>
<P>
The "Wanchun Garden" of Beijing presents the elegance and
magnificence of the imperial gardens while the Shanghai Garden,
named "Pearl Garden", displays the vitality of a modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
The particular features of each province, municipality and
autonomous region in gardening art and garden structure are
represented in the China Garden.

<HEADLINE> More Efforts For Sustained Economic Growth: Economists(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists have called for improved financial services and
financial innovations to fuel the growth of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), the cornerstone of the light industry and
private sectors, as well as expansion of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
China has already attached more importance to the financing of
SMEs in the first quarter as more SMEs-oriented credit departments
have been established in state banks and credit insurance systems
serving SMEs have been launched nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In a move to boost consumer demand, China has allowed
commercial banks access to consumer credit business, and new rules
governing the use of bankcards, credit cards in particular, which
will promote consumer credit remarkably, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Development of the capital market, including securities and
bonds business, will also help ease the burden of the state's
budget by diversifying financing sources, according to the
analysts.
</P>
<P>
China has set the growth of its fiscal budget in 1999 at 14.3
percent, five percentage points higher than that of the revenue.
In the first quarter, the state's revenue has grown by 26 percent
year on year to 232 billion yuan, while the budget has increased
by 17.5 percent to 184 billion yuan during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted that there won't be much room left for
expansion of fiscal deficit and increased issuance of treasury
bonds, and called for a more active role by the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
A more open capital market and stronger connections between the
capital market and money market will help ensure steady growth,
they said.

"quick on the trigger." But Palestinian officials said that the
policemen opened fire only after the Israeli soldiers ignored the

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial and
commercial city of Shanghai will step up efforts to reach the goal
of becoming an international financial center in about 20 years,
according to Vice-Mayor Chen Liangyu.
</P>
<P>
Overseas financial institutions and multinationals are
especially encouraged to participate in the effort, said Chen when
addressing the '99 China Business Summit co-sponsored by the China
Enterprise Confederation and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum,

Over the next few years, Shanghai is going to follow
international norms in managing its financial institutions and try
to establish a financial supervision system that will combine
administrative, economic and legal methods.
</P>
<P>
The city will approve more commercial banks while bringing in
various types of overseas financial bodies, according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Further measures will be taken to standardize the existing
capital, securities, foreign exchange and insurance markets. An
offshore financial market will also be set up together with that
for transactions of property rights.

<P>
ANKARA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 European Swimming
Championships will be held in Istanbul in July.
</P>
<P>
The European Swimming Federation (LEN) said in a statement on
Wednesday that the championships is slated for July 22-Augsut 1 in
Turkey's largest city despite concerns over safety at the
competition.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that four federation members had expressed
concern over security in Turkey after a spate of bombing attacks
in Istanbul and other cities by Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombing attacks have been launched by Kurds after
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) was
captured in Kenya in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, an investigation into the
precautionary measures taken showed that Turkey would be able to
hold the swim meet in complete safety.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has taken strict security measures to
prevent possible terrorist attacks throughout Turkey.
</P>

The championship will be held at the Atakoy Olympic Swimming

<HEADLINE> hke042928 -ADB Expert Calls for Good Governance in Banking Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- As the absence of quality
governance is one of the root causes of the banking crisis in
Asia, Asian countries should encourage good governance in the
banking sector, said an expert of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on "Financial Sector Restructuring in
Asia" here, Christine Wallich, director of the ADB Financial
Sector, suggested a number of tools for encouraging good
governance in banks.
</P>
<P>
"In certain countries, governments have established schemes to
assist banks to recapitalize either by injecting equity capital or
by purchasing bad loans. Any such assistance should be conditional
on corporate governance reforms in the affected banks."
</P>
<P>
Wallich said that institutional investors and multilateral
development banks should factor in the quality of corporate
governance in their decisions to do business with banks.
</P>
<P>
As providers of substantial capital, institutional investors
and other lenders can influence the quality corporate governance
in banks, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that legal regimes must permit the take-over of
banks, bankruptcy or official intervention.
</P>
<P>
"The threat of losing capital or forfeiting control of their
banks should compel most owners to exert good internal
governance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wallich also urged rating agencies to throw the spotlight on
the quality of board governance in banks as one of the factors in
their overall evaluation of the integrity and soundness of banks.

NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Two Kenyan cabinet ministers were
swapped together with two permanent secretaries and one new
permanent secretary was appointed in a cabinet reshuffle in this
east African country Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi made the cabinet reshuffle,
his second just within two months, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Previously minister Andrew Kiptoon of Cooperative Development
swapped places with Industrial Development Minister Chris Obure.
</P>
<P>
Nehemiah Ngeno was named as new permanent secretary in the
Ministry of Environmental Conservation, replacing Franklin Bett,
who was posted to Australia as High Commissioner (ambassador).
</P>
<P>
Ngeno, a long-serving chief economist, was until his new
appointment, the principal administrator in the Office of the
President.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Barua Chele for Information and
Broadcasting was swapped with Simeon Lesrima, the Permanent

Just two months ago, President Moi made his first major
reshuffle in which Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae resigned after
he was relegated to the Ministry of Industrial Development.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Moi sacked Jimmy Angwenyi from his post as
Assistant Minister for Trade, and on Good Friday reappointed

<HEADLINE> UAE Considers Allowing Expatriate Ownership of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- As many officials urge the
government to allow 100 percent ownership of businesses by
expatriates, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is considering
formulating a new law concerning this issue.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Economy and Commerce has no problem in
formulating a new law, as long as it is the right formula for a
flourishing business and plays an important role in attracting
investments," Thursday's Khaleej Times quoted a source of the
ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said many
officials from economic departments were calling for the full
ownership of businesses by expatriates so that they could get a
free hand in their economic activities, which could boost the
inflow of foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
The full ownership of businesses by expatriates, if
implemented, would remove the need for national sponsors in these
enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any laws concerning this issue must be
approved by the cabinet after detailed deliberations.
</P>
<P>
"This is too serious a matter to be decided overnight, as it
touches the nerves of the national economy," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"I personally support the move and encourage it," said the
source, adding that it was necessary to give foreign investors
more freedom as the trend of economic globalization prevails.
</P>
<P>
"If we keep protecting the local businessmen, we shall
obviously be creating hurdles against the flow of foreign
investments," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said it would not take very long for new laws to be drawn
up, "which will be in favor of both local and expatriate
businessmen."

<HEADLINE> Five Zambian Surveyors Released by DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The five Zambian surveyors
abducted by soldiers of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
have been released, Zambian local newspapers reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The five were released Wednesday afternoon at Kasumbalesa
border post near Chililabombwe in the north of Zambia, where
Copperbelt Minister Matthew Mulanda received them.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers quoted Zambian Acting Minister of Information
and Broadcasting Services Bennie Mwiinga as saying the men were
all in good condition.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that the Zambians are in good physical condition
and are safe and back to their homes and families," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwiinga thanked both Zambian and Congolese officials who worked
 tirelessly for the release of the five, adding that the relations
between the two neighboring countries had been excellent.
</P>
<P>
The five were on duty checking the border line west of
Kasumbalesa barrier last Saturday when the armed soldiers from DRC
pounced on them and dragged them into their side. The five
Zambians were accused of making reconnaissance for the rebels
fighting to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Lays Down Six-Year Plan for Drug Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has laid down a six-year
plan for perpetual elimination of narcotic drugs in Mongla region,
the eastern Shan state of the country bordering China, following
the declaration of the region as a drug-free zone in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the first three years of the plan, four tasks -- reclaiming
land in mountain and hill areas for terrace fields, making tests
to put the fields under high-yield paddy and other commercial
crops, ensuring sufficient water and power supply for hill
villages and building roads there -- will be carried out, leader
of the Mongla region U Sai Lin was quoted by Thursday's New Light
of Myanmar newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to lift people in the hill region out of
poverty and provide them with adequate food within the three
years, U Sai Lin said at a ceremony Tuesday marking the second
anniversary of the proclamation of the region as a drug-free zone.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there is dissatisfaction among residents in
the region who are in difficulties for livelihood due to lack of
effective material assistance.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that some residents asked to cultivate back poppy
and some already moved to the area where poppy can be planted.
</P>
<P>
"Though the cultivation of sugarcane, a poppy substitute crop,
has achieved success this year, things came to such a state that
the cultivation of sugarcane stopped as there was no way to seek
markets," he said, stressing that it is difficult for them to
maintain the success after eradication of poppy cultivation.
</P>
<P>
He requested the government and international organizations to
provide effective assistance to the region for the success for the
implementation of the six-year plan for perpetual elimination of
narcotic drugs.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the people in the region will make concerted
efforts to raise the living standard.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has laid down a 15-year total drug eradication plan for
the whole country beginning 1999.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh May Fail to Fulfill Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh may not be able to
complete all the development activities under the country's Annual
Development Program (ADP) for the current 1998-99 fiscal year, the
Bangladesh Observer reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only 44 percent of the ADP development activities were
completed during the first eight months of the fiscal year ending
June 1999, as against the target of 66.66 percent, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Planning Ministry said that only about 43
percent of the total fund allocated for the ADP for the fiscal
year had been spent, and now it was a great challenge to spend the
rest 57 percent to successfully implement the activities in the
remaining four months.
</P>
<P>
Under the ADP, 274 projects of a total 1,216 projects are to be
completed within the fiscal year, but only four projects have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
Another source from the ministry, however, termed the overall
activities satisfactory. "The development activities are not bad
at all even after the century's worst floods which the country
experienced last year," he said, adding that the rate of
development in the last eight months exceeded that of the same
period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The latest report of Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
Department under the Planning Ministry said that about 59.15
billion taka (1.22 billion U.S. dollars) were spent in the last
eight months, out of the total amount of 136 billion taka (2.80
billion dollars) in the ADP.
</P>
<P>
The rate of expenditure of the local currency increased, but
the use of project assistance fell, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Bigger Trade Surplus in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia recorded a bigger
trade surplus in March this year due to a higher growth in exports
compared with the same month last year, according to the
Statistics Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the 17th consecutive month since November 1997 that
Malaysia continued to record a trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in March amounted to 6.5 billion ringgit
(1.71 billion U.S. dollars) against a smaller surplus of 4.0
billion ringgit (1.052 billion U.S. dollars) in the same month
last year, the department's preliminary "Monthly External Trade
Statistics" shows.
</P>
<P>
During March, the country's exports grew 5.9 percent to 25.7
billion ringgit (6.763 billion U.S. dollars) while its imports
declined 5.4 percent to 19.2 billion ringgit (5.052 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department said the surplus in March was also higher by 1.6
billion ringgit (421.052 million U.S. dollars) compared with 4.9
billion ringgit (1.289 billion U.S. dollars) recorded in February.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of the year, the trade surplus was larger
at 15.7 billion ringgit (4.131 billion U.S. dollars) from a
surplus of 9.1 billion ringgit (2.394 billion U.S. dollars)
recorded a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the bigger surplus in
January-March was due to a larger decline in imports of 10.7
percent to 53.7 billion ringgit (14.131 billion U.S. dollars) and
a marginal increase in exports of 0.3 percent to 69.4 billion
ringgit (18.263 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi University Closed Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladeshi university has been
closed sine die following violence on the campus unleashed by some
students on Sunday and Monday, local press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)
was closed on Tuesday for an indefinite period, with all
examinations and academic and administrative activities suspended,
to avert further untoward incidents on the campus, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the university said a group of student,
numbering about 300, stormed the residential area of the teachers
and officials, the council building, several research sites,
provost offices of some residential halls, dining halls and common
rooms.
</P>
<P>
Computers, other office equipment and four cars were damaged by
the students and a teacher was injured, according to the press
release which also blamed police for "playing silent role during
the incident."
</P>
<P>
The students' action was triggered by the expulsion of a
student of the Civil Engineering Department, who was ousted for
impersonating another student in examinations around a month ago.
</P>
<P>
BUET Teachers' Association on Wednesday demanded steps to
strengthen security measures for teachers and stern action against
the students involved in the incidents, and a judicial probe into
the "mysterious and inactive" role of police during the incidents.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Import Maize to Ease Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
has entered into contracts with four companies to import 100,000
tons of maize at a cost of 15.6 million U.S. dollars to alleviate
the shortage of food in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Ismail
Ivwata, told reporters in here Wednesday that the move came after
an appeal made by the Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye to import
200,000 tons of emergency food.
</P>
<P>
More than one million people across the country have been
plagued by a crop failure due to a drought starting last October,
while the government's own grain reserves have been virtually
depleted.
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts, each of the companies would import 25,000
tons of maize, with each ton valued at between 135 U.S. dollars
and 176.5 U.S. dollars, Ivwata said.
</P>
<P>
He named the contracted companies as EECO Traders of Britain,
Andrea &AMP; CIE SA, Mbutano Investment Company, and Sky Coach
Services Limited.
</P>
<P>
The deputy agriculture minister said that food situation in
several regions especially Dodoma and Tabora and some districts in
Morogoro, Mbeya, Arusha, Iringa, Coast and Kilimanjaro regions is
still a problem of concern.
</P>
<P>
According to assessment made by the ministry, the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Food Program (WFP),
Tanzania is short of 600,000 tons of food in the first half of
this year.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Court Sentences 7 Genocide Suspects to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The criminal court in northern
Rwanda's Ruhengeri district Tuesday sentenced to death seven
genocide suspects accused of involvement in the genocide in the
area in April-July 1994, according to judicial sources in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The seven were part of a group of 25 genocide suspects who were
brought to court in a ''mega-trial,'' the Rwanda News Agency
Wednesday quoted the same sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
They were found guilty of five accounts including the creation
of terrorist gangs which rampaged Ruhondo commune, throwing
corpses in pit latrines, as well as illegal possession of arms.
</P>
<P>
Twelve of the 25 accused were found not guilty and subsequently
released, while five others were sentenced to life imprisonment.
One man got a one-year jail term.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan prisons are crammed with over 124,000 genocide suspects
waiting for trial. In a two-year period, Rwandan criminal courts
have handled over 1, 000 cases, with over 150 death penalties.
Twenty-two genocide culprits were publicly executed in April of
last year.
</P>
<P>
At this pace, trials of genocide suspects could continue to the
next century, some legal experts noted.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government has an ambitious plan of accelerating
trials by resorting to traditional courts commonly known here as
''Gacaca.''

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (59) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Why should the three issues be raised and solved during the
transition in Macao?
</P>
<P>
To ensure a smooth transition and transfer of government in
Macao, it is necessary to properly handle all major matters during
the transitional period, the most important ones of which are the
localization of the civil servants, the official language and the
laws.
</P>
<P>
The three issues are left over from history. When the two
Governments of China and Portugal signed the Joint Declaration on
the Question of Macao in 1987, conditions in Macao were
incompatible with its future return to China, which are shown in
the following three aspects:
</P>
<P>
1. The civil servants in Macao. The Portuguese Macao
Government employed about 10,000 civil servants at the time.
Among them, almost all the middle and senior level official posts
were occupied by Portuguese or their descendants (popularly known
as Macaense), while Chinese who accounted for about 97 percent of
the local population could only serve posts at the lower level.
This is obviously disproportionate to the population composition
in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, information released by the Macao Government shows
that the proportion of civil servants who were born in Portugal
rose sharply between 1980 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
2. Official language. Portuguese has long been the only
official language in Macao. All the laws promulgated by the
Portuguese Macao Government, all the communications between the
residents and the Government in Macao must be in Portuguese. A
test on Portuguese was compulsory for the recruitment or promotion
of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Chinese language which is the mother
tongue of the 97 percent of people in Macao was not used at all in
the executive, legislative and judicial activities in Macao. Yet
very few local Chinese speak Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
3. Local laws. The legal system in Macao at the time was
mainly composed of the laws in force in Portugal which were
extended to be applicable to Macao while the locally made laws
were few in number and insignificant. These Portuguese laws
enforced in Macao are outdated and out of step with the situation
in Macao.
</P>
<P>
What is more, they are written in Portuguese without being
translated into Chinese and thus not comprehensible to most local
Chinese residents. Furthermore, the judicial system in Macao was
affiliated with that of Portugal and all the judges and
prosecutors came from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, this situation is absolutely incongruous with the
status that Macao will enjoy after its return to China. If this
situation was not to be changed, the Chinese Government would not
be able to smoothly resume its exercise of sovereignty over Macao,
and it would be impossible to implement in Macao the policy of "
one country, two systems" as set forth in the Basic Law.
Therefore, it is essential for a smooth transition in Macao to
employ local people to public offices, make Chinese the official
language of Macao and localize the laws there.

What are the specific tasks of the Preparatory Committee for
the Macao Special Administrative Region?
</P>
<P>
On April 29, 1998, the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
People's Congress formally adopted, at its second meeting, the
Remarks by the National People's Congress on the Draft Name-list
of the Members of the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee is composed of 100 members, among
whom 60 are from all walks of life in Macao and 40 from the
mainland (including from the Macao Branch of the Xinhua News
Agency), with Vice Premier Qian Qichen as its Chairman and nine
Vice Chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee held its first meeting in Beijing
from May 5 to 6, 1998, during which Chairman Li Peng of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued an
instrument of appointment to each of the members and delivered a
speech. At this plenary meeting, the Detailed Working Rules of
the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region of the National People's Congress was adopted, a decision
was made to set up four working groups on the political, legal,
economic and social and cultural affairs, and the future work of
the Committee was discussed in some length.
</P>
<P>
As a working body of the National People's Congress, the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
has the following nine tasks:
</P>
<P>
1. Form the first Government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region, including working out the specific methods
for the formation of the Selection Committee for the First
Government and the selection of a candidate for the Chief
Executive, producing the Selection Committee and the candidate
according to the Methods, and deciding on the composition of the
First Government;
</P>
<P>
2. Work out specific methods for the formation of the First
Legislature;
</P>
<P>
3. Work out specific methods for the formation of the judicial
organs in the Macao Special Administrative Region;
</P>
<P>
4. Propose ways to handle the major legal matters related to a
smooth transition, including how to handle the previous laws in
force in Macao which contravene the Basic Law, and submit their

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Denies Killing Congolese Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army has rejected
reports by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that its
soldiers killed six Congolese rebels and 11 Ugandans in Kisangani,
north of DRC, in a protest against their presence in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
''This is false, it's a mere fabrication whose purpose is
obvious,'' Rwandan army spokesman Emanuel Ndahiro told Rwanda News
Agency, calling it a propaganda war by the Laurent Kabila regime.
</P>
<P>
Leon Kasonga, the DRC army spokesman, had said on state
television in Kinshasa that Rwandan troops opened fire on 400
disarmed Congolese rebels who had staged a protest march in Camp
Ketele, but did not say when the incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
''We are not aware of any incident of that kind,'' Ndahiro
said, adding the Rwandans are in good terms with the rebels they
are backing.
</P>
<P>
Jean Pierre Ondekane, commander of the rebel Congolese Rally
for Democracy, also refuted the report by the government official.
</P>
<P>
''Rwandan soldiers are with us since the beginning of the
rebellion, they are helping us and we fully collaborate,''
Ondekane told the news agency on a satellite phone from Bendera
town, in Katanga province.
</P>
<P>
However, well-informed sources in Kisangani gave another
version of the alleged protest. It is said that the protest
actually took place and was directed against the Ugandan People
Defense Force (UPDF) army chief of staff, Brigadier James Kazini,
who had arrested one RCD commander in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
''The Congolese rebels appealed for the release of their
commander and used the local radio to call upon residents to
protest against the UPDF senior commanders who have messed up
themselves with the Congolese,'' the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (61) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 61 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Can long-term prosperity and stability in Macao be maintained
after its return to China?
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that Macao will be able to maintain long-term
prosperity and stability after its return.
</P>
<P>
In terms of policies, the basic policy that the Chinese
Government pursues on Macao is that of "one country, two systems".
This policy has enjoyed extensive support of all Chinese people
including the compatriots in Macao as well as appreciation of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
This is because this policy conforms to both the need for
reform and opening up in China and the actual conditions in Macao.
It is a policy that will serve the long-term interests of China
and its people. It will be a stable and long-term policy and by no
means one of expediency. The Constitution of China and the Basic
Law will guarantee it. In a word, the long-term prosperity and
stability of Macao is ensured by the most reliable policy and
legal safeguards.
</P>
<P>
As to itself, Macao enjoys unique geographical, economic and
cultural advantages and maintains extensive exchanges and links
with many countries and regions. And our Macao compatriots have
had glorious patriotic and hard-working traditions. With the
implementation of the policies of "one country, two systems" and "
Macao people administering Macao", people from all walks of life
in Macao will surely unite more closely, give full play to their
own advantages and with their wisdom, industry and tenacity,
create a more beautiful Macao.
</P>
<P>
In respect to the relationship between the Central Government
and the MSAR, a local administrative region in China enjoying a
high degree of autonomy, the Central Government has the
responsibility and capability to ensure the long-term prosperity
and stability of Macao. The Central Government will vigorously
cooperate with and support Macao in its efforts to promote its
economy and improve its people's livelihood. The deepening of the
reform and opening-up program on the mainland and the steady
increase in China's comprehensive national strength will serve as
an ever stronger guarantee for the long-term prosperity and
stability of Macao.
</P>
<P>
After its return to China, Macao will certainly enjoy a more
splendid future.

<HEADLINE> East China Sea Natural Gas Piped To Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Some 3,700 families in
Shanghai's Pudong New Area have become the first group of
residents in the city to be supplied Wednesday with natural gas
from the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Construction work on the natural gas project in the East China
Sea, one of the key state projects during the 1996-2000 period,
has almost been completed after three years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
The project cost more than 6.5 billion yuan (783 million US
dollars) and included construction work on an offshore platform, a
natural gas processing plant, two seabed oil and gas pipes, as
well as related facilities in Shanghai urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The project's daily supply capacity of natural gas to Shanghai
is expected to rise from the current 300,000 cubic meters to 1.2
million cubic meters by the end of the year, making the gas supply
accessible to all residents in Pudong New Area.
</P>
<P>
Citizens living on the west bank of the local Huangpu River
will also gradually be supplied with the "green" energy.
</P>
<P>
With the wider use of natural gas, old coal gas plants in
Shanghai will be gradually closed down or renovated.
</P>
<P>
Oil explored from the sea had been piped to Shanghai by the end
of last year.

<P>
Meanwhile, more than 250 hotels, guesthouses and recreational
centers have been mobilized to cope with the anticipated big
influx of domestic and foreign tourists. Now the city can
accommodate some 50,000 tourists every day.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,800 IC phones have been installed along every major
street, enabling users to communicate with 204 countries and
regions across the world. The Kunming telecom departments have
invested over 800 million yuan (about 100 million US dollar) on
improving the local mobile phone network.
</P>
<P>
"Our company has just bought 300 luxury public transit buses
and they are ready to shuttle between the city proper and the
exhibition venue," said Shang Hua from the Kunming City Public
Transit Company.
</P>
<P>
Many Kunming citizens viewed the horticultural show as a golden
business opportunity. Almost all stalls selling color films in the
city have reported sharp rises in their sales volume.
</P>
<P>
"Every day I carry several passengers to and from the
exposition venue,"said taxi driver Huang Fang. "Things would be
much better when the Exposition venue is officially open to
tourists on May 1."
</P>
<P>
Kunming Mayor Zhang Chengyin has recently called on local
citizens to give an all-out support to the exposition, saying that
grand garden show is "a significant opportunity" for the city to
seek new developments and make itself better known to the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The city has to date recruited more than 60,000 young
volunteers to serve as tourist guides, interpreters and guards to
maintain order. Local television is running a crash English course
during the prime time to help more citizens learn essential
English for communicating with foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"Now even my little granddaughter has mastered enough simple
English to converse  with foreigners," said Jiang, a retired
workers.

<P>
SOFIA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The seventh meeting of the
parliamentary presidents of the countries bidding for European
Union (EU) membership concluded here Wednesday with the adoption
of two statements on the situation of southeast Europe and the EU
enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
All the parliamentary chiefs of 12 countries believe the
maximum open and transparent process is indispensable to the EU
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
European Parliament President Jose Maria Gil-Robles said at a

second groups of countries bidding for membership into different
classes but the entrance timetable for every country will be
different.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the EU speed up the reform work and better finish it
before the end of 2000, which will be also a prerequisite for the
success of the enlargement process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, opened on Tuesday, is attended by the
parliamentary leaders of all countries taking part in the EU
enlargement process, which are Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua Seeks Loans for Interoceanic Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua is seeking financial
support for an interoceanic railway project worth one billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The railway line, to be 473 kilometers long, will link the
country's Pacific and Atlantic coasts, from the Pacific port of
Corinto in the north to the Atlantic port of Monkey Point in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Last week a Nicaraguan mission went to Washington to seek a
credit for the construction of the railway, said the newspaper "La
Tribuna" on Wednesday, quoting Gilberto Cuadra from the company
SIT-Globa, which is in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
The railway will extend almost half the length of the country
and be used for the transportation of containers from one coast to
the other, said Cuadra.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the railway line, the project will also include
the construction of 80 kilometers of highway and 168 bridges.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Pledge to Strengthen HIPC Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank pledged here Wednesday to strengthen the
Initiative of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).
</P>
<P>
At a one-day meeting in Washington, the Development Committee
of the two international financial institutions agreed to take
action to enable HIPC Initiative debt relief to be "broader,
deeper and faster".
</P>
<P>
A communique released after the meeting said the ministers "
expressed their continued strong support for the Initiative and
reaffirmed its overarching objective of poverty reduction".
</P>
<P>
The Development Committee, consisting of 24 members, generally
ministers of finance, advises and reports to the boards of
governors of the Bank and the IMF on the transfer of real
resources to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Ministers reiterated the importance of ensuring a clear link
between debt relief and the goals of sustainable development and
poverty reduction and looked forward to the results of ongoing
consultations in this area," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also endorsed a set of principles that should be
used in considering changes to the current HIPC framework,
including ways and means to promote sustainable development and
poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative was launched in 1996 to deal with debt
problems of developing countries. So far, only two countries --
Uganda and Bolivia -- have received debt-relief assistance.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on the lessons of the recent financial crisis, the
ministers also reiterated the importance of concerted action to
help countries to bolster their social policies and institutions.
</P>
<P>
They also emphasized the importance and urgency of work by the
World Bank and the IMF to help countries become better prepared
for crises, and to ensure that when a crisis strikes the most
vulnerable groups are protected and the process of longer term
development sustained.
</P>
<P>
The committee decided that its next meeting will be held on
September 25 this year in Washington.

COLOMBO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika

A special unit will be set up at police headquarters to monitor
the progress of the effort.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Files Suits Against 15 Florida Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft, the world's
largest software maker, said on Wednesday that it had filed civil
suits against 15 Florida companies for selling or installing
Microsoft software illegally.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Seattle-based computer-software giant also
said two more Florida companies are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said the move in Florida was part of its national
anti-piracy effort, but that there is more illegal copying of
software in Florida than in most other states.
</P>
<P>
"The piracy rate in the U.S. as a whole is about 27 percent.
And in Florida it is estimated to be 32.3 percent," said Tony
Viera, Microsoft corporate attorney in charge of anti-piracy for
Latin America and Florida.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Microsoft filed similar suits against 20
Californian companies that had sold or installed illegal copies of
Microsoft programs.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, Microsoft has filed more than 100
similar civil lawsuits in dozens of states, including New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Minnesota,
Alabama and New York.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft claims that software piracy cost Florida 7,186 jobs
in 1997 and 490 million U.S. dollars in lost wages, tax revenue
and retail sales.
</P>
<P>
Software pirates often sell programs for 50 percent of the
average retail value, and some for as low as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources say while Microsoft itself has expanded
efforts to sell legitimate copies of its software over the
Internet, the network also makes distribution of illegal versions
easier to do and harder to detect.

Helsinki summit at the end of this year, the starting dates for
negotiations on the accession of each applicant state will become
clear.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Early Recovery for Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) expects the Philippine economy to recover this year, with
its gross domestic product (GDP) expanding by 2.2 percent due
mainly to a "fast turnaround" in the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Business World Thursday quoted a recently released IMF report
as saying that a strong agriculture sector could very well make up
for the expected poor performance of the industrial sector in the
first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
GDP is the value of goods and services produced by the economy
domestically, and is one of the widest measures of economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
The IMF report said some recovery in the industrial sector and
continued robust growth in the services sector will feed the
country's economy this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the continued strength of the export sector,
emanating from a strong demand for electronic products in the
international markets, will also give the economy the boost it
needs.
</P>
<P>
The IMF forecast, however, assumed the Philippine
administration successfully implements the economic policies it
has agreed to follow under a two-year standby program activated
last year.
</P>
<P>
The program puts emphasis on containing inflation at an average
of 8.5 percent for the entire year, reforms in fiscal management
and reforms in the taxation of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
With these reforms in place, the IMF said faster growth will
return in the medium term, at an average of 5 percent in the next
five years.

OTTAWA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- A 14-year-old boy opened fire with
a gun at a high school in Alberta, western Canada, Wednesday,
killing one student and seriously injuring another.

The suspect, a Grade 9 student who quit the W.R. Myers public

<HEADLINE> Congress Denies Clinton Support for Bombing on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted late on Wednesday against a resolution in
support of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was rejected on a 213-213 tie vote. Earlier, the
House voted 249 to 180 to limit President Bill Clinton's ability
to widen the Kosovo war, demanding the president to get
congressional approval before deploying ground troops.
</P>
<P>
The House's votes showed a great contrast to Clinton's appeal
for a "single voice" in Congress on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The debate was the first full House discussion about the Kosovo
crisis since NATO started bombing Yugoslavia on March 24..
</P>
<P>
The majority Republicans said Congress was merely exercising
its constitutional responsibility and forcing Clinton to keep his
word on not sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We should not even be in the Balkans," said Republican
representative Floyd Spence, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee. "The national security of this country is not at stake.
"
</P>
<P>
Doug Bereuter, representative from Nebraska, said: "Bombing for
peace is wrong and it's not working."
</P>
<P>
The Senate had voted bipartisan support for the airstrikes last
month. The House vote caught both Democratic and Republican
leaders by surprise. The administration said it would press ahead
with its airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
In response to the House vote, White House spokesman Jake
Siewert said NATO would continue its air campaign against
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Reports Growth in Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin scored some 2.7 billion U.
S. dollars in foreign trade from January to March, up 14 percent
from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In breakdown, exports made up 1.49 billion U.S. dollars, a rise
of 25.8 percent, and imports were 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 2.1
percent, according to sources from the Municipal Commission of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent of this northern port city's exports, or 1.
07 billion U.S. dollars, were done by overseas-financed
enterprises in the city, up 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, both state-owned enterprises and private
businesses clinched bigger increases in exports according to their
respective export volumes in the first quarter of last year, said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the city's rising export momentum to local
efforts to promptly adjust foreign trade strategy and expand the
city's overseas-backed businesses.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin now boats over 4,000 operational overseas-financed
businesses, said the information.
</P>
<P>
China's imports surged 11.6 percent in the first three months
of 1999, the highest growth rate since the second quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The total import value amounting to 32.99 billion U.S. dollars
between January and March, and the overall trade volume for the
period was 70.26 billion U.S. dollars, up 0.3 percent, while
export value dropped 7.9 percent to 37.27 billion U.S. dollars,
said earlier reports.

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank to Resume Lending to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have almost cleared the way for the
resumption of lending to Russia, the two monetary organs said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced that it had reached an agreement in principle
with Russia on a new economic reform program that will allow it to
resume lending to the country.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said negotiations over
the past few days resolved the major issues that had prevented the
IMF from resuming a lending program cut off in August when Russia
defaulted on billions of dollars in foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that we have agreed with the Russian authorities
on an economic program for Russia that I hope to be able to
recommend to the (IMF) executive board," Camdessus said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
He said there were a "few technical elements to be settled in
the next few days." But after those issues are resolved, Camdessus
said he would take the request for loan approval to the board and
expected endorsement for 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in new IMF loans
for Russia over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The items still to be cleared up include action by the Russian
parliament on a package of economic reforms the IMF is demanding.
That could take until mid-June, Russian Central Bank President
Viktor Geraschenko told reporters earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus said the agreement was reached after the IMF received
assurances from the Russians that the government of President
Boris Yeltsin will bring down the budget deficit and make
structural reforms to the country's banking system and in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the measures have been implemented and I have
received the necessary assurances, I shall ask the executive board
to consider Russia's request," Camdessus said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the World Bank (WB) said that it had completed
negotiations with the Russian government for the revision of the
third Structural Adjustment Loan.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that disbursements from the revised loan could
begin in the summer, following implementation of agreed prior
actions and approval by the IMF's board of the new economic
program for Russia.
</P>
<P>
The third Structural Adjustment Loan of 1.5 billion dollars was
originally approved by the World Bank's executive board in August
1998, and its first installment, for 300 million dollars,
disbursed at that time.
</P>
<P>
The loan is aimed to support reforms to the economic
environment for the development of productive enterprises in
Russia, including the reform of infrastructure monopolies, private
sector development, fiscal management, and financial sector reform.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that we have reached this important agreement
for support of Russia's economic reform efforts," said WB
President James Wolfensohn. "We look forward to implementing this
program for the benefit of the Russian people."
</P>
<P>
The Russian economy has been in a severe recession since last
year's default on foreign debt and a botched devaluation of the
Russian ruble. It suffered a 4.8-percent contraction in 1998 and
the IMF is predicting an even steeper decline of 7 percent in
output this year.

<HEADLINE> "Spring City" Ready for World Horticultural Show (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- When dusk fell on this famous "
Spring City" in southwest China, there would be people out in the
streets to spray water or wash the trees on sidewalks by using
firehoses. They were not firemen in drills, but volunteers doing
the last touch of preparations to greet the opening of the '99
Kunming International Horticultural Exposition on May 1.
</P>
<P>
With only two days to go, the people are busy sprucing up the
city, making it as beautiful as it can be.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that five million pots of flowers have been
laid in every major street and lane of the city that has a
population of 3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that the whole city is a large garden," said
Chen Xiaojuan, a tourist from north China who just bought two
bundles of carnations from a local flower market.
</P>
<P>
The newly-built six-lane road leading from the airport to the
downtown area is decorated with flowers and grass, with colorful
bunting bearing the expo emblem and mascot designs fluttering in
the breeze. Banners inscribed with the expo theme, "Man and Nature,
Marching Into the 21st Century", are strung over major streets,
crossings and overpasses.
</P>
<P>
Facelifting started two years ago when the city was chosen to
be the host of the exposition. The city government has spent more
than two billion yuan (about 250 million US dollars) upgrading 69
streets,laying six large downtown lawns with a total area of 274
hectares and covering 30 percent of the city with green.
</P>
<P>
"The cityscape has changed a lot," exclaimed Jiang Zhenfeng, a
retired worker. "All streets are tidy and clean. Spitting or
cigarette butts are nowhere to be seen."
</P>
<P>
Reputed as China's "Spring City" for its year-round mild
climate, Kunming is believed to be the best choice for hosting the
horticultural show.
</P>
<P>
The large Kunming new airport was completed and put into
service on April 15. It is capable of handling 12 million
passengers a year.

Kosovo comprehensive self-government with full equality of all
ethnic groups and will respect the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Serbia and Yugoslavia. Only such an agreement
could lay the foundation for a lasting and just solution to the
Kosovo issue, it said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides noted the negotiations should be "direct" and
involve representatives from all ethnic groups in Kosovo. Direct
negotiations were proof of mutual respect, said the statement.

International community representatives could be present at the
negotiations as guests with the agreement of both sides, it added.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Likely to Allow NATO to Use Its Airspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and NATO on Wednesday
exchanged notes on allowing NATO to use the country's airspace
within the framework of the "united forces" military action, the
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The exchanging of notes means the two sides have reached an
agreement on this matter, and the Bulgarian government will submit
a bill concerning the notes to the National Assembly (parliament)
for ratification, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the rules of the parliament, the voting will take at
least three days, said Iordan Sokolov, chairman of the parliament,
who was confident that the bill will be passed.
</P>
<P>
After NATO asked Bulgaria to give unlimited access to its
airspace to the alliance for military actions against Yugoslavia
on April 17, Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov went to Brussels,
the NATO's headquarters, to discuss with NATO leaders about the
details.
</P>
<P>
But as Bulgaria is not a NATO member, the military alliance has
to exchange notes with Bulgaria instead of signing a formal
agreement on the issue, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft, Bulgaria will open to NATO a 110-kilometer
wide air corridor to the east of the border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, Bulgarian opposition parties such as the Socialist
Party has more than once expressed objection to the question,
saying that opening the country's sky to NATO goes against the
stand passed by the parliament of "not directly or indirectly
participating in military actions against Yugoslavia". They are
expected to vote against the bill, said the report.

NANJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Jiangsu Province, east
China, has set up a wetland reserve on the Hongze Lake, one of the
country's largest freshwater lakes.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, covering an area of approximately 1,670 hectares,
is intended mainly to protect the habitat of rare birds,
</P>
<P>
Hongze Lake is a lake where 143 species of migratory birds
live through the winter. Nine of the species, such as cranes and
swans, have been listed under the protection by an international
convention signed by China, Russia, Japan, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), and the Republic of Korea (ROK).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the birds have been threatened by over-catching
of aquatic resources, imbalanced biological environment and
shrinkage of wetlands in recent years, and local experts have
called for immediate efforts for their protection.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is home to more than 40 species of water plants,
and some 50 kinds of fish, shrimp and crustaceans. Efforts will be
further enhanced to keep the habitat in the primitive state.

during the first month of NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia,
according to Prime Minister Zlatko Matesahas.
</P>
<P>
He warned if the strikes continued in the travelling season,
Croatia's transport services would lose some 70 million dollars as
foreign ships and planes would not stop at Croatian ports or

Croatian travel agencies were estimated to have lost more than
60 million dollars by May if the air strikes continued, and they

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Organizations Urge NATO to Stop Attacks Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam Fatherland Front and
the Vietnam Union of Scientific and Technical Associations (VUSTA)
have strongly condemned the U.S. and NATO's military actions
against Yugoslavia and urged NATO to end its attack against that
country.
</P>
<P>
The Presidium of the Vietnam Fatherland Front said in a
statement Wednesday that the destructive war against Yugoslavia
launched by the U.S. and NATO has outrageously violated the basic
principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as essential
rights of a nation and the right to live of a person, and is
destroying the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Vietnamese people share with the
Yugoslavian people the pain and losses caused by NATO's attack.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Fatherland Front has called on the United Nations
Secretary General, all countries, and peace, justice and
progress-loving forces across the world to take concrete and
practical actions to make NATO stop immediately the use of force
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the Vietnam Union of Scientific and Technical
Associations (VUSTA) demanded the U.S. and its allies stop
immediately and unconditionally all forms of military interference
in Yugoslavia, stressing that their continual bombing of
Yugoslavia since March 24 has killed and injured many innocent
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The VUSTA said the outrageous attack against Yugoslavia, a
sovereign country, by the U.S. and its NATO allies has destroyed
cultural works and the environment, causing heavy losses to the
Yugoslavian people and country, and threatening the cause of peace
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Union called on scientists and intellectuals all over the
world to raise their voice of conscience and humanity against the
attack on Yugoslavia.

KUNMING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China's largest private museum
has been opened here in Kunming, capital of southwestern China's
Yunnan province, right before the opening of the China '99 Kunming

</P>
<P>
Located in the southern part of Kunming City, the art museum,
built at a cost of 36 million yuan (about 4.35 million US dollars),
covers nearly three hectares.
</P>
<P>
The whole museum has five exhibition areas, devoted
respectively to paintings and calligraphic works, blue and white
porcelain, purple earthware, ethnic costumes and ornaments, and
fossils and grotesque stones.

well-known collector. He inherited a large collection left over
from his grandfather and enriched the family collections by
purchasing a wealth of precious paintings and calligraphic works,
porcelain and chinaware with money he earned from his flower
business.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Both Russia and South Africa
Wednesday emphasized that the current Kosovo crisis should be
settled by political means.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
noted that more countries, including NATO members, now stand for a
political solution, thus creating conditions for ending the crisis
"through joint efforts."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the current situation in the Balkan region is "very
complicated," he said much work needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
On his part, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo stressed
the U.N. should play a more active role in solving the crisis. As
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) president, he added, South Africa
called on the movement to play its due role in the crisis.

Nzo arrived here Wednesday with President Nelson Mandela on a
state visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine opposes NATO's
bombardment of Yugoslavia and called for a peaceful solution to
the crisis, said visiting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Boris
Tarassiuk here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine did not accept the use of force when solving
international problems and the air strikes on Yugoslavia had
already inflicted considerable economic loss on even all the
neighboring states, Tarassiuk told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country, which was about 400 kilometers away
from Yugoslavia, was suffering a daily loss of about 300,000 U.S.
dollars because of the Kosovo crisis. For this reason, Tarassiuk
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The minister will leave for Buenos Aires Wednesday evening to
continue his tour of five Latin American countries. During his two-
day visit to Brazil, Tarassiuk held talks on promoting bilateral
relations and signed three cooperation agreements on science,

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Party Condemns NATO Strikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian People's Party
(PPP) urged all the social sectors of the country to declare
themselves against the military attacks by NATO against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The PPP said on Wednesday that the military action led by the U.
S. against the government of Slobodan Milosevic violates human
rights and is a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
The party said that under the pretext of human rights, the
military intervention by NATO in Yugoslavia was hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
The PPP stated that each bombing raid cost 334 million U.S.
dollars, a figure sufficient to repair the damage caused to
Central America last year by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The party believed that NATO's military actions were sheer
proof of their hegemonism, to which no Latin American country
could stay silent.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the imperialism of the U.S. and its European
allies against Yugoslavia, must be rejected by all social sectors,
and by every person with common sense and true humanity.

<HEADLINE> Author Wins Lawsuit on Internet Story Infringement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing court yesterday ruled
in favor of a plaintiff whose story, published on his homepage,
was printed by a newspaper without permission, China Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was likely China's first case in copyright infringement on
works published on the Internet, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Weihua, director of Beijing Rongyida Electronic Co Ltd,
posted a story concerning a computer program on a website (www.3d.
yeah.net) on May 10 last year, under the pseudonym "Wu Fang," the
name of the homepage owner.
</P>
<P>
Chen claimed that the article, which discussed the development
of MAYA, a 3-D animation making software, was accompanied by a
copyright statement saying: "All Rights Reserved; No Reprint
without Permission."
</P>
<P>
However, the Chengdu-based Computer Business Information Weekly,
upon receiving an e-mail from a reader recommending the story,
printed it in its October 16 issue, without permission from Chen,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The weekly refused to neither apologize to Chen nor pay more
than its standard fee for contributed articles, as demanded by
Chen, because it alleged that Chen could not prove that he was "Wu
Fang," the author.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Haidian District People's Court, after
investigating, confirmed that "Wu Fang" is Chen Weihua, because
Chen could log onto the homepage, change its password, upload or
erase files.
</P>
<P>
"The article should be protected by China's Copyright Law as a
literary creation since it was published on the Internet so the
public could read it," said Li Dongtao, chief justice of the court,
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China just celebrated the fifth anniversary of its access to
the Internet last week, while the Copyright Law became effective
in 1991, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Targets Two Golds From Pool in SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Swimming
Association (PRSI) is optimistic the nation's swimmers will scoop
at least two golds in relay events in the 20th Southeast Asian (
SEA) Games in Brunei Darussalam in August.
</P>
<P>
PRSI's deputy to the technical committee Gerald Item said the
association would rely on eight key swimmers to maintain the
second medal position it gained in the 1997 SEA Games in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The swimmers would be selected from senior athletes, undergoing
training abroad and here, and junior swimmers who would be picked
from results of the three-day national age-group championship
starting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Only swimmers displaying the best form in various swimming
competitions this year will be named to the country's squad. They
are expected to meet Indonesia's best records produced in the 1997
biennial event.
</P>
<P>
"The association wants to send eight swimmers, at the minimum,
but we will also send several young swimmers who manage to attain
their best form to join their seniors in the SEA Games," Gerald
was quoted by The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, we only targeted four but we got 11 golds. This year,
we are targeting two to four golds from the men's and women's
relays because we faced a setback in our training program last
year due to the monetary crisis," he added.

whether we will send Mia to Copenhagen (World Championships) or
not. In the future, we hope Mia will be able to overcome her grief
and boost her fighting spirit," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Study Sees Emerging U.S. Information Appliance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 28 (Xinhua) -- With the continuing decline
in PC prices and the overall softness in the PC market, a shift to
the information appliance market is underway in the United States,
according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The emerging market of home and office devices which can
transmit to or plug into common public or private networks will
completely shape computing in the 21st century, said the report by
4th Wave Inc., a U.S. market research and technology assessment
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
The market is not about the Internet, the report said, but it's
used as a platform for the delivery of products and services.
Winning products and services will help ease the burden of
individual lives through technology. This is not fundamentally
different from the role that technology played 100 years ago when
electricity, the automobile, the telephone and radio
communications emerged, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Driving the emergence of the market will be very cheap
computing power and pervasive connectivity of homes, workplaces,
automobiles and individuals. Home markets will drive the next era
of computing, and a significant part of the markets will be based
on services rather than products.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the report said, the service market in 2004 is
estimated at 8.3 billion U.S. dollars, compared with the product
market of 4.8 billion dollars. By 2005, services will represent 77
percent of the market. In total, the market will rise to 5 billion
dollars by 2001, 20 billion dollars in 2008, and reach 23 billion
dollars in 2009.
</P>
<P>
Based on an evaluation of the role of computing in the U.S. GDP,
an average selling price for information appliances will be 70
dollars or a service cost of 23 dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the market transition is not just about
information appliances but the emergence of "the fifth era of
computing," a new era following mainframe, minicomputer,
workstations and PC.
</P>
<P>
"The fifth era of computing is going to be radically different
from the PC era," the report said. "This is essential as computing
become pervasive and the transition is made to the markets of the
21st century," it added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian FM Leaves for Hanoi Admission Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Nam Hong left here Thursday morning for Hanoi, Vietnam to attend
the ceremony to admit Cambodia into the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will be held in Hanoi on Friday to admit Cambodia
into ASEAN as its 10th member, which will finally fulfill the
dream of bringing all the 10 countries in the region into the
regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
Hor Nam Hong told the reporters at the airport that "April 30
will become a day of historic significance as the vision of
10-ASEAN has come true."
</P>
<P>
"Cambodia's entry into ASEAN serves the interests and needs of
both Cambodia and ASEAN. With Cambodia's entry, ASEAN will become
a more powerful regional grouping politically and economically,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have made a lot of efforts and preparations for joining the
regional group, because it will bring great political and economic
benefits to Cambodia," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Though Cambodia will face many difficulties after joining
ASEAN," he said, "We are optimistic about the future."
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Hor Nam Hong will sign two agreements --
the declaration to join ASEAN and the recognition of all ASEAN
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will host the special admission ceremony for Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia had been scheduled to join ASEAN on July 23, 1997
along with Laos and Myanmar, but the plan was put on hold after
factional fighting broke out in Phnom Penh.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister Sacked for Deviating Statements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic Wednesday sacked Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic for
"openly opposing the government's position and undermining its
credibility", the Ministry of Information said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on Tuesday to mark the seventh
anniversary of the founding of the Yugoslav Federation, Draskovic,
who assumed the deputy premiership on January 22, accused the
Yugoslav ruling party, the Social Party of Serbia, of
strengthening dictatorship by taking advantage of the current war
status.
</P>
<P>
The Belgrade Independence Television Station controlled by
Draskovic-led opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement, gave
the press conference a live broadcast.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Draskovic also welcomed the stationing of
multinational peace-keeping forces in Kosovo under the control of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spokesman Nebojsa Vujevic reiterated
on Wednesday that "the Yugoslav Federation will only accept
unarmed civilian monitors to be sent to Kosovo by the United
Nations."

<HEADLINE> TAT Targets Potential Tourists Using Cyberspace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) has announced a niche market strategy, using Internet
information technology to attract potential tourists.
</P>
<P>
TAT would invest 26 million baht (702,702 U.S. dollars) in the
development of an Internet Web page to attract visitors from
lucrative markets, particularly from North America and Japan, TAT
deputy governor Juthamas Siriwan was quoted Thursday by The Nation
as saying.
</P>
<P>
She said a great number of American and Japanese tourists spend
many hours surfing the Net For travel information and the TAT's
new Web page, which will display Thai tourist attractions, will be
targeted at those groups.
</P>
<P>
The Web page is part of the TAT's overall plan for niche market
promotional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Juthamas said that more than a half of the amount allocated
would be directed towards promoting the U.S. market, from which
the number of tourists to Thailand in 1998 grew by 17.8 percent to
415,831 on a year-on-year basis.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan has denied reports that he has agreed to stay on as England
coach beyond this summer, according to local reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Keegan originally agreed to take charge of the England team for
four matches - last month's Euro 2000 qualifier with Poland, the
Budapest friendly game, and two more qualifiers next month against
Sweden and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
He then planned to concentrate solely on his job of chief
operating officer at Fulham after these games.
</P>
<P>
But a report in the Daily Mail newspaper, said Keegan had
already told Football Association officials that he was willing to
stay on as a part-time coach next season, before taking over on a
full-time basis in the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Keegan has rejected the claims, however, saying: "It is not
true, there has been no meeting at all."
</P>
<P>
And the FA's executive director, David Davies, speaking from
Budapest ahead of England's friendly with Hungary on Wednesday,
told the BBC no deal has yet been agreed.
</P>
<P>
FA technical director, Howard Wilkinson, has also refused to
say what he thought would happen after June.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing definite has been arranged," the former Leeds manager
told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
</P>
<P>
"It's a delicate situation at the moment. He's got
responsibilities towards Fulham."
</P>
<P>
But Wilkinson did drop a hint about the FA's preferences, and
when a decision would be announced.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly the FA have got to keep their options open in case, if
Kevin was their choice, he decided not to carry on.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the sooner it's sorted out towards the end of the
season the better."
</P>
<P>
According to the Daily Mail, Keegan's mind is already made up,
however
</P>
<P>
"It is not beyond the realms of possibility that I will be
staying," he is quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I am in charge for four games of which we have already played
one and then we will wait and see."
</P>
<P>
Keegan is said to be delighted with the new set-up at the
Football Association in which Wilkinson is playing a key role.
</P>
<P>
"I have a lot of good people around me, including Howard
Wilkinson who has been invaluable to me and together we have got a
nice little team going.
</P>
<P>
"The FA is very professional, totally different from when I
played, and that makes it an easy job to be England manager - so
long as you keep winning."

<HEADLINE> Williams and O'Sullivan Reach Final Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- World number five snooker player
Mark Williams reached the semifinals of the world championship for
the second year running with a 13-9 victory over 1997 champion Ken
Doherty in Sheffield, England on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Doherty rallied from a 7-1 down at the end of first session,
reducing Williams's lead to four frames at 11-7.
</P>
<P>
But the 29-year-old Irishman was unable to completely bridge
the gap and Williams finished the match with a flourish, stroking
in a break of 97.
</P>
<P>
It was sweet revenge for the Welsh left-hander who was beaten
by Doherty at the semifinal stage last year.
</P>
<P>
"I've got a bit more experience and I've won a few more
tournaments since then," Williams said.
</P>
<P>
Ronnie O'Sullivan set his sights on his first world title after
beating former champion John Parrott in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Resuming with an 11-5 overnight lead, O'Sullivan saw his
advantage cut to three frames at 12-9.
</P>
<P>
But Parrott's comeback hopes were killed off when O'Sullivan
won the 22nd frame to complete a 13-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan said: "The season hasn't been as successful as it
could have been. But that's only down to myself and I'd like to
put matters right by lifting the world title."
</P>
<P>
O'Sullivan is bidding to become the first English player to win
the title since Parrott's success eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> China Establishes Remote Diagnosis Network for Military Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide network of remote
medical diagnosis which has already linked up 150 military
hospitals has begun to take shape in China.
</P>
<P>
An official with the General Logistics Department of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) said that by the end of next year
the network is expected have all military hospitals connected.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the network, which includes multi-media
computers, video cameras and fax machines and program controlled
telephones, can provide effective medical treatment for army
personnel stationed in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
Currently more than 500 medical experts in dozens of
specialties from PLA hospitals are able to offer on screen
diagnosis for army personnel operating in areas with small
hospitals such as those in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia, the Tibet Autonomous Region and
the Xisha Islands.
</P>
<P>
The network, which is also connected to similar civilian
facilities covering over 20 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions, has already saved the lives of over 3,000
officers and soldiers since it was first introduced in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The network will also be important for the PLA when operating
in special conditions such as fighting flood control and during
wartime.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Military Area Command, which took the lead in building
up the network in hospitals under its area military command, has
also been seeking ways it can be used in the field.

<HEADLINE> Banks Hammers the Scots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- British Sports Minister Tony Banks
has told a Scottish newspaper that the country's national football
team are under-achievers who are effectively "the West Ham of
world football".
</P>
<P>
The devoted Chelsea supporter repeated his call that Scotland
should merge with the other home nations and compete as a national
British team.
</P>
<P>
His comments came as Scotland prepared to test themselves in a
friendly against European champions Germany, and as the government
fights an election campaign for the Scottish parliament.
</P>
<P>
The poll for the new devolved body is just over a week away,
while the friendly match in Bremen takes place on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Scotland is one of the great football nations and have a
fabulous qualifying record," Mr Banks told the Scottish Sun.
</P>
<P>
"But they have never got past the first round and if you think
about them in English terms they are the West Ham of world
football- they never quite perform to their full potential.
</P>
<P>
"No-one can argue that Scottish football at its best is some of
the finest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"But Scotland never make it past the group stage and England
consistently fail to find that extra push in the final stages.
</P>
<P>
"As Britain they would win it," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish Football Association rejected the call.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Banks is entitled to his opinion," said SFA president Jack
McGinn.
</P>
<P>
"However, there is no evidence to suggest that there is any
support in the home countries for a Great Britain team."
</P>
<P>
The minister admits that his beliefs are unlikely ever to
become a reality, although he is determined to secure a British
presence in the Olympic soccer competition.
</P>
<P>
That would require a Great Britain team to be formed, an idea
which has always been rejected by the four home Football
Associations.
</P>
<P>
They fear it could undermine their powerful status as separate
countries in Fifa.
</P>
<P>
"Fifa president Sepp Blatter is talking about the possibility
of a British team in the Olympics and I'd love to see that happen,
"said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"But if we want to enter a soccer team in the Olympics we must
find a way of getting round the fact we have four home countries.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we could bring back the Home Nations Championship to
decide things as it used to be a big feature of the football
season," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australia still to Consider Hodgson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia will still consider
recruiting Roy Hodgson as their new coach despite the fact that he
has taken charge of Inter Milan until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
The Australian head coaching job has been filled by caretaker
Raul Blanco since the departure of former England boss Terry
Venables last July and the national side are being pressed to make
a decision.
</P>
<P>
Soccer Australia chairman Basil Scarsella claimed nothing had
changed with the announcement of Hodgson's Italian appointment and
the 51-year-old Englishman is one of several coaches still under
consideration for the job.
</P>
<P>
"He is a personal friend of the president of Inter Milan, he
was asked to fill in as a coach there and he has gone," the BBC
report quoted Scarsella as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly if Soccer Australia are looking at him it's not a bad
choice when a club like Inter Milan asks him to come and help out.
</P>
<P>
"He's still one of the front-runners in our search, he's one of
the favorites from overseas but that does not discount the locals
either."
</P>
<P>
The former Blackburn Rovers boss joined Inter as technical
director on Tuesday and has been given just four matches to revive
the fortunes of the Italian club.
</P>
<P>
However he will be replaced next season by former Juventus
coach Marcello Lippi.
</P>
<P>
Hodgson is well respected in Italy where he took Inter to third
place in Serie A and the UEFA Cup Final.

<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal's Nicolas Anelka has issued a public apology to the
Professional Footballers' Association for not appearing at their
annual awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old French international was voted Young Player of
the Year by his fellow professionals.
</P>
<P>
But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger had to accept the award on
his behalf and Anelka was alleged later to have spent the evening
instead at a nearby nightclub.
</P>
<P>
Anelka said: "I would like to pass on my apologies to the PFA
for not attending the ceremony on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately I was not aware of the full significance of this
award and I am sorry for any misunderstanding, upset or ill-
feeling it may have caused.
</P>
<P>
"It is a great honor for me to receive this highly regarded
accolade and I would now like to take the opportunity to thank my
fellow professionals for voting for me, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Calls for Yellow Card Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein is calling for a change in
the game's disciplinary system.
</P>
<P>
Dein, a possible candidate to become the next chairman of the
Football Association, wants the rule changed whereby players are
suspended after receiving five yellow cards, according to local
reports on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Highbury supremo thinks the current system is unfair to
both players and supporters and he does not want to see players
punished until they receive seven or eight bookings.
</P>
<P>
"The disciplinary procedures will be reviewed this summer with
managers having an input into the way these work," said Dein.
</P>
<P>
"I think they should be changed because at the moment teams and
fans are being denied the services of talented players.
</P>
<P>
"With the system of refereeing today there are a lot of cards
about. Maybe five cards for a suspension is too few and it should
be seven or eight. There is a double jeopardy because when a
player is sent off, a previous misdemeanor counts against him and
that is not right."

<HEADLINE> George Foreman Testifies Before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- George Foreman, former
heavyweight champion in the United States, testified Wednesday in
New Jersey before a federal grand jury in a probe whether the IBF
sold rankings and arranged fights in return for kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
Foreman would not discuss his testimony, but said he had never
been paid a kickback. The lawyer Lawrence H. Wechsler said federal
prosecutors are examining whether Foreman was extorted by
sanctioning groups, and that he did not know if Foreman ever paid
to better his ranking.
</P>
<P>
"I think that boxing should be given some time to clean up its
act," Forman said. "If not someone should do it for them."
</P>
<P>
Although inactive in the ring for several years, Foreman, 50,
said he wants to fight the man he considers the heavyweight
champion, Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to keep coming back until I'm a grandfather and
boxing is a sport as clean as pingpong," said Foreman.
</P>
<P>
At 45, Foreman captured the IBF and WBA championships to
become the oldest champion in any weight class, and now boasts a
record of 76-5.
</P>
<P>
Forman said his opinion about the Evander Holyfield-Lennox
Lewis title fight. "I think Lewis won the fight hands down."
</P>
<P>
But he said it was not the first robbery the sport has seen,
and claimed his defeat in 1974 by Muhammad Ali in Zaire should be
a prime example.
</P>
<P>
Federal grand jurors have subpoenaed all IBF records since
1982 on rankings and contracts for fights, as well as checks,
invoices, expense forms and telephone records, its attorney has
said.

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Remain One Issue Separated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Only one big issue is
separating the WNBA and the player union from reaching a labor
agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the only unresolved
concerns the number of not-for-profit appearances players make. No
negotiations are scheduled today.
</P>
<P>
The WNBA is supposed to begin a 10-week season on June 10. The
labor dispute forced the postponement of this week's draft.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on Monday and Tuesday settled other matters on a
four-year agreement. The contract would include a reopener option
for the league or the union after three years, with both sides
agreeing to no-lockout, no-strike clauses.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for 5 percent increases a year for draft
picks. Players from the ABI would be treated as rookies for salary
purposes this year but not subject to option clauses that teams
hold on other rookies for their second seasons. Veterans would no
longer be subject to such options.
</P>
<P>
The league postponed its player draft, which had been scheduled
for Tuesday. Earlier, the union and league agreed on a four-year
deal that would increase minimum salaries from $15,000 to $30,000
for veterans and $25,000 for rookies.

<HEADLINE> Mourning Has Slight Eye Fracture, out Two Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Miami Heat star center Alonzo
Mourning is in need of a new facial device to protect his injured
right eye and will be sidelined for at least two games.
</P>
<P>
Examinations today by Heat team doctors revealed a slight
fracture of Mourning's right eye orbit, but surgery is not
necessary.
</P>
<P>
He has been ruled out of Miami's next games Thursday against
Boston and Saturday versus Chicago. However, Mourning could be
available to play when the Heat host the Charlotte Hornets on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The four-time All-Star center suffered the injury when he was
poked in the eye in Monday's 90-65 win at Cleveland and missed
Tuesday's 95-76 victory at New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Mourning is no stranger to injury, having missed an average of
nearly 14 games over his first six seasons. Last year, he wore a
protective mask that covered most of his face after breaking his
left cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
This time around, Mourning will wear a device to protect the
eye when he returns to action.
</P>
<P>
The injury comes at a bad time for the Heat, who are battling
for the top seed in the Eastern Conference. At 31-14, they lead
Orlando by two games for the Atlantic Division lead and Indiana,
the front-runner in the Central Division, by 2 1/2 games with five
to play.
</P>
<P>
Mourning leads the league in blocked shots at 4.0 per game, is
12th in scoring (20.3), seventh in rebounds (11.1) and ninth in
field-goal percentage (.511).

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Norway trounced Georgia 4-1 in
Tbilisi on Wednesday in a European Soccer Championships group two
qualifying match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Austria blanked San Marino 7-0, restoring national
pride after the 9-0 crush by Spain last month and taking them to
the top of group six.
</P>
<P>
All Norway's goals came from players currently with teams in
the English premier league with Chelsea's Tore Andre Flo scoring
twice, and Tottenham Hotspur's Steffen Iversen and Ole Gunnar
Solskjaer of Manchester United adding the others.
</P>
<P>
Norway raced into a 4-0 lead after only 38 minutes but failed
to take greater advantage of a weak Georgian side who scored a
consolation goal midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
With Latvia, the leaders at the start of the day, being held to
a 0-0 draw at home by Albania in a match switched to Riga because
of the situation in the Balkans, Norway moved two points clear at
the top of group two.
</P>
<P>
They lead with 10 points from five matches, followed by Latvia
with eight from five and Greece six from five.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia, Georgia and Albania occupy the bottom three places
and are all but out of the running.
</P>
<P>
Out of a job is Georgia's coach Vladimir Gutsayev who announced
his intention to quit after this match a month ago claiming he
could not get on with several players in the team.
</P>
<P>
Ivica Vastic scored three goals for Austria, with Christian
Maryleb scoring twice. Martin Amerhauser and the veteran Andreas
Herzog (penalty) scored the others.
</P>
<P>
Austria, under new Croatian coach Otto Baric, go back to the
top of a very tight group with 10 points from five matches. They
are a point clear of Spain, who have nine points from four matches,
and surprise package Cyprus who have nine points from five matches.
</P>
<P>
Israel have seven points from four games, while San Marino are
bottom after six straight defeats and a goal tally of 1-27.

<HEADLINE> Scotland Stuns Germany in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Scotland gave the soccer world a
shock when it stunned Germany for the first time in 40 years on
Wednesday when 12 friendly internationals around Europe produced a
clutch of notable upsets.
</P>
<P>
Scotland, with a makeshift strikeforce following injuries and
withdrawals by several key players, stunned the reigning European
champions 1-0 in Bremen to continue Germany's recent run of poor
results.
</P>
<P>
There were also upset wins for Ireland over Sweden and Morocco
over the Netherlands in Arnhem.
</P>
<P>
In the glamour match of the night played in front of a 98,000
crowd, Barcelona drew 2-2 with Brazil in a Nou Camp game to mark
the Spanish club's centenary.
</P>
<P>
In other high-profile friendlies, Hungary drew 1-1 with England
in Budapest and Denmark drew 1-1 with South Africa in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Germany made most of the early running against Scotland but
failed to turn their possession into clear chances.
</P>
<P>
The only goal came when Don Hutchison scored after 65 minutes,
his first goal for his country in only his second international to
send a 27,000 German crowd home stunned and angry.
</P>
<P>
Scotland boss Craig Brown, who said before the match that he
had so many problems finding a team he was worried about playing
the game, greeted the result with cautious optimism afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"We were fortunate but I would gladly swap that result for a
win in Prague," he said, looking ahead to his team's vital Euro
2000 qualifier against group nine leaders Czech Republic on June 9.
</P>
<P>
"It gives us a bit of optimism. If we play with the same spirit,
the same determination, then I think we can do something over
there," added Brown.
</P>
<P>
Ireland showed neighboring England the way to beat Sweden when
they defeated the runaway European Championship group five leaders
2-0 in Dublin with goals from substitute Graham Kavanagh after 75
minutes and Mark Kennedy two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Morocco were also surprise winners, beating Euro 2000 co-hosts
Netherlands -- although more than half the Dutch team were playing
for Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Morocco, narrowly eliminated after the first round in last
year's World Cup finals, took a 2-0 lead with goals from Youssef
Chippo (59) and Salaheddine Bassir (69).
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands' consolation came in the last minute through
Ruud van Nistelrooy.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, who will jointly stage next year's finals with the
Dutch, also lost, going down to a 1-0 defeat to Romania in
Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, who were jeered off after losing at home to Egypt and
Bulgaria last month, would not qualify for the finals on current
form after a string of four 1-0 defeats.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Ionel Ganea scored the winner for Romania just after
halftime, but the hosts wasted a series of scoring chances and
should have won more comfortably.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo scored against his former club Barcelona to give Brazil
the lead after 29 minutes in a rain-lashed Nou Camp --with Luis
Enrique equalizing five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Rivaldo, of Barcelona then scored against his club for his
country to put Brazil back in front after 40 minutes with Philip
Cocu completing the scoring at 2-2 after 63 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Budapest, an Alan Shearer penalty gave an unfamiliar-looking
England team the lead over Hungary after 22 minutes before Janos
Hrutka scored the equalizer with a 25-meter freekick after 79
minutes that flew past David Seaman in the England goal.
</P>
<P>
England coach Kevin Keegan gave debuts to five players and said
afterwards that he would like to take the job on a permanent basis
after his temporary tenure ends in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Only a great performance from Manchester United goalkeeper
Peter Schmeichel saved the Denmark from defeat in Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
The Danes dominated the first half and scored through Ebbe Sand
after 40 minutes, but South Africa came back strongly after the
break and substitute John Moshoeu equalized after 72 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Poland scored a notable victory over the Czech Republic, who
like Sweden, boast a 100 per cent record in their European
qualifying group. Poland, chasing Sweden and England in their
qualifying section, beat the Czechs 2-1 in Warsaw.

<HEADLINE>   Keegan Wants the England Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan has confirmed he
wants to remain as England Coach - as long as he doesn't let
anybody down.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his experimental side were held 1-1 by Hungary
in the Nep Stadium on Wednesday, Keegan told Sky Sports talks are
ongoing but in essence, he does want to continue as England coach.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "I've had two chats with the FA and we are still
talking. But I don't want people to think that I don't want this
job because I do. It is a job I want, I just don't want to let
anybody down and that's what has made it difficult."
</P>
<P>
"The game against Hungary is another match under my belt at
this level, which gives me more experience, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Keegan took over the England helm from the sacked Glenn Hoddle
last February but said he would only be in charge for four matches,
ending after the Euro 2000 championship qualifier against Bulgaria

WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration on Wednesday announced
a major revision in U.S. sanctions policy that will permit sales
of food and medical items to Iran, Libya and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The new policy calls for an exemption of such items from future
sanctions, but will not affect sanctions against Iraq, Cuba and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat told reporters that
the announcement was the result of a two-year review of overall U.
S. sanctions policy which concluded that allowing food and
medicine sales to above-mentioned countries "doesn't enhance a
nation's military capability or ability to support terrorism." (

<HEADLINE> China, Vietnam to Launch Joint Oil Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- China and Viet Nam will work at
strengthening their bilateral co-cooperation in offshore oil
exploration, today's China Daily quoted a China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The papers said that Peprovietnam, a large-scale Vietnamese
state-owned company engaged in the offshore oil exploration
business, will invite international public bidding for a
polyethylene extracting project worth 80 million US dollars and a
2 million-ton gas storage project.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has invited the CNOOC to participate
in the public bidding and hopes for mutual co-operation in the
offshore oil and gas exploration field.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC officials said that they will send a specialist group
to Viet Nam to assess the economic efficiency of the projects
involved and discuss the co-operation possibilities between the
two groups.
</P>
<P>
In addition, CNOOC would like to take practical measures to
forge a healthy business relationship with its Vietnamese
counterpart in many areas, including technical exchanges and
professional training programs.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a Peprovietnam delegation paid a formal visit to
CNOOC. At the talks, also attended by the Vietnamese ambassador to
China, the two sides briefed each other on their business
development outlines.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the two countries have bright co-
operation prospects in the oil exploration business in the future.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC is interested in the offshore oil and gas exploration
with its priorities in providing technology and equipment, said
the officials.
</P>
<P>
Peprovieetnam is making efforts to expand international co-
operation and is seeking technical exchange opportunities with
their overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The top officials of the two countries wish the boundary
division problem in Beibu Bay will be solved as soon as possible
to speed up the bilateral business co-operation process.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the Peprovietnam delegation looked around the
offshore oil exploration research center with senior consultants
of CNOOC.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the two countries' industrial organizations have
broken the ice and begun to get in touch with each other. The
recent visit and the bilateral talks have stepped up the pace in
the two-way co-operation, officials said.

<HEADLINE> London Police Arrest Gunman After Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Armed police stormed a flat and
arrested a man Wednesday evening after a chase through the streets
of west London and a brief siege.
</P>
<P>
Police said a family of three had been trapped in the flat
above during the siege, but they were not held hostage and were
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
The drama began around 16:20 local time (1520 GMT) when a man,
driving a blue Maestro car, left a petrol station without paying.
</P>
<P>
He was pursued by police and opened fire on a police car before
hijacking another car.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, said to be armed with both an assault rifle and a
pistol, drove towards the High Street of nearby Feltham, where he
abandoned the Maestro.
</P>
<P>
The gunman then stopped and got into a white Vauxhall Astra. He
later abandoned the car and fled on foot, police said.
</P>
<P>
At around 19:30, he took over a ground floor flat in Feltham in
west London where a family of three people were living.
</P>
<P>
Police sieged the house, negotiated in vain and then stormed
into it to arrest the gunman. Nobody was believed to have been
hurt in the incident.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian President Unhappy About NATO Attitude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov
said Tuesday that he is unhappy with the way the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) treats his country.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian news agency MIA reported that at a press
conference held at the end of the recent NATO summit in
Washington, Gligorov expressed his dissatisfaction about the
Western military alliance's attitude toward Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
After his return to the Macedonian capital of Skopje from
Washington Tuesday, Gligorov told reporters that he does not
expect NATO to accept Macedonia as a member at present.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has expressed its desire for a NATO membership while
NATO, much against Macedonia's wish, just listed Macedonia as a
third-wave country to join it.
</P>
<P>
NATO, embarrassed with its failure to make Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept the conditions set by the West for
solving the Kosovo crisis after month-long air strikes, has been
reportedly planning a possible ground offensive in Kosovo to drive
out Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has been resisting NATO's efforts in persuading it to
allow NATO forces to launch a ground attack on Yugoslavia from its
soil.
</P>
<P>
Officially, there are around 12,000 NATO troops in Macedonia at
present. But NATO has been sending reinforcements and heavy
weaponry to Macedonia over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Although it was agreed that no more than 16,000 NATO troops
will be allowed to be stationed in Macedonia, there has been
speculation that the actual number of NATO troops in the country
has risen to 22,000, which have taken an offensive position.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo War Threatens Macedonian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Finance Minister Boris
Stojmenov said Wednesday that the on-going Kosovo war is
threatening the economic stability in Macedonia and ruining the
prospect of the country's development.
</P>
<P>
Stojmenov told foreign reporters that due to the Kosovo war,
Macedonia's economy is facing a very grave situation with the
national gross product (NGP) expected to decline by 8 percent and
the budget deficit-NGP rate to rise from the originally planned
0.1 percent to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unless Macedonia can have 485 million U.S. dollars in foreign
aid, it cannot maintain the economic stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
An economic slowdown in Macedonia will threaten the stability
not only in Macedonia but also in the entire Balkan region, the
Macedonian minister warned.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian economy has been adversely affected by NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia which began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Macedonian government said that the economic loss caused by
the Kosovo war will amount to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia has called on the international community, especially
the Western countries, for financial assistance and writing off or
delaying the payment of its foreign debts.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Transfer of Resources to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- China called here Wednesday
for transfer of resources to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Transferring resources to developing countries will exert a
profound overall impact on stimulating global market demand and
preventing worldwide deflation," said Jin Liqun, vice finance
minister of China.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the 59th meeting of the Development
Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), Jin said the Committee was established to promote the
transfer of resources to developing countries, which has been a
major agenda for the development business.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that while providing assistance to crisis-hit
countries, the World Bank and other international financial
institutions should make more efforts to fully understand and meet
the diversified financial needs of developing countries under the
current situation.
</P>
<P>
He urged the World Bank to make increased efforts to lower its
lending costs and provide concessional resources to developing
countries,
</P>
<P>
Official development assistance, particularly the concessional
funding, continues to decline despite improved fiscal positions in
major developed countries, which have benefited from relatively
low commodity prices, particularly oil, Jin said.
</P>
<P>
"Major developed countries should make concrete efforts to
increase official development assistance as required by their
moral obligation and the need to revitalize the world economy and
help developing countries maintain their balance of payments," he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Comprehensive Development Framework (CDF), Jin said that
the development experience of China and other countries
demonstrates that social transformation is of great importance to
sustainable economic growth whereas economic growth is the
foundation for social development.
</P>
<P>
"Given the diversity of countries in cultural and historical
backgrounds and development stages, the contents of and approaches
to comprehensive development programs will necessarily be
different, and the design and implementation of individual program
should certainly go beyond a single format," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank's proposed CDF initiative should aim at helping its
clients implement their own development strategies," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jin called on the World Bank to continue to contribute to
comprehensive development through providing financial and
technical assistance in areas such as education, health, urban
development, environmental protection, and institutional capacity
building.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in order to enhance the effectiveness of the
discussions on "global financial architecture," the modalities of
international forums concerned need to be improved so as to ensure
the full participation by developing countries in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The prospective global financial architecture should be able
to reflect the common interests, especially those of the
developing countries, on world economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It should take into account the special needs of developing
countries at different development stages and put them on the
equal footings during the economic globalization process," he
added.

<HEADLINE> House Votes to Restrict Clinton From Widening Kosovo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives
Wednesday voted to limit President Bill Clinton's ability to widen
the Kosovo war, saying the president should get congressional
approval before injecting "ground elements" into the
ever-expanding conflict with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The 249 to 180 vote blocked the funding of 6 billion dollars
that Clinton had earlier at a White House meeting with lawmakers
urged Congress to approve.
</P>
<P>
Majority-party Republicans said Congress was merely exercising
its constitutional responsibility and forcing Clinton to keep his
word on not sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not put our young men and women... in the position where
they are on the ground under fire and the president is consulting
with the Congress of the United States after the fact, of their
being in harm's way," declared House majority leader Dick Armey.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions set by the vote could even make it hard to use
the Apache attack helicopters that have been recently sent to
Albania, poised for attacking Serb ground forces.
</P>
<P>
"We should not even be in the Balkans," said Republican
representative Floyd Spence, chairman of the Armed Services
Committee. "The national security of this country is not at
stake."
</P>
<P>
In its first full debate since airstrikes began against
Yugoslavia on March 24, the House voted not only to restrict
Clinton's ability to commit ground forces, but also required the
president to first consult with Congress and get its approval
before sending combat troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The House debate was complicated by two other proposals by
California Republican Tom Campbell, which sought to force Congress
to make a stark choice between formally declaring war against
Yugoslavia or withdrawing U.S. forces from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Both proposals are expected to be rejected, but must be voted
on by the full House under provisions triggered by the 1973 War
Power Act.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the White House meeting with lawmakers, Clinton
expressed reservation about measures like the one the House had
just passed, saying 19 NATO nations had expressed unity over the
weekend and "America must continue to speak with a single voice as
well."
</P>
<P>
Clinton pressed for quick approval of his 6 billion dollar
request to pay for the expanded bombing against Yugoslavia and
urged lawmakers to resist Republican-led efforts to double it. "We
must get a Kosovo funding measure passed and to my desk now," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UK Suppliers Launch New Body to Regulate Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- The demand for effective
regulation of Chinese medicine and herbs in the UK has taken a
significant step forward Wednesday with the launch of a new
self-regulatory body by Britain's major Chinese medicine
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Medicine Association of Suppliers (CMAS), the first
of its kind across Europe, aims to oversee the supply of Chinese
medicine to practitioners and retailers in the UK.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional Chinese medicine and herbal remedies are
increasingly popular in the West, but they do need to be properly
regulated. The Association is committed to achieving this," said
CMAS chairman Henry Lee, who is also the head of Chinese Medicine
Developments at Britain's Middlesex University.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 600 to 700 registered practitioners in
Traditional Chinese Medicine in the UK, treating more than 1
million patients each year. However, there remain some grey areas
under current regulation arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The CMAS, with 17 signed suppliers which account for 80 percent
of the total Chinese medicines and herbs imports in the UK, will
oversee the supply of herbs to up to 500 Chinese medicine
practitioners in the country.
</P>
<P>
One of the priorities of the CMAS is to ensure that the
majority of the UK's Chinese medicine suppliers are providing
"quality control" products, Robert Miller, managing director of
East West Herbs Ltd, one of the CMAS' members, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The CMAS will work to assure safety and quality of Chinese
medicine in the UK through initiatives such as authentication and
chemical assays of herbs, and the planned introduction of a
kitemark for the herbs.
</P>
<P>
Supplier members of the CMAS are also committed to a code of
practice under which they must ensure the supply of authenticated
herbs and genuine non-toxic herbal products.

not think that there will be a massive transfer of refugees from
Macedonia to West Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Puig, who began a three-day visit to Macedonia Monday, said
that the West European countries want the Kosovo refugees to stay
in Yugoslavia's neighboring countries so that they could be
speedily returned to their homes in the future.
</P>
<P>
Puig said that he will submit his report on the refugee
situation to German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who holds
the current EU presidency, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He promised to make assistance proposals for the countries who
have taken Kosovo refugees in great numbers.
</P>
<P>
The West European countries should take mid-term and long-term
measures to help Macedonia cope with the grave situation caused by
the arrival of over 130,000 Kosovo refugees, he said.
</P>
<P>
He supported the idea of a Marshall's plan for Southeast
Europe, the Macedonian news agency MIA reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Macedonia, Puig met Macedonia's Urbanism
and Civil Engineering Minister Dusko Kadiesvski, Internal Affairs
Minister Pavle Trajanov and other Macedonian officials.
</P>
<P>
He also met with workers of the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees (UNCHR) and officers of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Skopje.
</P>
<P>
Puig visited a refugee camp in Stenkovec, Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eight flights were scheduled to take Kosovo refugees
from Macedonia to Norway, France, Finland and the Netherlands
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Promises to Consult Congress if Ground Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
pledged to leaders of Congress Wednesday that he would seek their
support should he resort to the use of ground troops in the
Yugoslavia conflict.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the promise in a letter to the congressional
leaders, released after he met about 40 members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The president said he was confident NATO air power would be
enough to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to allow
ethnic Albanian refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
However, if he changed his policy on ground troops, Clinton
said, "I can assure you that I would fully consult with the
Congress."
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, without regard to our differing constitutional views
on the use of force, I would ask for congressional support before
introducing U.S. ground troops into Kosovo into a non-permissive
environment," he said, meaning a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to
block funding for the deployment of U.S. ground troops in
Yugoslavia unless Clinton first gains the approval of Congress.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the White House announced Clinton would go to
Germany next Tuesday for a brief trip to visit U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
He will meet U.S. pilots flying bombing sorties from
Spangdahlem Air Base and see humanitarian relief operations at
Ramstein Air Force Base. The U.S.-led NATO started bombing
Yugoslavia in March.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Calls for Peaceful Solution to Congo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 NAIROBI, April 28 (Xinhua) - Ghanaian Vice-President John
Atta Mills on Wednesday called for collective efforts to solve
the political crises in the Great Lakes region, particularly in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, to make way for the development
of the people.
</P>
<P>
 "It is our expectation that together we can work towards
restoring durable peace and normalcy to those countries in order
to create the requisite atmosphere for sustainable development and
progress of our peoples," the vice president said.
</P>
<P>
 Vice-President Mills made these remarks in meeting with
Zimbabwean High Commissioner-designate Ngoni Sengwe at the State
House in Accra, according Ghana News Agency report.
</P>
<P>
 Mills said Ghana recognizes Zimbabwe's efforts in searching
for peace and security in the region.
</P>
<P>
 On the situation in Zimbabwe, he said Ghana has followed with
keen interest the pragmatic measures taken by that government to
ensure sustained economic development and prosperity for the
people.
</P>
<P>
 He said particularly laudable is the setting up of the
National Economic Forum to tackle issues affecting its
development.
</P>
<P>
 Mills also commended Harare's "bold" implementation of the
Land Reform Program in a bid to eradicate poverty and achieve
social justice through land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
 On bilateral relations, the vice president recalled the bond
of friendship between Ghana and Zimbabwe, saying the two peoples
have been drawn together through their common fight against
colonialism and imperialism as well as their commitment to peace,
stability and progress on the continent.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Ashanti Gold Jumps in Gold Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ghanaian government now has 19 percent of the company's
shareholding, whereas the British Lonrho PLC 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Peprah said the company commenced a major expansion program of
the Siguiri mine in the Republic of Guinea last year and "that
made significant contributions to our total gold production".
</P>
<P>
When Siguiri II mine is commissioned by the end of this year,
production capacity will be increased from some 160,000 ounces to
nearly 250,000 ounces per annum, he added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Ayanfuri mine, all other AGC mines exceeded
their production targets, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The company's acquisition of Samax Gold last year provided the
basis for an enlarged Geita mine in northern Tanzania which is
expected to yield 400,000 ounces of gold per year.
</P>
<P>
 The board chairman announced that the company maintained its
gold reserves at 23 million ounces but resources over the period
increased the reserves by five percent to 37 million ounces.
</P>
<P>
 He said AGC will continues to invest in the Obuasi mine so
that it could maintain its flagship status "but at lower cash
operating costs".
</P>
<P>
 The company spent nearly 30 million dollars to further its
exploration efforts on the mine sites and elsewhere in Africa, to
ensure its positive growth into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
On safety issue, the minister said the company marked new
international milestones, as Freda-Rebecca mine in Zimbabwe and
Bibiani mine in Ghana became recipients of the South Africa-based
national occupational safety association's Three Star rating
awards.
