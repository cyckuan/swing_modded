Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets from
the Los Alamos weapons lab have been found behind a copying machine within the
lab's top-secret secure area and are being evaluated, the Energy Department and
government sources said Friday. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the two
hard drives, believed to be the ones that disappeared more than six weeks ago,
were in an area that apparently had been searched before. Richardson said
investigators are looking into ''inconsistencies'' surrounding the whereabouts
of the devices. The FBI has examined the drives for fingerprints and they were
to be examined electronically on Saturday, said an official who spoke on
condition of not being identified further.

Senate Validates E-Signatures

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will soon usher in a new stage in the
digital age where the electronic signature and Internet-conveyed record have the
same legal standing as a pen-and-paper document. The president has strongly
backed the electronic signature legislation that cleared the Senate Friday by an
87-0 vote, saying it will marry the old value of consumer protection with the
newest technologies. The bill, which the House passed earlier in the week by
426-4, sets a national framework for giving online signatures legal status.

Koreas End Propaganda Broadcasts

<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Name-calling on the world's most heavily armed
border was replaced Friday with pop songs and words of reconciliation, as North
and South Korea stopped propaganda broadcasts across the Demilitarized Zone.
Koreas' leaders pledged to work together to end half a century of hostilities
and unite families separated by the Korean War. During the three-day summit,
which ended Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il ordered his
state-controlled media and military to stop all anti-South propaganda. South
Korea reciprocated Friday.

U.N. Verifies Israeli Withdrawal

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a setback for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Lebanon on Friday rejected the United Nations' verification of Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon, saying Israel still controls some Lebanese
territory. Annan had said earlier Friday at U.N. headquarters that the United
Nations has confirmed the Israeli withdrawal is complete. That announcement is
supposed to clear the way for U.N. troops to move into the border area and help
Lebanese forces restore peace and regain authority in the region.

   DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- Southern California's air-quality agency voted
Friday to require nearly 11,000 transit buses and garbage trucks to convert to
cleaner-burning alternative fuels, setting what environmentalists hope will be
an example for the rest of the country. The rules are believed to be the first

Air Quality Management District, require that all new vehicles bought by transit
agencies and trash companies run on natural gas, methanol, electricity or fuel

Pacers Defeat Lakers 120-87
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Led by Jalen Rose, the Indiana Pacers put on a fantastic
shooting display that kept the Lakers' championship plans on hold. Starting
6-for-6 on 3-pointers and shooting 75 percent in the first quarter, Indiana
manhandled Los Angeles 120-87 Friday night in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. A
four-point play by Miller turned a five-point lead into a nine-point lead just
seven minutes in, and three 3-pointers by Rose helped the Pacers score 39 points
in the first quarter -- their best of the postseason.

<HEADLINE> 22 Low Caste India Villagers Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Gunmen dressed in black stormed a
village in eastern India and shot dead 22 members of a low caste
community, domestic news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers were members of the Ranvir Sena, a private militia
run by upper caste feudal landlords, K.A. Jacob, the police chief
in eastern Bihar state said, quoted by the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre was apparently in retaliation for the killing of 12
upper caste villagers last week.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers stormed several homes in Miapur village late
Friday and sprayed bullets into the sleeping victims, all members
of the Yadav community of cattle herders. Twenty-two people died
immediately while an unspecified number were seriously wounded.
</P>
<P>
   However, some villagers put the number of dead at 24, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
   The last major strike by the Ranvir Sena was in Narayanpur
village in the neighboring district of Jehanabad, infamous for its
caste wars.
</P>
<P>
   Caste strife is endemic in Bihar, one of India's most lawless
and backward states. The Ranvir Sena is locked in a war of
attrition with ultra-left organizations like the Maoist Communist
Center and the People's War Group who say they represent the
interest of lower caste peasants.
</P>
<P>
   About 83 percent of India's one billion people are believers of
Hinduism, which classifies its people into a social hierarchy of
castes.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalan Troops To Patrol Streets  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Thousands of Guatemalan troops will start
patrolling streets round the clock this weekend to help police who,
have been losing the battle against crime.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo has publicly criticized
police for getting out smarted by criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is necessary to change the entire structure of authorities
to provide the kind of security Guatemalans need,'' said Defense
Minister Juan de Dios Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said the plan will continue ''as long as there is need''
with troops assuming many of the responsibilities of police,
including making arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand that there will be some hassle for common
Guatemalans who will be driving in their cars and be stopped by
soldiers looking for proper registration and weapons,'' Defense
Minister Juan de Dios Estrada told reporters at a press conference
Friday. ''But the new daily annoyances will be done for everyone's
well being.''
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 soldiers are being deployed to help out the 5,000
police officers, said National Police Director Mario Rene
Cifuentes.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala created its first all-civilian police force as a
condition of the December 1996 peace accords, which ended
Guatemala's 36-year civil war between government forces and leftist
guerillas. About 200,000 Guatemalans were killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   The law allowing the military to come to the aid of police was
first proposed by Portillo last month. It sailed through the
Guatemalan legislature with almost no opposition last week. The
logistics of the joint patrols took just days to finalize.

<HEADLINE> Group Sues Over U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN VALLES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A public interest group sued the Pebble
Beach Company and Monterey County on Friday, claiming proper
permits weren't obtained for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   The county, however, said permits are not necessary, and it was
not under an obligation to require them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no circumventing or deliberate omission of any
permitting,'' said County Supervisor David Potter, whose
jurisdiction includes Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Potter is also on the California Coastal Commission, which did
not require any permits, either, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Responsible Consumers of the Monterey Peninsula filed the
lawsuit in Monterey County Superior Court. It seeks to have holders
of future events the size of the U.S. Open obtain permits.
</P>
<P>
   David Dilworth, head of the group, maintains that county law
requires the tournament to obtain a county use permit, a coastal
development permit and environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   The RCMP, which sued successfully last year to stop a 2000-acre
development in Carmel Valley because of a lack of available water,
maintains that permits are needed because the U.S. Open attracts
throngs of people, creating traffic and noise problems.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 tickets were sold for this year's event.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Send Series Back to L.A.  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Thanks to Jalen Rose, Reggie Miller and some
incredible shooting, the Indiana Pacers extended Larry Bird's
coaching career at least one more game.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, who took Indiana to the Eastern Conference finals twice
and then to the championship series for the first time in franchise
history, said all along he would not coach another season. A loss
Friday night would have ended his coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   But with 32 points from Rose and 25 from Miller, the Pacers
routed the Los Angeles Lakers 120-87 to pull within 3-2 in the
best-of-seven series. Game 6 is Monday in Los Angeles. A seventh
game, if necessary, would also be in L.A. on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''After the last game, I talked about not letting them celebrate
on our court,'' Rose said. ''I was serious about that. This is the
first time the Pacers have been to the NBA Finals. It can be old
hat to the Lakers, but for this to be happening in our town, we
didn't want the fans to leave feeling the season is a
disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't have worried.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, who blew a 10-point lead before losing 120-118 in
overtime in Game 4 Wednesday night, dominated Game 5 from the
start. This time, there was no collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't play well and we played extremely well,'' Bird
said. ''It's up to us to keep the pressure on and go out there and
win a game. But I still think they feel very good about themselves,
up 3-2 and two games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The game the other night, we fought so hard and play so well
but let it slip away. It was great to see the guys come back and
play so well tonight,'' Bird said. ''The only time we got in
trouble was when we missed assignments, didn't rotate. Overall, we
played as well as we can play. But they still have the upper hand,
and they know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led 64-45 at the half, 86-67 after three quarters and
took its biggest lead at 33 points, several times in the closing
minutes, long after Bird had replaced all the starters except Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very determined,'' Rose said. ''Obviously, you're
disappointed when you don't play the way you're capable of playing.
And anytime you're down 1-3 you have to come out and show your
game. You can't leave anything in the tank or your season's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose was 12-of-18 from the field, including 4-of-5 3-pointers,
and all four of his free throw attempts. Miller was 7-for-12,
including 4-of-6 3-pointers and all seven of his shots from the
foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to have scoring out of both of them,'' Bird said.
''Jalen's a playmaker and when he gets it going, they forget about
Reggie sometimes and he'll pop it from the side. Together, when
they get it going like tonight, they're fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who had 35 points, was the only consistent
scorer for the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize that's the key,'' Mark Jackson said. ''It's tough
to do because when you're doubling on Shaq you're giving up
something on somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we had to make a statement from the beginning that we're
not here to roll over. We look forward to going back to California,
because our objective is to win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Lakers rally came late in the third quarter, when they
cut the lead to 15.
</P>
<P>
   A basket and two free throws by Rose pushed the lead back to 19.
Then, after two baskets by O'Neal, Austin Croshere hit two free
throws on a flagrant foul by Rick Fox. The Pacers kept the ball,
and eight seconds later Kobe Bryant picked up his fifth foul and
Mark Jackson hit two free throws to give Indiana an 84-65 lead. Los
Angeles never came closer than 17 points after that.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers shot 57.4 percent for the game. Indiana also had 10
3-pointers, including four by Rose and three by Miller in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' only lead was after Glen Rice hit one of two free
throws at the start of the game to make it 1-0. Rice finished with
11 points.
</P>
<P>
   A basket by Miller, a rebound basket by Rik Smits and the first
3-pointer by Miller gave the Pacers a 7-1 lead before the first Los
Angeles basket, a 3-pointer by Ron Harper. Los Angeles tied the
game at 9. But two free throws by Smits and the first 3-pointer by
Rose started another big Indiana run, and the Lakers never
recovered.

<HEADLINE> Has Gore Reinvented Government?  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE CASS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven years after Al Gore smashed an ashtray
on TV and vowed to fix an inept government, there are fewer
bureaucratic rules, fewer workers to invoke them and a bit more
common sense. But the federal machinery still misfires.
</P>
<P>
   And there's criticism that the vice president is taking too much
credit for a ''reinvention'' that even he admits isn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   While most everyone can find some good in Gore's reinventing
government program, nicknamed REGO, in some instances government
waste and inefficiency have grown worse, an Associated Press review
of audits and investigations shows.
</P>
<P>
   NASA blames the loss of two Mars probes and other failures on
the departure of too many experienced engineers during downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Processing benefit claims for sick veterans takes longer now
than it did before the government installed modernized computers.
And the Pentagon is still paying excessive prices for some parts.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say REGO has focused on image instead of tackling the
most troubling, entrenched problems. Federal auditors also
challenge some of the touted benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Gore says REGO saved $137 billion. But the auditors who
scrutinized $30 billion of those savings said most couldn't be
substantiated, and the program took credit for reductions that
would have occurred anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush has made REGO an issue in the
presidential race. ''They haven't reinvented the government
bureaucracy -- they have simply reshuffled it,'' he charged last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore contends REGO has led to smaller government, big savings
and many improvements in the way government works. He acknowledges
not all of REGO's goals have been met, but says it was successful
in ''changing the culture of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, improvements big and small are making the bureaucracy
more responsive to citizens and less stifling to workers, like:
</P>
<P>
   --Letting federal workers buy office supplies at places like
Wal-Mart instead of requisitioning them through a ''procurement
specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   --Inviting citizens to use the Internet to buy stamps, look up
Census data or even apply for a patent.
</P>
<P>
   --Listing Medicare in phone books under ''M,'' where people look
for it, instead of buried beneath ''Health and Human Services.''
</P>
<P>
   While many changes sound obvious, they were new to federal
workers who weren't used to treating citizens as customers, the
vice president says.
</P>
<P>
   ''When our reinvention effort began ... these kinds of obvious,
common sense practices weren't in place and now, in many cases,
they are,'' Gore told AP. ''Common sense can be quite uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress, however, see spotty progress. Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Fred Thompson says REGO led
to modest improvements, ''but they're overshadowed by wildly
exaggerated claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and President Clinton often boast that the federal work
force is the smallest since the Kennedy administration, but it was
the end of the Cold War -- not the efficiency efforts of REGO -- that
prompted most of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   From its early days in 1993, when Gore promoted reinvention by
smashing a government-issue ashtray on David Letterman's ''Late
Show,'' the project struggled with competing promises: making
government work better while reducing staff and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing out thousands of pages of silly rules, like the ashtray
safety test Gore demonstrated, was just the start.
</P>
<P>
   REGO, which has its own office and staff, helped eliminate
377,000 civilian jobs, cutting the federal work force 17 percent
through buyouts and attrition. The remaining employees were urged
to devise ways to do their jobs better.
</P>
<P>
   But there's growing evidence the disorderly REGO downsizing left
some employees overburdened.
</P>
<P>
   NASA pared 6,500 federal jobs and 47,000 contract workers. But,
after losing two Mars probes and suffering other failures,
administrator Daniel S. Goldin admitted, ''We probably cut too
tight.'' NASA is now hiring 2,000 more workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department halved the work force that buys goods and
services. But, the dollar amount for purchases dipped only 3
percent and large contracts requiring more scrutiny actually
increased in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Despite eased procurement rules that boost speed, workers are
falling behind and failing to sufficiently oversee some contracts,
the Defense Department inspector general warned.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the Pentagon paid $76 for a 57-cent screw. Of
course, that sort of thing also happened before REGO, and the
Pentagon says that procurement reform is still saving billions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Veterans Benefits Administration, the payroll was cut by
nearly 20 percent. Needing greater efficiency, the agency's
''reinvention lab'' found a way to shrink claims processing from 26
steps to four.
</P>
<P>
   But the decreased oversight left the agency vulnerable to $1.2
million worth of employee fraud, an internal review found.
</P>
<P>
   So the VBA created a new office to look out for fraud and is
hiring again, adding 440 workers to reduce errors and speed up
claims, which actually have fallen further behind. The agency also
pledges smarter computer upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   There is widespread agreement within government that the
downsizing was poorly planned, allowing too many front-line workers
and experienced employees to take buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't just cut employees randomly and think you have a
better work force at the end of the day,'' Thompson, R-Tenn, said.
</P>
<P>
   REGO director Morley Winograd, who came after the job cuts,
concedes there was little control. ''Hindsight is always 20/20. I
think we would do it a little differently today,'' Winograd said.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions complain that work once done by federal employees
has been shifted to private contractors, without evidence of
savings.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can tell us how many contractors we have, how much they
cost and whether using them has saved any money,'' said Bobby
Harnage, president of the American Federation of Government
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Some minority workers complain that reinvention also weakened
rules that guard against racial bias in hiring and promotions. REGO
''had a devastating impact on federal government workers,
particularly racial minorities,'' said a report last year from
Blacks in Government. Winograd says those claims have not been
documented.
</P>
<P>
   To motivate the troops, Gore has given workers with good ideas
more than 1,200 ''Hammer Awards'' -- a framed hammer that symbolizes
progress from the days when the government paid $400 for a basic

</P>
<P>
   But in a poll last year, only about a third of federal employees
surveyed said their agency had made reinvention a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Winograd shrugs off most criticisms, saying REGO can't be
deterred by occasional missteps while pushing innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you try a new system and you make a mistake and people play
gotcha, you really discourage willingness to take that chance
again,'' he said. ''That's what we fight against all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kettl, a University of Wisconsin professor who studies
REGO, credits Gore with pushing a behind-the-times bureaucracy to
leap forward, while falling short of the program's sweeping goals.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins the White House is likely to keep modernizing, even
if under a different name. Bush has his own plan to cut spending
through ''leaner management'' and increased use of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no way this disappears,'' Kettl said. ''It's simply
guaranteed to be a long-term legacy.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Accidents Rise In Gas Pipes  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Accidents are increasing on the 2.2 million
miles of pipelines carrying natural gas and other hazardous
materials nationwide, as the federal government slacked off on
enforcing many safety regulations, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   An average of 22 people died annually from 1988 to 1998 when the
number of accidents was increasing 4 percent per year, according to
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In one dramatic case a year ago, a pipeline overseen by the
federal Office of Pipeline Safety burst in Bellingham, Wash., and
229,000 gallons of gasoline ignited into an enormous fireball that
raced more than a mile down a creek. Two 10-year-old boys and an
18-year-old fisherman were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found the OPS has not enforced 22 of 49 safety
regulations passed by Congress since 1988, including periodic
inspections of pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the federal government is imposing fewer fines
on the pipeline industry, relying instead on ''letters of concern''
as an enforcement tool. Fines accounted for 49 percent of OPS
enforcement actions in 1990, 4 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., who requested the GAO investigation,
said the report ''paints a picture of an agency that places
disturbing amounts of faith in the industry it is supposed to
regulate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The focus of our nation's pipeline safety program and its
regulator should be on preventing the loss of life, rather than on
the preventing the loss of a profit margin to industry,'' Dingell
wrote to Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, who oversees the
office. ''Unfortunately, OPS seems to lack this focus and,
consequently, the ability to regulate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kelley Coyner, who oversees OPS, said the office
agrees with the report's findings and is ''using its legislative
authority for regulating pipeline safety, testing and enforcement
to the maximum extent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''More than a year ago, the (Transportation) Department
identified the leading causes of pipeline failures,'' Coyner said.
''We are taking action to prevent each of these causes and we have
identified areas where OPS inspections can be improved.''
</P>
<P>
   Although major pipeline accidents -- those involving a fatality,
injury or more than $50,000 in property damage -- increased in
recent years, the report notes fatalities are relatively low
compared with other forms of transporting goods: Some 66 people die
each year from barge accidents, 590 from railroad accidents and
5,100 from truck accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, OPS has decreased its use of ''unit'' inspections of
individual pipeline segments and has begun inspecting companies'
entire pipeline operating systems at one time, reducing OPS'
reliance on state inspectors to help examine pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   That is cause for concern, the GAO said, because state officials
are more familiar with local pipelines and can aid in identifying
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., is promoting legislation calling for
regional advisory panels of people who live near the pipelines to
make recommendations to OPS.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the experience with the Office of Pipeline Safety
clearly indicates that we need citizen involvement,'' Inslee said.
''I'm convinced from reading the GAO report that it's helpful for
the regulators to hear from citizens, not only the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Bellingham gasoline fire that killed the two boys and the
fisherman, the Transportation Department is seeking a $3.05 million
fine against Olympic Pipeline Co. for failing to test and monitor
the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Inslee said he believes the agency is making improvements since
the Bellingham explosion, but it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy in itself that it took the tragedy in
Bellingham to bring these problems to light,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Proposes Talks on Families  </HEADLINE>
By SANG-HUN CHOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea proposed Saturday that Red
Cross officials from North and South Korea meet this month to
discuss the reunion of families who have lived separated for a half
century across the world's most heavily armed border.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was another tangible sign that the isolated
communist North may be eager to implement a series of agreements
struck by the leaders of the two Koreas during their historic
three-day summit, which ended Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For over a half century, the two Koreas have traded
saber-rattling rhetoric across the Demilitarized Zone, guarded by
nearly 2 million battle-ready troops. Occasional progress toward
rapprochement had often been reversed by armed skirmishes and other
tension-raising developments.
</P>
<P>
   In a telegram sent to its South Korean counterpart Saturday, the
North Korean Red Cross Society proposed that they meet at the
border village of Panmunjom this month to discuss reuniting
separated families and repatriating North Korean spies held in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   ''Red Cross Societies of both sides must actively contribute to
improving North-South relations by faithfully implementing the
summit agreements absolutely supported at home and abroad,'' it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have warmed since this week's summit, when South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il
signed agreements aimed at easing tensions, helping the
impoverished North rebuild its economy and eventually working
toward reunification.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to begin allowing reunions of families separated by
the 1950-53 Korean War, starting on a holiday both countries share
-- Aug. 15, the day Korea was freed from Japanese colonial rule at
the end of World War II in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   If such reunions take place, Kim Dae-jung promised to repatriate
an unspecified number of convicted North Korean spies still held in
South Korea after serving long prison-terms.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the summit deals, North and South Korea stopped
propaganda broadcasts across the DMZ. On Friday, North Korea
quickly returned a South Korean fishing boat that had drifted into
North Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
   But separated families remains the most emotional among a host
of thorny issues that have divided the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1.2 million war refugees from the North are living
in South Korea today. More than half are over the age of 60; more
than 200,000 are in their 70s. Most left behind relatives in the
North.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War ended without a peace treaty, and the border is
sealed, depriving separated families of letters, phone calls,
travel and other means to learn the whereabouts and fates of their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 55 years, there has been only one official meeting of
separated families. In 1985, after 14 years of negotiations, 50
North Koreans traveled to Seoul and 50 South Koreans went to
Pyongyang for a four-day visit. But efforts for further reunions
were scuttled amid rekindled military tensions.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean human rights groups say there are 88 convicted
northern spies in South Korea. Of those, 58 people with families in
North Korea want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Seoul sent former North Korean guerrilla Ri In Mo home
in a humanitarian gesture. North Korea treated him as a national
hero and used him for anti-South propaganda. Seoul has not
repatriated any northern spies since.
</P>
<P>
   The summit was the latest move by North Korea to end its
isolation. Desperate for food aid, the North has opened relations
with Italy and Australia and is trying to improve ties with
Washington, Tokyo and Manila.

<HEADLINE> UCLA Linebacker Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA football player Asi Faoa was arrested
Friday at his dormitory on a felony charge of mayhem, stemming from
brain injuries sustained by another student during a party.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa, 19, was held in lieu of $100,000 bail pending his
arraignment, scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During an April 30 block party near the campus, Faoa and Rodrigo
Dezubriria were dancing when Faoa's elbow struck the other
student's head, said Officer Eduardo Funes, a police spokesman. A
criminal complaint alleged that Dezubriria sustained severe brain
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 240-pound Faoa was a redshirt freshman linebacker
for the Bruins last year and did not play.
</P>
<P>
   He has been indefinitely suspended from the team because of the
charge, UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will investigate the situation before making any other
decision,'' Dalis said.

<HEADLINE> Syria Takes Steps for New Leader  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- The near certainty of Bashar Assad's
succession of his father, President Hafez Assad, gets a fresh boost
Saturday when Syria's ruling Baath party meets to elect him party
leader and declare his candidacy for president.
</P>
<P>
   The party conference is part of an official script laid out for
Bashar Assad, a political novice, to fill the vacuum left by the
death of his father after 30 years at the helm of this Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad had to cut short a career as an eye doctor when his
elder brother Basil, his father's first choice as successor, was
killed in a 1994 car accident. He has since been groomed for
succession by his father, whose health had been poor since the
1980s. The elder Assad died of a heart attack June 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the week since, Bashar Assad has been declared commander of
the armed forces and promoted from colonel to general. The
country's rubber-stamp parliament also lowered the minimum age for
a president from 40 to 34 -- Bashar Assad's age.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's sudden ascendancy came as a surprise to some,
given Syria's history of political bickering and bloody upheaval.
Analysts believe it was helped by his image as a ''consensus
candidate'' and by Syria's powerful propaganda machine, which has
long indoctrinated Syrians with the idea that it is in the nation's
interest for the highest office to remain in the Assad family.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is almost mystical and it (Bashar Assad's succession) seems
like part of the general wisdom and the perception of stability,''
said Rosemary Hollis, chief of the Middle East department at
London's Royal Institute of International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe that it will take months, perhaps a
year, before Bashar Assad effectively takes the reins of power and
becomes the country's sole strongman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a question of political experiences, and his are not so
deep,'' said Hassan Abu Taleb, a Syria expert at Cairo's Al-Ahram
Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ''He has enthusiasm and
he has impeccable manners, but you need more than that when you are
the No. 1 man.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Baath party conference, expected to last up to five days,
about 1,000 delegates are to elect a 90-person central committee,
which will choose a new 21-member national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad is a Baath party member -- one of an estimated 1.5
million -- but until now has not held any formal position in the
party, which was founded in the 1940s and has held power since
1963.
</P>
<P>
   The party already has announced an initial nomination of Bashar
Assad for president, and a formal nomination is expected to be
announced during the conference. This will pave the way for the
People's Assembly to endorse the nomination and set a date for a
nationwide referendum when it meets June 25. There have been
reports that parliament might meet earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A plebiscite, however, is not expected to be held before the
traditional 40-day mourning over President Assad's death ends
around July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's succession, however, appears to be a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of posters and banners declaring him the
nation's hope for the future are displayed across the country.
Coverage of his activity and his photographs fill the pages of the
country's three main newspapers -- all tightly controlled by the
state.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reggie Miller and Jalen Rose shot the
Indiana Pacers to a big lead in Game 5. Austin Croshere helped keep
that lead large in the second half with his offense and his
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere had 13 points -- all in the second half -- and nine
rebounds off the bench in Indiana's 120-87 victory on Friday night.
He took just three shots from the field, but he took the ball to
the basket so successfully that he ended up shooting 12 free
throws, making 11.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Croshere had stark words for the Lakers, who are
still one victory away from a championship -- but just two losses
away from a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted it more than them, simple as that,'' Croshere said.
''There was no way they were going to win tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did earlier in the series, Croshere dominated his matchup
with Robert Horry, driving past the Los Angeles forward and
rebounding over him at will in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   He also played with a swagger, finishing at least two plays with
meaningless dunks well after the whistle had blown. He also got in
the face of his nemesis in the series, Los Angeles guard Derek
Fisher, after a hard foul in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Croshere admitted he took special pleasure in humiliating Los
Angeles. He was a passionate Lakers fan growing up in Santa Monica,
but now he thinks the Pacers have what it takes to celebrate a
title in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''They had us on the mat, and they let us up tonight,'' Croshere
said. ''Our confidence is really going up. We have to realize we're
just two games from a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HE'S NOT AIR YET: In the wake of Kobe Bryant's breakout
performance in Game 4 of the NBA Finals, he was repeatedly compared
with Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's blend of skill, grace and impeccable timing definitely
bring Jordan to Phil Jackson's mind, but he isn't ready to equate
his 21-year-old superstar with the game's greatest player.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw Michael play maybe 115 playoff games. He probably had 90
games at the level (Bryant) had this one,'' the Los Angeles Lakers
coach said. ''Not to take anything away from Kobe, but we got used
to the way Michael played and the level he played at.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kobe is young. He's probably a better player at 21 than
Michael was at 21. He has a wonderful future, and we hope that he
can fill those mighty big shoes. The chances are, he (won't).''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Jordan won six championships during the 1990s with
the Chicago Bulls. They both left the team in 1998 after winning
the sixth title. When the Bulls won their first rings in 1991,
Bryant was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant's youth gives him the edge over Jordan in one category,
at least. Jordan was 28 when he won his first title.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Bryant) is a special player, but he's still going to be a
terrific player,'' Jackson said. ''He's got a lot of years to
develop into that role.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's sentiments were proven true in Game 5, as Bryant shot
4-for-20, scored eight points and generally looked horrible in Los
Angeles' blowout loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kobe is a young superstar, but the key to that is 'young,'''
Indiana's Jalen Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   SALLEY'S RINGS: John Salley doesn't often leave the Lakers'
bench these days, but the veteran big man is in position to make
basketball history.
</P>
<P>
   Salley, who left three years of retirement and a cushy
broadcasting job with NBC to serve as Shaquille O'Neal's backup
this season, can become the first NBA player to win titles with
three teams if the Lakers finish off the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   He was an original member of the Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys
squads that won championships in 1989 and 1990, and he also got a
ring as a backup on the Chicago Bulls' 1996 squad. Many players
have won titles in two cities, but Salley is the first to be in the
right place at three right times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It couldn't happen to a better person,'' Salley said with a
grin. ''I couldn't find anybody else I would want this to happen
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Salley played in 45 games during the regular season, and after
playing sparingly in the Western Conference playoffs, he saw a
grand total of nine minutes of action in the finals' first four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Though Salley often plays only in emergencies -- like a few
seconds of overtime in Game 4 after Shaquille O'Neal fouled out,
for instance -- he makes contributions to the Lakers in the locker
room and on the practice court.
</P>
<P>
   As befitting his media experience, he is also the Lakers' most
acerbic, quotable player. Perhaps no seldom-used backup center in
finals history has done as many interviews as Salley has during the
past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just enjoy every day,'' Salley said. ''I'm just glad to be
out here and be a part of these guys. I'm glad Phil wanted me here.
It sure beats the hell out of being in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LOOSE BALLS: Indiana appears to have acquired a celebrity fan
of its own. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson slapped high-fives
with the Pacers players in the locker room after the game. He also
chatted with Pacers guard Mark Jackson. ... For the second straight
game day, torrential rains pounded Indianapolis. Downtown streets
flooded and pregame pep rallies around Conseco Fieldhouse got
soaked. ... Indiana coach Larry Bird said Friday that he thought
his team got better and better in each of the series' four games.
... Game 4, won 120-118 by the Lakers in overtime, was the
highest-scoring playoff game since Houston's 125-120 victory over
Minnesota on April 29, 1997. ... Four techincal fouls were called
within 32 seconds of each other in the fourth quarter. Lakers
forward Rick Fox continued to play the role of hockey enforcer,
shoving Reggie Miller and backing down Mark Jackson moments later.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ''No, no. We're down 3-1. You want to get
the hell out of here after you win.'' --Bird, when asked if he would
consider returning to coaching next season under any circumstances,
such as a Pacers victory in the series.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Plan Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators say the Clinton
administration's national missile defense plan is based on
uncertain assessments of potential threats and could face rising
costs and delays, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a report circulated in Congress that hasn't been made public,
the General Accounting Office concluded that because of limitations
on the Pentagon's ability to test all of the missile shields'
components, it would hard to know whether the system would work
during an attack, the newspaper said in Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Analyzing the findings of studies conducted by the Pentagon and
government agencies, the investigators said the technological
uncertainties of the system greatly increase the prospects for
delays, with each month of delay increasing costs by $124 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report by GAO, Congress' investigative arm, also said the
intelligence community is uncertain about what countermeasures a
''rogue nations'' like North Korea or Iran would employ in
attempting to defeat a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon wants to have 100 interceptor missiles based in
Alaska by 2007, with the first 20 ready to fire by 2005. President
Clinton is to decide this fall on whether to go forward with
construction of the system.

<HEADLINE> NorCal Cools Off After Heat Wave  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cooling fog rolled back into Northern
California Friday after an unusual midweek heat wave sent scores of
people to the hospital and was partly blamed in at least one death.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were investigating whether eight other deaths were
due to the heat since temperatures shot past 100 Wednesday. Many of
the dead were old or frail, making it hard to determine if heat was
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In the one confirmed heat-related death, a 73-year-old man, Cam
Bo Tu, collapsed while out walking Wednesday in Alameda County,
east of San Francisco. A heart attack was the primary cause of
death, but exposure was also listed as a factor, a coroner's
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, temperatures usually hover in the 60s. When
the mercury hit 103, there was no doubt the unusual heat created
widespread distress, particularly among the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of the counties that we talked to reported that there were
significant increases in emergency ambulance traffic,'' said Art
Lathrop, director of emergency medical services for Contra Costa
County.
</P>
<P>
   The heat buckled the pavement on the freeway linking San
Francisco and Sacramento and also caused power outages and
so-called ''rotating brownouts'' that left 97,000 customers in the
dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really having what I would call a heat storm,'' Pacific
Gas &AMP; Electric spokesman Tom Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   At a San Francisco Giants game Wednesday, 34 people were treated
for heat exhaustion and one person was hospitalized for heat stroke
with a body temperatures of 106 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, temperatures tumbled back to normal, the high in
San Francisco at noon was 61 degrees, 42 degrees lower than the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Lathrop said his office will be tuning up contingency plans
should severe weather break out again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not even summer yet,'' he said. ''It's spring.''

<HEADLINE> NY's Abe Hirschfeld Convicted  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer and
frequent political candidate, was convicted Friday in his second
trial on charges of trying to hire a hitman to kill his business
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, 80, was found guilty of second-degree criminal
solicitation for offering to pay $150,000 to have Stanley Stahl,
his real estate partner of 40 years, killed in 1997 because of a
business dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The judge allowed Hirschfeld, whose first trial ended in a
deadlocked jury, to remain free on $1 million bail. He faces up to
seven years in prison when he is sentenced Aug. 1.

   Hirschfeld, a former New York Post owner who is running for the
Senate, did not comment as he left the courthouse. He still faces a
second trial on state and city tax evasion charges July 31. His
first trial in the tax case also ended in a deadlocked jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Gilda Mariani said Hirschfeld in
fall 1996 gave Joseph Veltri, one of his building contractors,
$75,000 as a downpayment to a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Veltri testified that he delivered the money, but called police
when a second envelope Hirschfeld gave him contained information
about Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was told of the alleged plot and was not harmed, but he
did start riding in a bulletproof car and wearing a bulletproof
coat. He died of natural causes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld just recently was released from a 90-day jail stay
for contempt of court. The judge ordered him jailed because he
violated a court ban on discussing the trial with the media.
</P>
<P>
   He also is being sued by Paula Jones, whom Hirschfeld offered $1
million to drop her sexual harassment lawsuit against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jones settled that lawsuit for $850,000 in November 1998, in
part to accept Hirschfeld's offer, she said. Hirschfeld then tried
to back out of the offer, alleges her lawsuit, which was filed in
Dallas on Feb. 15.

Los Alamos Hard Drives Investigated
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators are closely examining two computer
hard drives containing nuclear secrets that were found at the Los Alamos weapons
laboratory, believing they are the ones missing for more than a month. They want
to determine whether the information has been compromised. Authorities hoped to
know by late Friday whether the two drives definitely are the same ones that
disappeared and, after an electronic examination, learn whether the contents
have been copied or otherwise tampered with, said one official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.

Lebanon Rejects UN Israel Withdrawal Claim
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a setback for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
Lebanon on Friday rejected the United Nations' verification of Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon, saying Israel still controls some Lebanese
territory. Annan had said earlier Friday at U.N. headquarters that the United
Nations has confirmed the Israeli withdrawal is complete. That announcement is
supposed to clear the way for U.N. troops to move into the border area and help
Lebanese forces restore peace and regain authority in the region.

Texas A&AMP;M Suspends Bonfire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Texas A&AMP;M University is suspending its
traditional pre-game bonfire for at least two more years to give officials time
to improve procedures following an accident last year that killed 12 students.
When the tradition does resume, in 2002 at the earliest, the bonfire will be far
smaller and the construction will be much more professionally run, Texas A&AMP;M
President Ray Bowen said Friday at a news conference. The change resulted from
the collapse during construction of the 2 million-pound log stack Nov. 18.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a bid to reinvigorate Congo's frayed peace process,
the Security Council demanded Friday that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their
forces from Congo immediately and threatened to consider possible sanctions if
they don't. In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council also said Rwanda
and Uganda should pay for the damage and deaths they inflicted on the northern
Congolese city of Kisangani, where they fought pitched battles earlier this
month, killing an estimated 300 people.

Calif. Votes For Cleaner Vehicles
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- Southern California's air-quality agency voted
Friday to require nearly 11,000 transit buses and garbage trucks to convert to
cleaner-burning alternative fuels, setting what environmentalists hope will be
an example for the rest of the country. The rules are believed to be the first
of their kind in the nation. The rules, approved unanimously by the South Coast
Air Quality Management District, require that all new vehicles bought by transit
agencies and trash companies run on natural gas, methanol, electricity or fuel
cells.

Warmest Spring on Record for U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spring 2000 was the hottest on record for the United
States. The National Climatic Data Center reported Friday that meteorological
spring -- March through May -- averaged 55.5 degrees Fahrenheit over the United
States. That's 0.4 degrees warmer than the previous record, set in 1910.
Climatologist Jay Lawrimore of the data center said he is reluctant to blame
global warming directly for the unusual heat in the United States.

Pacers Defeat Lakers 120-87
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Led by Jalen Rose, the Indiana Pacers put on a fantastic
shooting display that kept the Lakers' championship plans on hold. Starting
6-for-6 on 3-pointers and shooting 75 percent in the first quarter, Indiana
manhandled Los Angeles 120-87 Friday night in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. A
four-point play by Miller turned a five-point lead into a nine-point lead just
seven minutes in, and three 3-pointers by Rose helped the Pacers score 39 points
in the first quarter -- their best of the postseason.

U.S. Open, Tiger Woods breezing along on a brutally tough day. Nicklaus bid an
emotional and unforgettable farewell to 44 years in the toughest championship in
golf, reaching the 545-yard 18th hole in two shots. Woods rolled in a 30-foot
putt on the par-3 12th, his fifth birdie of the day on rock-hard greens, to get
to 9 under for the tournament and build a three-shot lead over Miguel Angel
Jimenez.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Friday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Indians-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: OF Manny Ramirez was scheduled to begin a rehab
assignment Friday at Double-A Akron. The Indians hope Ramirez, on
the DL since May 29 with a strained left hamstring, can rejoin them
by the middle of next week. ... 3B Travis Fryman said he still
believes the Chicago White Sox think the Indians are the team to
beat in the AL Central. ''The more they play well against us,
though, the more its going to go towards easing that thought from
their minds,'' Fryman said.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers are 13-7 in games where 3B Dean Palmer has
at least one RBI. ... Juan Encarnacion hit just .130 (6-for-46) in
his first 12 games after missing 10 games due to injury and a
suspension. ... Friday's game was the first of several planned for
radio cast to OF Juan Gonzalez's native Puerto Rico. Gonzalez's
friend and Tigers Latin America liaison Luis Mayoral handled the
play-by-play.
White Sox-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox entered the day with a 5&AMP;frac12;-game lead over
Cleveland. At this point last season, the White Sox trailed the
Indians by 12 games. ... Chicago's eight-game road winning streak
is the team's longest since winning eight straight July 11-Aug. 1,
1993. ... Starter James Baldwin was 17-3 with a 3.06 ERA since Aug.
1.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: 2B Chuck Knoblauch was back in the lineup, leading off
and playing second base one night after being sent home in the
sixth inning. Knoblauch made a career-high three errors on
Thursday. ... Chris Turner started at catcher, while Jorge Posada
played designated hitter. Manager Joe Torre wanted to try Turner
with struggling David Cone, who had one win in his first 12 starts.
Turner caught Cone on May 20 in Cleveland when Cone allowed two
runs in 6 1-3 innings and got a no-decision. ... Rookie Jake
Westbrook will be called up from Triple-A Columbus to start
Saturday. ''He seems polished. He has basic stuff and is very
mature,'' Torre said.
Blue Jays-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays got some luck in the first inning when
RHP Kelvim Escobar struggled. With runners on first and second and
five runs already in, Scott Hatteberg popped out to Raul Mondesi in
right field for the second out. Troy O'Leary tagged from second and
the throw got by 3B Tony Batista, who then kicked it into the Blue
Jays dugout, allowing O'Leary to score and Wilton Veras to advance
to third. But Toronto appealed, and the umpires ruled O'Leary left
second too early. That erased a run, an error, and ended the
inning. ... Mondesi's first-inning home run on Friday night helped
Toronto set a club record with homers in 15 consecutive games. It
was Mondesi's 13th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Jeff Frye has hit safely in 10 consecutive games, and 22
of the last 23. ... Brian Daubach had just nine hits in his last 56
at-bats before homering in the first inning. ... The back-to-back
homers by Carl Everett and Daubach were Boston's fifth consecutive
homers of the year.
Rangers-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Thursday night's game at Baltimore didn't end until
nearly 1 a.m. after a rain delay of 2 hours, 7 minutes. The team
didn't arrive at its hotel in St. Petersburg, Fla., until 5:30 a.m.
... RHP Jared Camp was claimed off waivers from Cleveland and
optioned to Double-A Tulsa. OF Ruben Mateo (broken leg) was moved
from the 15-day to the 60-day DL to make room on the roster. ...
LHP Matt Perisho (1-0) was scheduled to make his first start of the
season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: RHP Juan Guzman was moved to the 60-day DL after a
setback in a minor league rehab start for Triple-A Durham. He left
Thursday night's outing with shoulder stiffness after throwing 45
pitches in 3 2-3 innings. ... LF Greg Vaughn sat out his second
straight game since aggravating a right hamstring injury. CF Gerald
Williams also remained out of the starting lineup with a left hip
flexor strain. ... First-round draft pick Rocco Baldelli, a high
school outfielder from Cumberland, R.I., and fifth-round selection
Jace Brewer, a shortstop from Baylor, agreed to contracts.
Angels-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: The Angels had 44 steals in their first 65 games. They
didn't get 44 last year until their 114th game. ... RHP Tim Belcher
will make his first start and appearance of the season on Saturday.
He's returning from offseason surgery on his right arm. ... Rookie
C Bengie Molina made his 50th start of the season. He had 24 RBIs
in his previous 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: The Orioles planned to active RHP Calvin Maduro
(elbow injury) off the DL Friday but decided to give him one more
rehabilitation assignment. He will pitch for Class A Frederick on
Saturday. ... LHP Chuck McElroy has allowed only one earned run in
his last 11 2-3 innings. After pitching two innings both Wednesday
and Thursday, he was to be given the night off Friday. ...
Washington Capitals Olie Kolzig, winner of the coveted Vezina
Trophy as the NHL's top goaltender, will throw out the ceremonial
first pitch Saturday night before the Orioles host Anaheim.
Athletics-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Former-Royal Kevin Appier was scheduled to make his
first start against his former team on Saturday. Appier is the
Royals' career leader in strikeouts (1,451) and ranks fourth in
wins (114), starts (269) and innings pitched (1,821). He was traded
to the A's for Jeff D'Amico, Brad Rigby and Blake Stein last July
31. ... The A's entered the three-game series with an 8-1-2 record
in road series this season. They won just seven series all of 1999.
... The A's began the game with the best road record in the major
leagues (21-12). The Royals tied for the best home record in the
American League (20-10).
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals will see six former teammates on the
A's: Sal Fasano, Jeremy Giambi, Kevin Appier, Mike Magnante, Rich
Sauveur and Scott Service have played for the Royals. Five Royals
(Jeff D'Amico, Brett Laxton, Dave McCarty, Blake Stein--DL and Jay
Witasick) are former A's. ... 2B Carlos Febles will head to
extended spring training Sunday to begin his rehabilitation for a
strained left shoulder. Febles has been on the 15-day DL since June
5. ... LHP Jose Rosado returned home Friday after going to
California to get a second opinion on his ailing left shoulder. He
has been on the DL since May 1 with tendinitis in his left
shoulder.
Mariners-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners' 35-28 start was their best ever through
63 games. Their previous best was 34-29 in 1997, '96 and '91. ...
Rob Ramsey's first major league victory on Thursday night marked
the first time in 24 games that a Mariners reliever got the win.
Since May 19, when Jose Mesa picked up the win against Tampa Bay,
Seattle starters had been 12-4 and the bullpen had been 0-7.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins signed their top pick, RHP Adam Johnson,
the second overall pick in the draft earlier this month. Johnson
didn't work out for the Twins because the club feared the
aggressive pitcher from Cal State Fullerton might hurt himself
trying to impress them. Instead, he'll report to rookie ball in
Fort Myers, Fla. Johnson, 20, set a school record with 365
strikeouts in three seasons. ... The Twins decided to boost their
number of giveaway bobblehead Tony Oliva and Kirby Puckett dolls
later this summer from 5,000 to 10,000. Some fans were upset when
they waited in line for five hours for a Harmon Killebrew doll but
came away empty-handed.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Reliever Ugueth Urbina, who has been on the DL since
May 9 because of inflammation in his right elbow, joined the team
Friday and will throw on the side Sunday. He has been rehabbing in
Jupiter, Fla. ... Vladimir Guerrero is ahead of last year's home
run pace. He hit his 20th home run Friday. Last season, he did not
hit his 20th until July 21. The Expos are 13-4 when he homers. ...
White has hit safely in 16 of 19 games, and is batting .329
(25-for-76) in that stretch with six doubles and three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: Luis Montanez, the Cubs' first round pick in the June
draft, was in Chicago Friday to meet the team and will take batting
practice this weekend. Montanez, 18, was an all-state selection at
shortstop out of Coral Park High School in Miami. ... Kerry Wood
received a ''Big Mouth Billy Bass'' for his 23rd birthday. The fish
plaque sings ''Don't Worry Be Happy'' and ''Take Me to the River.''
... SS Jose Nieves, who is on an injury rehab assignment as he
recovers from a strained hamstring, joined Class AA West Tenn
Friday.
Marlins-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Jim Leyland, who previously managed both clubs,
attended Friday night's Marlins-Pirates game. Leyland lives in
Pittsburgh and scouts for St. Louis. ... The Marlins are playing
their second series in Pittsburgh in less than three weeks, but
don't play the Pirates again this season after this weekend. ...
RHP Josh Beckett and C Ramon Castro will represent the Marlins in
the Future All-Star game July 9 in Atlanta. It is the second
successive season the Marlins have had two prospects chosen.
Pitchers Brad Penny and Jason Grilli were picked last season. ...
Luis Castillo stole his 27th base of the season in the second
inning Friday night, leaving him three short of breaking the
Marlins' record (Chuck Carr, 115 steals).
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pirates pitching prospect Sam McConnell is 7-1 at
Double-A Altoona with a 1.17 ERA that is the lowest among starting
pitchers in organized baseball. The 25-year-old left-hander
finished 1-7 at Altoona last season after going a combined 15-8 in
parts of two seasons at Single-A Lynchburg. ... Todd Ritchie, who
pitches Saturday, is 2-0 with a 2.08 ERA in two career starts
against Florida. ... Jose Silva, who leads all active Pirates
pitchers with 32 appearances, makes his first start of the season
Monday in Montreal. ... With Pirates pinch-hitters slumping, with
five hits in their last 41 at-bats through Thursday, manager Gene
Lamont probably won't give John Vander Wal as many spot starts as
before. Vander Wal, who is tied for seventh all-time with 114 pinch
hits, is 6-for-13 with two homers and nine RBIs as a pinch-hitter.
... The Pirates finished 2-5 against the Braves after going 3-4
against them last season.
Braves-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Andres Galarraga started against Curt Schilling despite
bringing a lifetime average of .100 (4-for-40) against him. ...
Terry Mulholland, who starts Saturday, is 34-25 lifetime at
Veterans Stadium. He had two stints playing with the Phillies. ...
Reggie Sanders started his first game Friday since going on the DL
May 6.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: While the Phillies took batting practice, the 1980
World Series championship team was honored with a parade through
downtown Philadelphia on Friday night. ... The Phillies hired Dan
Roberts, son of Hall of Famer Robin Roberts, to be a coach for
Single-A Batavia. ... Bobby Abreu was not in the starting lineup
Friday because he is 2-for-24 against Tom Glavine.
Mets-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets are tied with the Reds for the NL lead in
one-run victories with 13. ... LHP Mike Hampton (groin) will have
his next start pushed back two days, pitching Tuesday at home
against the Phillies. Rick Reed was scheduled to start Sunday in
the finale of the three-game series in Milwaukee. ... The Mets have
dominated the Brewers, going 16-3 since Milwaukee joined the NL in
1998. New York started the weekend series with eight straight wins
over the Brewers, not losing to Milwaukee since May 18, 1999. ...
Through 63 games this year, the Mets are 35-28. Last year they were
33-30.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers designated seldom-used IF Sean Berry for
assignment, hoping to trade the seven-year veteran as soon as
possible. The Brewers have seven days to trade, release or send
Berry outright to the minors. But Berry, batting .152 (7-for-46),
will not be sent to the minors. ''Sean had no interest in doing
that, nor do we,'' GM Dean Taylor said. ... OF Lyle Mouton was
activated to fill Berry's spot on the roster. ... The Brewers
entered the weekend series with only one victory in nine home games
against the Mets.
Cardinals-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Mark McGwire had 23 home runs in the Cardinals' first
65 games, helping them build a 37-28 record and a 4&AMP;frac12;-game lead in
the NL Central. After 65 games in McGwire's record-breaking
70-homer season of 1998, he had 31 home runs -- but the Cardinals
were nine games out of first place with a 31-34 record. Last year,
McGwire had 19 homers through the team's first 65 games, and the
Cardinals were 6 1-2 games off the pace with a 32-33 mark. ... If
the Cardinals hang on to their lead and win the NL Central, La
Russa will join Sparky Anderson (Cincinnati and Detroit) and Whitey
Herzog (Kansas City and St. Louis) as the only managers to win at
least two division titles with two different organizations. La
Russa guided Oakland to four AL West crowns during a five-year
span. An asterisk on that list belongs to Davey Johnson, who
managed the Mets to a pair of NL East titles, and Cincinnati to the
best record in the NL Central during the strike-interrupted 1994
season.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers optioned newly acquired RHP Al Reyes to
Triple-A Albuquerque and recalled C Adam Melhuse from the Dukes.
''I don't necessarily like to bring a guy in and not even give him
the opportunity to pitch here, but I have no choice,'' Johnson
said. ''I don't need 12 pitchers. Eleven is enough. I don't have
enough innings to keep the whole bullpen sharp because they're not
overworked. And very I'm probably going to need more flexibility
with the catching situation because the rulings on the suspensions
(of Chad Kreuter and the injured Todd Hundley) are coming up (next
week during the series in Houston). That's why I need 14 position
players.''
Diamondbacks-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: 1B Erubiel Durazo took batting practice in Tucson,
Ariz., on Friday for the first time since going on the disabled
list with torn cartilage in his right wrist. The Diamondbacks hope
Durazo can start working out with the team Monday when they return
to Phoenix. ... OF Steve Finley is 0-for-17 in his last five games
and has not driven in a run or homered since June 4. Manager Buck
Showalter is not concerned. ''You couldn't tell if he is 17-for-17
or 0-for-17. He will go down hacking with all guns blazing every
game. No one is going to be in a groove for 162 games. It doesn't
happen.'' ... The Diamondbacks are 4-13 in their last 17 road
games.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies, long known for their power rather than
their speed, is second in the NL with 62 stolen bases. Colorado had
70 steals all of last season, but OF Tom Goodwin could match that
by himself. Goodwin reached 30 steals faster than any player in
Rockies history and is on pace for 78, which would shatter Eric
Young's team record of 53 in 1996. ... Manager Buddy Bell will
alter his starting rotation slightly because of Friday night's
rainout. LHP Brian Bohanon and RHP Masato Yoshii were pushed back a
day, but RHP Pedro Astacio will stay in his scheduled spot Tuesday
at Cincinnati. Sunday's originally scheduled starter, RHP Rolando
Arrojo, will go Wednesday. ... OF Larry Walker wore a Phoenix Suns
jersey under his jacket in batting practice. The jersey had
Walker's favorite No. 33, which was the same number worn by Suns
great Alvin Adams. ''Who's Alvin Adams?'' Walker said.
Reds-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: 3B Aaron Boone started Friday night at San Diego for
the first time since he sustained a broken nose when he was hit by
a pitch by Russ Ortiz on Tuesday at San Francisco. ... Aaron Boone
watched older brother Bret's three-run homer sail to left-center
field in the first inning, giving San Diego a 5-1 lead. ... The
Boones' father, Bob, is a special assistant to Reds general manager
Jim Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The Padres' second-round draft pick, 1B Xavier Nady
of the University of California, visited the Padres on Friday and
took batting practice and grounders. The Padres think it'll be
tough to sign Nady because he had been projected to go in the top
half of the first round but slid down to the second round. Also,
he's represented by Scott Boras, known as a tough negotiator. ''I
would doubt very much that this kid would take second-round money,
but I don't know.'' ... The Padres remain less than $250,000 apart
in talks with their first-round pick, high school LHP Mark Phillips
of Hanover, Pa. When talks started, Phillips requested a $2.5
million signing bonus and the Padres countered with a $2 million
offer. ... RHP Woody Williams, who had an aneurysm in his right
armpit surgically repaired on May 4, threw 60 pitches in a
simulated game and said he felt good. ''Tomorrow is the key, and if
it feels good, it's a positive,'' Williams said. He anticipates
making two rehab starts and hopes to be back in time to start at
Texas on either July 8 or 9, right before the All-Star break.
Astros-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: 3B Chris Truby made his major league debut on Friday,
replacing 3B Ken Caminiti, who was placed on the 15-day disabled
list due to a ruptured tendon sheath in his right wrist. ... LHP
Billy Wagner has eight blown saves in his first 14 opportunities.
He blew a total of three save opportunities during the 1999 season.
''I don't think anybody's giving up on Billy,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ''Obviously we're concerned because he's a much
better pitcher than this. It might be different if he was somebody
that wasn't proven, but Billy is, so he's going to get every chance
to work out of this.'' ... RHP Jose Lima is 1-4 with a 7.19 ERA in
seven road games.
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Kirk Rueter's wife, Karla, gave birth to Hope
Elaine (8 pounds, 4 ounces, 20&AMP;frac12; inches) on Wednesday. ''It was a
long day, but a perfect day,'' said Rueter. ''The nurses say she
looks like Karla and I hope she's going to take after her.'' It is
the Rueter's first child. ... Dusty Baker celebrated his 51st
birthday on Thursday with a rare day off. ''Usually I'm playing on
my birthday,'' said Baker. ''And like you guys (the media) say,
usually losing. I skipped it this year. Maybe that's a good omen. I
feel recharged.'' The Giants are 1-6 on Baker's birthdays. ... RHP
Livan Hernandez has a 2.83 home ERA.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 120, Lakers 87  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- On the night they could have been crowned
champions, the Los Angeles Lakers had their most lopsided loss of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn of a new dynasty? Hah!
</P>
<P>
   Not in Indiana's house. Not when the Pacers were shooting like
they were in their own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Jalen Rose, the Pacers took control early and never let
up, keeping the Lakers' championship plans on hold. Starting
6-for-6 on 3-pointers and making 75 percent of their shots in the
first quarter, Indiana manhandled Los Angeles 120-87 Friday night
in Game 5 of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   This was the night when the coaching career of Larry Bird could
have come to an end, the night when the Lakers finished off their
coronation. But just a few minutes in, it was immediately clear
that there would be no finality coming out of these finals just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were simply not ready to quit, not even close.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a team that plays better when our backs are against the
wall, and 3-1 was a big wall,'' said Rose, who went 12-for-18 and
scored 32 points. ''We just need to take it one game at a time and
see if we can get this thing done.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana ran its offense to perfection, creating open shots that
almost never missed. The outburst hit the Lakers like a sucker
punch to the gut, knocking the wind, energy and smarts out them
before they knew what hit them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain,''
said Reggie Miller, who scored 25 points. ''We just need to let it
all hang out. We've got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A four-point play by Miller turned a five-point lead into a
nine-point lead just seven minutes in, and three 3-pointers by Rose
helped the Pacers score 39 points in the first quarter -- their best
of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was 19 at halftime, shrunk to 13 in the third and then
grew to 25 early in the fourth as Miller stood at the line and sank
four straight foul shots -- three for being fouled on a 3-pointer
and one for a technical foul on Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which shot 57 percent from the field, led by as many as
33.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was only a matter of running out the clock and
getting ready for the series to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana trails 3-2 in the best-of-seven series. Game 6 will be
Monday night at Los Angeles and Game 7, if necessary, will be
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to make a statement from the beginning that we were not
going to roll over. We wanted to go back to California,'' Indiana
guard Mark Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Pacers forward Austin Croshere said his team was ''going to
leave everything on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was going to be our last game we were going to give it
everything we had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal led Los Angeles with 35 points and 11 rebounds,
but no one else did much of anything positive. Worst of the bunch
was Kobe Bryant, who followed up his Game 4 theatrics and a day of
Michael Jordan comparisons with an abysmal 4-for-20 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of looking for his shots within the offense and letting
O'Neal carry the load, Bryant too often tried to freelance and take
over the game by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kobe was game for it, but he just didn't find the rhythm out
there to play with,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had lauded Bryant before the game, saying he's
''probably a better player at 21 than Michael was at 21.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant was a model of immaturity this time, and the result
was an array of off-balance clankers, twisting misses and puzzled
looks from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the finals, but
the Pacers look to be a strong candidate to be the first.
</P>
<P>
   They still need to win two straight in Los Angeles -- making it
three straight overall -- against a team that hasn't lost more than
two in a row all season. But if they can shoot as well as they did
Friday and take the Lakers out of their game plan early, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew this was going to be a difficult game,'' coach Jackson
said. ''We shot 45 percent in the first half, they shot 61. Their
shooting really had us in a quandary, and in the second half they
beat us on the boards and got to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in the driver's seat; we're not in a situation
where we need to panic. We need to play with more energy and in
control. We need precision and execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Jackson said he found it a ''mystery'' as to
how to keep his team from being overconfident.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a natural excitement that you can feel about this
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of hours later, that mood had turned to
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers wanted to get off to a fast start to avoid having to
play from behind, and they couldn't have started much better.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 15-for-20 in the first quarter, Indiana led 39-28 after
12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Rose scored 11 apiece, although the Lakers shot 52
percent themselves to stay within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal took a two-minute rest early in the second, and Indiana
seized upon his absence to begin a 7-2 run ending with a 3-pointer
by Rose for a 46-32 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best hit back-to-back jumpers and Rose reached 22 points
on a fastbreak dunk and a reverse layup for a 54-35 lead, which
Rose followed with a nifty defensive play as he swiped the ball out
of Ron Harper's hands on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand we have what it takes to beat L.A., but it does
nothing to talk about it,'' Rose said. ''I was going to shut up and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's lead reached 20 late in the quarter, and it was 64-45
at the half as Rose had 22 and Miller 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers went up by 21 early in the third before the Lakers
made their run, pulling within 13 on a driving layup by A.C. Green.
That, however, would be as close as they would get.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant picked up his fourth foul in the middle of an ensuing
10-4 run by Indiana, then picked up his fifth with 1:44 left in the
quarter. Mark Jackson hit both foul shots for an 84-65 lead, and
Indiana's advantage stayed at 19 heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a great win,'' Rose said. ''Had they beaten us by 33,
we would have been written off. So we'll see what happens. They're
still in control, we're still the team that has fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know California will be ready to celebrate. We heard about
the parade, but it won't be tomorrow.''
Notes: Best, who was questionable with a bruised shoulder, showed
no ill effects as he played 10 minutes and scored 5 points and
added three assists. ... O'Neal shot 1-for-6 at the free throw
line, lowering his accuracy rate in this series to 41 percent. ...
Chris Mullin and Zan Tabak of Indiana and Devean George and John
Salley of the Lakers scored their first points of the series during
extensive garbage time. ... The Lakers previous worst loss was by
29 in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against Portland.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Russian Tycoon Released  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- After four days in prison and an outcry accusing
the Kremlin of cracking down on the press, media baron Vladimir
Gusinsky was freed, smiling and thanking the press for their
intense coverage of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of swindling and theft are still pending against the
47-year-old tycoon, one of Russia's most prominent businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the prosecutor-general's office said Gusinsky
was released after promising not to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you to all who supported me,'' Gusinsky said on his NTV
television station an hour after his release. ''Foremost of all, to
journalists and all my colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The case had dogged President Vladimir Putin during a trip to
Spain and Germany, with journalists firing questions about Gusinsky
at every opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   After days of saying he knew little about the matter, Putin said
Thursday that he believed arresting Gusinsky had been an excessive
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was in Moldova as Gusinsky was released and made no public
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, he had insisted that the arrest Tuesday of Gusinsky,
the head of the Media-Most holding company that includes some of
Russia's most respected broadcast and print media, had nothing to
do with press issues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Gusinsky seemed likely to remain in Moscow's
overcrowded Butyrskaya prison through the weekend. He met with
investigators during the day and his lawyers announced that formal
charges had been filed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gist of the charges is that Media-Most itself was created
exclusively with the goal of inflicting damage on the state,'' said
Gusinsky lawyer Genri Reznik.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said Gusinsky is suspected of taking part in
the theft of $10 million in state funds in a privatization deal. He
is one of the powerful Russian businessmen widely called
''oligarchs'' whose tough dealmaking have propelled them to the top
-- and often raised questions about their business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Top editors of Gusinsky's media said Kremlin officials had made
informal threats for months before Gusinsky's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Kremlin's press service declined to comment
on the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most's news organizations have offered critical coverage
of the war in Chechnya and alleged Kremlin corruption and intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   But the investigator in charge of the case, Valery Nikolayev,
told Russian state television that there were no political motives
and that it was ''a common criminal case.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that the prosecutors should necessarily have
used such a measure as arrest,'' Putin said Friday at a Berlin news
conference. ''But I don't have reason to believe that they broke
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted the contention of Gusinsky's lawyers that their
client was eligible for release under an amnesty for holders of
state medals. Gusinsky has an Order of the Friendship of Peoples.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency cited the prosecutor-general's office
as saying the decision to release Gusinsky took the medal into
account. But the office spokesman declined to comment on that to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A group of prominent American CEOs, led by a former ambassador
to Moscow, Robert Strauss, announced Thursday that because of
Gusinsky's arrest, it would postpone its trip to Russia, which had
been scheduled to begin next Tuesday. The group, representing the
U.S.-Russian Business Council, was to have met with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, U.S. Ambassador James Collins met with Russian
officials and urged that Gusinsky be guaranteed due process and
protection of his rights, an embassy official said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Gusinsky heads a major Russian Jewish organization
has added fuel to the fire, with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
calling on Russian officials to reconsider the arrest.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Targeting DNC  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The protesters who swarmed recent world trade
and banking summits in Seattle and Washington now are targeting the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstration planners, hoping to rally 30,000 protesters,
are promising a carnival-like convergence of activists for the Aug.
14-17 convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be people with giant puppets, there'll be street
theater, folks in funny costumes and carrying giant banners,'' said
organizer Shawn McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be more disruptive actions as well. For example,
groups such as the Berkeley-based Ruckus Society plan July training
camps to teach elaborate protest tactics including creating
virtually impenetrable human blockades by having protesters link
arms through plastic pipes.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Lt. Horace Frank said officers have met with
some activist groups to discuss ways to keep the protests peaceful.
The department expects some, however, to seek attention by breaking
windows or provoking confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   ''If people decide to break the law, we will have to take
appropriate action,'' Frank said.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officials will travel to Philadelphia to monitor
expected protests during the Republican convention two weeks before
the Democrats gather in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have designated an area for protesters
in a vacant lot two blocks north of the convention site, the
downtown Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers say that won't do, and they plan legal action
in an effort to gain access to the streets surrounding the
convention center.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Austin, spokesman for the city's convention host committee,
said the protest zone will still give demonstrators access to the
delegates and media.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't stick them in Siberia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But protest organizer McDougal said, ''The protest pit is just a
way to quell the public voice. They're telling us, 'You protest
when we say, where we say.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protest groups accuse the Democratic Party of
failing to fight exploitation of workers in an era of corporate
globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect many different means of calling attention to the
corporate domination of our political system,'' McDougal said.
</P>
<P>
   Convention organizers note that several labor unions and
environmental groups that were influential in the demonstrations at
economic meetings in Seattle last fall and Washington this spring
have allied with Vice President Al Gore, the all-but-sure
Democratic presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''For that reason, many members of those communities will be
with us at both the convention and general election,'' said Peter
Ragone, a spokesman for the Democratic National Convention
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other groups, however, plan to use the event to
promote their message.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 activist groups have united under an umbrella
coalition known as the Mobilization to Protest the Democratic
National Convention 2000 -- or D2K Network for short.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of ''affinity groups'' represented by the coalition
oppose matters as diverse as sexism, racism, homophobia,
environmental destruction, the death penalty, U.S. immigration
policies and police corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the groups say the Internet has become an invaluable,
low-cost recruitment tool, enabling them to update activists
through Web sites, e-mail newsletters and digital sign-up sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters are asked not to injure anyone, D2K organizers said.
That message does not, however, extend to property.
</P>
<P>
   ''Equating property on the same level as people is part of the
problem,'' said McDougal, who also is a program coordinator for the
American Friends Service Committee, the U.S. social service arm of
the Quaker religious movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want anyone to get hurt, but 'nonviolence' doesn't
mean you sit there and don't confront what you think is wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Prince William Is Turning 18  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prince William is blessed -- some might say cursed
-- with Princess Diana's dazzling looks. Tall, blond and handsome,
he might have been a 21st-century heartthrob even if he weren't a
living reflection of the most famous face in the world.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, his 18th birthday, William comes into his mother's
unintended legacy -- international celebrity at its most daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds, this child of a spectacularly broken marriage,
whose mother's death sent much of the world into mourning, seems to
have grown into a strong and sensible young man with no more than
the average adolescent's aggravations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a king-in-waiting who is well-mannered, charming and
seems eminently ready to embark on the next stage of his life,''
historian Andrew Roberts wrote in the days leading up to William's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   But William has two big problems that are his alone: He knows
that, one day, the future of the British monarchy and its declining
popularity will be in his hands. And he knows he must -- much sooner
-- face the press.
</P>
<P>
   Historian David Cannadine once called Diana ''the most
spectacular royal celebrity and media star there ever has been.''
</P>
<P>
   After her death in 1997, he wrote that ''for years to come there
will be many people who will find it impossible to contemplate
(William's) slim, long-legged body, his thatch of red-fair hair,
and his bashful, downcast, through-the-eyelashes look, without
seeing in them the image of his mother. In a very real sense she
will live on in him.''
</P>
<P>
   For all Diana's flirtation with the news media and her love-hate
relationship with the press, she did not wish the same fate for her
sons.
</P>
<P>
   She and Prince Charles persuaded the press self-regulatory body
to protect William and his younger brother, Prince Harry, from
press intrusion while they were schoolboys.
</P>
<P>
   The voluntary press Code of Practice was tightened further when
Diana died in Paris fleeing from photographers.
</P>
<P>
   But when William crosses the threshold of adulthood on
Wednesday, he leaves behind the code's protection of minors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Across Fleet Street can be heard the sound of gloves gently
coming off,'' The Independent newspaper wrote as the prince's
birthday approached.
</P>
<P>
   Even the serious broadsheet newspapers are in a lather of
competition over William.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles' press secretary resigned last week after a
wrangle with the usually decorous Daily Telegraph over what the
newspaper called unfair distribution of the official birthday
photos.
</P>
<P>
   And the normally sedate BBC-TV was miffed over the release of
official birthday footage. The exciting sequence, aired Friday
evening? William swimming, working in his study and taking part in
a cooking course.
</P>
<P>
   Said to be a ''thank you'' to the news media for leaving him in
peace at Eton, the film showed a relaxed William, cooking paella
with his classmates and laughing over spilled ingredients. He was
also shown playing water polo and was described as one of the top
100 sprint swimmers in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids, of course, can hardly wait for his official
adulthood. And one didn't. The News of The World infuriated the
palace June 11 by printing telephoto pictures of William at school,
in violation of the press code.
</P>
<P>
   Press commission chairman Lord Wakeham said the week before
William's birthday that he hoped to set out guiding principles for
the news media to follow after the prince leaves school.
</P>
<P>
   The palace announced Friday that William has decided to postpone
the use of the designation His Royal Highness, which the royals
usually adopt at 18, because he is unlikely to carry out royal
duties until he has finished university.
</P>
<P>
   So, will there be a replay of Diana's pursuit by photographers
and the anonymous speculation about her life?
</P>
<P>
   The omens are not good, though The Sun, the biggest-selling
daily in Britain, made a surprise public vow in Saturday's edition,
promising to ''play fair'' with William. ''We will cover real news.
We will not intrude. We will not pry,'' the tabloid wrote,
according to advance copies of an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Still, newspapers already are running picture layouts of pretty
young aristocrats they deem to be acceptable mates for William.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like it or loathe it ... he is an extremely public figure, he
is an heir to the throne, his mother was Diana, he is single, he is
jolly good-looking, he is going to be covered,'' Rosie Boycott,
editor of The Express, was quoted as telling The Independent.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly does loathe it.
</P>
<P>
   William has never concealed his dislike of the press, and that
is unlikely to improve if he finds a steady girlfriend and
reporters get wind of it.
</P>
<P>
   His social life in London already is news, especially since
several young people in his circle admitted taking drugs. William
is accompanied everywhere by a police protection officer, however,
which likely limits how much trouble he can get into himself.
</P>
<P>
   The little verifiable information about William says he is good
at swimming, loves polo, is a good shot and goes fox hunting like
his father.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he has done well at school. He may take a year
off when he finishes at Eton this summer, to travel or work. But he
is expected to eventually study for a degree in art history, with
Edinburgh University a likely first choice.
</P>
<P>
   William has had a chance to mix with young people and spread his
wings, and he seems to be overcoming the shyness that made him so
reserved in public.
</P>
<P>
   The British wish him well. Most were delighted at his birth and
enjoyed watching the toddler grow and go off to school. They
sympathized when his parents' marriage broke up, and their hearts
ached for him when he walked behind his mother's casket to
Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Now they wonder if the young man who looks so like his mother
has her warm and volatile character or the reserve and sensitivity
of Prince Charles.
</P>
<P>
   And they will have endless opportunity to read all about it. All
they'll have to do is buy the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Desperate to replace Diana as a guaranteed sales winner,
newspapers and magazines are sure that they can reverse their
circulations' slides by publishing pictures of the prince,'' The
Guardian wrote recently. ''The market has no morality.''

<HEADLINE> White House Travel Case Wrapped Up  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The last chapter in the seven-year White House
travel office controversy is being played out at a bad time for
Hillary Rodham Clinton -- in the midst of her campaign for the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray won't prosecute anyone in the
long-running investigation, but he is putting the finishing touches
on a report likely to be made public before the November election,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Some documents and testimony gathered by Ray's office and
already on the public record suggest Mrs. Clinton played a central
role in instigating firings at the travel office, which makes
transportation arrangements for the White House press corps. She
denies being involved.
</P>
<P>
   The report could be sent to a three-member federal appeals court
panel as early as next week and publicly released three months from
now after lawyers for the first lady and others named in the
document have had an opportunity to respond, say legal sources
familiar with the investigation, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions that could be answered in Ray's report is
whether then-deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster and other
presidential aides tried to protect the first lady from criticism
by saying she had little to do with the purge.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's predecessor, Kenneth Starr, zeroed in on the travel office
in January 1996 when a memo by presidential aide David Watkins
surfaced stating that Mrs. Clinton had been behind the firings.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half earlier, Mrs. Clinton had denied ordering the
dismissals in written answers a White House lawyer submitted on her
behalf to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ... knew that there would be hell to pay if ... we failed
to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the first
lady's wishes,'' Watkins wrote in his unaddressed memo. He added
that he had been ''as protective and vague as possible'' in his own
answers to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once this made it onto the first lady's agenda, Vince Foster
became involved, and he'' and Hollywood producer Harry ''Thomason
regularly informed me of her ... insistence that the situation be
resolved immediately by replacing the travel office staff,''
Watkins wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady continued to insist she didn't direct the
firings. ''I had no decision-making role with regard to the
removal,'' Mrs. Clinton said in written answers to Congress in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's decision marks the second since he took over for the
oft-criticized Starr that he has closed down an inquiry without any
prosecutions in the long-running probe of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Ray announced there would be no prosecutions
regarding the White House's gathering of FBI background files on
former Republican administration employees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no immediate comment on the travel office
matter.

<HEADLINE> Lakers Parade Plans on Hold  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Better wait before anointing Kobe Bryant the
next Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   And better put those parade plans down Figueroa Street in Los
Angeles on hold, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   For the sixth time in nine playoff elimination games this
season, the Los Angeles Lakers came up short, losing to the Indiana
Pacers 120-87 Friday night in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, trimming
their lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard about the parade that they had planned.'' said
Indiana's Jalen Rose, who scored 32 points. ''That won't be
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the word was the parade would be held Monday had the
Lakers won Game 5. Instead, Game 6 will be played that night at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, the hero of Game 4 with eight of his 28 points in
overtime, committed his fifth foul with 1:44 left in third period,
and was forced to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, whose sprained left ankle didn't appear to be bothering
him, wound up with only eight points, shooting 4-for-20 without
attempting a free throw.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, Lakers coach Phil Jackson didn't remove Bryant
until three minutes remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kobe was game for it, but he just didn't find his shots or
rhythm out there to play with,'' Jackson said. ''They did a nice
job on him and, you know, I'm sure he's going to admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said he simply didn't have a good game.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, you just bounce back,'' he said. ''You just put it
behind you and we'll go home. That's what we played all season for,
to have homecourt advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to be champions tonight. It didn't happen. So we're
a little disappointed, but it's no biggie when you think about it.
I'm disappointed in the game I played, but you just put it behind
you, move on and get ready for Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who lost two games to Sacramento, another to Phoenix
and two more to Portland once they got within one game of winning
those series, seemed a step slow on this night, especially on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Pacers made them look bad by knocking down open
look after open look, especially in the first half when they took a
64-45 lead. The Lakers weren't closer than 13 points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, who has carved up the Pacers all series, had
35 points and 11 rebounds, but he got little help from his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just hit a lot of shots,'' O'Neal said. ''We didn't play
hard at all. I knew they were going to play inspired basketball for
Larry Bird's last home game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana went ahead for good in the opening four minutes, and had
their 19-point lead at halftime despite O'Neal's 19 points and
seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the Pacers shot 15-of-20 and were 6-of-6
from 3-point range in taking a 39-28 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the period during a timeout, the old disco tune
''Staying Alive'' entertained the Conseco Fieldhouse faithful, who
went nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Pacers were definitely staying alive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Jackson admitted that with a 3-1 lead, it was
difficult to keep his team from being overconfident, especially
considering the Lakers haven't lost three straight games since the
1999 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can talk about it, it's just difficult to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he was right.

<HEADLINE> 16 Arrested in NYC Park Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The number of arrests climbed to 16 Friday in a
string of attacks on women who were stripped and groped by gangs of
young men in Central Park last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the arrests took place on Friday. Police believe up to
60 men were responsible for the harassment, molestation and in some
cases robbery of 47 women, ranging in age from 14 to 40, including
four tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, police released 17 more photos of suspects, taken
from amateur videotapes of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 men arrested so far, four were found after tipsters
called a police hot line. Seven others surrendered after seeing
their photos either in newspapers or on television.
</P>
<P>
   All of the attacks occurred in daylight, most of them at the
southern end of the park, near the Central Park Zoo and the Plaza
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears to be something that happened relatively
spontaneously, and apparently some of them did not really recognize
the seriousness of the matters they were involved in,'' Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 75 detectives have been assigned full-time to
catching the suspects, Internal Affairs investigators are focusing
on whether any officers failed to help victims, as some of the
women have complained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without prejudging, my sense is we'll probably find four or
five police officers who acted inappropriately while the vast
majority of them acted appropriately,'' the police commissioner
said. ''Those police officers who acted inappropriately will be
subject to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   During his weekly radio appearance, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
called the attacks a travesty but said the majority of officers did
their jobs. He ended his show by saying: ''Make sure you get out
into the park, enjoy yourself, have a great weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said he will propose legislation making gang
sexual assault a crime punishable by three to five years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 6, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jim Edmonds hit two home runs and the St.
Louis Cardinals spoiled Orel Hershiser's return to the Los Angeles
rotation with a 6-3 victory over the Dodgers on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Hentgen (6-6) pitched into the seventh inning, giving the
Cardinals their fifth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (1-3), returning from a self-imposed stint in the
minors after a slow start, was charged with five runs and six hits
in four-plus innings. It was his first appearance with the Dodgers
since May 9, when he pitched in relief at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The 1988 Cy Young winner, who returned to Los Angeles this
season after a five-year absence, was removed from the rotation
after getting shelled for seven earned runs in 1 1-3 innings on
April 19 against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who grounded out with the bases loaded to end the
fourth, left in the fifth with the score tied at 3, two runners on
base and no outs.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Matt Herges struck out Mark McGwire and Ray Lankford,
but Eric Davis and Mike Matheny had RBI singles. Davis finished
with three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser retired his first two batters of the game before
giving up Edmonds' homer to right-center. He then hit McGwire in
the lower back with a 2-2 pitch, walked Lankford and surrendered an
RBI double by Davis. Lankford also scored on the play, as right
fielder Shawn Green tried to throw out Davis at second.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit his 20th homer with two outs in the ninth, an
opposite-field drive to left off Mike Fetters. It was Edmonds'
first multihomer game for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres pitched the ninth for his 12th save.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros closed the gap to 3-1 in the second inning with his
19th homer -- and third in his first four career at-bats against
Hentgen.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen walked Dave Hansen with one out in the fourth and then
issued a two-out intentional walk to Alex Cora. Hershiser grounded
to third for an inning-ending force.
</P>
<P>
   Hentgen, traded to St. Louis by Toronto last November, has
posted victories in consecutive starts for the first time since
winning his first three outings with the Cardinals.
Notes: Davis needs eight more RBIs for 900 in his career. ... The
intentional walk to Cora was only the fifth all season by St. Louis
pitchers, the fewest in the NL. ... Reliever Al Reyes, whom the
Dodgers acquired from Baltimore on Tuesday in the Alan Mills trade,
was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque. Catcher Adam Melhuse was
recalled from the Dukes. ... Hershiser already has hit 10 batters
in just 21 2-3 innings this season, including a major league
record-tying four on April 19 against Houston. One more and he'll
match the number he had last season in 179 innings with the New
York Mets. Hershiser has now plunked at least 10 batters in five
consecutive seasons. ... Edmonds is 5-for-14 lifetime against
Hershiser, with three home runs. ... Hentgen, who singled in the
fourth, is 8-for-26 at the plate and leads rookie Rick Ankiel for
the most hits among St. Louis pitchers.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Hard Drives Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal investigators are closely examining
two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets that were found
at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory, believing they are the ones
missing for more than a month. They want to determine whether the
information has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hoped to know by late Saturday whether the two
drives definitely are the same ones that disappeared and, after an
electronic examination, learn whether the contents have been copied
or otherwise tampered with, said one official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The two devices, each about the size of a deck of cards, contain
highly technical information that would be used by a nuclear
emergency response team to locate and dismantle not only U.S., but
some Russian and other countries' nuclear devices in case of an
accident or terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were found in a secure area. The area is being treated as
a crime scene,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said at a news
conference in Phoenix, where he was informed of the discovery
Friday while holding a meeting on summer electricity reliability.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the two devices were found within the secure
''Division X'' area of the New Mexico weapons lab in an area that
had been searched previously. Another official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said they were discovered behind a copying
machine.
</P>
<P>
   The highly restricted area includes the vault where the two
drives, which belong to the Nuclear Emergency Search Team had been
kept. They were last reported seen April 7 and found missing a
month later, although senior lab and Energy Department officials
were not informed until recently.
</P>
<P>
   While relieved that the drives were found within the secure area
of the lab, Richardson said ''this is not a victory speech'' and
that the FBI and the Energy Department ''would continue to
aggressively pursue'' the criminal investigation. Even with the
drives recovered those responsible could face criminal charges for
security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to hold people accountable. There are going to be
people disciplined,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half-dozen Los Alamos scientists -- among 26 people
with free access to the vault where the devices had been kept --
have been given polygraph tests and some answers have raised
suspicions among investigators, according to government sources.
And six Los Alamos managers, including the chief of the emergency
response team that used the devices and the head of the lab's
nuclear programs already have been put on leave with pay pending
completion of the investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the hard drives had evoked anger and
frustration both in Congress and at the White House and Energy
Department, which didn't learn of the security breach for nearly a
month after the devices were found missing from the vault.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the two drives did not stem the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It raises more questions about security than it answers,''
said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., a member of the Senate Intelligence
Committee. ''The hard drives were apparently discovered in an area
that had been previously searched, raising the strong possibility
that they were returned to the site after being stolen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla, chairman of the House Intelligence
Committee called the missing drives ''a major security failure''
that had ''potentially devastating'' consequences if the
information were compromised. The CIA has been asked to make an
assessment of potential harm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, six Democratic members of the House, led by Rep. John
Dingell of Michigan, ranking member of the Commerce Committee,
urged Richardson to cancel the government's contract with the
University of California for managing the Los Alamos lab.
</P>
<P>
   They said the university, which has managed Los Alamos as well
as the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California for the
government for more than 50 years, is ''incapable of carrying out
its ... obligations'' to provide security.

<HEADLINE> Son Honors Dad With 10,000 Mile Ride  </HEADLINE>
By AMBER AUSTIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURFREESBORO, Tenn. (AP) -- Wylie W. Sensing Jr. died of lung
cancer before he could realize one of his lifelong dreams -- to
visit the Alaskan wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   In his honor, his son, Scott Sensing, is driving 10,000 miles in
a 1952 Chevy truck to the most northern point on the continent
accessible by car -- Prudoe Bay, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not doing this for fame or recognition,'' says Sensing,
who started his journey June 11. ''This is something my father
always dreamed of doing, and if I can somehow fulfill that dream
for him, and raise money to fight the disease he died from, then
it's something I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing, 36, a student services officer at Tennessee Technology
Center in Murfreesboro, took a one-year leave of absence from his
job for the journey.
</P>
<P>
   While such cross-country pilgrimages are not unusual, traveling
in an old truck that averages 40 mph, has no radio and no modern
air-conditioning makes the journey a test of human will.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being without an air-conditioner has been a hard adjustment.
If your going across town that's one thing, but eight hours at 93
degrees without cool air is tough,'' Sensing said June 14 from his
Texas hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been someone who needs music to drive. So far I've
done a lot of thinking to pass the time, watching the changes in
scenery roll past.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing and his father renovated the truck, affectionately named
Shelley, after he discovered it near his rural Middle Tennessee
home the summer after his 1982 high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I was going to drive it to Alaska that summer. But of
course that was silly back then, and I didn't do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His dreams of Alaska were passed down to him by his father, who
fantasized about homesteading in the Alaskan wilderness since he
was a child.
</P>
<P>
   A normally animated man, Sensing is quiet as he talks about his
father. He stares into the distance, fighting strong emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ''My dad was born about a hundred years too late,'' said
Sensing, noting his father owned every Western novel written by
Louis L'Amour. ''He was one of those people who would have been
fine living back in the woods all alone, fending for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Friend Galen French said when Sensing's father got ill with lung
cancer, the father and son used to talk about a road trip to
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Mr. Sensing really thought he was going to beat it,''
French said. ''I think that was one of his motivating factors, that
they would finally get to take that father-son trip. But it wasn't
meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Sensing died in May 1998 at age 65. It took the
younger Sensing about a year before he could commit himself to
making the trip for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was then I said, 'I'm going to do this all the way, or I'm
not going to do it at all,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took another year for him to raise money and find sponsors.
Corporate donations -- including $1,000 for fuel from Kroger Fuel
Centers and a laptop donated by Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Tennessee
-- have helped him finance about 90 percent of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was our way of helping out what we believe is a worthwhile
cause,'' said Sherri Tate, a Kroger spokeswoman. ''We get all kinds
of donation requests, but Mr. Sensing's request is definitely one
that I haven't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing also raised over $30,000 for the American Cancer Society
from about 40 antique car clubs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing plans to keep a travel journal that he will post on a
Web site, along with pictures, so his family, friends and sponsors
can monitor his progress.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's taking the back roads of America for several
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to avoid all those huge 18-wheelers doing 80 mph on the
interstate,'' Sensing said. ''Plus, you see parts of the country
you would never know were there if you stayed on the interstate. I
think my dad would like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing started his journey from Murfreesboro, following the
Natchez Trace Parkway, originally an Indian trail. He wound through
Mississippi to Austin, Texas, the hometown of his friend French,
who will ride with him to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing will then drive alone to Calgary, Alberta, where he'll
meet his brother David for the last stretch to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The only route to Prudhoe Bay from Fairbanks is Dalton Highway,
a 489-mile road originally used only to service the Alaska
Pipeline. The road recently opened to the public -- 300 miles of it
still gravel.
</P>
<P>
   The Sensings' last connection with civilization will be
Coldfoot, Alaska: ''the last place you can buy anything -- gasoline,
Twinkies, beef jerky,'' Sensing said. ''In Coldfoot, it's basically
now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   The drive from Coldfoot to Prudhoe Bay is 244 miles. Sensing's
truck has a 25-gallon gas tank, and he will carry an extra
six-gallon jug with him.
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrives, Sensing doesn't have any particular plans. He
believes the journey alone is a tribute to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ''My father had dreamed about Alaska since the 70s,'' Sensing
said. ''By finally making it a reality, both his dreams and mine
will come true.''

<HEADLINE> Guatemalans Seek Protection  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- In the city, guns will soon outnumber
people. In the countryside, heavily armed private security forces
are becoming more common than electricity and phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Crime has gotten so out of hand that 4,000 Guatemalan troops are
taking to the streets Saturday to aid an overworked police force.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vice president, a camera-shy bureaucrat known here
mainly for blending into the furniture, surprised Guatemalans by
appearing on television May 29 to plead for the crime wave to
abate, if even just slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Guatemalans none of it is enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures for the crime rate, but gun sales
give a gauge of how rampant fear of crime is. In the last six
months, purchases of security services and weapons are up 50
percent on rates that were already among the highest in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Already in Guatemala City there are 1.5 million guns, about as
many firearms as people. Even conservative estimates show guns will
outnumber people by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't keep any popular models on the shelves,'' said Ricardo
Umana, owner of Gun Depot, a small store in a wealthy suburban
Guatemala City neighborhood, packed from floor to ceiling with
handguns, shotguns and assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of my customers used to be hunters, but now everyone
everywhere is buying guns,'' Umana said.
</P>
<P>
   The capital sports concealed-weapon laws more lenient than
Texas. Security guards brandishing assault rifles and shotguns
guard every bank, electronics store and shopping mall and can even
be found keeping an eye on McDonald's in some of the city's rougher
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Guatemala City, where guns have become harder to find
since the end of the 36-year civil war in 1996, residents have
begun forming armed groups, known as ''security juntas'', aimed at
scaring would-be criminals out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are now easily more of these groups than there are
police officers,'' said Cesar Saldavar, police chief for rural
Peten, Guatemala's northernmost state. ''All the guns left over
from the war are going into the hands of groups organizing to kill
and frighten criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the western, mostly Indian state of Quiche, authorities
report that security juntas have arisen in the region's five
largest municipalities and are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't know how many guns there are here in Quiche
now. We may be up to civil war levels,'' a police spokesman said on
customary condition of anonymity. ''We have to be worried a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups serve mainly to intimidate potential criminals, but
that doesn't stop citizens from taking matters into their own
hands: Lynchings have become common throughout rural Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Guatemalans mobilize to protect themselves, some say the
simplest way to end crime problems would be to return to the
country's dictatorial past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone says if (former dictator Gen. Efrain) Rios Montt took
power again all of the criminals would flee, that they would leave
the country,'' said Enrique Lucero, 41, as he waited for a bus in
an affluent southern Guatemala City neighborhood where he works as
a housepainter. ''The general doesn't tolerate crime, and everyone
knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt, the current president of the legislature, ruled
Guatemala with an iron fist from 1982-83, an 18-month tenure in
which he oversaw arguably the bloodiest days of the civil war. The
December 1996 peace accords finally brought fighting between state
forces and leftist guerillas to an end, but only after some 200,000
Guatemalans had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's 1985 constitution bars Rios Montt, 71, from assuming
Guatemala's highest office again. But President Alfonso Portillo,
who is a member of the party Rios Montt founded and campaigned
closely with the ex-dictator during last fall's elections, is
lobbying for a special congressional session to repeal the
constitution -- and clear the way for another Rios Montt presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt has refused to talk to the news media about apparent
attempts to return him to power. But he supported a new law that
lets an army that once went to war against its own people to take
to the streets again, this time to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fighting this kind of violence in whatever manner we can is a
good idea,'' Rios Montt said.

<HEADLINE> UN: Rwanda, Uganda Leave Congo  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Concluding two days of talks with Congo's
warring armies, the Security Council demanded that Rwanda and
Uganda immediately withdraw their forces from the country and
threatened to consider sanctions if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimously adopted resolution Friday, the council also
said Rwanda and Uganda should pay for the damage and deaths they
inflicted on the northern Congolese city of Kisangani, where they
fought earlier this month, killing an estimated 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was adopted at the close of the meeting that
included the foreign ministers of Rwanda, Uganda and Congo and
representatives of the key rebel groups and other foreign armies
involved in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan Foreign Minister Amama Mbabazi, who chairs a committee
of the various factions, called the meeting a success because all
sides reaffirmed their commitment to Congo's year-old peace
agreement, known as the Lusaka Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''We therefore go with the confidence that this interaction will
result in faster and effective implementation of Lusaka,'' Mbabazi
told the council.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the two-day session focused on pressing all foreign
forces to leave Congo and encouraging dialogue between the
government and opposition. U.N. officials say such dialogue has
been stymied by repeated obstacles mounted by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The debate among council members on the draft resolution had
focused on whether to demand that Rwanda and Uganda pull out of
Congo before the other foreign armies -- Namibia, Zimbabwe and
Angola -- which are supporting Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda entered the war two years ago, backing
different rebel groups seeking to oust Kabila. They say they are
involved to protect their borders from their own rebels operating
inside Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Rwanda and Uganda turned their guns on each
other in Kisangani. The fighting ended Sunday after Rwandan forces
drove the Ugandans out of the northern sector of the city and let
unarmed U.N. military observers deploy between the former allies.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution demands Rwanda and Uganda and other armed groups
''immediately and completely withdraw from Kisangani'' and from the
entire country ''without further delay'' as called for by the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It says the two countries should make reparations ''for the loss
of life and the property damage they have inflicted on the civilian
population in Kisangani'' and asks the United Nations to submit a
report on what the amount should be.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also says the council would consider possible
''measures'' if the Congo parties fail to abide by the demands in
the resolution -- a reference to possible economic and diplomatic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''So long as there is movement there will be some patience in
the Security Council,'' said British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock.
''If that movement evaporates, then so will our patience.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 7, Astros 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his major league-leading
26th home run, leading Shawn Estes and the San Francisco Giants
over the Houston Astros 7-4 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds had three hits, scored three runs and drove in two. He
came to the plate in the eighth inning needing a single to hit for
the cycle, but flied out. The crowd gave him a standing ovation
when he returned to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Aurilia also homered for the Giants, who won their fourth
straight and went a game over .500 for the first time since May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (6-3) allowed one run and five hits in seven innings. He
improved his home ERA to 1.61 in six starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored twice in the ninth. Robb Nen relieved after
Craig Biggio's RBI double and got the last out for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton (4-3) allowed six runs on eight hits and four
walks in four 1-3 innings. He's 1-3 with a 9.36 ERA in six starts
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou homered and drove in two runs for Houston. Jeff
Bagwell and Julio Lugo each had two hits for the Astros, who
matched their season high with four errors.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants took advantage of two errors to score two runs in the
first. Marvin Benard walked, stole second and went to third on
Mitch Meluskey's throwing error. One out later, Bonds doubled off
the right field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis Burks had an infield single, and Bonds scored when Lugo's
throw got by Bagwell at first.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds hit a 2-2 offering from Elarton into the last row of the
right field bleachers with one out in the third. Aurilia homered on
the first pitch he saw to lead off the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added a pair of runs in the fifth. Burks scored from
second on Lugo's second throwing error of the game at shortstop.
Bobby Estalella doubled home Aurilia with the other run.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds tripled with one out in the sixth and scored when Jeff
Kent singled. It was Kent's NL-leading 63rd RBI.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Astros 3B Chris Truby made his major league debut. He
tripled in the ninth for his first hit and scored on a groundout.
Truby was recalled from Triple-A New Orleans to take Ken Caminiti's
place on the roster. Caminiti was placed on the 15-day disabled
list due to a ruptured tendon sheath in his right wrist. He'll
undergo surgery on Monday at Houston's Methodist Hospital. He's
expected to miss 8-12 weeks. ... Dusty Baker celebrated his 51st
birthday with a day off Thursday, the first time he's had his
birthday off since taking over as Giants manager in 1993. The
Giants are 1-6 on his birthday. ... Elarton has now allowed six
home runs in 25 innings pitched away from Enron Field. ... Biggio
doubled in his 6,630th career at-bat for the Astros, moving him one
past Jose Cruz for the team record.

<HEADLINE> Activists Want Telescopes Off Land  </HEADLINE>
By JEAN CHRISTENSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- For decades, astronomers have flocked to the
highest point in Hawaii to search the night skies with some of the
most powerful telescopes on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Now a dispute is erupting at the 14,000-foot summit of the
dormant Mauna Kea volcano over the presence of those telescopes.
Native Hawaiian activists call them an unwelcome intrusion on
sacred Hawaiian land.
</P>
<P>
   University of Hawaii officials hope a master plan approved
Friday for future telescope development will resolve that dispute.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, scientists say, is a top-notch window to the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of the best places on the entire earth to put a
telescope,'' said Steven Vogt, a professor of astronomy and
astrophysics at the University of California at Santa Cruz, who
helped discover the first planets smaller than Jupiter ever found
outside the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   More major telescopes are located on Mauna Kea, or ''White
Mountain,'' than any other single peak -- 12. They include the
world's largest optical and infrared telescopes at the W.M. Keck
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Hawaii oversees the observatory, which is used
by NASA, the California Institute of Technology and institutions
from Canada, France, Japan and the United Kingdom, among others. It
generates about $142 million a year for the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the sometimes snowcapped summit -- considered the ''piko,''
or navel, that connects Hawaiians back through time -- also is home
to several endangered native species and archaeological sites.
Natives consider it the home of the Hawaiian goddesses of snow and
mist.
</P>
<P>
   At a tiny mountain lake, generations of Hawaiians have offered
their children's' umbilical cords to connect them to the spiritual
world.
</P>
<P>
   ''The University of Hawaii does not have autonomy on Mauna
Kea,'' said Abraham Kamakawiwoole, who sees astronomers' use of the
mountain top as another example of stolen Hawaiian land. ''The
indigenous people of the Hawaiian archipelago do. Jurisdiction of
Mauna Kea belongs to the Native Hawaiian.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the research conducted at Mauna Kea is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists there have spotted galaxies in the early stages of
formation; found evidence the universe's expansion may be speeding
up rather than slowing down; and identified objects beyond Neptune
left over from the formation of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this work couldn't be done without the quality of
observing that can be done from Mauna Kea,'' said Robert McLaren,
interim director of the university's Institute for Astronomy. ''The
only alternative would be to do it in space, and that's extremely
expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   A draft plan guiding future telescope development has been
rewritten five times since 1983, costing the university more than
$1 million. On Friday, the university's Board of Regents approved a
plan that President Kenneth Mortimer said ''respects the sacredness
of the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year master plan reduces astronomy zones from 160 to 150
acres within the 11,300-acre science reserve, and allows for three
new telescopes instead of five, as originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   The regents, who include Native Hawaiians, retain ultimate
authority over new development but now will be advised by community
members and Hawaiian cultural experts.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also bars major changes to the lunar-like summit
landscape and new telescopes must blend with the surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Vogt said he and other scientists are sensitive to Hawaiian
cultural concerns and feel a kinship with the ancient Hawaiians,
who relied on the stars to navigate their Pacific crossings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're starting now to take the tiniest little steps on that
long, long journey to figure out how we can get off this little
rock and go somewhere where we can survive as a species,'' Vogt
said. ''I would think if I were a Native Hawaiian, I would feel
kind of honored to have such a place used for such things.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Allard Baird To Be KC's GM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Allard Baird will become general manager
of the Kansas City Royals, succeeding Herk Robinson effective
immediately, The Kansas City Star reported.
</P>
<P>
   Baird, 38, has been the team's vice president and assistant
general manager for baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   New Royals owner David Glass told the Star on Friday that Baird
will be introduced as the new GM before Saturday night's game with
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is in his 31st year with the Royals and his 10th as
general manager, giving him the longest tenure of any GM in the
American League. He will remain with the club in his role as chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very positive thing for the organization,'' said
Glass. ''Everybody's very excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals have long been grooming Baird for the role and Glass
views the change as a promotion for him rather than a demotion for
Robinson, 59.
</P>
<P>
   Glass had indicated previously that he wouldn't make any
significant personnel moves until after the season, but decided to
act now because he thinks Baird is ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has already begun to do a great deal of the day-to-day
stuff,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Baird is in his 12th season with the Royals and has spent his
career on the baseball side of the business. He has held jobs from
hitting coach at the minor league level to territorial scouting
supervisor in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He was named special assistant to the general manager in
February 1997 and promoted to a vice president and assistant GM in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is unquestionably time to hand the reins over,'' said
Robinson. ''I have worked closely with Al for the last couple of
years in preparation for this day. He is very, very qualified. He's
a good baseball man. He's at a good stage and age of his life. Lots
of energy, very creative. He's well-respected throughout baseball,
very respected by our own coaches and players.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird will handle all day-to-day baseball operations of the
club.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who became chief operating officer shortly after Glass
took control of the Royals, will maintain a full-time role with the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Baird and Art Chaudry, senior vice president for business
operations, will both report to Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Glass took control of the Royals on April 28 and less than a
month ago he gave manager Tony Muser a two-year contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Previously Glass installed his son, Dan, as the club's
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''We view Dan and Baird as being the architects of the future
for the Royals,'' Glass said. ''While Herk and I are here, with all
of our experience, we can help them grow. But Herk and I are from a
different generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are positioning the Royals' next generation of management
to make sure we are comfortable for the foreseeable future.''

<HEADLINE> Euro 2000 Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even the sweetest goals could not prevent Euro 2000 from turning
sour.
</P>
<P>
   After a first week of fun and games, a hooligan riot left a
trail of destruction through Brussels, Belgium, and left 137
Englishmen in jail even before Saturday's kickoff of the game
between Germany and England in Charleroi, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The skills, beauty and goals displayed by France and the
Netherlands as they qualified for the quarterfinals paled in
comparison with the violence and racist taunts that wrote another
sorry chapter in the history of soccer hooliganism.
</P>
<P>
   France eliminated the Czech Republic with a 2-1 win, and cohost
the Netherlands eliminated Denmark immediately afterwards with a
3-0 thrashing.
</P>
<P>
   Germany and England, both on the ropes in Group A, will be
looking anxiously at the result of group leader Portugal against
Romania, who meet in Arnhem, Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Most eyes unfortunately center on hooligans who ran amok through
the historic center of Brussels leaving a trail of ransacked shops
and bars. A massive police presence was able to detain 137
Englishmen, of whom 35 were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Police anticipated the worst violence would occur in Charleroi
before or after Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen people were hospitalized with injuries after the
riot, which had police cornering and clubbing English hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   In Charleroi, police surrounded the main square where English
fans were drinking, while some were chanting anti-Turkish racist
songs. Police picked some rowdy fans from the crowds and took them
away. An actual fight with police never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium tightened border controls, and at least two dozen known
hooligans or drunken fans were sent back to England, bringing the
total of people forced to leave since the tournament opened to 56.
It was not enough to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know we have a reputation, but it is not all of us,''
English fan George Scotland said. ''I have a ticket for the
Charleroi game, but it is making me think twice about going.''
</P>
<P>
   Charleroi is 31 miles south of the capital. Most German fans
were expected to go straight to Charleroi on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rotterdam, meanwhile, was hopping to the rhythm of the Dutch
team.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kluivert put the Dutch ahead in the 58th minute at a
time when they started showing nerves. Substitute Ronald de Boer
added the second in the 66th soon after entering the game, and
Boudewijn Zenden made it a hat trick for Barcelona players by
adding the third with 12 minutes to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''When halftime arrived and we were goal-less, we weren't very
confident that there would be a good result for us,'' coach Frank
Rijkaard said. ''We knew we had to give a lot more to make pressure
as a collective team. When that happened, we started to play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   France advanced in the tournament with respect for the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Czechs are one of the toughest sides in the tournament.
They don't deserve to go out,'' said French forward Thierry Henry,
who scored Friday's opener for France.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal and Tigers Play for Title  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- While LSU's Brad Cresse and Blair Barbier
reminisced about being back in the College World Series final,
Stanford's John Gall, sitting just a few feet away, waited for his
turn.
</P>
<P>
   The LSU players talked about the Tigers' current 12-game winning
streak and what a great run the team had in the 1990s, when it won
four NCAA titles.
</P>
<P>
   Gall wanted to chime in, but held his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike Brad and Blair, we haven't won one. So this is a new
experience for this side of the table,'' Gall said.
</P>
<P>
   A new experience for an old team.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (50-15), playing in their first CWS championship
game since 1988, have seven upperclassmen in their starting lineup.
They believed it could be the difference in Saturday's title game
against LSU (51-17).
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel good about our chances,'' Stanford senior Edmund Muth
said. ''In every game we've had where it's been lose this and your
career is over, we've responded. Nothing changes here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The foul lines aren't turned any different, the mound's not
any higher, the fences aren't any farther back and they still have
to throw the ball over 17 inches of the plate. And that's where our
experience really should make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers aren't exactly cubs, either.
</P>
<P>
   LSU has eight holdovers from the 1998 team that played at
Rosenblatt Stadium, three of whom also played on the 1997
championship squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the money games,'' LSU first baseman Brad Hawpe
said. ''This is what puts the ring on your finger, and that's what
we're playing for.''
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers were 23-7 at the CWS in the 1990s, including 13-2 in
the last five years. Stanford, making its third appearance in the
championship game, won titles in 1987 and '88.
</P>
<P>
   LSU won four championships in the 1990s, earning the distinction
as the team of the decade. But the Tigers, who are 4-0 in title
games, haven't won one since posting back-to-back titles in 1996
and '97.
</P>
<P>
   LSU is a slightly different team than it was during the '90s
run. The Tigers -- whose style was called ''Gorilla ball'' and who
were nicknamed the ''Baton Rouge Bombers'' for all the homers --
don't have quite the power throughout the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they set the NCAA Division I record for homers in a
season with 188. This year, with the NCAA-mandated, less-potent
bats, they have 96 dingers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd get seven or eight hits and a couple of them would be
three-run home runs,'' Barbier said. ''That's how we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt still seems to suit the Tigers, though. They have
scored 29 runs in three games and have hit nine home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Cresse, who had 30 home runs this season, is still waiting for
his first at this year's CWS. He snapped a 0-for-9 hitless streak
against Florida State on Thursday, which could prove huge for the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was big for me,'' Cresse said. ''It hasn't been a good
tournament for me, but it's been a great one for my team.''
</P>
<P>
   And it still could get better. The Tigers will start Brian
Tallet (15-3) against Stanford. Tallet, a lanky left-hander, hasn't
pitched since last Saturday's opener against Texas. He gave up five
runs in 7 1-3 innings for the win, making him only the third
pitcher in LSU history to win 15 games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford planned to counter with either right-hander Jason Young
(9-1) or right-hander Justin Wayne (15-3).
</P>
<P>
   Both pitchers were drafted in the early rounds of last week's
amateur draft. Wayne went to the Montreal Expos with the fifth
overall pick, and Young was taken 47th overall by Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of us has a different bag of goodies,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever starts, the other one will be the first Cardinal out of
the bullpen. Stanford also has a dominant closer with Jeff Bruksch,
who is tied for the school record with 13 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just what we always wanted,'' said Muth, who holds the
CWS career record for home runs with six. ''We've played in every
big game except the big one, and now we're there.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we're not just happy to be here. I don't see any guy on
our team overly excited. We expected to be here, so now let's just
go for it.''

<HEADLINE> Gibson Leads SBC Championship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Fred Gibson found the Bermuda grass greens of
Dominion Country Club to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson had nine birdies in a bogey-free round Friday, shooting a
tournament-record 9-under-par 63 for a 4-stroke lead on the opening
day of the Senior PGA Tour's SBC Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 52, made an uphill 12-foot birdie putt on the 545-yard,
par-5 18th green to break the tournament record of 64 set by J.C.
Goosie in 1987 and matched by George Archer in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to see some putts go in,'' said Gibson, who made
seven birdie putts of 10 feet or more. He holed three 30-foot putts
and one 20-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greens are perfect. I'm from Orlando, so I'm very familiar
with Bermuda grass,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of his game also fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drove the ball real well. It's hard to control it when the
ball is in the rough. This is just the first day. Regardless of the
outcome the rest of this week, I know I'm playing well enough going
into the U.S. Senior Open.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senior Open begins June 29 in Bethlehem, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Hall, playing despite the pain of three kidney stones,
opened with a 67, good for second place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had an interesting week with the kidney stones,'' Hall
said. ''I hit the ball awfully well. I thought about withdrawing
early in the week, but the emergency room doctor told me to take it
one day at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I wasn't nearly as sharp as Fred. The course is in
great condition. If you're accustomed to Bermuda greens and can
read the grain correctly, you can make a lot of putts on these
greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-time winner Lee Trevino was five strokes back at 68 along
with Ray Floyd and Gary McCord. England's Brian Barnes shot a 69,
and John Mahaffey, the defending champion in his hometown event,
topped an 11-player group at 70.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Dougherty had his first hole-in-one on the senior tour, using
a 6-iron on the 153-yard, par-3 17th hole. It was the ninth ace on
the tour this year and the third in the tournament's 16-year
history. Dougherty opened with a 73.

Los Alamos Hard Drives Investigated
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Authorities hope to know by late Saturday whether two
computer hard drives found at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory definitely are
the same ones containing nuclear secrets that have been missing for more than a
month. They also will conduct an electronic examination to learn whether the
contents have been copied or otherwise tampered with, said one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the
two devices were found within the secure ''Division X'' area of the New Mexico
weapons lab in an area that had been searched previously. Another official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were discovered behind a copying
machine.

   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Gunmen dressed in black stormed a village in eastern
India and shot dead 22 members of a low caste community, domestic news agencies
reported. The attackers were members of the Ranvir Sena, a private militia run
by upper caste feudal landlords, K.A. Jacob, the police chief in eastern Bihar
state said, quoted by the Press Trust of India. The massacre was apparently in
retaliation for the killing of 12 upper caste villagers last week.

   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Texas A&AMP;M University is suspending its
traditional pre-game bonfire for at least two more years to give officials time

When the tradition does resume, in 2002 at the earliest, the bonfire will be far
smaller and the construction will be much more professionally run, Texas A&AMP;M
President Ray Bowen said Friday at a news conference. The change resulted from
the collapse during construction of the 2 million-pound log stack Nov. 18.

Bush Takes Swipe at Gore's Tax Plan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- George W. Bush on Friday suggested Al Gore doubled the
size of his tax cut plan because that's what polling said he should do. ''Surely
America doesn't want a focus group-driven presidency,'' said the GOP contender.
Bush acknowledged his own campaign uses focus groups, which are people chosen
for their characteristics and questioned on specific topics. On Thursday,
Democrat Gore promised $500 billion in tax relief over 10 years to help
middle-class Americans pay for tuition, buy health insurance and save for
retirement. The total is double his earlier estimate, an increase he said was
possible because of a rising federal surplus.

Tiger Woods Leads 100th U.S. Open
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The fog lifted over Pebble Beach on Friday and
revealed the passing of a generation -- Jack Nicklaus limping home in his final
U.S. Open, Tiger Woods breezing along on a brutally tough day. Nicklaus bid an
emotional and unforgettable farewell to 44 years in the toughest championship in
golf, reaching the 545-yard 18th hole in two shots. Woods rolled in a 30-foot
putt on the par-3 12th, his fifth birdie of the day on rock-hard greens, to get
to 9 under for the tournament and build a three-shot lead over Miguel Angel
Jimenez.

<HEADLINE> Last Look for Nicklaus After US Open  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus pulled his drive left,
bent over to pull the tee out of the ground and looked up in plenty
of time to catch a glimpse of his future.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the fieldstone porch of a multimillion-dollar home
alongside the 11th tee at Pebble Beach, two men in comfortable lawn
chairs stared back.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open is about to become a spectator sport for the man
who played it better than any other -- ever. Nicklaus said so
himself. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say there's a pretty good chance this is the last,'' he
started, then stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very slim that I would play again. ... This place in many
ways started my golf game and almost 40 years later, maybe it's a
fitting place to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a minute or so later, when someone asked Nicklaus
about whether he'd ever consider coming back if the U.S. Golf
Association extended yet one more exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well,'' he began, ''if I won the Senior Open and I was playing
well and ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Stop right there, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's disappointing not making the cut, but it would be
hard to imagine a more fitting goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   On a sun-splashed afternoon, on the prettiest piece of ground
golf is played on, Nicklaus made a farewell tour and should leave
it at that.
</P>
<P>
   He had his oldest son, Jackie, toting his bag and his wife,
Barbara, standing behind the 18th green, red-eyed with tears, to
give him one last U.S. Open hug.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always said if he could play one last round, he wanted to
play Pebble Beach,'' she said. ''Obviously, he wanted to play four
rounds, but it was still wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus tried to say as much himself several times, but the
words wouldn't come out exactly that way.
</P>
<P>
   The hair is thinner and the middle thicker than when he was the
most fearsome presence in the game. But people who expect him to be
pleased with any effort have no idea what Jack is made of; even
now, concession speeches have to be wrung from him.
</P>
<P>
   At the Masters two years ago, the people in charge at Augusta
National honored 40 years of Nicklaus by putting his name on a
bronze plaque. An hour into Sunday's final round, he stubbornly put
it back on the leaderboard. Afterward, when his quest came up four
strokes short, the then-58-year-old Nicklaus took a seat in the
interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be pretty stupid to say I wasn't thrilled,'' he said
at the time. ''But I'd also be dishonest to say I wasn't
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday's final tour of Pebble Beach, Nicklaus was mortified
at moments, disgusted at others, humbled by a few, but finally
touched. He was applauded at every green and nearly every fairway,
but the truth is there were precious few shots worth clapping for
on his way to a round of 11-over par -- Nicklaus' worst Open score
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the cruelty golf inflicts, it also allows for a
graceful exit. And for once, with 44 Opens come and gone, Nicklaus
availed himself of that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was one of 75 golfers out on the course when fog
postponed completion of the first round. He played nine holes
Friday morning and when he arrived at the 18th tee a second time
late in the afternoon, he prowled the tee box and finally sat down
on a fence at the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took one big last look at it,'' he said. ''I was hoping
somebody would take a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Nicklaus turned to Jackie and said he was going for the
green in two at the 543-yard, par-5 hole. He hadn't even attempted
the feat in 20 years, yet there was nothing but memories left to
play for.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment props up a legend for only so long, but in this case
it was just long enough. Nicklaus drove his tee ball to the middle
of the fairway and airmailed a 3-wood to just in front of the
green. From there, accompanied by a growing roar, the ball rolled
to within 50 feet of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Nicklaus caught up with it, everybody in the
bleachers was standing and Nicklaus uncharacteristically milked the
moment for all it was worth. He pretended to be surprised to find
out he'd reached the green and he then stepped out of his putting
crouch when a seagull flying by squawked a goodbye of his own. Back
on the 18th fairway, meanwhile, old foe Tom Watson was applauding
and fighting back a few tears of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackie told the old man to read the final putt himself.
Nicklaus missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My eyes were blurry and I was trying to go through the
moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For just a heartbeat, you could sense how special this all was,
but Jack being Jack, he couldn't let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ''And,'' he finished, ''I topped the darned putt.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Leads 100th U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- As Jack Nicklaus bid a poignant
farewell to the U.S. Open, Tiger Woods lined up his first tee shot
of the day. It was as if a symbolic handoff was taking place on a
windy day along the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, a four-time Open winner, shot 11-over 82 in the second
round Friday, leaving him at 13-over 155 at the midway point and
unlikely to make the cut. He was saluted by fans and fellow players
in his 44th consecutive Open.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes after Nicklaus walked off the 18th green, Woods
began his second round in a tournament that is turning into his
coronation. He began the round with a one-stroke lead, and built
his margin to three shots with a 30-foot birdie on the par-3 12th
hole just as darkness halted play Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods thrust his right arm in the air to celebrate the birdie on
his last shot of the day. It moved him to 9 under, three shots
better than Miguel Angel Jimenez. Thomas Bjorn and Angel Cabrera
were four shots farther back at 2 under.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, playing his 100th professional tournament in the
centennial U.S. Open, is trying to become the first wire-to-wire
Open champion since the late Payne Stewart at Hazeltine in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was far too early to compare this tournament to
his record 12-stroke victory in the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a long way to go. We haven't even finished the second
round yet,'' Woods said. ''This golf course is a lot more demanding
than Augusta was.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was scheduled to resume his second round at 6:30 a.m. PDT
(9:30 a.m. EDT) Saturday. Once the round is complete and the cut is
made, tournament officials hope to start the third round by 10:30
a.m. PDT (1:30 p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   If fog returns to plague the tournament, however, the Open could
extend into Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The fog that suspended play Thursday afternoon and held up the
resumption of play for 90 minutes Friday morning forced two rounds
to be played simultaneously Friday. Nicklaus and 74 other golfers
had to complete their first round before immediately beginning the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of players were still on the course completing their
first round when the second round got underway, as players
scrambled to make up for lost time.
</P>
<P>
   When the fog finally lifted, sunshine and a brisk wind made the
course hard and fast. Scores skyrocketed for everyone except Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I was playing with a marble out on the pool table.
I couldn't keep anything on the green,'' Nicklaus said. ''If you're
not quite on your game, it eats you alive every time.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods teed off in the late afternoon, the greens
were like concrete. But that did little to faze Woods, who rolled
in an 18-foot par putt on No. 2 and a 20-foot birdie on the third
hole. Birdies followed on holes 6, 7, 11 and 12. Bogeys on Nos. 5
and 9 were his first of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Other golfers did not fare as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett made a brief run at the lead with birdies on four
of the first eight holes of his second round, moving to 5 under.
But he had two double-bogeys on the back nine, and ended the day at
1-under 141.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin, a senior tour star and the 1990 Open winner,
completed a first round of 68 Friday morning but shot 78 in the
second round for a 4-over 146 total.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greens. I'm not going to say they're impossible, but
they're close,'' Irwin said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman went eight straight holes with a bogey or worse in
the second round for an 82, and is almost certain to miss the cut
with a two-round total of 17-over 159.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 60, who won a duel with Arnold Palmer to capture the
1972 Open title at Pebble Beach and also won a U.S. Amateur
championship on this course, finished the first round at 2-over 73
but knew by the end of the second round that he was almost certain
to miss the cut.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the 18th hole, Nicklaus turned to his son and
caddy and decided to go out with a flourish by trying to reach the
545-yard hole in two shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turned to Jackie and I said, 'You know, I have not tried to
knock it on the green in over 20 years, so let's see if we can
knock it on in two today,''' Nicklaus said. ''And lo and behold, it
went on to the putting surface.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he ended up three-putting and settling for a par,
Nicklaus got a hero's welcome from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great run of tournaments since I was 17 years
old,'' Nicklaus said. ''It's been a long time and a lot of Opens,
and it's been great.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The regulars of the Senior PGA Tour
were holding their own with the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   All four -- Tom Watson, Hale Irwin, Dave Eichelberger and Tom
Kite -- were projected to make the cut after the second round was
completed Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Eichelberger, the defending U.S. Senior Open champion, rebounded
from an opening-round 78 to shoot a 2-under 69. It was one of only
four below-par scores among players who finished their rounds
before darkness postponed play Friday evening. The average score
for the day: 76.024.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's as good a round as I've played in a long, long time,''
Eichelberger, 56, said. ''Even when I won the Senior Open, I don't
think I played that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson had the best two-round score among the Seniors, a 3-over
145. Irwin, who briefly contended for the lead, was at 146 and Kite
149.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it shows the old boys can still do it,'' Eichelberger
said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, 55, had one of the most surprising scores of the first
round, a 3-under 68 that left him only three shots behind leader
Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin, who completed the round Friday morning after fog
halted play the previous day, had only a half-hour break before
going back to the first tee to start another 18 holes. It proved to
be too much for his back, already sore since he strained a ligament
at a Senior event in Atlanta last month.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin shot a 7-over 78 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more we stood around, the tighter it got,'' he said,
having spent nearly eight hours on the course. ''It was tight as a
drum. It showed on my shots. I didn't hit it very far.''
</P>
<P>
   The low point of the round was a double-bogey 6 at No. 16. Irwin
missed the fairway with a 4-wood off the tee and was forced to
pitch out from the high rough. He had an 8-iron to the green, but
came up short, forcing him to chip on for a 2-putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a quick double-bogey,'' Irwin said. ''I never really
felt like I hit a bad shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Irwin became the oldest player to win the Open,
beating Mike Donald in a playoff in Medinah, Ill. He won't be
breaking that record at Pebble Beach, but the old-timers have
nothing to be ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HANGING ON: Bobby Clampett slipped off his spikes before he
even got to the locker room, easing the pain from the blisters on
his heels. It was a hard day at the U.S. Open -- and he only played
16 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Clampett, the golfer-turned-broadcaster-turned-golfer, struggled
through a four-bogey, no-birdie round before darkness halted play
about 8:15 p.m. PDT. That left him 1-over par after an
opening-round 68.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult conditions,'' he said. ''The golf course
is beating you up right now. If you hit a good shot, it's par. If
you hit a bad shot, it's bogey.''
</P>
<P>
   Clampett blamed a faulty putter for his troubles. He hit the
first seven greens in regulation, but had only a bogey and six pars
to show for it. After that, the rest of his game began to suffer.
He finished up with a bogey at No. 16 after hitting his tee shot
behind a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, not a bad showing for a golfer who has played
only one tournament in two years, spending most of his time as a
broadcaster for CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still some things in my game that are a little
rusty,'' said Clampett, playing the Open for the first time in 14
years. ''You've got to expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   AMATEUR WOES: David Gossett came to the U.S. Open with more
confidence than one would expect from a 21-year-old collegian. Then
again, he won the U.S. Amateur championship last year on the same
course.
</P>
<P>
   But Pebble Beach proved to be a little tougher this time for the
University of Texas student.
</P>
<P>
   Gossett, low amateur at the Masters in April, couldn't get
anything going in his return trip to the northern California coast.
He finished with rounds of 78 and 77 for a 13-over total.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had so many positive memories from this place,'' he said.
''I played well here. I was comfortable here. So, yeah, I'm
disappointed. But golf is a fickle game, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing up his first round Friday morning, Gossett got a taste
of Pebble Beach's wicked side at the par-3 17th -- the same hole
where Tom Watson made his famous birdie from the rough in winning
the 1982 Open.
</P>
<P>
   Gossett needed four shots just to get on the green. His first
shot landed in the back rough off the tee, and his next shot found
a bunker on the right side. He blasted out of the sand to the first
cut of rough on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Gossett ditched his jacket, perhaps hoping that
would change his luck. He pitched within 5 feet of the flag and
made the putt for a double-bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since it's summer, I don't have to go back to classes,'' said
Gossett, who is majoring in communications. ''I'll spend some time
working on my game.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he has the memory of playing with Jack Nicklaus.
Gossett was pared with the Golden Bear for the final round at
Augusta, followed by the first two rounds of the Open. Next month,
he'll complete a remarkable year by playing the British Open at St.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   COSTON THE COMEDIAN: Jeff Coston, playing in the Open for the
first time since 1978, shot a 6-over 77 in the second round. At
least he could laugh about it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his 3-iron on the par-3 17th, he replied, ''I
hit a good one into the air. I was going to run under it. I thought
the infield fly rule was in effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old Coston, who shot a 70 in the first round, wasn't
done. Here's a sampling of his other comments:
</P>
<P>
   --''I don't know where I am. Somebody touch me and wake me up.''
</P>
<P>
   --''I don't see the ball as well (as 22 years ago). I went to my
optometrist to get that laser surgery and he said it's too late for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   --''I tried too hard, took too long and thought too much. Maybe I
needed a lobotomy.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PAULSON OUT: Dennis Paulson withdrew after the second round,
citing back and rib injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson came to the Open on a roll, having won his first PGA
Tour event the previous week in the Buick Classic. He beat David
Duval in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Paulson dropped out after rounds of 75 and 76 at Pebble
Beach, a 9-over score that was in danger of missing the cut anyway.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wearing all black and his signature Kangol
hat, Samuel L. Jackson was clearly the coolest cat on Hollywood
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 fans gathered curbside Friday to watch the ''Shaft''
star unveil his sidewalk star, the 2,195th dedicated along the
famous Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who woulda thunk it?'' Jackson asked. ''I remember coming here
in 1969 and looking at all the names on the boulevard. It never
came across my mind that I would be a part of this ever -- even if I
was in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 51, was surrounded by family members who also were in
town for his daughter's high school graduation. Friends at the
ceremony included William Friedkin, who directed Jackson in ''Rules
of Engagement,'' and Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's other movie credits include ''Pulp Fiction,'' ''A Time
to Kill'' and ''Star Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace.''
''Shaft'' opened nationwide Friday.

<HEADLINE> 1960s Band Gets Past Royalties  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Record producer Phil Spector was ordered to pay
$2.6 million in past royalties and interest to the Ronettes, a girl
group that he signed to a contract in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Paula Omansky found that Spector, who kept the rights to
all Ronettes recordings, made millions of dollars in ways not
authorized by the five-year contract, while paying the three women
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women testified that the only money they ever
received from Spector was a one-time payment of $14,482.30.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, issued Friday, the judge said the contract covers
only royalties on sales of phonograph records, but Spector sold the
recordings for use as background music in movies, videocassette
recordings, and advertising. For example, ''Be My Baby'' was used
with the opening credits of the movie ''Dirty Dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Spector also did not have authority to license
the group's master recordings to third parties for re-recording,
such as in ''oldies'' compilations that feature other artists.
</P>
<P>
   Spector's lawyer, Andrew Bart, did not return messages seeking
comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes -- sisters Veronica and Estelle Bennett and their
cousin Nedra Talley -- recorded 28 songs for Spector's Phillies
Records between 1963 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   They sued Spector 13 years ago, saying he had cheated them, and
the case went to trial in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Arrests in Yugoslavia Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDVA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Police here have arrested suspects they
say trailed a top opponent of Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic
out of Serbia and tried to gun him down in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Vuk Draskovic accused Milosevic on Friday of attempting to
''liquidate'' him after the attackers opened fire on him through
the window of his seaside home hours earlier. Draskovic was grazed
on his head by bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's deputy interior minister, Vuk Boskovic, said Friday
that suspects had been arrested in the attack, but refused to
identify them or say how many were in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Boskovic would not say who was responsible for the attack but
said the assailants ''followed Draskovic all the way from Serbia
with a murderous intention.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We arrested perpetrators of this crime,'' Boskovic said. ''We
seized their weapons. We arrested people who helped them and we
know who ordered the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack raised tensions between Montenegro and Serbia, which
together make up the Yugoslav federation. Montenegro pursues a
pro-Western policy under its president, Milo Djukanovic, who broke
with Milosevic two years ago. As a result, Montenegro has enjoyed
virtual independence from the Serb-led federal government in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, his head bandaged from his wounds, made clear who he
thought was responsible for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was definitely organized by Serbia's state security,''
Draskovic said. ''It is also definitely certain that another
decision on my liquidation could not have been reached without the
knowledge of those who run the country. And in this case, it is
Slobodan Milosevic and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no statement from the Yugoslav federal government. The
state-run Tanjug news agency, however, said Milosevic's allies in
Montenegro urged authorities to find the assailants ''to prevent
speculations and cheap political trickery.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic was alone watching television when the attackers
sprayed gunfire into his living room around midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old opposition firebrand usually has his own
security, but his four regular bodyguards were arrested by Serbian
police two weeks ago for illegal weapons possession. Draskovic's
wife Danica said her husband turned down an offer of protection by
Montenegrin police.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a monstrous conspiracy,'' Montenegro's police chief,
Vukasin Maras, said. He accused Belgrade of trying to export
''state terrorism'' to the maverick republic.
</P>
<P>
   The attack also drew international condemnation. The European
Union's foreign and security policy chief, Javier Solana, said it
''illustrates the sad state of political affairs'' in a country
''where the use of brute force'' has become a standard method for
''settling political differences.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Draskovic, Russia's foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, also condemned the ''terrorist attack'' which he said
''threatens the process of democratization in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest in a series of attacks against
prominent figures in Yugoslavia. In one of the attacks, Goran
Zugic, the Montenegrin president's national security adviser, was
gunned down in front of his home in Podgorica on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic survived a road accident in October in which three
party associates, including his brother-in-law, were killed.
Draskovic suffered only minor injuries but called the incident -- a
head-on collision with a truck which swerved off its lane -- an
assassination attempt and blamed Milosevic.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Holding Hostages Reach Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages in
the southern Philippines agreed Saturday to deal with a negotiator
they had earlier denounced, rekindling hopes of progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels had refused to work with chief government
negotiator Robert Aventajado because they believed he favored a
military operation to free the captives, most of whom are foreign.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement brought by their emissary to Manila, rebel
leaders said Aventajado ''may continue with his role as
(government) chief negotiator'' for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Aventajado said the rebel emissary was in a meeting
with the chief negotiator Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this statement from the Abu Sayyaf, everything will be
set next week for the resumption of the talks,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels seized three Germans, two French, two Finns, two
South Africans, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos on
April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort and brought them to Jolo,
an island at the southern tip of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the rebels separated the hostages into two groups
because of fears of a possible military rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they would no longer talk with Aventajado after
he suggested the government might consider such a rescue if
negotiations over the release of the hostages break down.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf has warned that the lives of the hostages ''will
be exposed to extreme risks'' if a rescue operation was launched.
</P>
<P>
   Aventajado claimed his comment was taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf is the smaller but more extreme of two rebel
groups fighting for an independent Islamic state in the
impoverished southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of talks last week, the rebels refused to abandon
their demand for an independent nation. The government has
repeatedly ruled out any breakup of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are also demanding the protection of traditional
fishing grounds from large trawlers, many of which are
foreign-owned, and the formation of a commission to examine the
problems of Filipino Muslims living in neighboring Malaysia. They
are also expected to demand a large ransom at a later time.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Firefighters Making Progress  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GUTTERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAILEY, Colo. (AP) -- With another cold, damp day in the forecast
Saturday, firefighters in the Colorado foothills were working
furiously to hem in two wildfires that blackened more than 20,000
acres in a five-day rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Jubilant residents were allowed back into their homes east of
Rocky Mountain National Park. ''I not only kissed the ground, but I
think I ate some ashes,'' said Tom Larrance.
</P>
<P>
   Rain, snow and temperatures in the 30s helped keep flames at bay
Friday while crews quickly cut fire lines around the perimeter of
the blazes. By the end of the day, both fires were 50 percent
contained.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not dead,'' warned Mike Reasor, a spokesman for the team
managing one of the fires. ''It has the potential to get up and go
again if we don't take advantage of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunny weather was expected to return Sunday, increasing the risk
that the fires could roar back to life. ''It's going to be warming
up and it's going to drying out,'' said Mike Chamberlain, a
meteorologist with the management team.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also identified a suspect who may have started the
fire while camping in the area. They said the 33-year-old Loveland
resident, Kenny Winchester, has retained a lawyer and refused to
talk with sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Both fires started Monday and spread quickly, propelled by hot,
dry winds. At least 39 homes were destroyed and more than 400
people were forced to flee. All were allowed to go home by Friday
except for 35 families in the Bailey area, southwest of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to have everybody home,'' said Kevin Corbett, who
had stayed behind to guard against looters while his wife and her
son evacuated their house in Conifer. ''These last few days have
been a little like house arrest. It's great to get the neighborhood
back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire managers estimated the cost of fighting both blazes had
climbed to more than $3.8 million. Nearly 1,900 firefighters were
on the scene by week's end, and helicopters and tanker planes had
made scores of runs to drop water and fire-retardant slurry.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes are the latest in what is shaping up as the nation's
worst fire season since 1996. The National Interagency Fire Center
in Idaho reported that more than 45,000 fires this season have
burned 1.2 million acres.

<HEADLINE> 'Perfect Storm' Schooner Docks  </HEADLINE>
By MARYCLAIRE DALE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Willi Bank won't have to see the upcoming
film adaptation of Sebastian Junger's book ''The Perfect Storm'' to
learn what happens.
</P>
<P>
   He lived it.
</P>
<P>
   Bank was an engineer on the historic schooner Ernestina when it
set sail from New England to Bermuda in October 1991 and got caught
in rough seas when an Atlantic hurricane met with a second storm
charging south from Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   The collision created what mariners dubbed ''The Halloween
Storm,'' what lay people called ''the storm of the century,'' and
what Junger made famous in his novel as ''The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were running away from Hurricane Grace,'' recalled Bank,
36. ''When things got better there, we were told about the other
storm. I said, 'What do you mean there's a more severe storm out
there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Junger's book describes how the fishing vessel Andrea Gail
vanished while battling that second storm after setting sail from
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Today the Ernestina -- as it was in nine years ago -- is a
floating classroom that allows students a chance to experience life
on a turn-of-the-century vessel. It sailed into Penn's Landing on
Friday, and will be open to the public over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The 106-year-old schooner began its days as a fishing vessel,
has braved 20 expeditions to the Antarctic, and at one time carried
load after load of hopeful immigrants to the United States from
Cape Verde, Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It made it through the Halloween Storm, but not before some
tense moments at sea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were in terrific seas, but nothing as bad as the people who
perished,'' said Willi Bank's 65-year-old father, William, a
neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania who served as the
ship doctor on the 1991 voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The storm set in three days after the 24 students and crew of 10
left the Ernestina's home port in New Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of passing quickly, it stalled for several days, leaving
the crew to work around the clock to try to save the ship.
</P>
<P>
   While they initially used their 8,323 square-feet of sails to
run ahead of the storm, when the winds died down, they turned to
the ship's 6-cylinder engine, only to find it flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Huge swells had caused water to back up in the exhaust system.
Willi Bank spent 2&AMP;frac12; days below deck, taking the engine apart and
getting it running again.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the physical labor and emotional strain, the worst part
of the trip was listening by radio as two other boats -- including
another century-old schooner, the Anna Christina -- went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew people on board. The captain had sailed as a mate on
the Ernestina,'' said Gregg Swanzey, 47, then the Ernestina's
captain. ''All we could do was just listen. It was awful to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard was able to pick up the passengers of those
vessels before they sank. The Andrea Gail, meanwhile, was lost, its
six crew members never heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was just the latest adventure for the Ernestina, which
by 1991 had survived several groundings in the Antarctic and a fire
in a New York harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The Cape Verde government gave the boat to the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts in 1982 to thank the United States for helping it
gain independence from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The schooner was named a National Historic Landmark in 1990.
Today, the state of Massachusetts runs educational programs aboard
and welcomes visitors at its home port or at ports around the
country where it docks.
</P>
<P>
   The stately vessel is 114 feet long, with a majestic
76-foot-high Douglas fir main mast and a 74-foot foremast. It takes
20 people to raise the main sail.
</P>
<P>
   While the crew uses computers for forecasting and
communications, the living conditions have changed little from the
19th century -- no running water or air conditioning, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Willi Bank is now the ship's captain, though he hasn't faced
many days like he did as the engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some days are pretty long, but the sailing is wonderful,'' he
said. ''The students, no matter what the weather, always come away
with a novel experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Perfect Storm,'' which stars George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg
and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, opens June 30.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Focuses on Fathers  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The one in three American children who live
without their fathers should not have to suffer financially or
emotionally, President Clinton said Saturday in releasing a report
that offers ways to help fathers get more involved in their child's
schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Education and Health and Human Services
departments gives teachers and those who care for youngsters
information on the best ways to help fathers have a strong role in
their children's education. And it highlights model programs and
provides information on resources available.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers report that a father's involvement during infancy
and the early years not only contributes to a child's emotional
security, but helps them solve math problems and develop verbal
skills, Clinton said in his weekly radio address, marking Father's
Day on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''One study showed that the chances of a child getting mostly
A's increased by over 40 percent in two-parent families where the
father was highly involved,'' Clinton said. ''Even in families
where the father isn't living with his child, but remains actively
involved, those odds of getting A's increased by a full third.''
</P>
<P>
   In his radio message, which he taped Friday in New York where he
visited two schools, the president noted that child support
collections have increased 10 percent during the past year,
reaching a record of nearly $16 billion -- double the $8 billion
collected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used his address to criticize the House for passing
a spending bill last week that fails to include his $255 million
fatherhood initiative. It aims to help at least 40,000 low-income
noncustodial parents -- primarily fathers -- find work, meet support
payments and re-establish relationships with their children.
</P>
<P>
   It would allow states to simplify child support and distribution
rules, give incentives to states that pass more child support
payments directly to families and help noncustodial parents move
into jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, many fathers can't provide financial and
emotional support to their children, not because they're deadbeat,
but because they're dead broke,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the president's concerns, Massachusetts Gov. Paul
Cellucci noted in the weekly Republican radio address that children
without fathers living at home are five times more likely to grow
up poor and twice as likely to drop out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenges confronted by fathers today are greater than
any time in our past, and more important than ever to future
generations,'' Cellucci said. ''I urge every father across this
great land to take an active role in their children's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also put in a plug for pro-family initiatives that his
fellow GOP governors, including presidential candidate George W.
Bush of Texas, have instituted in their states.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party members say they're for real, experts say not yet  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - It had all the trappings of a political
convention: sign waving, slogan shouting and speech making.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to cast votes, party organizers passed
around cardboard boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The left side of the room got one with a handwritten sign taped
to it; those on the right made do with one from an office supply
store.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Reform Party's state convention, where
conventioneers were as likely to stumble past community college
students in the hallway as they would their candidates for
president or U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Reform Party claim it is just as viable as the
two major political organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Forget tales of infighting and images of fringe candidates. If
New Jersey voters could hear the party's message, they would
respond by putting Reform candidates in office, said party
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a small party, no doubt about it, but we're going to
build it,'' said Joe Sansone. ''I think the Reform Party is
becoming America's party.''
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party activists point to New Jersey's significant share
of registered Independent voters. And they highlight Libertarian
Murray Sabrin's 1997 run for governor where his 6 percent of the
vote made him eligible for public campaign funding.
</P>
<P>
   But others say independent or third parties like the Reform
Party clearly are steps behind Republicans and Democrats. Political
analysts contend that it is more than just a gap in funding or
organization. Many third party candidates and their messages lack
credibility, analysts charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sansone was approved as state chairman for the
party that formed after Ross Perot's failed presidential campaigns.
Sansone now heads New Jersey's organization working to elect
Patrick Buchanan president.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, the conservative talk show host, joins Pat DiNizio,
the singer who put rock band The Smithereens on hold to run for
U.S. Senate, at the top of the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say the enthusiasm exhibited at the state convention
proves theirs is a burgeoning movement.
</P>
<P>
   If a member of a traditional party had that kind of energy
before the Iowa presidential caucus, the national media would
consider that candidate a contender, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're seeing the kind of energy and excitement that you would
see in the Iowa Caucus about a month out,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   DiNizio said he was encouraged not only by the enthusiasm, but
the commitment by such a wide range of people.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the passion. I find it remarkable that so many people
would be here at this time of day,'' DiNizio said after the
Wednesday afternoon convention at Raritan Valley Community College.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party allows people the option of not just another
candidate, but the chance to be come involved in the process,
DiNizio said. And it is not dedicated to a single special interest
or fringe group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe the Reform Party is such a party,'' DiNizio
said. ''I think it is a real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Logue said he is a party activist because he agrees with the
Reform Party's opposition to international trade treaties, strict
gun control and its support of strong border defense. And the party
is attracting more and more people put off by major parties and
their candidates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have centrists. We have former Republicans and former
Democrats. It is a party that brings all sides in,'' Logue said.
</P>
<P>
   These nontraditional parties all hope to collect at least the
roughly 15 percent of the vote that usually goes to independent
candidates, said Ingrid Reed, the director of the Eagleton
Institute's New Jersey Project.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to me you have the potential of voters' paying
attention. Then the question is the candidate's credibility, is the
message credible,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is really hard to know where a third party can go,
because you do have this new complication of what message the
candidate sends. It's hard to tell if they're credible, or the
credibility of the message,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Reform Party candidate might win in New Jersey, Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's still a stretch,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   More likely a strong independent candidate would pull voters
from a major candidate and skew the election, Reed explained.
</P>
<P>
   ''If an election is close, as they are in New Jersey, a strong
third-party candidate can do that,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> 'Shaft' Star Unveils Sidewalk Star  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wearing all black and his signature Kangol
hat, Samuel L. Jackson was clearly the coolest cat on Hollywood
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 fans gathered curbside Friday to watch the ''Shaft''
star unveil his sidewalk star, the 2,195th dedicated along the
famous Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who woulda thunk it?'' Jackson asked. ''I remember coming here
in 1969 and looking at all the names on the boulevard. It never
came across my mind that I would be a part of this ever -- even if I
was in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 51, was surrounded by family members who also were in
town for his daughter's high school graduation. Friends at the
ceremony included William Friedkin, who directed Jackson in ''Rules
of Engagement,'' and Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's other movie credits include ''Pulp Fiction,'' ''A Time
to Kill'' and ''Star Wars: Episode One -- The Phantom Menace.''
''Shaft'' opened nationwide Friday.

<HEADLINE> Activisits: Regis in Sweatshop Flap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- First it was Kathie Lee Gifford and sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Now labor activists have accused her morning show co-host Regis
Philbin of attaching his name to a clothing line made by a company
with a history of production at abusive foreign factories.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin appeared at Macy's earlier this week to introduce a
shirt and tie line called ''Regis by the Van Heusen Company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, members of the UNITE garment workers' union
demonstrated inside Macy's near a display of the cotton shirt and
satin tie ensembles that have become Philbin's trademark attire on
his quiz show, ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're giving him a chance not to put his name on clothing made
by a company with ties to labor abuses,'' said UNITE spokeswoman
Jo-Ann Mort.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Phillips-Van Heusen offices in New York was not
returned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company was named in a class-action lawsuit
claiming that workers on the Pacific island of Saipan worked in
sweatshop conditions. Phillips-Van Heusen, and other garment
makers, promised to establish a fund to finance an independent
monitoring program and provide money to the workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, in response to accusations that her clothing line is
produced in sweatshops, has hired monitors and joined a national
task force that acts as a watchdog for labor conditions.

<HEADLINE> Singer Surrenders on Drug Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Christian music singer Michael English
surrendered to authorities on drug charges Friday, three days after
he was indicted, and was immediately released on bond.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old singer is facing 12 counts of fraudulently
obtaining the prescription drug hydrocodone, a sedative similar to

   Police raided English's Nashville apartment in February after an
investigation showed he and a friend were having numerous
prescriptions filled by doctors.

<HEADLINE> Buffalo regains crown as upstate New York's No. 1 job hub  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - After a one-month hiatus, a hiring surge
moved Buffalo back ahead of Rochester as the biggest job hub in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the two-county Buffalo region registered a record
564,100 jobs, 1,600 more than the tally in the six-county Rochester
region, the state Labor Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Rochester overtook Buffalo as the No. 1 employment center for
the first time in April, but Buffalo bounced back last month with a
seasonal surge in hiring at construction and service companies.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent, its lowest
level in May in at least 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's employment count has stagnated in the last decade
while Rochester's has surged. The upstate labor market is dwarfed
by the New York metropolitan region's 4.2 million jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department includes Monroe, Wayne, Ontario,
Livingston, Genesee and Orleans counties in the Rochester region
and Erie and Niagara counties in the Buffalo region.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffalo region's population stands at around 1.2 million,
about 100,000 more people than live in the Rochester area.

<HEADLINE> AP on TV: Animal Planet  </HEADLINE>
By BRIDGET RNE
For The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Need an adrenaline rush? Want to laugh? Feel
like a good cry? ''Animal Planet'' -- that all-animals-all-the-time
cable channel -- is fulfilling the emotional needs of an increasing
number of human viewers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the A.C. Nielsen Co., the Discovery Channel spinoff
is growing faster than any other cable outlet. Launched in October
1996, Animal Planet now attracts over 60 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Around-the-clock viewers of all ages obsess over creatures great
and small, from tough old crocs with very sharp teeth to precious
little pussycats with bruised paws.
</P>
<P>
   ''It allows for the full emotional range ... but it also speaks
to the head as well as to the heart,'' says Clark Bunting,
executive vice president and general manager of the Bethesda,
Md.-based Animal Planet.
</P>
<P>
   Bunting says the channel is committed to offering shows that are
entertaining and educational, but also safe for the whole family to
watch -- no less a challenge in the animal kingdom than it is with
people programming.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, sex and violence can be issues for even Animal Planet, and
Bunting says it all ''boils down to common sense and good
judgment'' when deciding how much of the wild world to show, how
much fur to let fly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids watching need to know that animals kill, die and have
sex,'' said Bunting. ''It's part of the natural order ... but we
never hold shots gratuitously or for shock value.''
</P>
<P>
   Family values haven't taken any bite out of the network's
super-popular ''Crocodile Hunter,'' which has made international
stars out of critter-chasing Australian Steve Irwin and his
American wife, Terri.
</P>
<P>
   The show's second annual ''Croc Week'' begins Sunday (June 18)
at 8 p.m. Eastern, including the harrowing new episodes ''Spitting
Cobras,'' ''Crocs of the Revolution'' and ''Dangerous Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   All feature Irwin in seemingly imminent danger of being -- as he
says in the autobiographical ''Steve's Story'' episode -- ''gored,
clawed, chomped, bitten, savaged, jumped on, whacked, peed on and
even groped'' by a variety of creatures most people would run a
mile from.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Steve, Terri and top croc Agro will be available as action
figures, with built-in audio of such Steve lingo as ''By crikey''
and ''What a ripper.'' Toys, games, Web site linkage and plans for
a theme park are all part of ''Animal Planet's'' continued
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of being a doll is ''mind-boggling,'' said Terri by
phone from the couple's zoo in Queensland. But she believes Steve,
who was off in the bush at the time getting footage of rare birds,
is ''a real-life action hero, totally, passionately, devoted to
saving wildlife, and people respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri suggested that another reason for Animal Planet's
popularity is the correlation between animal and human behavior
which, for example, might attract ''ER'' lovers to the channel's
''Emergency Vets.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've not had a scientific approach to animals myself,'' Terri
said. ''I'm much more anthropomorphic. I believe they feel
happiness, sadness, all the emotions like we do, and I think more
and more people are coming to that belief.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stainton, producer of Irwin's series, says Irwin's
''wonderful sense of story telling,'' attracts audiences who might
otherwise be watching sports or surfing the Net. He stresses that
although Irwin ''has no fear,'' care is taken to include messages
about appropriate behavior around wild animals, as in don't try
this at home.
</P>
<P>
   While some conservationists may have reservations about
''Crocodile Hunter'' or some of the dumbed-down aspects of ''Animal
Planet,'' they also acknowledge the channel's plus side.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is something good to be said about anything which
provides people with the knowledge that there are other animals
beside themselves on this planet,'' says John Lukas, director of
the White Oak Plantation Conservation Center, in Yulee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't please everyone 100 percent, but very early on we
established relationships with humane societies, wildlife funds and
conservationists,'' says Bunting. He cited the ''Animal Planet
Rescue'' vehicle, which has provided animal aid during such
disasters as the 1998 Florida wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Irwins, other human celebrities home grown on
''Animal Planet'' include Dr. Robert Taylor and the other
caregivers of ''Emergency Vets,'' who combine the gurney-racing
treatment for ailing animals with comfort and compassion for people
whose pets don't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, co-founder of Denver's Alameda East hospital, where the
heart-tugging series is shot, has a simple explanation for the
network's success: ''People just love animals, and that feeling
seems to be growing, and 'Animal Planet' just got in touch with
that feeling at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, ''Animal Planet'' filled many hours with old
episodes of ''Lassie'' and recycled documentaries. Now, almost 80
percent of its programming is original. In addition to ''Crocodile
Hunter'' and ''Emergency Vets,'' the lineup includes the game show
''You Lie Like a Dog,'' ''Planet's Funniest Animals,'' ''The Ape
Crusaders,'' ''Animal Court'' and the fictional series ''Call of
the Wild,'' based on the Jack London novel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Call of the Wild'' has made a star out of Kavic, a 140-pound
Malamute-timber wolf mix.
</P>
<P>
   ''He gets more fan mail than I do,'' admits Shane Meier, who
stars as Miles Challenger, Buck's owner. ''He can really act.''

<HEADLINE> Ambiguity May Slow Korean Summit  </HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Earlier this year, President Kim
Dae-jung perplexed and even offended some South Koreans when he
praised North Korean ruler Kim Jong Il as pragmatic. Now, in the
wake of an inter-Korean summit, the North Korean is the toast of
many in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The huge swing in perceptions toward North Korea owes much to
the grace and respect that Kim Jong Il lavished on his South Korean
visitor last week, and less to the content of their agreement to
seek reconciliation and eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators are now taking a hard look at the broadly worded
deal, which makes only modest advances on similar agreements that
were reached in 1972 and 1991 among lower-ranking officials of the
Koreas. The Cold War standoff on their divided peninsula has lasted
since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   There are plentiful indications that the warming of ties this
time could be more substantive than previous ill-fated
rapprochements, though uncertainty over whether North Korea will
fulfill all its pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spent a lot of time trying to convince the North Koreans
that this time we have to implement the deal that we have agreed
on,'' Park Joon-young, the South Korean president's chief
spokesman, said Saturday at the Foreign Correspondents' Club in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Park stressed, however, that the summit was a success because
South Korean officials weren't even sure if they would come away
with an agreement. And the fact that the leaders of the two Koreas
were meeting for the first time was historic.
</P>
<P>
   In one encouraging sign, the North proposed Saturday that Red
Cross officials from both sides meet this month to discuss the
reunion of separated families.
</P>
<P>
   North and South Korea have also stopped propaganda broadcasts
across the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ along the sealed, heavily
fortified border. On Friday, North Korea quickly returned a South
Korean fishing boat that had drifted into North Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
   But such gestures are relatively easy to implement, and
solutions to the larger issues such as the U.S. military presence
in South Korea and reunification would have to overcome the barrier
of decades of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   During his talk with Kim Jong Il, Kim Dae-jung explained in
detail why a continued U.S. military presence in South Korea was
necessary for regional security, the president's office said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the North on Saturday reiterated an old view that the
United States was an obstacle to Korean peace, an argument that it
has often employed in an attempt to split the Seoul-Washington
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea should be
the first step to be taken by the U.S. to help the Koreans achieve
the reunification of Korea,'' the North's foreign news outlet,
KCNA, quoted the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dae-jung said he and Kim Jong Il had roughly similar ideas
on reunification, approving a transitional stage involving two
separate governments linked by inter-Korean councils. However, he
did not provide specifics and most experts agree that reunification
will require years or even decades of confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean president said he raised concerns about the
North's nuclear and missile programs with Kim Jong Il, but he did
not say how the North Korean responded. There was no mention of
those issues in the accord that they signed June 14.
</P>
<P>
   On his triumphant return to Seoul, Kim Dae-jung said the danger
of war on the Korean peninsula was over. However, in a meeting
Saturday, South Korea's main opposition leader Lee Hoi-chang urged
Kim to remind his people that the North's arsenal was as dangerous
as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have also accused Seoul of being too soft on Pyongyang
by agreeing to the repatriation of former communist prisoners in
exchange for reunions of separated families. The deal does not
refer to the many abducted Southern fishermen and prisoners of war
from the Korean War believed held in the North.
</P>
<P>
   There are also fears that South Korea, eager to woo North Korea,
will grant it more economic aid without rigorously seeking
conciliatory gestures in return. Desperation for aid is believed to
be a primary motive for the impoverished North's agreement to host
the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''One cannot be sure that the North is not just putting on a
show for the sake of practical advantage,'' the Chosun Ilbo, South
Korea's most influential newspaper, said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   The South is so jittery about offending the proud North that
even semantic nuances are crucial. Park, the presidential
spokesman, urged reporters to refer to ''economic cooperation,''
instead of ''economic aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is certainly an appropriate term since the South's
economy is at least 20 times larger than that of the North, and the
South has offered to rebuild Northern roads, railways and other
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential loophole is the phrase stipulating that Kim
Jong Il will visit Seoul for another summit ''at an appropriate
time.'' The North Korean leader could use the vagueness of the
expression as leverage to win concessions in exchange for his
visit.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Colombia Spending  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under Pentagon pressure, congressional leaders
want to revive and pass this month a stalled multibillion-dollar
spending package for Colombia, U.S. peacekeepers in Kosovo and
domestic disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved a $13 billion measure two months ago. It has
languished in the Senate because of Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., who said the bill was expensive and too time-consuming.
The needs could be still be met, he argued, if Congress instead
included the money in regular spending bills and passed them
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lott and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., would like
to send the money, in a still undetermined amount, to President
Clinton by June 30, when lawmakers are to begin a weeklong Fourth
of July recess, say congressional aides from both parties, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   June 30 also is the day before the Army says it will have to
start curtailing minor construction, civilian hiring and other
activities unless it receives $1.5 billion the bill contains.
Republicans do not want such cutbacks blamed on them, particularly
in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   A message Army headquarters recently sent field commanders
demanded details on how they would save 8 percent of their budgets
beginning July 1 if Congress did not quickly provide the money.
Besides construction and hiring reductions, the letter suggested
supply and maintenance cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Military prudence dictates we must plan now for the worst
case,'' in which the money would not be provided until later this
year, the message said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been pressuring GOP leaders for weeks to
act on the bill. Clinton said this month it is needed for
''pressing national needs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an encouraging sign that, after many months, they now
finally appear to be ready to make progress on these essential
needs,'' White House budget office spokeswoman Linda Ricci said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said Friday the bill would be
addressed ''sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Clinton administration's actions, which have required a
depletion in the Pentagon's budget, concern us greatly, and that's
why Congress, like every year, will address the shortfall,''
Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki's reference was to Clinton's deployment of 5,900 U.S.
troops to serve as peacekeepers in Kosovo, an action Congress never
formally approved.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton requested $5.2 billion at the beginning of this year, an
amount that grew to $5.5 billion. Most is for helping fight drug
producers in Colombia, which supplies most of the cocaine used in
the United States; U.S. troops in Kosovo; and the costs of
disasters including last September's Hurricane Floyd, which
walloped North Carolina and other Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved its $13 billion version of the bill on March
30, pumping up the money Clinton sought for the Pentagon and
domestic natural disasters and other projects at home.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he supported the money for Colombia, Kosovo and
disasters, but said the measure was too costly and would take too
much of the Senate's time.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said the Senate would take pieces of the bill -- but
not all of it -- and add them to several regular spending bills for
fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved three bills last
month that include almost $9 billion for Kosovo, Colombia and
disasters. Little has happened since.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Senate plans to debate one of those bills Tuesday, a
$13.4 billion foreign aid bill containing $934 million for
Colombia. The money is for training Colombian troops, buying
helicopters and other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia money is expected to be challenged both by
Democrats who would rather see the money spent domestically to
prevent drug use and Republicans reluctant to get involved in a
South American civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the aid is expected to survive. It may be combined
eventually with the money for Kosovo and disasters and placed on a
routine military construction bill, which would be likely to move
quickly through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The aid package also is expected to carry money for New Mexico
to rebuild from its recent wildfires. The price tag for that is not
yet known.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea Leader Motives Analyzed  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The pictures were compelling: The wide smiles,
the intense jocularity, the let's-bury-the-hatchet demeanor. But
did Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, really mean it?
</P>
<P>
   Among Korea watchers in the United States, hope is mixed with a
strong dose of skepticism that North Korea, virtually overnight,
could turn its back on 50 years of hostility toward its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., an experienced Asia hand,
agrees that Kim's summit meeting this past week with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung was an extraordinary development.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ''There is ample reason to be very cautious
about the lions having laid down with the lambs.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Peter Brooke, East Asia expert on the House International
Relations Committee staff, ''I don't think Kim Jong Il has
undergone an epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Eberstat of the American Enterprise Institute has his
qualms as well while acknowledging it was refreshing to hear North
Korea refer to the head of South Korea as ''president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They always maintained that South Korea was a monster with no
legitimate right to exist,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other analysts, Eberstat worries about whether Kim Jong
Il plans to carry out his promises to work toward peaceful
reunification with the South and toward reuniting long-divided
families.
</P>
<P>
   He said Kim Jong Il may have been at his wily best at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   ''A shaky North Korean system has just negotiated a huge
infusion of foreign aid without making any concessions on nuclear
issues,'' Eberstat said, alluding to the $450 million Seoul has
budgeted this year in assistance to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   William Drennan, a Korea expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace,
said it is hard to reconcile Kim Jong Il's charm offensive at the
Pyongyang summit with what Drennan describes as the leader's
disreputable past.
</P>
<P>
   Drennan and other experts cited strong evidence of Kim Jong Il's
role as the mastermind of a terrorist bombing of a South Korean
passenger plane that killed 115 people when it crashed off the
Myanmar coast on Nov. 29, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea long has held the North Korean leader, then in a
subordinate position, responsible for the attack but has muted that
issue as part of Kim Dae-jung's efforts at accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Drennan also cited other aspects of Kim Jong Il's rule, carried
over from the era of his late father and longtime North Korean
leader, President Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that North Korean diplomats routinely have been caught
selling illicit drugs and contraband cigarettes and trading in
counterfeit money. At home, Kim Jong Il presides over what is
widely regarded as one of world's most repressive and economically
deprived states.
</P>
<P>
   Solarz has a sense of deja vu about the agreements signed last
week. He recalled the high hopes generated on Dec. 13, 1991, when
the two sides signed an ''Agreement on Reconciliation,
Nonaggression and Exchanges and Cooperation Between the South and
the North.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreements were never implemented ''because of the
recalcitrance and intransigence of Pyongyang.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agreements contemplate far more people-to-people
contacts between South and North, and Solarz again wonders what
Pyongyang is up to.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that thousands of South Koreans visit the North's most
spectacular tourist site, Diamond Mountain, each year but under
conditions imposed by the North that preclude any contact with
ordinary North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   ''One has to wonder whether they are really prepared to do an
about-face,'' Solarz said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials harbor similar reservations about North
Korea's willingness to fulfill its promises but have been generally
upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today is a new day of hope for the future of the Korean
Peninsula,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Thursday.
''The historic summit between the leaders of South and North Korea
represents a bold step toward resolving a half-century of conflict
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of building on momentum generated at the summit, the
administration is expected to implement on Monday measures that
will ease 50 years of economic sanctions against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced the policy in September. The
administration has delayed the required follow-up action, pending a
demonstration of good will by the North. Kim Jong Il satisfied that
condition last week at the summit.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rulings Awaited  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court soon will end its 1999-2000
term with a flurry of rulings sure to have a profound effect on
American life in cases covering abortion, school prayer, gays in
the Boy Scouts and police Miranda warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday and within the next two weeks, the court also is
expected to rule on government help for parochial schools,
free-speech rights of abortion protesters and how states conduct
primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Announcement of just a dozen decisions stand between the
justices and the three-month summer recess they are expected to
begin by June 28. Among them could be rulings that bring dramatic
changes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   In its first ruling on abortion since 1992, the court is
expected to say whether Nebraska can ban a surgical procedure
opponents call ''partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the decision says, it is sure to escalate the
decades-old nationwide political war over the legality and morality
of abortion. More immediately, the decision might also control the
fate of similar laws in 29 other states.
</P>
<P>
   School prayer has bedeviled the court for 40 years, and the
justices now are to decide in a Texas case whether public school
districts can let students lead stadium crowds in prayer before
high school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is certain to be scrutinized to determine whether the
court strongly reaffirms or retreats from a landmark 1962 decision
that outlawed organized, officially sponsored prayer in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   On a docket extraordinarily full of emotion-packed cases, none
has proved more evocative than a New Jersey gay rights dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The justices must decide whether the Boy Scouts can bar
homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. The decision also may
answer whether boys who say they are gay can be banned as well.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no Supreme Court decision is as well-known as one called
Miranda vs. Arizona, in which the court said police must warn
criminal suspects of their ''right to remain silent'' when
questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Now the court is considering, in a case from Maryland, whether
it should dismantle that 1966 landmark and scuttle the warnings
made familiar to generations of Americans by movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   A church-state dispute from Louisiana asks the court to decide
whether taxpayer money can be used to buy computers and other
instructional materials for religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Its ruling will affect federal efforts to connect every American
classroom with the Internet and also could carry significance for
the politically charged legal fights over tuition vouchers -- help
for families who send their children to religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   The court is deciding in a California case whether states
violate political parties' free-association rights when they allow
primary election voters to cast their ballot for any candidate
regardless of affiliation.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollas Threaten To Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas who have fought
Israeli forces in southern Lebanon for 18 years warned Saturday
that they will resume attacks if Israel does not give up tracts of
land claimed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''All violations should be dealt with; ... otherwise we consider
the mission of liberating Lebanese territory to be incomplete and
resistance remains our choice to liberate the last inch of our
occupied land,'' Hezbollah said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came a day after U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, scheduled Monday to visit Lebanon as part of a Middle East
tour, confirmed Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon ''in full
compliance'' with Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Friday rejected the United Nations'
verification of Israel's May 24 withdrawal, saying Israeli forces
still controlled some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hoss renewed Lebanon's commitment to cooperate with
the United Nations ''to the extreme.'' But he added that Lebanon
''insists on recovering every inch of its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Hezbollah described Annan's announcement as
''unrealistic and premature,'' saying it favored Israel. ''We
regret that the United Nations has become a cover for the
continuation of the Zionists' occupation of parts of Lebanese
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and Hezbollah's rejection of the U.N. withdrawal
verification prolongs the risk of renewed cross-border fighting and
is likely to delay the deployment of Lebanese army troops in
southern Lebanon, where the anti-Israel guerrillas are the de facto
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Annan's formal declaration of the withdrawal
paves the way for the 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Lebanon to deploy to the Lebanese-Israeli border and help the
Lebanese government reassert its authority in the vacated
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said Saturday that no
peacekeepers will be deployed before matters are sorted out with
the Lebanese government, possibly during talks Monday with Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said all along that Lebanese consent is a
prerequisite of U.N. deployment in any place in the country. After
all, the peacekeeping force is subject to their sovereignty,'' he
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that Lebanese officers working with a
U.N. inspection team found that Israeli troops still manned several
positions inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The new border line was drawn by U.N. cartographers according to
the 1923 line fixed by colonial France and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Syrians Seek Progress With Bashar  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR
<TEXT>
<P>
   QARDAHA, Syria (AP) -- From the picturesque village of the late
President Hafez Assad to Syria's desert villages to Damascus' old
souks, Syrians are putting together a wish list for Bashar Assad,
the man all but certain to succeed his father as the country's
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like him to bring us the Internet,'' said Abeer Ismail, a
25-year-old nurse in Qardaha who has taken a computer course in
hopes of a better-paid job. ''Then I'll skimp on makeup and clothes
to save for a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want feed for my 200 goats and running water at home,'' said
Hashem al-Ghazi, 62, at the desert village of El-Bureij, where
water has been cut for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Less bureaucracy, fewer import-export forms to fill out,''
said Mahmoud al-Qadmani, 32, who runs a textile shop in Damascus'
Hamidiyyeh souk.
</P>
<P>
   The wishes are not new. Syrians for years have hoped for a more
dynamic economy, more job opportunities, higher incomes and access
to the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
   But many believe their long-deferred dreams are closer to being
realized because they see Bashar Assad, a 34-year-old eye doctor,
as a young leader better able to understand their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's ruling Baath Party opened its first conference in 15
years Saturday to elect Bashar Assad party leader and declare his
candidacy for president, putting him closer to succeeding his
father. Assad's formal election is not expected to be held before
the traditional 40-day mourning period ends July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Syria already has come a long way from the 1960s, when the
government adopted an economy based on a staid socialist system and
nationalized all large industries, including banks and public
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Hafez Assad began allowing private investment in
agriculture and industry. Then in May 1991, parliament passed what
has become Syria's economic mantra, Law No. 10 -- designed to
attract investment by giving tax holidays of up to nine years,
customs exemptions on machinery and the right to repatriate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   With the adoption of the law, Syria's socialist identity began
to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   The days when getting a bag of bread meant standing in line for
hours are gone. CDs are more prevalent. Mobile phones and credit
cards are slowly becoming part of life. Even satellite dishes,
which still are not legal, sit on balconies next to flower pots.
</P>
<P>
   Modernizing has been slow, however, hampered by antiquated trade
and banking laws and red tape. This has dampened the excitement of
investors who rushed to put their money into projects soon after
Law No. 10 was enacted. That, coupled with low oil prices before
last year, has slowed annual economic growth to less than 3 percent
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Change hasn't reached all aspects of Syrian life.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are available in shops, and a quasi-governmental
Syrian Computer Society trains ordinary Syrians in computer skills
and runs computer labs for the public in villages and urban
centers. But Internet access is limited to government offices and
the elite.
</P>
<P>
   The educational system remains geared toward producing civil
servants rather than entrepreneurs, computer specialists or experts
who can handle a private sector economy. The unemployment rate for
Syria's 4 million working-age adults is estimated at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Sukkar, a former World Bank economist who runs a private
investment and development firm in Damascus, said education should
be one of the new regime's top priorities, especially since half
Syria's 17 million people are younger than 20.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 young people enter the labor force every year.
</P>
<P>
   Economic reform ''has to find ways to absorb all this new
generation into society in a productive way, find them employment,
involve them in the future of the country,'' Sukkar said.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad has already started a push for modernization. He is
leading an anti-corruption campaign that has targeted top
government officials. He has said he'd like to see a computer in
every house and followed through with a drive that allows Syrians
who cannot afford computers to buy them from government agencies by
paying small monthly installments. He is also behind a campaign to
computerize government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Sukkar said Assad's mission ''is not going to be easy, but I
think it's doable.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects this week's congress of the ruling Baath Party to
elect a new leadership that will support Assad's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to see new faces more in tune with the times,
younger, less entrenched in the past, more progressive,'' Sukkar
said. ''All this is going to help Dr. Bashar move forward with
economic reforms.''

<HEADLINE> Toddler swept through 34-foot-long pipe after downpour  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) - A 2-1/2-year-old boy who was watching frogs
prance around after a rainstorm fell into a ditch at the bottom of
the family's driveway and got sucked into a 34-foot-long drainpipe
by swift-flowing water.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Oleyourryk's father, who was standing nearby, jumped in
to try and grab him but the boy had already vanished down the
foot-wide pipe. A teen-age neighbor ran to the other end of the
pipe, jumped in the ditch and shouted ''I got him!''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was pulled clear, suffering a bad scare but no more than
a few cuts and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been watching the frogs Thursday evening with his
4-year-old brother, Jacob, when he fell into the ditch, which runs
along both sides of the driveway and is connected by a pipe under
the driveway. The ditch was filled with muddy water after a
downpour in this town northwest of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel was gasping for air at first but started crying within
seconds. He was taken to a hospital as a precaution but is doing
fine, said his father, David Oleyourryk.

<HEADLINE> Balkans Still Await Reconstruction  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICK QUINN
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- The bombs stopped falling on
Yugoslavia a year ago. But Balkan nations are still waiting for the
money promised by the West.
</P>
<P>
   Despite numerous conferences and reams of plans, both supporters
and critics are starting to wonder whether Balkan reconstruction
efforts will remain mostly talk and no action.
</P>
<P>
   ''Promises must be kept,'' insisted Bodo Hombach, coordinator of
the international Stability Pact for the Balkans, which took part
in another planning meeting June 7-9 in the northern Greek city of
Thessaloniki. ''We have to fight against red tape and
bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hombach frets about a ''downward spiral of disappointment and
failure'' if big donor nations begin losing interest and political
support for their grand promises for Balkan reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Stability Pact was formed one year ago with much fanfare by
the European Union, 44 other nations, the World Bank and 36
international organizations. Its goal is to coordinate
international efforts to supply much-needed funds to help promote
economic development in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Its indirect mandate is to add weight to the West's pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by cutting Serbia out of most
of the redevelopment projects. Pact members say Serbia can join the
fold as soon as Milosevic is gone from power.
</P>
<P>
   Stability Pact officials also claim that, despite the funding
delays, a major accomplishment so far has been allowing some level
of common purpose in a region of deep ethnic hostilities and
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's spokesman, Andrew Levi, called it a
''remarkable change.''
</P>
<P>
   One example, he said, was Hombach's mediation earlier this year
in convincing Romania and Bulgaria to finalize nearly 10 years of
negotiations and agree to build a second bridge over the Danube
River, which defines most of their common border. Construction has
not yet started.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the Pact has not made much real headway in
pumping serious Western investment into the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will stagnate like a backwater and it will grow even
worse,'' said Thanos Veremis, president of the Hellenic Foundation
for Defense and Foreign Policy in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Veremis sees the Pact's inability to directly supply funds as a
reflection of waning international interest in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally it shows the reluctance of all to put their hands in
their pockets,'' Veremis said. ''The Balkans is not a rich place,
it is not strategic or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   International donors in March pledged $2.4 billion to the
Stability Pact, which has already come up with 50 immediate
projects such as road repairs, bridges, power grids and water
supply networks. The agency also seeks to help independent media in
places such as Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But to get the money, the Stability Pact has to go through a
long tender process and none of the major projects have gotten off
the ground. Officials say the extended process is often necessary
to guard against corruption.
</P>
<P>
   It took EU planners 42 weeks to draw up plans to approve $19.9
million in May to help clear the Danube of debris and unexploded
shells left over from NATO's bombing campaign. But that project is
still pending approval from the 15-nation EU as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Stability Pact officials have indicated they would like to cut
the time for such projects to 16 weeks if possible.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion from the Pact of Yugoslavia -- a major trade route
for the Balkans -- is another problem. Without Yugoslavia, for
example, the project to clear the Danube will not be enough to
restore full commerce on the waterway since it passes through the
heart of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is much frustration, and much of this frustration is due
to the black hole called Yugoslavia,'' said Javier Solana, a former
NATO secretary-general who is now the EU's commissioner for
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals by some EU countries to lift sanctions have been
sidelined. Members of the Yugoslav opposition, who have counted on
help from the West, say lifting sanctions would be an important
step.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the only thing that might help the opposition,'' said
Predrag Simic, foreign policy adviser to opposition leader Vuk
Draskovic, who was nearly killed in a shooting Friday. He blamed
allies of Milosevic for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Non-governmental organizations, which may be called on to
implement many Stability Pact proposals, were kept out of the loop
until this month when 120 representatives met in Thessaloniki with
Pact envoys. Many came away with complaints with the Pact.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have no money of their own to spend,'' said James Lyon, a
Balkans economic expert with the International Crisis Group. ''They
are basically coordinating how everyone else is spending their
money and they are not even doing that well.''

<HEADLINE> To shop, hang out or exercise free speech, it's off to the mall  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - You have the right to free speech, you have
the right to privacy at home, you have the right to watch cops on
TV read Miranda warnings to bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   And you have the right - should you wish - to hand out brochures
at a shopping mall about the endangered Australian hairy-nosed
wombat. Or to cajole passers-by into signing your petition to run
for U.S. Senate as a Green Party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is true, but civil freedoms inside malls exist with
limits.
</P>
<P>
   Mall owners can impose rules on your free speech by specifying
where and when you can set up a table, and how much you have to pay
in advance for liability insurance in case you have a tendency to
incite riots or in case your wombat mascot has a habit of biting.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Mayer, a prominent Princeton activist currently running as
a Green Party candidate in the 12th Congressional District, said
mall rights are a major issue to minor parties and activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stood outside to distribute leaflets outside the Freehold
Raceway Mall (in 1992). The security folks asked me to leave. I
said I had a constitutional right to be there. They were not
pleased to hear that,'' Mayer said. ''They brought me to the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer said established political parties do not engage in mall
pamphleteering because they have other options, such as mailings,
TV commercials, paid public events and costly fund-raisers.
Republicans can stage a media event, as they plan to Monday on the
Statehouse steps to promote their candidates for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do not, by and large, talk to people like we do,'' Mayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the New Jersey Supreme Court released a landmark
ruling to permit activist organizations like the Green Party to
conduct petition drives and voter registration efforts in malls -
in this case Mill Creek Mall in Secaucus - free of prohibitive
insurance fees.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reinforced a 1994 state Supreme Court opinion in a
case in which anti-war activists were barred from the Short Hills
Mall. Chief Justice Robert Wilentz declared malls had replaced the
town square and so must accept the assortment of town criers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the ultimate purpose of these shopping centers is
commercial, their normal use is all-embracing, almost without
limit, projecting a community image,'' Wilentz wrote. ''For the
ordinary citizen it is not just an invitation to shop, but to do
whatever one would do downtown, including doing very little of
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people will not like it, any more perhaps than they liked
free speech at the downtown business districts. Dislike for free
speech, however, has never been the determinant of its protection
or its benefit,'' Wilentz wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as the 1994 ruling might have been to fans, it was
not bedrock. The Short Hills mall case was ruled by a minimal 4-3
majority, and of those four justices two were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two still on the court, Justice Daniel O'Hern wrote the
opinion this time. But O'Hern, who now has retired also, achieved
what Wilentz could not: a 7-0 vote that will not be overturned
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most businesses in the state are conducted in facilities
surrounded by parking lots far from the public streets,'' O'Hern
reiterated. ''Leafletting in heavily visited shopping areas
therefore has a very high value in our system of political
discourse. Putting too high a price on the exercise of that freedom
may destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   There has always been a strong argument against free speech at
the mall. In the three-vote dissenting opinion written by former
Justice Marie Garibaldi in 1994, she said a mall is a big store, a
commercial property whose owners have no more First Amendment
obligation to accommodate political activists than a crowded Wawa.
</P>
<P>
   Garibaldi in her dissent said most Supreme Courts, including the
U.S. Supreme Court, saw the issue her way, which was and remains
true.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Supreme Court also said states can handle these
questions for themselves according to their laws and local
circumstances. New Jersey residents are perhaps unique in the
nation in their dependence on a network of shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   Most shopping malls accepted the 1994 ruling and made reasonable
rules for people like Mayer and his friends. ''It was Mill Creek
that decided to be really hard nosed about it,'' said Frank Askin,
a Rutgers University law professor who argued both mall cases on
behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than coping with a vulnerable, divided ruling from six
years ago, the owners of the Mill Creek Mall now have a unanimous
ruling with little room for ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   James Hirschhorn, a lawyer for a national association of malls,
said the O'Hern ruling dealt not with basic mall rights but with
the details, and it set a reasonable balance.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, activists with a track record of causing
disruptions or provoking hostility can be forced to pay for high
insurance coverage. O'Hern merely said mall owners cannot assume
the worst, but must document a basis for their fears. ''The
business owner has got to have facts,'' Hirschhorn said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a cobble-stoned street flooded by
the sun, two swarthy-skinned men sit on a rug playing cards and
trading jokes. Asked about life in Kosovo, one of them grins and
says: ''It's never been better.''
</P>
<P>
   More Gypsies sit on another sidewalk less than a 20 minute drive
away. But the mood among the men in the Serb part of Orahovac
couldn't be more different from that of their Prizren brethren.
Scowls meet the same question here, and the answer is: ''We are
prisoners, unable to move freely for fear of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after NATO-led peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo, the truth
about whether life is improving for the province's nearly 30,000
remaining Gypsy -- or Roma -- minority is hard to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   It is instead colored by long-standing prejudices and
complicated by the fact that many Roma deny their heritage. They
call themselves Serbs, or Egyptians or Ashkali in clear attempts to
distance themselves from traditional anti-Gypsy prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to figure out which groups are gradually
improving relations with the Albanian minority. Though they call
themselves Egyptians, most members of that group speak only
Albanian, as do the Ashkali. Both are Muslims and generally live
among Albanians. The other Roma often only speak Serb and live with
Serbs. Many even consider themselves Serbs -- like those in
Orahovac, trapped in a Serb enclave of the city because of fear of
attack from Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the rest of the world, they are all Roma. And with
suspicions fading that all dark-skinned Kosovo residents
collaborated with the Serbs during their crackdown on majority
Albanians, attacks are decreasing. Gyspies are slowly again
becoming part of everyday life in many Albanian-dominated Kosovo
cities, towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees point to
an April agreement on reconciliation and recent visits by the major
Kosovo Albanian leaders to the cities of Prizren and Urosevac for
meetings with local Roma community leaders as signs of how much
things have improved since the first months after the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we started the process of reconciliation six months ago,
nobody thought things would improve this quickly,'' says Ariana
Zherka of the Pristina UNHCR branch. ''When I first started meeting
Roma leaders, they were anxious and fearful. Now they sit on
municipal government boards and their views are being heard and
respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Because dark-skinned Roma look different from other Kosovo
residents, those who did side with the Serbs were highly visible.
That led to a general backlash against the Roma. Dennis McNamara,
the head of Kosovo's UNHCR mission, says that ''they were the
second-most targeted after the Serbs'' by Albanians seeking revenge
for the Serb crackdown that killed an estimated 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with emotions cooling, and non-Serbian-speaking Roma
seeking to make amends, ethnic Albanian political leaders realize
that the Roma ''are not a threat politically, and the Albanians can
make concessions to the Roma that they cannot make to the Serbs,''
McNamara said.
</P>
<P>
   By opting for ethnic reconciliation with a minority, ethnic
Albanian political leaders clearly hope to blunt international
criticism that the violence by their own people demonstrates the
same kind of racist intolerance of which the Serbs were once
accused.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Albanian hand of reconciliation does not appear to
extend to Serb-speaking Roma in Orahovac and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been locked in here for a year,'' says one of the
Orahovac Roma, who identified himself only as Mirko. ''Everyone
should have freedom of movement. But the Albanians won't let us
move out of here -- some of us tried, but they didn't come back.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hatred without reason -- none of us did anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked in the Albanian part of Orahovac about Serb Roma, Suleiman
Safte replies: ''They're worse than the Serbs. The Serbs just
killed. Those Roma asked their victims, 'With which knife would you
like to be killed?'''
</P>
<P>
   There's still a long way to go, even in improving relations
between Albanians and the pro-Albanian Roma like the Egyptians and
the Ashkali. In some cases, revenge violence lessened only after
leaders of such communities got their followers to do thousands of
hours of free labor, rebuilding Albanian houses they say they did
not destroy.
</P>
<P>
   And some speak even now of recent violence -- like Imer Bajrami,
who remains traumatized by two raids on his house by masked
Albanian-speaking men.
</P>
<P>
   The last time, less than two months ago, ''they pulled plastic
bags over our head and down our bodies and threatened to burn us,''
says Bajrami, 75, squatting on his haunches as he watches traffic
flow by. ''They said, 'You work with the Serbs, you have guns
inside.' One put a burning lighter to the bag covering my wife for
a second before they all left.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since then, things have started improving a bit. But I'm still
afraid to sleep at home.''

   PISA, Italy (AP) -- When Fabio Vasarelli climbed the slippery
spiral staircase of the Leaning Tower of Pisa on Saturday, he
started feeling a bit dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew this was going to happen, but I couldn't miss this
opportunity,'' said the 23-year-old Pisa native. ''I'd never been
here, and it's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasarelli was among a privileged group of 100 Pisa University
students who were allowed inside the medieval tower.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since the last visitors enjoyed its
breathtaking view of Piazza dei Miracoli, and most of the students
had never been inside ---- or were too young to remember.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's visit was a symbolic gesture designed to show off a
project aimed at correcting the tower's perilous lean -- and
reassure the public that it would someday again be open.
</P>
<P>
   When the tower was closed to the public a decade ago, officials
said it would be open again in just a few years. The ambitious plan
to stop the tower's increasing tilt has taken far longer than
expected, but officials say it is succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, regarded with some skepticism at first, includes
attaching a pair of steel ''suspenders'' to the tower, and then the
excavating soil under its foundations.
</P>
<P>
   When the work began, the tower leaned 6 degrees, or 13 feet, off
the perpendicular, on its south side. Now it is 5 inches straighter
-- back to the levels of more than a century ago, experts said. So
far, about 250 cubic feet of earth have been excavated; 460 cubic
feet still have to be taken away.
</P>
<P>
   To stabilize the tower while the work was underway, 800 tons of
lead counterweights were placed at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Project officials hope to have the work finished next spring.
When they do, the monument will lean 17 inches less than it did in
1700 --enough to stabilize it, but not enough for the naked eye to
detect.
</P>
<P>
   ''At that point, the tower will be OK for two or three
centuries,'' said Michele Jamiolkowski, who heads the committee of
experts monitoring the $27 million project.
</P>
<P>
   The experts warn that even when the tower reopens, visitors
might not be allowed in on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The monument might hardly sustain the millions of tourists who
would flock to it every year,'' warned a member of the experts'
committee, Giorgio Macchi, pointing out how past visitors have worn
down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Macchi said the dirty marble facade will also need some
restoration. Tests on the facade are now in progress.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the 190-foot high tower began in 1173 to
celebrate the glory of Pisa, in those years a wealthy port town.
</P>
<P>
   The soil underneath its foundations began sinking when it was
just 34 feet high, starting its centuries-long tilt. The builders
forged ahead, however, managing to complete it in 1360.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of people have been inside since the tower was
closed to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lucky ones allowed in on Saturday couldn't go all the
way up the tower's 293 steps. Their tour ended on the second of the
monument's eight stories of arches and columns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God,'' Vasarelli said. ''I don't know if I would have
made it.''

<HEADLINE> Five teens arrested in Wyckoff beating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WYCKOFF, N.J. (AP) - Five teens have been arrested in the
mob-style beating of two 17-year-old students outside a home here,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also called for police monitoring of an All-Star
game Friday night at Ramapo High School, where the suspects are
students, to prevent a possible retaliation. No problems were
reported at the game.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said the beating of the two Don Bosco High
School students involved as many as 25 Ramapo students wielding
baseball bats, boards, tire irons and a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the five arrested Friday were juveniles, whose names
were not released. A 16-year-old from Franklin Lakes was charged
with attempted murder and rioting, among other charges. A
15-year-old from Franklin Lakes and a 17-year-old from Wyckoff were
charged with aggravated assault, possession of a weapon for
unlawful purposes and rioting. Charges were not available for a
16-year-old from Franklin Lakes who was also arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan C. Kellet, 18, of Wyckoff, was arrested and faces weapons
charges and a count of aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the injured teens, who were treated and released
from The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, are from Ridgefield Park and
Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came after the two took offense at a rumor
circulating about one of the boys' female cousins and went to a
house on Demarest Avenue to confront a youth they thought was
responsible for spreading it, police said.
</P>
<P>
   When they got there, they were met by the group of 25 teens who
had the weapons, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called to the home around 5 p.m. Tuesday, found the
boys in need of medical attention, and detained the occupants of a
sport-utility vehicle that was leaving the address.
</P>
<P>
   Bergen County Prosecutor William H. Schmidt told The Record of
Hackensack for Saturday's editions that he has met with school
officials to try to prevent more violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very often, these types of activities will spill into the
community,'' he said. ''If the victims' friends decide they want to
come back and retaliate, they're going to find themselves in the
same situation'' as those arrested, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack caught the attention of state Secretary of State
DeForest B. Soaries Jr., who has proposed an anti-violence program
that would include a hot line that students could call if they know
about potential violence.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said the program may be installed at Don Bosco and
Ramapo high schools next year.

<HEADLINE> Shas Schools in Political Crisis  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- While most of his classmates spent recess
singing the praise of God, Yosef Kahn practiced dribbling and
dunking. Basketball is a favorite pastime, he confessed -- until one
of his friends whispered in his ear to correct him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I prefer Torah,'' the sixth-grader quickly said, referring to
the biblical studies that take up five hours of his eight-hour
schoolday.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn attends the ''Light of the Torah'' school, a soaring new
structure perched over a panorama of Jerusalem, and one of about
200 educational institutions run by the ultra-Orthodox Shas party.
</P>
<P>
   The Shas schools are at the center of a bitter political row
that is threatening to topple Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
government and bring the Middle East peace process to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis say Shas is using its political clout to extort
millions of dollars in government funds for schools that
indoctrinate pupils and turn them against the democratic system
that allowed the party to flourish in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leaders say the schools, which have 25,000 students,
redress decades of discrimination against religious Jews of
Sephardic, or Middle Eastern, background -- and they are prepared to
leave Barak's government if their demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
   ''This money is meant to reduce the gaps in Israeli society,''
said Shas spokesman Yitzhak Sudri. ''What the Ashkenazi (European
Jewish) establishment did for 40 years to the Sephardic population
simply brought them to depravity. They weren't educated enough,
they didn't have chances to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas critics say the party has controlled cash-intensive Cabinet
ministries for most of the 16 years of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll published in the Maariv newspaper on Friday found
that 71 percent of secular Israelis believe Sephardic Orthodox
children are now favored by the system. The poll had a margin of
error of 4.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The clash came to a head last week when Shas ministers voted
with the opposition for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually a fireable offense. However, Barak is scrambling
to keep Shas in his Cabinet, fearful that the party's departure
would create a minority government lacking the credibility to
finalize the peace treaty with the Palestinians he has promised for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leaders are furious with Education Minister Yossi Sarid,
who has refused to transfer $7.5 million in emergency funds to the
Shas school system he says has already richly benefited from
government magnanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Sarid, who heads the secular Meretz party, says the system is
bankrupt because of mismanagement, and wants future funding closely
supervised by his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   As a way out of the crisis, Barak is considering removing the
Shas schools from Sarid's oversight. However, this would not solve
deeper tensions.
</P>
<P>
   In return for loyalty to Barak, Shas wants the government to
fund a transportation system for its students and to legalize its
five pirate radio stations. Both could be powerful tools for
mobilizing voters in future elections. Shas has grown steadily over
the years, and now is the third-largest party in parliament, with
17 of 120 legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Secular Israelis say the religious schools offer little more
than indoctrination. They say Shas helps perpetuate poverty -- and
creates new Shas voters dependent on handouts from the party --
because students don't learn what is necessary to compete in a
modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's creating an enclave,'' said A.B. Yehoshua, a noted
Israeli writer. ''They don't study civics or subjects that will
prepare them for professions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shas educators counter that religious study does not impede
integration into Israeli society; in fact, they say, the gargantuan
memory and interpretive skills required to master the Talmud, the
vast commentary on Jewish law, are enough to ground the students in
any pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids who have studied Talmud learn quickly,'' said Rabbi
Shlomo Bresca, the principal of Light of the Torah, claiming that
an increasing number of ultra-Orthodox are joining Israel's
burgeoning high-tech work force.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Shas says, the schools provide the children
with a moral basis to survive modern decadence.
</P>
<P>
   Bresca is quick to point out that it is only the boys' school
that has benefited from the recent cash flow. Down the street, the
girls still study 30 to a class in cramped metal shacks that burn
in midday summer heat. Both schools have about 265 pupils each.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the dedication of the teachers, who work long hours at
low pay,'' that make Shas schools attractive, he said. ''Secular
teachers walk out over not getting a 10 percent raise. Our teachers
have waited months for salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the teachers appear to have answered a calling. At
the boys' school, they enraptured pupils with energetic
explanations of religious duties.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Avraham Avergil strode among a cluster of first-graders,
reviewing how many times a day one recites the ''Shema,'' the
one-sentence encapsulation of monotheism and chosenness said to be
the essence of Jewish belief.
</P>
<P>
   ''You say it when you ... ,'' he bellowed, and then dropped his
cheek into the palm of his hand. ''Go to sleep!'' the boys shouted.
''And when you...,'' he stretched. ''Wake up!'' they shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, secular concepts have a way of creeping into even this
insular society. The sixth-grade girls -- who study a much greater
proportion of the state-set curriculum -- were asked to write essays
on what system of government they preferred. Each chose the
republican system, explaining that an elected government better
guaranteed their rights.
</P>
<P>
   The boys spend much more time studying religion -- but they too
are not invulnerable to secular customs. Yosef Kahn, the hoop
dreamer, could not remember where he learned his basketball moves.
It wasn't in school -- no gym class -- nor at home, where TV is
banned.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he remembered: ''On the street.''

<HEADLINE> Trenton man sentenced to life for strip club killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOYLESTOWN, Pa. (AP) - A Bucks County jury sentenced a New
Jersey man convicted of killing a gambling buddy at a Bristol
Township strip club to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After seven hours of jury deliberations, DeWayne Housley was
found guilty Thursday of first-degree murder in the February 1999
killing of Charles Bethea, 53, of Yardville, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Housley, 24, of Trenton, N.J., was automatically sentenced to
life in prison after jurors met Friday for a death penalty hearing
and were unable to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bethea, an employee at the New Jersey Department of Labor, was
waiting outside Divas International Gentleman's Club for his
girlfriend, an exotic dancer who had been called by the club to
fill in for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Police said codefendent Courtney Page Boone, 21, of Trenton,
N.J., and Housley knew Bethea from hanging out in illegal gambling
halls. They believed that Bethea carried a lot of cash and planned
to rob him.
</P>
<P>
   Housley and Bethea fought, police said, and Bethea was chased
into the club. Just inside the door, police said, Housley shot
Bethea in the face, then fled.
</P>
<P>
   Boone, who claimed he stayed in the car during the killing,
pleaded guilty in April to third-degree murder and agreed to
testify against Housley.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton goes on the attack to ''define'' Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In what one veteran New York Democratic
strategist calls a ''very perilous strategy,'' Hillary Rodham
Clinton is directly attacking her new Senate rival, Rep. Rick
Lazio, in campaign appearances and television advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy was on display Tuesday when she visited a hospital
in suburban Westchester County. She said Lazio's positions were out
of step with most New Yorkers and that he too often flip-flopped on
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're going to have a great time trying to find out where he
stands on issues,'' she said. ''If you look at his record, it sort
of depends on who's the last person he talked to.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the first lady stepped things up with a half-hour
speech to 1,100 women supporters in New York City, calling the Long
Island congressman ''a follower, not a leader'' and accusing him of
voting ''against the interests of New York women, children and
families.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little disagreement as to why the first lady has gone
on the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''She is under intense pressure, based upon the polls, to define
him quickly and to reduce her negatives ... She will begin to
define him before he gets on television in a major way and defines
himself,'' said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign, the
New York-based Sheinkopf is not involved in the U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, not well known outside his home district in Suffolk
County, entered the Senate race on the Republican side just a month
ago after Mayor Rudolph Giuliani withdrew because of prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Four independent polls out since the switch have shown the race
is a statistical tie or extremely close, or much the same as it was
when Giuliani was running.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times/CBS News poll out Tuesday had Clinton barely
ahead of Lazio, 44 percent to 39 percent, among likely voters. It
found that three in 10 voters had an unfavorable opinion of the
first lady while 62 percent said they either didn't know enough
about Lazio to form an opinion or were undecided about him.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans say the new Clinton aggressiveness is a
sign of concern on the part of the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''This obviously is a desperation move,'' said Dan McLagan, a
spokesman for Lazio's campaign. ''She spent a year introducing
herself to New Yorkers. They've met her, they've heard about her,
they don't like her ... They are turning to the tried and true
Clinton method of search and destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson disputed that, saying there
wasn't any real change in strategy and that the candidate and her
campaign have been spelling out differences with Lazio ever since
he entered the race. Nonetheless, Wolfson said that in the past
week Clinton had pulled the individual elements of the criticism
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to talk about the issue differences. They're
significant,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, Clinton is seeking to portray Lazio as too
conservative for New York and a sidekick of former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich. Lazio says he is a moderate Republican in tune with
mainstream New York voters.
</P>
<P>
   Sheinkopf said Thursday that he expected Clinton to quickly
press her effort with new television ads attacking the
congressman's voting record while praising her own work as first
lady and before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on Friday, Clinton launched two new television ads
attacking Lazio for not supporting the Patients' Bill of Rights
legislation and for not being an active supporter of hate crimes
legislation sought by gay rights activists. Both ads end with the
tag line: ''The more you know, the more you wonder.'' They were the
first TV ads of the campaign in which one candidate directly
attacked the other.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheinkopf cautioned that Clinton is engaging in ''a very
perilous strategy to some extent. It could backfire and increase
her own negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio camp believes that may happen if it plays its cards
right. To help counter her attacks, the Lazio campaign is stepping
up positive TV spots touting the congressman as a family man who
has spent his life in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And Lazio has sought to reinforce the notion that Clinton is
going negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Yorkers deserve a clean campaign on the issues. Mrs.
Clinton's mudslinging is an affront to them,'' he said after her
Wednesday attack. ''New Yorkers deserve much better than Mrs.
Clinton offered today.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Clinton strategy may carry risks, the first lady's
advisers feel she has a cushion and point to the Times/CBS poll as
evidence of that. The poll found that 74 percent of voters felt she
was spending more time discussing issues than attacking Lazio. Only
nine percent saw things the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the numbers, Sheinkopf said Clinton doesn't have much
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's in a very difficult position,'' he said. ''She's got to
define him faster than he defines himself.''

<HEADLINE> Mugabe: Zimbabwe is for Blacks  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe said Saturday
that whites may live in Zimbabwe, but they will never have a voice
equal to that of blacks in the southern African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whites can be citizens in our country, or residents, but
not our cousins. They are the greatest racists in the world,''
Mugabe said in a campaign speech one week before parliamentary
elections set for June 24-25.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe does not face election, but his ruling ZANU-PF party is
facing its greatest challenge since the country gained independence
from Britain 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The president has repeatedly attacked the small, white minority,
which generally opposes him.
</P>
<P>
   He has also expressed sympathy with the mobs of black supporters
illegally occupying more than 1,400 white-owned farms. He has
called the occupations a justified protest against the British
colonial legacy of unfair land distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, the British are saying that they are squatting on white
man's land. Where is black man's land in Europe?'' Mugabe said.
''Zimbabwe is a black man's land, and a black man will determine
who gets it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that racial reconciliation was possible as
long as whites recognized that blacks rule Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is suffering its worst economic crisis in the
post-independence period, and Mugabe's provocative comments have
discouraged potential foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's ruling party and its allies currently control all but
three of the 150 seats in parliament, but opinion polls suggest the
main opposition group, the Movement for Democratic Change, could
make large gains.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout for Mugabe's speech -- fewer than 6,000 supporters --
was so disappointingly small that Tony Gara, deputy minister of
local government, apologized to Mugabe in his introductory remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Gara said the low attendance was a result of the country's fuel
shortage, the short notice of the rally and because Saturday is a
working day for many Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe planned to head to Egypt afterward for an international
summit meeting, and Saturday's rally was expected to be his last
major campaign event ahead of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout was expected to be much larger in Highfield, a
Harare suburb, where Mugabe held his first major rally after
independence in 1980. At that time, he was carried shoulder-high
and hailed as a liberator by 150,000 supporters.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he said the war against white rule had brought the
country freedom from racial oppression, and that life had improved
for Zimbabwe's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The (revolutionary) war was fought so that we would be treated
like people, not dogs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said he had been wrongfully accused of harming Zimbabwe,
and he also denounced Ian Smith, the last prime minister of
Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was known before independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent 11 years in prison at the hands of Ian Smith. He is
still here, alive, keeping a head that we should have -- you know --
taken away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said people supporting the opposition were doing so
because they had forgotten how Zimbabweans suffered under colonial
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing war veterans sitting near the stage, Mugabe said,
''This is our country. Nothing will happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Though calling for a peaceful election, Mugabe told his
supporters to retaliate for any attacks from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to fight back,'' he said. ''But ZANU-PF doesn't want
to provoke.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 31 people, most of them opposition supporters, have
been killed in political violence since February, and many more
have been beaten.

<HEADLINE> Italy Art Expert Kidnapped in Yemen  </HEADLINE>
By AHMED Al-HAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- An Italian art expert who was in Yemen to
organize an art exhibition was kidnapped along with four Yemenis,
the Italian Embassy said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Alessio was kidnapped Friday in Marib province together
with his tour guide, an antiquities expert and two military
escorts, deputy head of mission Orazio Guanciale said.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian, who heads the Palazzo Bricherasio Foundation for
art, had arrived in the country Wednesday and was touring the
eastern province in advance of a Yemeni art exhibition he planned
to organize in Turin, Italy, Guanciale said. Marib, believed to be
where the Queen of Sheba once ruled, is modern Yemen's most famous
archaeological site.
</P>
<P>
   Tribesmen in this impoverished nation of 17 million sometimes
kidnap tourists and diplomats to press the government for better
living conditions.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 foreigners have been kidnapped since 1990 in Marib,
which is home to four powerful tribes. Solo travelers must drive
there in a convoy escorted by armed soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The five men kidnapped Friday were taken by the al-Zaidi tribe,
whose demands were still unknown, a tribesman said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Other tribal officials said the kidnappers had given mediators a
list of demands, including that the government deliver an
undisclosed ransom and compensate for damage caused by 1995 flash
floods. The kidnappers also wanted authorities to arrange jobs in
the armed forces for Marib's unemployed and to spend some of the
province's oil revenues on local development.
</P>
<P>
   A government official said the demands would not be met, and
that security forces were surrounding the area of the kidnappers.
However, the government would not use force to try to release
Alessio, he said on condition of anonymity.

   TACARIGUA, Trinidad (AP) -- The case has all the makings of the
Elian Gonzalez custody battle -- a motherless boy, a blue-collar dad
and feuding relatives -- but this time the father is a convicted
felon fighting to keep his 6-year-old on this Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   The core question is whether the rights of the boy's father,
Anthony Alvarez, overrule a standing custody order and the
opportunities that the boy might enjoy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to stay with my dad,'' said Brandon, whose fair
skin makes him stand out in a country mostly divided between
descendants of Africans and East Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing content in the quiet hamlet in north-central Trinidad,
Brandon -- for the time being -- lives with his dad and cousins in a
modest, one-story home full of puppets, Nintendo video games, and
cousins. His father, who once earned $400 a week as a landscape
contractor in the United States, now makes $40 a week bagging rice.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was deported to his native Trinidad in 1998. In
February, a district court granted sole custody to maternal
grandparents Robert and Kathleen Willard of Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Elian Gonzalez case, Brandon's tale began with a
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, 1996, Brandon's mother, Lara, was killed in a car
crash in Massachusetts en route to classes at Fitchburg State
College. She was 20, months from a nursing degree and planning to
wed Alvarez, with whom she lived together with Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   That year Alvarez served four months of a felony conviction
stemming from a mugging in Nashua. The judge commuted the sentence
when he was told of the mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and his father were reunited for a short time, but in
May 1998 Alvarez was detained and deported because of his felony
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Both grandparents were given joint custody and Brandon spent
weekdays with paternal grandmother Joy Alvarez and weekends with
the Willards. Both live in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The climax came when the Willards tried to prevent Brandon's
visit to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't want him to go on this trip because he was going to
miss too much school,'' said Mr. Willard, 58. The dispute led to
their successful motion for sole custody.
</P>
<P>
   But two days later, Joy Alvarez took the boy to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Now jailed in Manchester, N.H., she is unable to pay her
$500,000 bond and faces up to seven years imprisonment for
interfering with the custody order.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been telling the Willards for the longest time that the
best thing for Brandon is to be with me -- yet I know that the best
opportunities for him are in the United States,'' Alvarez said. He
said he is willing to allow visitation rights, but doesn't feel
they'll compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The Willards visited Trinidad in April and gave the U.S. embassy
court papers establishing their custody and tried to persuade the
father to give up his son.
</P>
<P>
   So far they've had no response, Robert Willard said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to try to work cooperatively with Tony, which we
see as being best for everybody, especially Brandon,'' Willard
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that going to court in Trinidad was an option they have
not yet considered and are reluctant to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Lamora, public affairs officer at the State
Department's Office of Children's Issues, noted that Trinidad was
not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of
International Child Abduction, which would normally apply in such
cases.

<HEADLINE> Assad May Allow Domestic Change  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- In a series of interviews as his father
groomed him for the Syrian presidency, Bashar Assad offered a
glimpse of his thinking and gave the world a chance to get to know
him. He has stuck close to his father's line on peace with Israel,
but shown himself more open to domestic change.
</P>
<P>
   Now that his father is gone -- Hafez Assad died June 10 of a
heart attack after 30 years in power -- Bashar Assad has said very
little in public. On Saturday, he declined to speak to reporters
covering a meeting of Syria's ruling Baath Party.
</P>
<P>
   During his father's funeral Tuesday, Bashar Assad praised
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for having a good grasp of
Syria's realities. ''That is very good news for our country and
people to hear that you understand,'' he said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Syria ''is committed to continue in the same way
that President Assad was following,'' he told Albright. This last
remark was taken to mean that Bashar Assad, 34 years old and a
political novice, would stick to his father's uncompromising
approach in peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Egyptian weekly Al-Osboa, conducted two
weeks before Assad died but published last Monday, Bashar said: ''I
would like to stress that peace to Syria is a strategic choice.
When Syria took part in the (1991) Madrid (peace) conference, and
then in the peace talks with Israel, it went with fixed principles
that could not be divided or partitioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashar outlined the principles as: Not a single inch of land to
remain under Israeli control, and Syria wants full control over the
northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to be prepared to permit a higher level of pluralism
and freedom of expression than his father. But, in the same
Al-Osboa interview, he fell short of endorsing a full-fledged
democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   The young Assad's career as an eye doctor in a west London
hospital ended when his elder brother Basil, his father's first
choice for a successor, died in a 1994 car accident.
</P>
<P>
   But he has lived almost his entire life in Syria, where his
father ruled with an iron grip and showed zero tolerance for
dissent. Under Hafez Assad, Syria endured long spells as an
isolated, or even pariah, nation because of western allegations
that it sponsored terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe in democracy and I respect others' opinions to a
large extent. ... I believe that it is necessary to listen to the
point of views of all the others whatever different and
contradictory,'' Bashar Assad told Al-Osboa. ''There is no harm to
Syria if we have a strong and active media that opens the door for
everyone far away from a single opinion or a single point of
view.''

<HEADLINE> Coffee shop changes name, again, to satisfy Federal Express  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A coffee shop has changed its name a third
time to satisfy shipping giant Federal Express' copyright
infringement claims.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as Federal Espresso, then Ex-Federal Espresso,
the owners have ironically named their java business ''Freedom of
Espresso.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Memphis, Tenn.,-based FedEx filed a copyright
infringement lawsuit against the coffee bar's owners in U.S.
District Court in Syracuse. It was settled recently, Syracuse
Newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we had to do was buy an 'O' and an 'M,''' to create a sign
with the new name on it, said co-owner Anna Dobbs.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was not quite the sum of what changed.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs' brother and business partner, David Ruston, said he has
at least 200 pounds of stationery at his home sitting next to the
fireplace, ready to burn. It all carried the contentious name.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the Syracuse shops owned by Dobbs and Ruston, the only
reference to the old name is outside the building. Beneath a sign
bearing the new name is another that reads, ''Formerly known as
Ex-Federal Espresso.'' Under the settlement agreement, the shop can
keep that sign up for 60 days, said the shop's lawyer, Joseph
Heath.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs and Ruston are bound by the settlement not to discuss the
terms.
</P>
<P>
   A FedEx lawyer also would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year legal battle did not appear to kill business for
the store. Dobbs and Ruston plan to open a third shop soon. Which
means Heath will have a new place to collect legal fees - he
charged one cup of coffee a day indefinitely.

<HEADLINE> The last DJ standing turns to the Internet  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It's 8 p.m. on a sticky summer Sunday in the
city. One of America's last great free-form DJs grabs a microphone
and starts his weekly six-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Scelsa opens with a blast of Captain Beefheart and the Magic
Band. He's soon moved to Miles Davis blowing ''Summer Night,''
followed by Dick Van Dyke's ''Put on a Happy Face'' - a nugget from
the ''Bye Bye Birdie'' movie soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   County music legend Ray Price, 74, stops by for a chat about his
half-century in the business. And Scelsa's show -
self-deprecatingly dubbed ''Idiot's Delight'' - is once again off
and running, an eclectic mix of music and monologue.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of radio loved by Scelsa and his legion of
listeners. But when the veteran DJ flips on the radio at home, the
sounds he hears are not so sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Abrasive talk radio. Lousy music. Howard Stern imitators. Lousy
Howard Stern imitators.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many people find commercial radio uninteresting, and
unchallenging, and unenlightening,'' Scelsa observes. ''There's a
huge audience that listens to music, but doesn't listen to radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Scelsa, a New York radio veteran since 1967, now offers an
alternative: he's taking his acclaimed WNEW-FM show to the
Internet. Scelsa has seen the future of rock and roll radio ... and
it ain't on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''If radio's a lost cause, am I supposed to put my tail between
my legs and slink away?'' Scelsa asks. ''No. There's a new medium,
so I'm giving it a shot. It can't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   His thrice-weekly Internet entry, ''Vin Scelsa's Live At
Lunch,'' debuted in May as Arbitron numbers indicated people were
turning their radios off more frequently these days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the average listener spent a little more than 23 hours
a week with their radio. That number has shrunk to 21 hours, says
Arbitron spokesman Thom Mocarsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Vin-ternet show, available around the world, airs live
Tuesday through Thursday from noon-3 p.m. EDT via
www.artistent.com. It's also stored there for repeat listening at
web surfers' convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, there is no such thing as a typical Scelsa show.
</P>
<P>
   On the June 1 webcast, Scelsa - broadcasting from his suburban
New Jersey home - paid homage to the late Tito Puente before
segueing through tunes from Radiohead, Hank Williams, The Clash,
Aimee Mann and Joe Ely.
</P>
<P>
   There are no commercial breaks, just all Scelsa all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Federal Communications Commission restrictions,
Scelsa also did a bit on ''the f-word,'' then played - uncensored -
the George Carlin ''seven dirty words'' routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much more liberating for me,'' Scelsa says happily,
although his early listenership of about 4,000 people is a fraction
of what he draws on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Scelsa's not alone in enjoying the new media's freedom. On Los
Angeles-based knac.net, an expanding audience hears a wider range
of music and DJ's spouting four-letter words. Another L.A. station,
KIIS-FM, has hired ''I-jays'' to run its interactive webcast. Ex-J.
Geils Band frontman Peter Wolf is hosting a radio show via the same
site as Scelsa.
</P>
<P>
   These shows, unlike most available internet radio, are created
specifically for the medium.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of stations worldwide provide live streams of their
broadcasts, allowing listeners to sample shows from Ireland, Brazil
or New Orleans. (The site www.I-probe.com provides links to 1,800
stations.)
</P>
<P>
   Other services, like ClickRadio, offer a jukebox approach -
listeners can choose their songs and hear them via the internet,
freeing them from the tyranny of music selected by station
executives (known in the business as playlists).
</P>
<P>
   Why this explosion of Internet options? Critics offer plenty of
reasons: Radio has too many commercials. There is less music. And
the quality of the music ... well, not everyone loves Britney
Spears and the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Take Rob Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in Rolling Stone, Sheffield recently described
contemporary American radio as ''a handful of media oligarchs
imposing their uniform playlists on a nation of DJs who wouldn't
know how to pick their own songs even if they were allowed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a recent Manhattan news conference, the artist
formerly known as The Artist dissed the radio business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to get back to the day where DJs got to play their own
records,'' Prince suggested. ''We've got to get rid of playlists.
If you ask people, they're sick of hearing the same thing over and
over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Chris Scaiano.
</P>
<P>
   Driving in his car, the 30-year-old Bronx resident turns off the
radio and turns on the CD player. ''New York radio is horrible,''
Scaiano says bluntly. ''I don't want to listen any more.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not that way in 1967, when Scelsa began his career at the
East Orange, N.J.-based college station WFMU-FM. He graduated to
program director, earning $45 a week, before making the 1970 jump
to commercial radio at the ABC network's FM station, WPLJ-FM.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that radio ''consultants'' first became the bane of
Scelsa's existence. He moved around, finally landing his weekly
Sunday show in 1985 (it started in the morning, and eventually
moved to nights).
</P>
<P>
   ''Idiot's Delight'' became a cult favorite - ''The Rocky Horror
Picture Show'' for the musically astute. The show shifted to
WNEW-FM in January 1996, where it now remains.
</P>
<P>
   What Scelsa envision for his Internet show is something rare
these days: a music program with personality.
</P>
<P>
   That was once the standard in New York, long the epicenter of
the radio world. In the '60s, DJ ''Murray the K'' Kaufman was the
honorary ''Fifth Beatle,'' a larger-than-life voice booming from
the radio. In the '70s, Frankie Crocker rode a white steed into
Studio 54, announcing his return to the market.
</P>
<P>
   DJs had attitude. In 1965, Kaufman quit in the middle of his
show when management at WINS-AM instituted a playlist. Executives
shrugged and switched to an all-news station that stills gives you
the world in 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stations were once selling the music and the DJs
equally,'' says Ben Fong-Torres, author of ''The Hits Just Keep on
Coming: The History of Top 40 Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   No more. Music is often MIA, as on New York's top-rated Howard
Stern show, and marketing is omnipresent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's become more of a science in the last 20-25 years,'' says
Fong-Torres, a former Rolling Stone writer. ''Today the emphasis is
demographics, everything broken down by age, sex, musical
preference, region.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio's other drastic change was deregulation, allowing
businesses to snatch up a variety of stations in a single market.
Diversity was out, conglomerates were in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The airwaves belong to a few big corporations,'' Scelsa
complains. ''The notion that I grew up with in the '60s, that the
airwaves belonged to the people and the owners held the license in
public trust, has completely disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners to Scelsa's first few internet shows came from places
as varied as Red Bank, N.J., Kailua, Hawaii, and Alpharetta, Ga. To
Scelsa, that's cause for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ''I compare this to my early days at WFMU,'' Scelsa says. ''In
1967, very few people owned FM radios. Most people did not own
stereo receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe enough people around the country and around the
world are interested in creative, free-form music, and they will
flock when it's there.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Standing before a media horde at his first
Manhattan news conference last month, incoming Archbishop Edward
Egan acknowledged something wasn't quite right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like the boss,'' he confessed. ''But give me a
little time and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, the time is now for the 68-year-old Egan. On
Sunday, in a St. Patrick's Cathedral ceremony, he officially
becomes the 12th head of the sprawling Archdiocese of New York and
its 2.4 million members.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an elaborate installation Mass complete with a
45-minute procession of 700 priests will mark the conservative
Catholic prelate's ascent to the St. Patrick's pulpit. There, he
will address a crowd of about 3,000 invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   The attendees are a mix of the sacred and the secular: eight
cardinals will join first lady Hillary Clinton, U.S. Rep. Rick
Lazio, Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas,
Gov. George Pataki, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Egan is swapping suburban Connecticut for a Manhattan fishbowl,
moving into the official residence on Madison Avenue. He instantly
becomes America's most visible Catholic; his Sunday sermons will
soon become fodder for tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the former bishop of Bridgeport wasn't talking about his new
job, putting off interviews until he put in a full week on the job.
He first wants to meet people and get a feel for the diocese and
its 413 parishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to familiarize himself as to where things stand now
in the archdiocese,'' said spokesman Joe Zwilling. There's plenty
to learn: New York is the nation's third-largest archdiocese,
behind Los Angeles and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Egan has yet to even set his regular schedule for celebrating
Mass in the cathedral, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   But some things are already known about Egan: he is a firm
believer in church doctrine, unwavering in his opposition to
abortion and birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was born in Oak Park, Ill., the hometown of Ernest
Hemingway. He graduated from Rome's prestigious Gregorian
Pontifical University in 1958. Ordained in Rome, he spent the next
two decades in Chicago or the Vatican in several positions.
</P>
<P>
   Egan became a bishop in 1985, and spent the next three years
working with his predecessor, Cardinal John O'Connor, as vicar for
education in the archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he became bishop in Bridgeport, where he was hailed for
reorganizing diocesan schools, recruiting local men into the
priesthood, and fund-raising. But during his tenure, the diocese
was forced to defend itself against more than two dozen lawsuits
about alleged sexual molestation by local priests.
</P>
<P>
   Though all but one of the cases predated Egan's arrival, the
incidents raised embarrassing questions about whether the abuse was
covered up.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was named May 11 to replace O'Connor, who had died of
cancer eight days earlier after 16 years on the job. O'Connor will
be remembered in prayers at both ceremonies for Egan.
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop assumes his duties Sunday before an afternoon
prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   Egan will first bless the congregation with holy water before
his papal letter of appointment is read and notarized in the
cathedral's sanctuary. At that point, he officially becomes
archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Egan will celebrate the Mass of installation and
deliver the homily.
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop's namesake nephew, Edward Michael Egan, will
present the gifts for communion. The archbishop selected some music
for the Mass; a friend, opera star Renee Fleming, will perform
''Alleluia'' from Mozart's ''Exultate Jubilate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his farewell news conference at Bridgeport, Egan said one of
his major objectives in New York was bringing in more priests and
other religious vocations. In his first Mass at St. Patrick's, Egan
installed five new priests.
</P>
<P>
   All five will attend the Sunday service with Egan.
</P>
<P>
   He must also deal with the archdiocese's school system - 238
elementary schools and 55 high schools with 113,000 students. Egan
has said he hopes to keep all the schools open.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of unfinished business remains in Bridgeport, Conn. - on
June 27, he will return to ordain a group of permanent deacons
there. Two days later, he will be in Rome to receive the blessing
of Pope John Paul II in his new job.

<HEADLINE> Putin in Moldova for Gas Debt Talk  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
promised Saturday to help Moldova resolve a dispute over a
breakaway, Russian-speaking enclave and affirmed his support for
the territorial integrity of this impoverished former Soviet
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the Trans-Dniester region's problems would help Moscow
comply with a promise made last year by former President Boris
Yeltsin to remove the 2,500 Russian troops and equipment still
stationed on Moldovan territory by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and Ukrainian-speaking populations of Trans-Dniester
declared independence in 1990, fearing that the Romanian-speaking
leadership of the newly independent country would reunite with
neighboring Romania.
</P>
<P>
   A war erupted from 1991 to 1992 in which some 1,500 people died.
Russian troops stationed in Moldova since Soviet times intervened
in 1992 to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Putin announced at a news conference that had appointed former
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to head a ''settlement commission''
to help resolve the status of Trans-Dniester. Primakov was the
author of a 1997 memorandum which Moscow hopes will be the basis of
a settlement between Trans-Dniester and the Moldovan government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national interests of Russia are that Moldova should be
self-sufficient, territorially integral and independent,'' Putin
told reporters before departing for Moscow at the end of a 15-hour
visit.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Dniester, which borders Ukraine, comprises one-tenth of
Moldova's total land area and has an estimated population of
600,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moldovan sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Putin turned down a request by the leader of
Trans-Dniester separatists, Igor Smirnov, for a private meeting in
Chisinau.
</P>
<P>
   That was a clear signal to the separatists that Moscow expects
them to resolve their differences with Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi short of their goal of independence.
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference, Putin did not mention the withdrawal
agreement, which Yeltsin accepted during last year's summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE has expressed concern that although the deadline is
still nearly two years away, the Russians have announced no
timetable for the withdrawal. Trans-Dniester separatists oppose the
withdrawal because they consider the Russian troops their
protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats were concerned that Putin, who was elected
president on the promise to restore Russia's role in the world,
might be reluctant to remove Russian forces from a strategic area
against the wishes of the local Russian-speaking population.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Dniester has developed into a major smuggling center for
weapons and other supplies, depriving both Moldova and neighboring
Ukraine of customs revenues and presenting a threat to regional
security.
</P>
<P>
   ''During the negotiations, Putin said he does not intend to keep
Moldova on a short leash, including by using Russian troops,''
Lucinschi said.
</P>
<P>
   Less progress was evident, however, on the other major issue
between Russia and Moldova -- the country's $861 million debt to
Moscow for natural gas. Moldova's economy virtually collapsed after
the Russian currency crisis of 1998 undermined the principal market
for Moldovan exports, mostly wine and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   A Moldovan spokesman said Putin and Lucinschi discussed the debt
issue into the early hours of Saturday, but there was no
announcement of any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot go to the Russians with an outstretched hand, but
Russians cannot give aid without knowing they will be paid back,''
Lucinschi at the news conference.

<HEADLINE> Council Discusses Backing Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Lebanon still insisting that Israel
occupies part of its territory, the U.N. Security Council met
Saturday to discuss endorsing Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
announcement that Israel has completely withdrawn from southern
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A day after he first rejected the U.N. verification of Israel's
pullout, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Saturday that
Lebanon is committed to cooperating with the United Nations. But he
reiterated that the country ''insists on recovering every inch of
its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations had long planned to move in after an Israeli
pullout from southern Lebanon and verify that Israel had completely
left Lebanese soil. Before heading to the Middle East on Friday,
Annan announced that the world body had completed the verification
process.
</P>
<P>
   But Hoss quickly responded, saying Lebanese officers working
with the U.N. team inspecting the border had found several Israeli
military outposts inside Lebanon. His rejection of the U.N.
announcement was a setback for Annan, who had hoped to discuss the
next steps to achieve peace in the Middle East during his trip to
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the controversy will likely dominate Annan's meetings
in Beirut on Monday with top Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24. Under the 1978 Security
Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping troops were to help the
Lebanese army restore security and authority in the border zone
after U.N. workers verified Israel's departure.
</P>
<P>
   But the dispute over Israel's withdrawal has delayed the
deployment of the peacekeeping troops -- and more critically the
deployment of the Lebanese army to the region. The Lebanese army's
presence is important because since the Israeli pullout, Shiite
Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas who fought the Israeli troops for years
have moved into the former occupied zone and taken de facto
control.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla presence in the zone right across from Israel's
border is especially a concern for residents of northern Israeli
towns, who fear guerrilla attacks. On Saturday, Hezbollah warned it
will resume attacks on Israel's north if the Jewish state does not
give up tracts of land claimed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''All violations should be dealt with; ... otherwise we consider
the mission of liberating Lebanese territory to be incomplete and
resistance remains our choice to liberate the last inch of our
occupied land,'' Hezbollah said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The draft statement being debated by the Security Council calls
on the Lebanese government ''to ensure the return of its effective
authority and to maximize its presence in the south.'' It welcomes
measures taken by the secretary-general to beef up the 4,500-strong
U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, but it stresses that U.N.
redeployment to the border ''shall be carried out in coordination
with the redeployment of the Lebanese armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council endorsement of Israel's withdrawal would put
its political weight behind the U.N. position, rather than
Lebanon's. That could pose difficulties for some council members,
particularly Russia. Moscow has close ties to Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. force in Lebanon, said
Saturday that no peacekeepers will be deployed before matters are
sorted out with the Lebanese government, possibly during talks
Monday with Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said all along that Lebanese consent is a
prerequisite of U.N. deployment in any place in the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office welcomed Annan's declaration,
saying in a statement Saturday that it now expects the United
Nations to act to ''help restore law and order in the area.''

<HEADLINE> Court critical of Congress as it overturns conviction based on overseas crime </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Blaming inaction by Congress for forcing its
hand, a federal appeals court has reversed the sex-abuse conviction
of a man who fathered a child with his 13-year-old stepdaughter at
a U.S. military base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling made public Friday, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction over a case set
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court said it reached that conclusion ''with
regret,'' and noted it was taking the unusual step of forwarding a
copy of its opinion to the chairpersons of the House and Senate
Armed Forces and Judiciary committees so changes to laws can be
considered.
</P>
<P>
   The comments came in a written decision dated Thursday. The
appeals court said the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn was not the
appropriate venue to bring charges against a civilian who committed
a crime in Germany. It then dismissed the indictment against the
defendant, Milton Gatlin.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reversed his guilty plea in Brooklyn to a charge of
sexually abusing a minor. A message left with his lawyer for
comment was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin was charged with a crime which prosecutors allege
occurred after March 1993, when he married Gail Taylor, a U.S. Army
sergeant stationed at an Army base in Darmstadt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said that sometime in August 1996, while his
wife was on duty in Bosnia, Gatlin began having sexual intercourse
in Germany with a 13-year-old daughter of Taylor by a previous
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Gatlin, who was 34 years old at the time,
continued to have sexual relations with the girl regularly through
at least January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the United States, she gave birth to a child
in September 1997, and later revealed that she had been having sex
with Gatlin, the court said. A genetic test later confirmed his
paternity.
</P>
<P>
   Gatlin was charged with engaging in sexual acts with a minor. He
pleaded guilty after a judge in Brooklyn rejected a defense request
to have the charges dismissed because the alleged crime occurred
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, Gatlin was sentenced to four years and three months
in prison and was ordered to pay $1,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   In throwing out the case against him, the 2nd Circuit said its
ruling ''should come as little surprise to anyone familiar with the
history of criminal prosecution of civilians accompanying the
military overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court rulings as far back as 1957 have found that
civilians accompanying the military overseas cannot be prosecuted
in the United States, the court said. But each time, critics,
including government commissions and independent scholars, demanded
that Congress change laws to allow the prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the court noted, Congress thus far has not ''responded to
this call for legislation, though its inaction hardly can be blamed
on a lack of awareness of the gap. Indeed, Congress has held
several hearings on the matter, and, over the last four decades,
has entertained more than 30 bills aimed at closing the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the court acknowledged that Congress has passed laws
allowing the prosecution of certain crimes such as terrorism when
they occur outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In one footnote, the 2nd Circuit referenced an earlier case in
the United States in which charges against two women were dropped
even though evidence showed they had brutally killed their
husbands, both American soldiers, while the families were stationed
on military bases overseas.

<HEADLINE> Navy Detains 56 Protesters in Range  </HEADLINE>
By ISMAEL TORRES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Navy officers detained 56
demonstrators Saturday who had invaded the U.S. military bombing
range on Vieques to demand the Navy leave the small Caribbean
island.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 56 people arrested, 19 were released on Vieques after
being cited to appear in federal court on trespassing charges, Navy
spokesman Robert Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37 others were taken to the naval base on the main island of
Puerto Rico, where four were cited and released, and 33 remained in
custody because they were ''not being cooperative,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not giving the information necessary to cite them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy lawyers were talking with ''all the appropriate people,''
including federal magistrates, to decide how to proceed with the
33. A court date has not been set for those cited, but they could
appear in court as early as Monday, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested were 20 doctors -- from surgeons to general
practitioners -- who said in a statement: ''We are a group
representing Puerto Rican doctors who are concerned about the
health and future of the people of Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he didn't know if the doctors were among those
detained at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of resentment over the Navy's presence on Vieques boiled
over in April 1999, when a jet dropped two 500-pound bombs
off-target and killed a civilian security guard. It was the first
fatality in 60 years since the Navy took over two-thirds of the
20-mile-long island, dislodging thousands of residents. Some 9,300
civilians now live there.
</P>
<P>
   People's anger was compounded when the Navy admitted it had
illegally and accidentally fired 263 armor-piercing bullets tipped
with depleted uranium on the range in February 1999, and Puerto
Rican officials said they were never informed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters occupied the range for a year to prevent
more bombing. They were forced out in a federal operation May 4,
and the Navy resumed training under a deal that calls for a
referendum before February 2002 and the use of inert ordnance until
after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the Navy loses the vote, it would have to leave the island by
May 2003, giving up a site it says is crucial for the kind of
realistic training that saves lives in combat.
</P>
<P>
   But many Vieques residents accuse the Navy of contaminating
their environment, destroying fishing grounds and coral reefs,
keeping away tourists, and contributing to a 14 percent
unemployment rate. Dozens are filing lawsuits claiming their health
problems, from respiratory illnesses to cancers, are related to the
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was
leading a group of scientists Saturday to test the island's soil
and water to support a separate suit against the U.S. government
over environmental and human rights issues in Vieques.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Publisher Imprisoned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An Iranian publisher has been imprisoned for
insulting Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, during the
February election campaign, newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Alireza Khoshandam, who runs a small book-publishing house
called Creative Dialogue Publications, was prosecuted for remarks
made during his unsuccessful bid to gain election to parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-line Revolutionary Court sentenced Khoshandam to prison
on Thursday, the reformist Hayat-e-Nou reported. His sentence was
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The charges against him include insulting . . . the Supreme
Leader in his election campaign speeches,'' the paper said.
Insulting Khamenei or questioning his absolute power is a
punishable offense in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why Khoshandam was only sent to prison now. No
other details were available.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners in the judiciary opposed to the reforms of President
Mohammad Khatami have ordered the arrest of several journalists and
the closure of 19 publications since April.
</P>
<P>
   A press bill being drafted in parliament seeks to prohibit the
Special Clergy Court and the Revolutionary Court from taking any
action against journalists. In the Feb. 18 elections, reformists
won a majority in parliament for the first time since the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would prohibit the arbitrary closure of a newspaper
without judicial process. It would also ban no-jury trials for
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The media has been at the forefront of the Khatami-led campaign
for political and social reform.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners say the reforms violate Islamic principles.

<HEADLINE> NATO Removing Kosovo Arms Cache  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLECKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers started removing
ordnance Saturday from the biggest illegal weapons cache uncovered
in Kosovo since the end of fighting last year -- arms a British
commander said were ''almost certainly'' hidden by ethnic Albanian
extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that this is a very significant find,'' Brig. Gen.
Richard Shireff, commander of British forces in Kosovo, said of the
stacks of grenades, machine guns and other weapons. ''It is almost
certainly, almost entirely Albanian. All evidence we got here
suggests that it is former KLA material.''
</P>
<P>
   KLA is an acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army, a group of
ethnic Albanian separatists who fought a Serb crackdown in this
province. The leadership of the now formally disbanded KLA must
have known about the weapon cache, and not divulging it as part of
Kosovo's peace settlement reflects a ''degree of noncompliance,''
Shireff said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officers said the weapons and ammunition were found Friday
in this former KLA stronghold 20 miles southwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Two underground bunkers were stacked to the ceilings with
grenades, mortars, ammunition, heavy machine guns, rocket-propelled
grenades and other ordnance. Shireff said it appeared that some
weapons had been recently removed. Other storage areas were found
Saturday but it was unclear what they contained.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said that Agim
Ceku, the former military chief of the KLA, met Saturday with
senior representatives of Kosovo's Western diplomatic community.
The arms find apparently was at the center of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Ceku now heads the Kosovo Protection Corps. The corps is
officially a civil emergency response unit, but the Serbs say it
actually is the successor to the KLA, which fought them in Kosovo
until NATO forced an end to the bloodshed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In September, NATO-led peacekeepers declared that the KLA had
complied with orders to turn over all its weapons. On Sept. 20,
NATO agreed to reorganize the KLA into the protection force under a
deal personally negotiated by NATO's supreme commander for Europe,
Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
   British Lt. Col. David Allfrey, who commanded the search
operation, suggested some of the missing weapons could have been
used in recent attacks against Serb civilians. Serb community
leaders believe such attacks are part of a campaign by ethnic
Albanians to drive them from the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''What their designs are, it's not my position to say,'' Allfrey
said. ''But there have been a few killings in the Serb community in
the last couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The cache was discovered as part of an exhaustive search for
weapons. The search, which began Thursday, involved hundreds of
peacekeepers and covered more than 38 square miles of central
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A military training area was near the bunkers, which appeared to
be well-kept. There were fresh footprints, according to NATO
personnel on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly been used for training. There is a very large
quantity of ammunition,'' Allfrey said. NATO officers suggested
that they expected to find even more arms, saying there appeared to
be tunnels leading to other depots nearby.

<HEADLINE> Syria Takes Steps for New Leader  </HEADLINE>
By HAMZA HENDAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria's ruling Baath Party opened its
first conference in 15 years Saturday to elect Bashar Assad party
leader and declare his candidacy for president, putting him closer
to succeeding his father, the late President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, held a week after Assad died of a heart attack,
began on a somber note, with Bashar Assad among about 1,000
delegates observing a minute's silence after repeating the Baath
party slogan: ''One Arab nation with an immortal mission.'' The
standing delegates then chanted the party anthem without music or
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight at the conference venue, a modern
marble-and-glass conference hall that is part of a hotel complex 10
miles south of the capital, Damascus. Armed troops of the elite
Republican Guards lined the road and manned a roadblock 1.2 miles
away. They were also deployed in the woods surrounding the
conference hall, while armed security men in business suits were
inside the building.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black suit, a tie and an expressionless face, Bashar
Assad took his seat in the front row of the wood-paneled hall and
listened to two hours of speeches, most lavishing praise on him and
his late father.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear when during the five-day conference the party
members would elect Bashar Assad to lead the party, or when they
would nominate him for the presidency. The proceedings were also to
focus on assessing the party's rule.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening speech, Suleiman Qaddah, assistant
secretary-general of the party, vowed it would remain loyal to
Assad's policies. ''We salute the hope of the future ... Bashar
Assad. We are with you, comrade, and behind you we will continue
the march to express our commitment and loyalty to the path of
(Assad).''
</P>
<P>
   The party meeting was part of an official script laid out for
Bashar Assad, a political novice, to fill the vacuum left by his
father's death June 10 after 30 years at the helm of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week, Bashar Assad has been declared commander of
the armed forces and promoted from colonel to general. The
country's rubber-stamp parliament also lowered the minimum age for
a president from 40 to 34 -- his age.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad is a Baath party member -- one of an estimated 1.5
million -- but until now has not held any formal position in the
party. At the conference, expected to last up to five days, the
delegates are to elect a new 90-person central committee, which
will then elect a new 21-member national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The party already has announced an initial nomination of Bashar
Assad for president, and a formal nomination is expected to be
announced during the conference. This will pave the way for the
People's Assembly to endorse the nomination and set a date for a
nationwide referendum when it meets June 25. There have been
reports that parliament might meet earlier.
</P>
<P>
   A plebiscite is not expected to be held before the traditional
40-day mourning over President Assad's death ends around July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's succession, however, appears to be a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of posters and banners declaring him the
nation's hope for the future are displayed across the country.
Coverage of his activity and his photographs have filled the pages
of the country's three main newspapers -- all tightly controlled by
the state -- since his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad's sudden ascendancy came as a surprise to some,
given Syria's history of political bickering and bloody upheaval.
Analysts believe it was helped by his image as a ''consensus
candidate'' and by Syria's powerful propaganda machine, which has
long indoctrinated Syrians with the idea that it is in the nation's
interest for the highest office to remain in the Assad family.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe that it will take months, perhaps a
year, before Bashar Assad effectively takes the reins of power and
becomes the country's sole strongman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a question of political experiences, and his are not so
deep,'' said Hassan Abu Taleb, a Syria expert at Cairo's Al-Ahram
Center for Political and Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar Assad had to cut short a career as an eye doctor when his
elder brother Basil, his father's first choice as successor, was
killed in a 1994 car accident. He has since been groomed for
succession by his father, whose health had been poor since the
1980s.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Kill 34 Villagers in India  </HEADLINE>
By INDRANIL SINGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Black-garbed gunmen stormed a village while
its residents slept early Saturday, executing 34 women, children
and old men after the latest caste-related battle in India's
poorest and most lawless province.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers, identified as members of an upper-caste militia
backed by rich landlords, fought a gunbattle with several armed
villagers for 2&AMP;frac12; hours until the residents ran out of ammunition,
said M.V. Rao, police superintendent of the Aurangabad area in
Bihar state, where the massacre took place.
</P>
<P>
   Then the attackers stormed several homes and ordered the women,
children and elders to stand in a line. They were shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were sleeping, and suddenly the firing started,'' said
Anupama Devi, 68, whose two daughters-in-law were killed in the
attack. ''I ran out and screamed, 'Why are you killing us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Devi quoted one of the attackers as shouting: ''Shut up, we have
come to take revenge.'' Satyendra Singh, 23, whose brother was
killed, said some of the attackers were injured and taken away by
their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the handiwork of the Ranvir Sena,'' Rao told The
Associated Press, referring to the upper caste militia.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, a young girl, seven boys, 19 women and seven old men
-- all members of lower castes -- were killed in Miapur village in
east India. Fifteen people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Caste-related violence often flares in Bihar state between the
Ranvir Sena and Maoist guerrillas belonging to the People's War
Group and the Maoist Communist Center, who say they represent the
underclass. Revenge attacks are often carried out against villagers
and scores die each year.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said hatred between different castes in the
centuries-old social hierarchy of Hindus, who form nearly 83
percent of India's 1 billion people, was not the only reason for
the seemingly unending cycle of killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a problem of caste or policing. It is a problem of
infighting among the political bosses,'' said Shivendra Narayan,
senior anthropologist at the independent A.N. Sinha Institute of
Social Sciences in Patna.
</P>
<P>
   Rival political parties in the state accuse each other of
funding rival groups. Hundreds of unemployed youth in Bihar are
sucked into the rivalry and end up joining the rival groups
according to their caste affiliations, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Maoist rebels in the state rode to strength along with the rise
of a slew of political parties that represent the landless lower
caste people. To fight their growing influence, powerful landowners
started creating their own militias.
</P>
<P>
   ''The electoral empowerment of the lower castes has contributed
to the violence,'' said Saibal Gupta of the Asian Development
Research Institute. ''For a person here, his caste is his only
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no one claimed responsibility for the massacre,
eyewitnesses said the killers announced they were acting in
retaliation for the killing of 11 upper caste villagers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have since rushed about 400 police to Miapur. Angry
villagers refused to allow district officials to take away the
bodies of the victims, saying they wanted Rabri Devi, the chief
minister of Bihar, to come to Miapur.
</P>
<P>
   The state's police chief said his men had sealed the borders of
the district and were searching for the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Miapur, a village accessible only by foot, is 5 miles from
Senari village, where 34 upper caste villagers were killed by the
Maoist Communist Center last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia Bombards Chechnya Rebels  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian artillery and warplanes bombarded
Chechen fighters' mountain refuges with long-range guns and rocket
launchers Saturday, trying to hit suspected rebel positions in the
key Argun Gorge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the bombardment near the southern town of Shatoi
included salvos from truck-mounted Grad rocket launchers and
followed overnight shelling.
</P>
<P>
   Russian attack jets flew 18 combat missions in the previous 24
hours, bombing suspected rebel bases in the gorge, the military
command's news service said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Argun Gorge is a key rebel refuge and supply route to
Georgia, the only foreign country bordering Chechnya. Russian
forces have been trying to wipe out guerrilla bands hiding in the
mountains, using their massive advantage in firepower while
avoiding close combat.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have fought back with hit-and-run attacks that have
inflicted a steady stream of Russian casualties and chipped away at
the federal troops' morale. According to the Interior Ministry,
federal checkpoints and stations came under fire 23 times over the
preceding 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian policeman was killed and two were wounded when
unidentified gunmen opened fire on a checkpoint in Chechnya's
capital, Grozny, the regional Interior Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A woman passer-by was also wounded in the attack Friday night, a
ministry spokesman said. The attackers fired on the checkpoint from
a speeding car and eluded capture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police have established the identities of gunmen who
killed a Muslim cleric in Chechnya on Friday, the spokesman told
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Umar Idrisov, an imam or Muslim leader, was shot and killed by
attackers who burst into his home in Urus-Martan in southwestern
Chechnya. According to the Chechen branch of the Interior Ministry,
Idrisov was killed by members of the rebel gang led by warlord
Magomed Tsagarayev.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday night, rebels inside Chechnya fired grenade
launchers and submachine guns at a Russian police checkpoint in the
neighboring republic of Dagestan, police officials told ITAR-Tass.
Police returned fire; there were no casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, a funeral service was held Saturday for Gen. Gennady
Shpigun, the Interior Ministry's envoy to Chechnya, who died in
rebel captivity. Shpigun was buried in Moscow's Preobrazhenskoye
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gennady Shpigun's death has united us, and we will do our best
to establish constitutional order in Chechnya,'' Interior Minister
Vladimir Rushailo said at the funeral service. He called Shpigun's
death ''a very heavy loss for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shpigun was kidnapped by Islamic militants at Grozny's airport
on March 5 last year. A rebel taken prisoner by the Russians told
the Interior Ministry that Shpigun had died of a heart attack, but
the Prosecutor General's office said Friday that experts had not
been able to pinpoint the cause or time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were expelled from Chechnya after a 1994-96 war
with independence fighters. They re-entered the republic after
Islamic militants seized several villages in the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Guatemalans Fear Crime Wave  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- In the city, guns will soon outnumber
people. In the countryside, heavily armed private security forces
are becoming more common than electricity and phone service.
</P>
<P>
   Crime has gotten so out of hand that 4,000 rifle-toting
Guatemalan soldiers took to the streets Saturday to aid an
overworked police force.
</P>
<P>
   Even the vice president, a camera-shy bureaucrat known here
mainly for blending into the furniture, surprised Guatemalans by
appearing on television May 29 to plead for the crime wave to
abate, if even just slightly.
</P>
<P>
   But for many Guatemalans none of it is enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable figures for the crime rate, but gun sales
give a gauge of how rampant fear of crime is. In the last six
months, purchases of security services and weapons are up 50
percent on rates that were already among the highest in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Already in Guatemala City there are 1.5 million guns, about as
many firearms as people. Even conservative estimates show guns will
outnumber people by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't keep any popular models on the shelves,'' said Ricardo
Umana, owner of Gun Depot, a small store in a wealthy suburban
Guatemala City neighborhood, packed from floor to ceiling with
handguns, shotguns and assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of my customers used to be hunters, but now everyone
everywhere is buying guns,'' Umana said.
</P>
<P>
   The capital sports concealed-weapon laws more lenient than
Texas. Security guards brandishing assault rifles and shotguns
guard every bank, electronics store and shopping mall and can even
be found keeping an eye on McDonald's in some of the city's rougher
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Guatemala City, where guns have become harder to find
since the end of the 36-year civil war in 1996, residents have
begun forming armed groups, known as ''security juntas'', aimed at
scaring would-be criminals out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are now easily more of these groups than there are
police officers,'' said Cesar Saldavar, police chief for rural
Peten, Guatemala's northernmost state. ''All the guns left over
from the war are going into the hands of groups organizing to kill
and frighten criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   In the western, mostly Indian state of Quiche, authorities
report that security juntas have arisen in the region's five
largest municipalities and are growing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really don't know how many guns there are here in Quiche
now. We may be up to civil war levels,'' a police spokesman said on
customary condition of anonymity. ''We have to be worried a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups serve mainly to intimidate potential criminals, but
that doesn't stop citizens from taking matters into their own
hands: Lynchings have become common throughout rural Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Guatemalans mobilize to protect themselves, some say the
simplest way to end crime problems would be to return to the
country's dictatorial past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone says if (former dictator Gen. Efrain) Rios Montt took
power again all of the criminals would flee, that they would leave
the country,'' said Enrique Lucero, 41, as he waited for a bus in
an affluent southern Guatemala City neighborhood where he works as
a housepainter. ''The general doesn't tolerate crime, and everyone
knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt, the current president of the legislature, ruled
Guatemala with an iron fist from 1982-83, an 18-month tenure in
which he oversaw arguably the bloodiest days of the civil war. The
December 1996 peace accords finally brought fighting between state
forces and leftist guerillas to an end, but only after some 200,000
Guatemalans had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Guatemala's 1985 constitution bars Rios Montt, 71, from assuming
Guatemala's highest office again. But President Alfonso Portillo,
who is a member of the party Rios Montt founded and campaigned
closely with the ex-dictator during last fall's elections, is
lobbying for a special congressional session to repeal the
constitution -- and clear the way for another Rios Montt presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt has refused to talk to the news media about apparent
attempts to return him to power. But he supported a new law that
lets an army that once went to war against its own people to take
to the streets again, this time to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fighting this kind of violence in whatever manner we can is a
good idea,'' Rios Montt said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's 1st Nonwhite Chief Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Ismail Mohamed, the first
nonwhite to serve as chief justice in South Africa, died of
pancreatic cancer in a Johannesburg hospital Saturday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, who was of Indian descent, defended anti-apartheid
activists for decades and was considered one of the most gifted
orators among South Africa's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He became the country's first nonwhite judge in 1991, when South
Africa was still ruled by the white minority. Former President
Nelson Mandela named him chief justice of the Supreme Court of
Appeal in 1996. He held the post until his illness forced him to
step down in February.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, a devout Muslim, studied law at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, one of the country's top
universities. But after he passed the bar in 1957, apartheid laws
prevented him from renting chambers in the building that housed the
Johannesburg Bar, which was located in a whites-only area.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, Mohamed was forced to borrow desk space from
colleagues when they were busy in court and decamp to the law
library when they returned. He eventually obtained a special permit
in 1969, but still faced numerous restrictions under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed was considered an expert on the Group Areas Act, which
segregated neighborhoods by race. He was also a leading authority
on constitutional law. He helped author the constitution for
neighboring Namibia, which gained independence from South Africa in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   When he was named chief justice, Mohamed had to move to the
judicial capital of Bloemfontein, a place that brought back painful
memories.
</P>
<P>
   During the apartheid era, Bloemfontein was part of the Orange
Free State, which for years barred Indians from remaining in the
province overnight. When working in the province, he had to leave
each night before dusk and return the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''My return to that province revives fresh wounds and painful
memories which I cannot and would not want to obliterate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon becoming chief justice, Mohamed said he hoped to contribute
to ''the urgent need to salvage the image of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The judiciary needs to be a friend and protector of the
people, instead of an instrument of racial, gender and political
oppression,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Same three digits picked two nights in a row in New York Numbers drawing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Lottery players - and state officials who
pick the numbers - did a doubletake Friday when the same three New
York Numbers popped up in the same order for the second day in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a completely random occurrence,'' said Susan Miller,
Lottery spokeswoman. ''Different machines, different balls.''

   On Thursday and Friday, the numbers selected were 0, 8, and 4.
The top prize for the game is $500.
</P>
<P>
   Miller could not say what the odds were of the numbers coming up
twice in random drawings.
</P>
<P>
   The Win 4 numbers were also similar on both nights, though in
different orders. On Thursday, 0, 8, 7, 1 popped up and on Friday
the Win 4 numbers were 8, 9, 1, and 0.

<HEADLINE> Lazio: Missed vote just part of the campaign  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKDALE, N.Y. (AP) - Two days after missing a Congressional
vote, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio said Saturday that he will remain in the
House while campaigning and trust that New York voters will
understand when there are conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not considering stepping down,'' Lazio told reporters at
a ceremony honoring veterans of the Normandy invasion. ''I think
it's a matter of duty ... We're staying in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, missed
Thursday's vote on a $10 million funding bill that would have
established a 2 million barrel home heating oil reserve. Lazio
supported the bill, which was voted down in the House, 195-193.
</P>
<P>
   The four-term Congressman was flying back to New York, where he
had a full day of campaigning on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to miss some votes, because I need to get around
the state,'' said Lazio, who boasted a 99 percent attendance record
in Congress. ''We got into this race very late. It's the nature of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Republican said he believed New York voters
would understand when he was absent from Washington because of the
campaign: ''I think people understood it when (Democrat) Chuck
Schumer ran for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio also used the opportunity to take a shot at his Democratic
opponent, first lady Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''My opponent has yet to cast a single legislative vote, so I'm
really proud of my attendance record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton unveiled two new television ads that
questioned Lazio's voting record. ''Rick Lazio: The more you know
... the more you wonder,'' the ads said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the ads, Lazio said Clinton had embraced ''negative
campaigning and distortions. ... They would like me to slip down to
that level, to get down in the mud where they are now, but I'm not
going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a Clinton spokesman, said there wasn't any real
change in strategy and that the candidate and her campaign have
been spelling out differences with Lazio ever since he entered the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to talk about the issue differences. They're
significant,'' Wolfson said.

<HEADLINE> Sunbathers to be booted from Higbee Beach to restore bird habitat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOWER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Sunbathers - clothed and nude alike
- will be banned from a portion of Higbee Beach beginning next
summer, in an effort to give terns, gulls and other shore birds a
safe place to nest and feed.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the state Division of Fish and Wildlife to make
the 1,000-foot stretch of sand off-limits comes a year after nude
sunbathers were forbidden at the Cape May County beach.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have said they want to see if shore birds will
return to the area if they are protected from human interference.
</P>
<P>
   ''If keeping human beings out of there doesn't bring the birds
back, the area will be opened up again in a year or two,'' Jo Ann
Cubberly, the head of the state Bureau of Tidelands Management,
told The Star-Ledger of Newark for Saturday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year ban, which will stretch from May 1 to Sept. 15,
will not begin until next summer. Other parts of Higbee will remain
open.
</P>
<P>
   Higbee Beach's popularity with nude sunbathers came to an end
last year when Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bill enabling local
governments to control behavior on state property. The beach, part
of a 1,000-acre wildlife management area, is one of only a few
maritime forests remaining at the shore.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to curb lewd behavior that had been reported in
the area, Lower Township passed an ordinance banning nude
sunbathing in 1988. But part of the beach is located on federal
land, and a Cape May Court House couple fought the state law and
local ordinance on the grounds that the township had no right to
regulate federal property.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature has approved a bill - now awaiting
Whitman's signature - to close that loophole.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian P.M. Resignation Expected  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's prime minister is expected to
tender his government's resignation Sunday, clearing the way for
King Abdullah II to appoint a replacement, government officials
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports emerged Thursday that a Cabinet reshuffle was imminent,
but there has been no official word on why Prime Minister
Abdur-Ra'uf S. Rawabdeh is to step down. In April, though, a group
of legislators urged Abdullah to dismiss the government, accusing
it of failing to deliver on political and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Rawabdeh, the first prime minister to serve under Abdullah since
he ascended the throne in February 1999, is seen as conservative.
Abdullah is believed to be impatient for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is likely to ask Ali Abu Ragheb, a senior economist and
former trade and industry minister, to form a new Cabinet,
government officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ragheb, who studied in the United States, heads the
parliament's economic committee and is a member of an economic
consultative council chaired by Abdullah. He is known to advocate
liberal economic reform and the privatization of profitable state
firms.
</P>
<P>
   The king has often consulted Abu Ragheb on economic policy.

<HEADLINE> Navy Detains 56 Vieques Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By ISMAEL TORRES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Navy officers detained 56
demonstrators Saturday after they invaded the U.S. Navy bombing
range on Vieques island and demanded that the Navy leave.
</P>
<P>
   Among those detained on the small Puerto Rican island were 20
doctors -- from surgeons to general practitioners -- who said in a
statement: ''We are a group representing Puerto Rican doctors who
are concerned about the health and future of the people of
Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   All the protesters were cited to appear in federal court to be
charged with trespassing, Navy spokesman Robert Nelson said. They
were subsequently released. Nelson said he did not know when they
will appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of resentment over the Navy's presence on Vieques boiled
over in April 1999, when a jet dropped two 500-pound bombs
off-target and killed a civilian security guard. It was the first
fatality in 60 years since the Navy took over two-thirds of the
20-mile-long island, dislodging thousands of residents and using
part of the island as a practice bombing range. Some 9,300
civilians now live on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   People's anger was compounded when the Navy admitted it had
illegally and accidentally fired 263 armor-piercing bullets tipped
with depleted uranium on the range in February 1999. Puerto Rican
officials said they were never informed.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters occupied the range for a year to prevent
more bombing. They were forced out in a federal raid May 4, and the
Navy resumed training under a deal that calls for a referendum
before February 2002 and the use of non-exploding practice bombs
until after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If the Navy loses the referendum, it would have to leave the
island by May 2003, giving up a site it says is crucial for the
kind of realistic training that saves lives in combat.
</P>
<P>
   But many Vieques residents accuse the Navy of contaminating
their environment, destroying fishing grounds and coral reefs,
keeping away tourists and contributing to a 14 percent unemployment
rate. Dozens are filing lawsuits claiming their health problems,
from respiratory illnesses to cancers, are related to the military
exercises.

<HEADLINE> Serb Opposition Leader Healing  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's best-known opposition
leader said Saturday he will remain in Montenegro while recovering
from a gun attack he claims was organized by President Slobodan
Milosevic's government.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin police said they had arrested those responsible for
the attack on Vuk Draskovic, who was slightly wounded when gunmen
fired into his vacation home at about midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police refused to give more details or say how many suspects
were in custody. But Montenegrin Deputy Interior Minister Vuk
Boskovic said the attackers had ''followed Draskovic all the way
from Serbia with a murderous intention.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin authorities had promised a fuller statement
Saturday, but gave none. They also did not provide any evidence to
support the claim that the assailants had come from Serbia --
Milosevic's stronghold and the larger of the two Yugoslav
republics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is quite clear that those who ordered (the attack) are in
Belgrade,'' Boskovic told the Montenegrin newspaper Vijesti. He
said police found the apartment where the assailants had planned
the attack, together with ''weapons and gloves'' used in the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said he did not know how long he would stay in
Montenegro, where the pro-Western government opposes Milosevic.
Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, said he had
decided to stay for ''medical assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters Friday that orders for ''my liquidation could
not have been reached without the knowledge of those who run the
country. And in this case, it is Slobodan Milosevic and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Yugoslav Telecommunications Minister Ivan Markovic
ridiculed the allegations of government involvement, saying
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Montenegrin President Milo
Djukanovic and ''terrorists'' from a militant student organization
had all decided ''to publicly support Draskovic, with the aim to
disrupt his vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indirectly, he was inferring that the U.S. and pro-Western
opposition had staged the shooting to drum up popular support for
Draskovic and discredit the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
   The state Tanjug news agency also sought to dismiss Draskovic's
accusations and cast doubts on his account of the attack. ''It is
strange that Draskovic was shot at four times from the terrace of
his house, and that he suffered only a pierced ear and a light
flesh wound on his head,'' Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Draskovic hurriedly left the scene, probably to think how to
concoct something,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanjug said ''nobody in his right mind'' wanted to solve
political conflicts ''through violence and assassinations.'' It
went on to repeat allegations that Montenegro's government is
subservient to the United States, which wants ''by hook or by
crook'' to bring to power ''obedient puppet politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Draskovic is undoubtedly of that kind,'' Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed by the attack, Montenegrin authorities demoted two
senior security officers. Montenegro's interior minister, Vukasin
Maras, said he would offer his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Draskovic lives in Serbia, he regularly spends the
summer along the Adriatic coast in Montenegro. He ordinarily
travels with his own security, but two weeks ago his four
bodyguards were arrested in Belgrade for illegal weapons
possession.

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush predicted today his older brother, George
W. Bush, will win Florida and contended Al Gore's campaign was ''bluffing''
about its ability to compete in the state. Jeb Bush said Democrats also
exaggerated strength in Florida 12 years ago when his father, George Bush, beat
Democrat Michael S. Dukakis. Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state, which
has 25 electoral votes, fourth most in the country. But a Florida poll in May

through the rubble of their charred homes today, firefighters worked in rain and
light snow to cut off two wildfires burning in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains. Some homeowners were left with nothing; others found houses
mercifully spared by the blazes that have blackened nearly 20,000 acres and
destroyed 54 homes since Monday. ''It's smoky in here; it's not too bad,'' said
Ceilly Robl, as she walked through her home near the fire's edge southwest of
Denver. ''There were several times we thought it was going to go. I could see
the fire coming.''

   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria's ruling Baath Party opened its first
conference in 15 years Saturday to elect Bashar Assad party leader and declare
his candidacy for president, putting him closer to succeeding his father, the
late President Hafez Assad. It was unclear when during the five-day conference
the party members would elect Bashar Assad to lead the party, or when they would
nominate him for the presidency. The proceedings were also to focus on assessing
the party's rule.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With Lebanon still insisting that Israel occupies part

Secretary-General Kofi Annan's announcement that Israel has completely withdrawn
from southern Lebanon. A day after he first rejected the U.N. verification of
Israel's pullout, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said Saturday that Lebanon
is committed to cooperating with the United Nations. But he reiterated that the

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In another sign that North Korea may be opening
up, the country's Red Cross Saturday said talks should begin this month to
reunite families separated by the Korean War. The telegram to the South Korean
Red Cross was a surprisingly quick move to begin implementing one of a series of
agreements struck by the leaders of the two Koreas during their historic
three-day summit. An estimated 1.2 million war refugees from the North are
living in South Korea today. More than half are over the age of 60; more than
200,000 are in their 70s. Most left behind relatives in the North.

Clinton: Tighten Biological Weapons Ban

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today renewed his suggestion that a new

international agreements that outlaw biological weapons. The president's appeal
came on the 75th anniversary of the Geneva agreement that first banned chemical
and biological weapons from the battlefield. ''Today, one of the greatest
threats to American and global security is the danger that adversary nations or
terrorist groups will obtain or use chemical or biological weapons,'' the
president said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Rocks Iceland  </HEADLINE>
By MARGRET BJORGULFSDOTTIR
<TEXT>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook southern
Iceland on Saturday, causing structural damage to houses in a
village near the epicenter but no known injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington D.C. said the quake
measured magnitude 6.6, which would make it the strongest in
Iceland since a 7.0-magnitude quake on May 6, 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland's meteorological institute said Saturday's quake had a
magnitude of about 5.7, although it said it hadn't completed
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists on the small Scandinavian island said the quake had
originated 5.6 miles south of Arnes, a tiny community near the
village of Hella, south of the capital, Reykjavik. Some houses at
the center suffered severe structural damage and were no longer
usable.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical power was cut in several areas, but was quickly
restored, while water pipes broke in nearby villages and farms.
</P>
<P>
   Fallen rock obstructed some area roads, but none had to be
closed. Three bridges on main routes across the island's south were
closed for engineering checks and later reopened.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, but the Civil Defense Authority sent
volunteer rescue squads to check on families at outlying farms.
</P>
<P>
   The quake struck at about 3:40 p.m. local time on Saturday, as
people were celebrating Iceland's national day with gatherings at
community halls for afternoon coffee. Many returned to their homes
to find the contents in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Iceland, where there are many active volcanoes, frequently
experiences minor earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> White Man Begins Trial in Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ROYSE
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- When the first pipe bomb exploded,
students at Florida A&AMP;M University were startled, but not in fear.
No one was hurt and the damage was slight.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sept. 1, the usual grind of a just-started year
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, another pipe bomb exploded on campus, this time
accompanied by a racist phone call to a local television station
warning: ''This is just the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were no injuries, news of the threat spread fear
across the predominantly black college campus. The school's once
idyllic city-on-a-hill atmosphere was transformed into a compound
of ID checks, police checkpoints and bomb sweeps of the buildings
each morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, FAMU President Frederick Humphries said the
12,000-student campus was trying hard not to adopt a siege
mentality. But as he surveyed a phalanx of police walking across
the quad just before a potentially frightening fall football
Saturday, he admitted: ''It's playing with the very life of our
university.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb scares ended in late October after the arrest of an
out-of-work former embalmer. On Monday, Lawrence Lombardi, 42,
faces a jury that will decide whether he is guilty of planting two
bombs in campus buildings and carrying out a hate crime. If
convicted, he could face life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The federal trial was moved about 200 miles west of the
university to Pensacola because U.S. District Judge Robert L.
Hinkle feared local jurors could be swayed by concerns about race
relations in Tallahassee
</P>
<P>
   But as prosecutors seek to convict Lombardi, a former Marine who
once had a snack delivery route that took him to the FAMU campus,
the fear among students has faded.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't heard a conversation about the bombing in so long,''
said Derric Heck, a senior architecture major from Brunswick, Ga.,
and president of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, as vice president, Heck spent days meeting with
college administrators about security concerns after the
explosions. But as his last year of college draws to a close, Heck
said he and his peers have moved on.
</P>
<P>
   For Humphries and others who have lived through racial violence
before say they will be watching as the justice system wrestles
once again with race-based hate.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people will be paying attention to this court case,''
Humphries said. ''People are paying attention with an eye toward:
When is this kind of stuff going to end? And when are we going to
respect each other?''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case has been kept secret and most of the
court file in the case is sealed. The federal judge in Tallahassee
who made that decision said some of the material is unlikely to be
admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors will not comment on the case, and Lombardi's
attorney, Tim Jansen, also said last week he couldn't comment
before the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi, whose only previous run-in with the law was a long-ago
DUI, has maintained his innocence. During a pretrial hearing,
Jansen said the government's case against his client was weak.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evidence he in fact manufactured any item,'' Jansen
told the judge who ordered Lombardi held in prison until the trial.
''They can't prove he made the device, they can't even prove he was
at FAMU.''
</P>
<P>
   Police painted Lombardi as a racist whose former co-workers told
them he doesn't like black people and frequently used racial slurs.
Detectives said they were led to Lombardi after former co-workers
identified him from a photo taken at a home improvement store and
recognized his voice from a tape of the call to the TV station.

<HEADLINE> Bush Criticizes Security Lapse  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush chastised the Clinton
administration Saturday for its handling of nuclear secrets at the
Los Alamos weapons laboratory, saying that ''America's nuclear
security should not be a matter of lost and found.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, appearing with his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at the
state convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, also blamed the
administration for a ''slow slide to military weakness'' shown
through poor military recruiting and low morale within the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor pledged to rebuild military strength with
lighter and more lethal weapons, and to restore morale by giving
troops clear missions and reducing peacekeeping assignments.
</P>
<P>
   At Los Alamos, two computer hard drives containing nuclear
secrets were found Friday and federal investigators believe they
are the ones that were missing for more than a month. Investigators
now are trying to authenticate the contents and determine whether
the information was copied or tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential candidate told an audience of 700
that the administration was to blame for the ''chaos and
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added: ''I'd like to make another pledge to you: I will
bring this sorry chapter to a close in my administration. Our
national labs will be secure again, our vital information will be
sealed again, and our nuclear secrets will be secret again.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first comments on the missing drives, Bush said Thursday
he supported the investigation already under way and blamed the
administration for ''another major security lapse'' that he said
was of ''great concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, brother Gov. Jeb Bush predicted that his older
brother would win Florida and contended Al Gore's campaign was
''bluffing'' about its ability to compete in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said Democrats also exaggerated strength in Florida 12
years ago when his father, George Bush, beat Democrat Michael S.
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This reminds me a little of '88, where the Dukakis campaign
came in with a field organization and they were talking about how
they were going to compete and do all these things, and then by the
end, we had a going-away party for them with a vote,'' Jeb Bush
told reporters aboard his brother's campaign plane.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if Gore will leave the state entirely, but I
think there's a lot of bluffing going on right now,'' he said
between fund-raising appearances with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats outnumber Republicans in the state, which has 25
electoral votes, fourth most in the country. But a Florida poll in
May put George W. Bush at 47 percent and Gore at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Bush gained more support, winning the endorsement
of the Florida chapter of LULAC, the League of United Latin
American Citizens, the nation's oldest and largest Hispanic
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, George Bush won the state with 62 percent of the vote.
He barely carried Florida while losing to Bill Clinton four years
later. In 1996, Clinton won by a 48-42 margin over Republican Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Many political observers feel Gore's standing with voters,
particularly in South Florida, with its large Cuban American
population, has been hurt by the Clinton administration's efforts
to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gore believes a family court, rather than federal judges, should
decide the case -- a position counter to the administration's. He
also broke with the administration by supporting legislation to
grant permanent resident status to Elian, his father and other
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's swing through Florida was a chance for the
brothers to enjoy campaigning together.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan bragged he was a better runner. Jeb Bush said he was a
better golfer. They seem to share the same tailor: Each wore a blue
dress shirt and red tie.
</P>
<P>
   Joked older brother: ''You can see mine's a little kind of a
softer tone. It's a little more presidential look.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, 47, was seen by some family members as the more likely
presidential contender until he lost his first bid for Florida
governor in 1994 -- the same time his 53-year-old brother won his
first term in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, however, said he is happy with his lot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am consumed by my work and my family and I've got the best
job in the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospect of a George W. Bush-Jeb Bush GOP ticket
this fall, the older brother said that combination would save
campaign money on bumper stickers.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''If all else fails, then he's in the running.''

<HEADLINE> Measles Kills 300 in Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) -- A measles outbreak in
the impoverished Central African Republic has killed at least 300
people, mostly children, in the last month, the Health Ministry
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people have been infected, and the disease was
spreading, ministry official Gerard Grezengue said.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the worst-affected areas, at least 90 people have died
in the northern village of Oudda-Djalle, whose population numbers
just 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials blamed a lack of resources in Central African
Republic, one of the world's poorest countries, saying there had
been no systematic vaccination for the disease since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The government planned a new vaccination campaign next month
with the help of the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Measles, which can cause deadly pneumonia and swelling of the
brain, is especially dangerous in infants and young children.
Pregnant women are also at risk from the disease, which can induce
early labor or miscarriage.

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- A teen-ager who claimed he was shot by
gang members who mistook a sign language exchange with his
hearing-impaired cousin for provocative gang signals now says his
cousin accidentally shot him.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Handy's cousin, Ruben Faulkwell, 15, was taken into custody
Friday afternoon on a juvenile charge of aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very scared,'' Faulkwell said about an hour before he
was taken to the juvenile center. ''I didn't want to go to jail. I

<HEADLINE> Clinton Visits Roosevelt's Home  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made a pilgrimage
Saturday to the home of her hero, Eleanor Roosevelt, a former first
lady who declined a challenge the current one has taken on -- a run
for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to Val-Kill, Eleanor Roosevelt's cottage home and a
national historic site, to announce that $150,000 has been raised
through private donations to help with preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the first lady to a crowd of more than 400 people,
Anna Roosevelt, granddaughter of Eleanor Roosevelt, said: ''The
legacy of this place is the legacy of a great woman who simply took
stock of who she was and where she was and then tried to be useful.
Such a woman is Hillary Rodham Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It should feel like home here,'' she told the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the podium, Clinton said the Val-Kill site was ''a
fitting monument to a woman who was larger than life, but always
approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   In her day, Eleanor Roosevelt had turned down a plea from Harold
L. Ickes, a top aide to President Franklin Roosevelt, to run for
the U.S. Senate from New York. Clinton's top political adviser in
her Senate race against U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio is Harold M. Ickes, a
son of the Roosevelt adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Before her speech, Clinton toured the cottage where Eleanor
Roosevelt worked and slept. It was the first lady's second visit
there in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long been an admirer of Eleanor Roosevelt, admitting
in 1996 that she had carried on imaginary conversations with her
predecessor since taking up residence at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   At Val-Kill on Saturday, Clinton recalled her first mention of
talking with Mrs. Roosevelt, at an event in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking out at this audience at Lincoln Center and I
said, 'You know, the White House just encourages me to have
conversations with Mrs. Roosevelt.' I meant it as a metaphor, but
it became, yet again, one of those things people all talked
about,'' she said. ''I guess sort of suggesting I really had gone
off the deep end.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you know, it's not a bad idea to think about what Mrs.
Roosevelt would do and say.''
</P>
<P>
   She ended her speech with a smile, telling her audience, ''The
next time I talk to her, I will tell her all about what you are
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Saturday, Lazio said he will remain in the House while
he runs for Senate. Lazio's statements came two days after he
missed a Congressional vote because he was flying back to New York
to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not considering stepping down,'' Lazio told reporters in
Oakdale, N.Y., at a ceremony honoring veterans of the Normandy
invasion. ''I think it's a matter of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio missed Thursday's vote on a $10 million funding bill that
would have established a 2 million barrel home heating oil reserve.
Lazio supported the bill, which was voted down in the House,
195-193.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOBERMORY, Canada (AP) -- Rescuers on Saturday pulled the bodies
of two 12-year-old students from Lake Huron's Georgian Bay, where
they had disappeared after the glass-bottomed boat they were on
sank.
</P>
<P>
   The two Ontario students -- Henricki Foerster and Wade Simmons --
were on a school tour Friday when the 33-foot True North II went
down near Flowerpot Island, a popular tourist destination on the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian Coast Guard vessel rescued 15 students, two teachers
and the boat's captain on Friday. But the boy and girl were still
missing when the search was suspended overnight.
</P>
<P>
   After a six-hour search Saturday, divers found the pair several
hundred yards from the sunken vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were still investigating what caused the boat to
sink during the outing for seventh graders from Tiverton, Ontario.

<HEADLINE> Report: Latvia To Indict Suspect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIGA, Latvia (AP) -- Latvian prosecutors plan to charge suspected
Nazi war criminal Konrads Kalejs with genocide, the Baltic News
Service reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Now 86, Kalejs would be the first alleged Nazi to face such
charges in this ex-Soviet republic since it won independence in
1991. Formal charges are expected by early July, BNS reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kalejs now lives in Australia after being deported from the
United States, Canada and Britain. Human rights groups claim he was
an officer in the Arajs Kommando, a Nazi-sponsored death squad
responsible for the murder of some 30,000 people, mostly Latvian
Jews, during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Kalejs denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Chief prosecutor Rudita Abolina said the government uncovered
evidence that Kalejs was a chief guard at a Nazi-run concentration
camp in Salispils, about 25 miles from the capital, Riga, BNS
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some 80,000 Jews were murdered during the 1941-44 Nazi
occupation of Latvia. Under international pressure to bring
suspected Nazis to trial, Latvian prosecutors launched a criminal
investigation of Kalejs earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Latvia and Australia agreed in April on a new extradition treaty
expected to go into force by the end of the year. BNS reported that
Latvian prosecutors will request Kalejs' extradition once he is
charged.

34 Low Caste India Villagers Killed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Black-garbed gunmen stormed a village while its
residents slept early Saturday, executing 34 women, children and old men after
the latest caste-related battle in India's poorest and most lawless province.
The attackers, identified as members of an upper-caste militia backed by rich
landlords, fought a gunbattle with several armed villagers for 2&AMP;frac12; hours
until the residents ran out of ammunition, said M.V. Rao, police superintendent
of the Aurangabad area in Bihar state, where the massacre took place. Then the
attackers stormed several homes and ordered the women, children and elders to
stand in a line. They were shot and killed.

Bush Criticizes Security Lapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- George W. Bush chastised the Clinton administration
today for its handling of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory,
saying that ''America's nuclear security should not be a matter of lost and
found.'' Bush, appearing with his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, at the state
convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, also blamed the administration for a
''slow slide to military weakness'' shown through poor military recruiting and
low morale within the armed forces. The Texas governor pledged to rebuild
military strength with lighter and more lethal weapons. At Los Alamos, two
computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets were found yesterday and federal
investigators believe they are the ones that were missing for more than a month.

Strong Earthquake Rocks Iceland
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   REYKJAVIK, Iceland (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook southern Iceland on
Saturday, causing structural damage to houses in a village near the epicenter
but no known injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey in Washington D.C. said the
quake measured magnitude 6.6, which would make it the strongest in Iceland since
a 7.0-magnitude quake on May 6, 1912. Iceeland's meteorological institute said
Saturday's quake had a magnitude of about 5.7, although it said it hadn't
completed calculations. Scientists on the small Scandinavian island said the
quake had originated 5.6 miles south of Arnes, a tiny community near the village
of Hella, south of the capital, Reykjavik.

20 doctors -- from surgeons to general practitioners -- who said in a statement:
''We are a group representing Puerto Rican doctors who are concerned about the

N. Korea Proposes Talks on Families
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- In another sign that North Korea may be opening
up, the country's Red Cross Saturday said talks should begin this month to
reunite families separated by the Korean War. The telegram to the South Korean
Red Cross was a surprisingly quick move to begin implementing one of a series of
agreements struck by the leaders of the two Koreas during their historic
three-day summit. An estimated 1.2 million war refugees from the North are
living in South Korea today. More than half are over the age of 60; more than
200,000 are in their 70s. Most left behind relatives in the North.

Clinton: Tighten Biological Weapons Ban
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today renewed his suggestion that a new
global inspection system be created to detect and deter cheating on
international agreements that outlaw biological weapons. The president's appeal
came on the 75th anniversary of the Geneva agreement that first banned chemical
and biological weapons from the battlefield. ''Today, one of the greatest
threats to American and global security is the danger that adversary nations or
terrorist groups will obtain or use chemical or biological weapons,'' the
president said in a statement.

sluggers.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kohl Aide Won't Testify  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A key figure in the party-financing scandal
surrounding former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to
refuse to testify before a parliamentary investigating committee.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Uwe Luethje, a former financial officer for Kohl's
Christian Democratic Party, told the committee Luethje will invoke
his right to avoid self-incrimination, the Berliner Morgenpost
reported Saturday. Prosecutor are investigating Luethje for
possible charges in the party's slush fund scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Luethje is believed to have detailed knowledge about a web of
secret campaign accounts run under Kohl, who chaired the Christian
Democratic Party from 1973 to 1998. If Luethje refuses to testify,
he will join three other former aides who have stonewalled the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament opened an inquiry in February to examine whether
decisions under Kohl's 1982-98 government were bought -- something
Kohl hotly denies.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl touched off the scandal last fall by admitting he accepted
about $1 million in secret campaign contributions during the 1990s.
He refused to name the donors. Anonymous party donations in Germany
are illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal grew to include secret foreign accounts, more
unexplained millions in party funds and allegations of money
laundering. It also sparked the downfall of party leader Wolfgang
Schaeuble, who took over from Kohl after his 1998 election defeat.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Prairie Dogs Killed  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN WITTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIELDS, N.D. (AP) -- On a wall in Shields Bar, between mounted
heads of deer and pronghorn, are seven charts tracking 23,895
kills.
</P>
<P>
   Each number represents a dead black-tailed prairie dog.
</P>
<P>
   Another 4,912 prairie dogs were shot in six hours during the 8th
Annual Prairie Dog Extravaganza, a competition that drew 70
shooters to this tiny south-central North Dakota town earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   To local ranchers, it's another battle in an ongoing war against
land-wrecking pests. To animal rights activists, it's an
unnecessary slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ternes, who has about 275 cattle, said the prairie dogs
are preventing grazing on his land -- killing grass by digging
tunnel networks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to get overpopulated with them and we won't be
able to do anything about it,'' Ternes said. ''The land is going to
be worth nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the shoot, organized by the Selfridge-Shields Sportsman
Club, participants pair up and spread out to prairie dog colonies
within a 30-mile radius of the town. The top 10 shooters win $1,900
in prize money. The day ends with a steak fry and dance.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Proctor, a program associate with Predator Conservation
Alliance, says prairie dogs need to be protected.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a blood sport that is causing great harm to the entire
prairie dog ecosystem -- not just prairie dogs but many other
species,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Boyles, a wildlife biologist with People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals in Norfolk, Va., said the annual shoot
is not solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're just killing a lot of animals for fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The North Dakota Game and Fish Department is working on a plan
to maintain a ''viable'' prairie dog population, said spokesman
Mike McKenna. It has not yet determined what level is viable.
</P>
<P>
   The department has opposed listing prairie dogs as endangered.
Surveys cited by the department have shown that prairie dog
populations in the state increased from about 10,000 acres to
30,000 acres since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Al Schauer, who enjoys the camaraderie of the shoot and has
showed up for all eight events in Shields, said anyone who wants to
find out how prairie dogs affect ranchers should ''get some land
and put cattle on it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the people that complain the most about them have
never seen this area or lived here,'' he said, while taking a break
from the shoot.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Denies Colombia Rebel Aid  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez on
Saturday denied a former ally's accusations that his government
provided arms to leftist guerrillas in neighboring Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez called the allegations by former police chief Jesus
Urdaneta ''absolutely false'' during a news conference in the town
of La Fria, on the border with Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's irresponsible to accuse me of being implicated in this
type of activity when my only interest has been promoting peace,''
he said. ''I have never wanted to intervene in the internal affairs
of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   Urdaneta joined Chavez in a failed 1992 coup attempt. After
Chavez was elected president in December 1998, Urdaneta was named
chief of Venezuela's Investigation and Prevention Services
Directorate, a national police force with intelligence-gathering
functions.
</P>
<P>
   Urdaneta left the government in January. He is now a candidate
for governor of the central coastal state of Aragua and an ally of
Francisco Arias, Chavez's main opponent in an upcoming presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview Friday, Urdaneta said Chavez had urged
government support for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I was in charge of the (political police), Chavez
suggested supporting the Colombian guerrillas with weapons, a
position that I opposed vehemently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Urdaneta alleged that Chavez ordered a former interior minister
to funnel some $300,000 to rebels in Colombia. He said Chavez's
party sent arms to the rebels. He also accused Chavez of preventing
a police raid on an office of Chavez's party where investigators
believed weapons were stored.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope (Urdaneta) takes that back -- he can't be going around
lying about things as delicate as this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in February 1999, Chavez has used his
credentials as a left-leaning nationalist to urge an end to the
36-year conflict between the Colombian government and leftist
rebels. He also has offered to mediate negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Annan in Morocco To Talk With King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan made an
impromptu stopover in Rabat on Saturday to talk with Moroccan King
Mohammed VI about the disputed Western Sahara territory and the
situation in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, who was starting a Middle East tour, also went to the
western port city of Casablanca for a meeting with Saudi Arabian
Crown Prince Abdallah Ibn Abdelaziz.
</P>
<P>
   He then headed to Iran, the starting point of the Mideast trip
that is to take him to Lebanon and Jordan, among other places.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told reporters in a brief statement that his talks with
the Moroccan king had been ''fruitful.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. chief alluded to Lebanon's rejection of the U.N.
verification of Israel's May 24 withdrawal from its southern border
areas, but gave no details. He said he had spoken by telephone with
both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and with Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud, but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the visiting Saudi crown prince, Annan said:
''We discussed the means to maintain security in Lebanon and in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan's visit here comes ahead of July 28-29 talks in London on
the disputed Western Sahara territory. The talks -- to be headed by
Annan's special envoy James Baker -- bring together all protagonists
in the quarter-century-old dispute:
</P>
<P>
   Morocco claims the territory as its own; the Polisario Front of
rebels demands independence for the vast territory; Algeria
traditionally has backed the Polisario; and Mauritania shares a
border with the Western Sahara -- a stretch of desert along the
Atlantic coast of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A first meeting May 14 in London bore no fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has tried for nearly a decade to organize a
referendum on the territory's status, but that effort has been
blocked by squabbling over who should be allowed to cast a ballot.
A U.N. mission has identified 86,000 natives with a right to vote
in a referendum. But nearly 130,000 people who were rejected have
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   A ''third way'' that would give the region large autonomy while
keeping it attached to Morocco -- which annexed the territory when
Spain gave it up in 1975 -- has emerged in talks without ever being
officially evoked by either side.

Celestin Ilunga
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Celestin Ilunga, a former general in
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko's army who later joined Congolese
rebels, has died, a rebel spokesman said Saturday. His age was not
available.
</P>
<P>
   Kin-Kiey Mulumba said Ilunga died of heart failure in South
Africa on Thursday. He was recently appointed ''defense minister''
in the Congolese Rally for Democracy, the Rwandan-backed rebel
group that controls most of eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Ilunga, who underwent military training in the United States,
was not prominent in the rebel army ranks and tried to distance
himself from the rebels' close ties with Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Ilunga was considered one of the best-educated army cadres under
Mobutu and served as the interior minister in what was then called
Zaire and has since been renamed Congo. He was known to have close
ties with UNITA rebels in Angola during the more than two decades
of cooperation between Mobutu and UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi.
Ismail Mohamed
</P>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Ismail Mohamed, the first
nonwhite to serve as chief justice in South Africa, died of
pancreatic cancer Saturday. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, who was of Indian descent, defended anti-apartheid
activists for decades and was considered one of the most gifted
orators among South Africa's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   He became the country's first nonwhite judge in 1991, when South
Africa was still ruled by the white minority. Former President
Nelson Mandela named him chief justice of the Supreme Court of
Appeal in 1996. He held the post until his illness forced him to
step down in February.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, a devout Muslim, studied law at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, one of the country's top
universities. But after he passed the bar in 1957, apartheid laws
prevented him from renting chambers in the building that housed the
Johannesburg Bar, which was located in a whites-only area.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, Mohamed was forced to borrow desk space from
colleagues when they were busy in court and decamp to the law
library when they returned. He eventually obtained a special permit
in 1969, but still faced numerous restrictions under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   When he was named chief justice, Mohamed had to move to the
judicial capital of Bloemfontein, a place that brought back painful
memories.
</P>
<P>
   During the apartheid era, Bloemfontein was part of the Orange
Free State, which for years barred Indians from remaining in the
province overnight. When working in the province, he had to leave
each night before dusk and return the next morning.
Joseph Santoiana
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Joseph Santoiana, a confidante of J. Edgar
Hoover and founding father of Tampa's FBI field office, died
Thursday. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Santoiana ran secret missions for Hoover to Buenos Aires,
Argentina, and Casablanca, Morocco, during World War II and shaped
some of Tampa's high-profile prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Santoiana retired in 1973 after 33 years with the FBI. He came
to Tampa in 1960 after heading bureau offices in San Diego; San
Juan, Puerto Rico; Portland, Ore.; Houston; New Haven, Conn.; and
Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Santoiana helped convict Tampa police Maj. William R. Bland on
federal charges of conspiracy and transporting stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   He led the FBI probe in the notorious kidnapping of heiress
Barbara Mackle, a prominent developer's daughter who was abducted
in 1968 from a hotel room. She was imprisoned for four days in a
plywood box buried underground and equipped with a ventilation
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gallagher, Special Agent in Charge of the Tampa office,
came to work for Santoiana as a one-year rookie agent in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very much the old pro. He was essentially -- because of
his reputation -- larger than life,'' Gallagher said. ''He was
probably one of the finest administrators the bureau ever had.''

two personalities, one of them violent. That appears to be a negative portrayal

Vessel captain Gunnar Marel Eggertsson guided the ship along the
beginning of its route from Iceland to Greenland to the shores of
Canada and New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''Icelanders do not take credit for discovering America,'' Prime
Minister David Oddsson said at the vessel's departure. ''But we do
reckon that we played a significant role in the first contact
between native Americans and Europeans one thousand years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Leif ''The Lucky'' Eriksson's landing in North America -- or
Vinland the Good, as he named it -- is well recorded in two medieval
Icelandic manuscripts. Determined to re-enact the voyage,
Eggertsson designed and built the Islendingur of oak and pine from
Norway and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The crew counts nine experienced sailors. In the Viking era, a
battleship like Islendingur would have had a crew of 70, including
a double shift of 32 oarsmen for a quick getaway. This time, it
will rely on a motor.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,600-mile voyage will take four months, including more than
20 scheduled stops.
</P>
<P>
   After the farewell ceremony, Islendingur headed to
Hvammsfjordur, west Iceland, where Eriksson had his farm. There it
will wait for the pack ice to retreat, opening the sea lane to
Greenland.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, the ship is to arrive in Brattahlid, the site of
Eriksson's settlement in west Greenland, founded in A.D. 985. Five
days later it will depart from there for North America, as did
Eriksson.
</P>
<P>
   The first planned stop in North America is L'Anse aux Meadows,
Newfoundland, the site of North America's only Viking camp,
excavated in the 1960s. Other stops include Boston, Providence and
New York, where the journey will end in October in time for the
opening of the Smithsonian exhibition ''Vikings: The North Atlantic
Saga'' at the American Museum of Natural History.

<HEADLINE> California Vets Home Fined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARSTOW, Calif. (AP) -- A veterans home was cited and fined
$64,500 in connection with three patient deaths and faces possible
revocation of its license.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health Services cited a wide range of
violations in issuing six citations Friday against the 400-bed
California Veterans Home for aging and disabled veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the California Department of Veterans Affairs
disputed the allegations, and plan to appeal, said Jerry Rucker,
the department's under secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The citations grew out of a survey of the home by state health
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, health department officials said the home did
not pay close enough attention to a patient who died in February. A
coroner and a treating physician at the home said the man died
after choking on broccoli. Officials of the veterans home said he
died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, an unidentified patient died in a diabetic coma
after suffering a skyrocketing blood-sugar level that had not been
called to a doctor's attention. A review of records revealed that a
third patient received a powerful anti-seizure medication twice
daily for 70 days without a physician's order.
</P>
<P>
   The $64,500 in fines is the maximum allowed by law.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan, Hagelin Backers Clash  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Patrick Buchanan's supporters clashed
briefly with those of rival John Hagelin as the two Reform Party
presidential hopefuls campaigned for votes at the party's North
Carolina convention Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go Pat, Go!'' many in the crowd of about 200 people screamed
as they rose to their feet when Buchanan entered the hotel
ballroom. A few minutes earlier, Hagelin's supporters screamed
nearly as loudly and held signs which read: ''Hagelin: A Reason to
Vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the two men appeared to be ready to cross paths in the
hallway, each went their own way without a verbal exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tension between the two rivals and their supporters
was obvious as both men made impassioned speeches to try to woo
North Carolina's 15 delegates. No vote was taken at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who quit a fourth bid for the Republican nomination
last year, became the point of contention during a brief, loud
exchange between Buchanan and Hagelin supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The clash erupted when Pete Wenk told the convention in a speech
that he planned to vote for Buchanan. That prompted state party
officials to offer a spokesman for Hagelin's supporters to respond
to his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pat Buchanan is an extremely right-wing person,'' said the
Hagelin supporter, Gayatin Erlandson of Asheville, prompting
Buchanan supporters to stand and boo. ''He is known as a racist,''
she continued, causing them to scream even louder.
</P>
<P>
   She later joined some other Hagelin supporters in offering an
apology for her remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said the battle for the Reform Party nomination was a
necessary thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a birth,'' he said. ''It's not always that
attractive, but there's something being born. Once we get over the
battle over the nomination we need to come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin portrayed himself as a more mainstream and electable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Dror Bar-Sadeh, the state party chairman, said North Carolina's
15 delegates will be committed to vote for the winner of the Reform
Party's national primary, to be held between July 4 and the August
convention in Long Beach, Calif.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LURGAN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Protesters hurled firebombs at
security officers monitoring a Protestant parade in this town
Saturday, and police fired back with plastic bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Three police officers and a soldier were slightly injured and
one man was arrested after about an hour of fighting, a Royal
Ulster Constabulary spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, Northern Ireland's largest Protestant
fraternal group, had received permission from the Parades
Commission to march through Lurgan town center, about 20 miles
southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of troops and police in riot gear had sealed flashpoint
areas in Lurgan, but they came under attack by dozens of
anti-parade protesters who threw fire bombs, ball bearings, bottles
and stones.
</P>
<P>
   Police said 25 to 30 gasoline bombs were thrown at security
forces and that officers fired three plastic bullets at rioters.
</P>
<P>
   The Parades Commission was established two years ago to
adjudicate between Protestant marching groups and militant Catholic
protesters who try to block parades that pass by Catholic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen's parades commemorate a variety of events important to
Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority, ranging from
17th-century victories over Catholics to Protestant casualties in
World War I. The Orangemen say Catholic protesters are denying
their right to public assembly.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic protesters complain that the Orangemen's
drum-thumping ''kick the pope'' bands are designed to make
Catholics feel like second-class citizens. Police have clashed
violently with both sides in efforts to keep them apart.

<HEADLINE> Royals Hire Allard Baird As New GM  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Royals' new owner hired a new
general manager, promoting Allard Baird on Saturday to replace Herk
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   David Glass, who bought the team in April, had indicated his
long-range plan was to promote Baird, a 12-year veteran of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recently, Herk came to me and recommended that we make Allard
the general manager,'' Glass said. ''He felt like Allard was ready
and certainly has the ability and the enthusiasm to take on the
general manager's role and do it very, very well. It's never good
to procrastinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird, 38, becomes one of baseball's youngest GMs and Robinson
becomes the team's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had passion as a coach and a teacher and thought I would
probably end up in the minor leagues as a manager or roving
instructor,'' Baird said. ''But it evolved into this over time and
I'm excited about it. It's a tremendous opportunity and an honor.
I'm eager to get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, appointed general manager 10 years ago by the team's
late founder, Ewing Kauffman, was the longest-tenured GM in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Although the small-market Royals have not appeared in the
postseason since winning the 1985 World Series, they are showing
evidence of dramatic improvement with several talented young
position players, including outfielders Carlos Beltran and Jermaine
Dye and infielders Joe Randa and Mike Sweeney. Going into Saturday
night's game against Oakland, they were one game over .500, and
with renewed interest stirring among fans.
</P>
<P>
   'Allard was a big part of that,'' said Robinson, a 30-year
Royals employee. ''There was no reason to wait. This just positions
us to be a much stronger organization and move forward. Allard is
very ready to take the job.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Rochester, N.H., Baird joined the Royals as hitting
coach for the Class-A Appleton of the Midwest League in 1988 and
two years later was made territorial scouting supervisor for
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Ewing Kauffman Award for outstanding
contributions to the scouting department in 1996, he was made
special assistant to the general manager. In September 1998, he was
promoted to vice president and assistant general manager of
baseball operations.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who purchased the team for $96 million, has promised to
increase the payroll, which was $23 million on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money is a big part of the game. But money doesn't play,''
Baird said. ''Players play. When that first pitch is thrown, it
still comes down to the ability to play. That will continue to be
our concentration.''

<HEADLINE> Stanford Can't Hang On in CWS  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Stanford was just five outs from its third
national baseball title.
</P>
<P>
   But that was three outs more than they could get in a 6-5 loss
to Louisiana State in the College World Series championship game on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With a 5-2 lead with one out in the eighth inning and one of
Stanford's top pitchers still going strong, everything fell apart
for the Cardinal. Two home runs in the eighth tied it and LSU
slugger Brad Cresse, who struggled all series, hit a game-winning
single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Cardinal lost in three championship
game appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough to end this way, but it doesn't take away from what
they've done for me,'' Stanford coach Mark Marquess said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told them they had nothing to be ashamed of and that I was
very proud of them. Sometimes you give a game away, but they beat
us. They earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (50-16) was outhitting LSU 13-4 before the bottom of
the eighth and Justin Wayne had seven strikeouts in three innings
of relief. But Blair Barbier started the Tigers' comeback with a
solo homer and Jeremy Witten tied it with a two-run shot off Wayne,
setting up Cresse's heroics in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''They capitalized on the mistakes I made late in the game,''
Wayne said. ''It can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne said he felt fine, but Barbier and Witten found a way to
hit his pitches just over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''When they go far, it's hard to tell if the pitches were
breaking or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne (15-4) relieved starter Jason Young in the fifth, even
though Young was still pitching well. The Cardinal's No. 1 starter
had allowed just two runs on four hits, striking out two and
walking one.
</P>
<P>
   But Marquess thought Wayne and his potent slider could be even
more effective against the Tigers, who hit .301 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought Justin's slider was a good matchup for them,''
Marquess said. ''And it was, until the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal erased the Tigers' 2-0 lead in the fourth with a
four-run inning. Chris O'Riordan and Andy Topham opened the inning
with back-to-back singles, then LSU starter Brian Tallet hit Damien
Alvarado. Craig Thompson came up with the bases loaded and hit a
line drive over the wall in left for Stanford's second grand slam
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford added another run in the sixth on John Gall's RBI
single off reliever Trey Hodges, but that was all the Cardinal
offense. Hodges allowed just one more hit the final four innings
and was voted the CWS most outstanding player.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal nearly let the lead slip away in the bottom of the
sixth. Wayne walked Brad Hawpe to open the sixth and then hit
Barbier. But Wayne got out of the jam by striking out Wally
Pontiff, Cedrick Harris and Witten.
</P>
<P>
   Marquess said he opted to not put in closer Jeff Bruksch, tied
the Stanford record with 13 saves this season, because Wayne still
looked strong in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he still had good stuff,'' Marquess said. ''He had
been our main guy all year.''

<HEADLINE> Man found guilty of killing senior citizen over drug money dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - A 33-year-old Long Branch man was
convicted of murdering his 72-year-old friend by beating him to
death with a hammer after the older man refused to give him money
to buy crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In convicting Donyelle Locust, a Superior Court jury on Friday
rejected his claims that he was coerced into confessing to the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Amison, a retired Marine sergeant and union official, was
found bludgeoned to death at his Asbury Park home after he refused
to give Locust some cash on Feb. 11, 1999, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Locust had borrowed about $100 from Amison
earlier in the day, but apparently wanted more. When Amison refused
the second request, Locust waited until the older man had gone to
sleep and used a hammer from the house to strike him repeatedly in
the head, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy revealed multiple blunt force trauma to the head,
including skull fractures, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Locust then stole several items of jewelry, traded them in for
drugs and apparently got his fix, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Locust was friends with the man and did odd jobs for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Locust faces a minimum of 30 years in prison without parole when
he is sentenced in August by Superior Court Judge Patricia Del
Bueno Cleary.

<HEADLINE> Girl Needing Transplant, Graduates  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   McMINNVILLE, Ore. (AP) -- For one night at least, Brandy Stroeder
wasn't the face of a health care system that let her down.
</P>
<P>
   Walking confidently across the stage to a loud ovation, the
18-year-old dying from cystic fibrosis hugged school officials,
grasped her high-school diploma and raised her arms in victory as
her classmates applauded and cameras flashed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It meant everything to me, I just didn't want to stumble,''
Stroeder said after the Friday night ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Stroeder, who suffers from a disease that causes her body to
produce excessive mucus that clogs her lungs, has sued the state
because it won't pay for a potentially lifesaving double
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Health Plan, which extends Medicaid coverage to roughly
350,000 low-income Oregonians, pays for single transplants but
considers a simultaneous lung-and-liver transplant too experimental
and, at $250,000, too costly.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, Brandy is expected to die within two years.
</P>
<P>
   The state this week agreed to pay for tests to determine if
Stroeder is a good candidate for the operation, but still maintains
it will not pay for the actual procedure.
</P>
<P>
   At the McMinnville High School football stadium, Stroeder, who
wants to be a chef, looked as healthy as her classmates, and
certainly yelled louder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brandy acts likes there's nothing going on, so we respect
that,'' said Katie Maynard, 18, who has known Stroeder since middle
school. ''It's not like she shows off, saying 'oh, look, I have
this disease' that's not her at all.''

   CHARLEROI, Belgium (AP) -- Police fired water cannons and detained about 450
people Saturday as English and German fans hurled tables and garbage at each

Championships. England won the game 1-0, but the day was marred by widespread
violence in this Belgian town. English fans threw bottles at police as they left
the stadium and smashed windows at a McDonald's in the town. During the game,
ticketless England supporters stormed through bars and cafes, venting their

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 11, Red Sox 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Toronto nearly blew a 10-run lead as David Wells
tied Randy Johnson for the major league lead with his 11th win and
the Blue Jays hung on for an 11-10 win over the Boston Red Sox on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Batista avenged a rough game one night earlier by homering
in his first at-bat and Alex Gonzalez drove in four runs with a
two-run homer and two-run single. Brad Fullmer had a two-run homer
and Jose Cruz added a two-run double as Toronto built an 11-1 lead
in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (11-2), who has posted his worst career numbers in Fenway
Park, gave up seven runs -- five earned -- and 11 hits in 6 1-3
innings. Six runs came after being handed the 10-run advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch pitched the final two innings for his 14th save.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Ramon Martinez (5-4) couldn't get out of the
fourth inning, allowing seven runs and seven hits in three-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Batista, who struck out twice with the tying run on third in
Friday's 7-4 loss, gave Wells a 3-0 lead in the second with his
16th homer following singles by Carlos Delgado and Brad Fullmer.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Delgado and Batista sandwiched walks around
Fullmer's single to load the bases. Cruz followed with a two-run
double and Gonzalez singled to chase Martinez and make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer and Gonzalez each hit two-run homers off Tim Wakefield
in the fifth, making it 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox then went to work offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Varitek homered leading off in the bottom of fifth. Darren
Lewis had a run-scoring groundout. Nomar Garciaparra's RBI single
scored the third run, and Jeff Frye scored on the same play when
center-fielder Cruz fired the ball into the stands behind the
third-base dugout for an error.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox got two runners on with one out in the seventh off
Wells. Paul Quantrill came in and forced in two runs by hitting
Garciaparra with a pitch and walking Carl Everett. With two outs,
Varitek hit a three-run double to make it 11-10. Pedro Borbon then
retired Troy O'Leary to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Batista's homer was Toronto's 16th consecutive game with a
home run, extending its record set Friday. ... Delgado singled to
right in the second despite a shift, extending his hitting streak
to 12 games. ... Frye improved his hitting streak to 11 games. ...
Wells, who came in 7-10 with a 5.71 ERA in Fenway, beat the Red Sox
in Boston on May 25. ... The game's start was delayed 41 minutes by
rain. ... The Red Sox have signed 13 of their top 25 picks from the
June draft.

<HEADLINE> LSU's Hodges Named Most Outstanding  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Louisiana State reliever Trey Hodges needed
just four innings to lock up the College World Series most
outstanding player award.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges (5-2) pitched four scoreless innings Saturday in the
Tigers' 6-5 win over Stanford in the CWS championship game. It was
the second win of the series for Hodges, who also had a save in one
of the four games LSU won to clinch a fifth national title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what to say,'' Hodges said. ''I wouldn't be able
to win an award like that without my team and what I had behind
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 2-3 innings in the series, Hodges allowed six hits,
two runs, struck out eight and walked two. He had a 1.69 ERA for
the series.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges is just the third LSU player to win the award and first
since Todd Walker in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges was joined on the CWS all-tournament team by LSU second
baseman Mike Fontenot, shortstop Ryan Theriot, third baseman Blair
Barbier and first baseman Brad Hawpe, who was voted in as the
designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Fontenot led the Tigers with a .462 batting average. Hawpe was
second at .400 and hit three homers and had nine RBIs. Barbier hit
.385 with three homers, including a solo shot Saturday that tied
the championship game in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford outfielders Joe Borchard and Edmund Muth and first
baseman Craig Thompson were the Cardinal selections on the
all-tournament team.
</P>
<P>
   Borchard hit .500 for the tournament; Muth set the CWS record
for career homers with his sixth and Thompson hit .421 and hit a
grand slam in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California's Beau Craig, who hit .455, was the
all-tournament catcher. Florida State's Jon McDonald, who had an
0.87 ERA in 10 1-3 innings and Hodges were the pitchers and
Louisiana-Lafayette's Steven Feehan was the third outfielder.

<HEADLINE> Final answer: No sign of virus in NYC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A chicken tested for the deadly West Nile virus
showed no sign of the disease, scuttling plans to begin pesticide
spraying in the borough of Queens, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, we do not have evidence of the West Nile virus
in New York City,'' said city Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen.
Testing was done by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, and the National Veterinary Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's announcement comes two days after a preliminary test
indicated the presence of the virus in the chicken, raising fears
that the disease could linger through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the virus killed six people and infected 62 others in
the metropolitan area. Four of those deaths and 45 of the illnesses
occurred in the city - most in northwest Queens.
</P>
<P>
   The results mean that plans for the city to begin pesticide
spraying in Queens have been canceled. Spraying will occur only if
the virus re-appears.
</P>
<P>
   The health department is monitoring the chicken in the Corona
section of Queens. The sentinel chickens, which serve as the early
warning system against West Nile, are not killed by the virus.

<HEADLINE> Children expected for summer of recovery in the United States  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An exhausted group of 160 children suffering
from the effects of the Chernobyl radiation leak came to the United
States Saturday to live with American families and rejuvenate their
bodies with abundant food and medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The 8- and 9-year-olds were met Saturday night at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in Queens by 20 volunteer pilots for
AirLifeLine, a group of more than 1,100 pilots nationwide who
donate their time, fuel and planes to fly financially needy
patients to distant medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots such as 34-year-old Alex Wattles of Pound Ridge, N.Y.,
arrived to take the Chernobyl children to St. Louis, Philadelphia,
Mannassas, Va. and Youngstown, Ohio, where families will take them
in. Other children remained in New York City. They will return to
Chernobyl in the Ukraine on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't look so good when you pick them up for the first
time in June. They're gray and pale and skinny. They look worn
down,'' Wattles said. ''Come August, they look great. Their cheeks
are flushed. They're filled out and well rested.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl atomic power plant's reactor No. 4 exploded and
caught fire on April 26, 1986, spreading a highly radioactive cloud
over much of Europe in the most serious nuclear accident in
history.
</P>
<P>
   This is the seventh year that Chernobyl children have been taken
in by families with children of their own. Each year, the number
brought in grows. This year, 30 more children arrived than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Reiner, a spokeswoman for the group, said the children
generally arrive in poor health, though none of them are terminally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   She said they visit eye doctors, dentists, pediatricians and
specialists while eating more nutritious foods and breathing
fresher air.
</P>
<P>
   Wattles said the children throughout the summer will be ''doing
all the things you and I take for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Their activities sometimes include visits to amusement parks,
baseball games and cultural events.
</P>
<P>
   Wattles recalled how one boy upon his first visit to a
convenience store said: ''I've never seen so much food in my life.
Is this where they keep all the food in the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was taking eight children to St. Louis and would
return to New York City with them at the end of the summer, in what
he predicted would be a tearful goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very emotional thing,'' he said. ''They're very
gracious and grateful to be here.''

<HEADLINE> Malchow Sets Butterfly Record  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- American Tom Malchow set a world record
in the 200-meter butterfly Saturday, breaking the mark set by Denis
Pankratov of Russia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow, the American record holder and 1996 Olympic silver
medalist, was timed in 1 minute, 55:18 seconds in the Charlotte
UltraSwim, topping Pankratov's mark of 1 minute, 55:22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old swimmer from St. Paul, Minn., brought the crowd
to its feet when he touched the wall after the first 100 meters and
his split of 55:53 seconds was clearly on world-record pace. The
fans remained standing over the final two laps, cheering him all
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I had a chance at 50 and 100 and 150 by the way the
crowd was cheering,'' he said. ''Then it was up to me to bring it
home.''
</P>
<P>
   When he touched the wall he took a few seconds before looking up
to see his time, then closed his eyes and remained motionless for a
moment. He then pumped his fist in the air several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't look at the clock for a few seconds after the race
because the way the crowd was cheering, I knew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed from the pool and pointed to the sky with both arms,
a tribute he said to Ryan Weggeman, his girlfriend's brother, who
was killed in a car accident in March.
</P>
<P>
   In other men's events, Brendon Dedekind won the 50 freestyle in
23.76, Neil Walker took the 100 backstroke in 56.88 and Elvin Chia
won the 200 breaststroke in 2:17.72.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's races, Maddy Crippen won the 200 butterfly in
2:15.40, B.J. Bedford took the 50 freestyle in 26.38 seconds, Lea
Maurer won the 100 backstroke in 1:02.77 and Kristy Kowal took the
200 breaststroke in 2:34.28.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford, whose race was the next one after Malchow's
record-setting swim, said it inspired her to swim her best time of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you see a great swim it always spurs you on,'' she
said. ''People were laughing at me because there were tears
streaming down my face when I went to the blocks. In all the years
I've known Tom, that was the most emotion I'd ever seen from him
and it was really moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Malchow's record was the third to fall in as many days.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Alexander Popov set a world record in the 50 freestyle
in Moscow on Friday. Roman Sludnev, another Russian, set the 100
breaststroke record in the same meet Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John Urbanchek, Malchow's coach at the University of Michigan
and Club Wolverine, thinks Malchow is capable of lowering the mark
to one minute, 53 seconds by the Olympics later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the training we've been doing, I would say that time is
not out of the question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malchow wore the new Fastskin swimsuit, a neck-to-ankle bodysuit
that has been controversial because it's credited with helping
swimmers cut their times. The version he wore was a tank that
zipped up the back and did not have sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanchek defended Malchow for wearing it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you give credit to the suit or to the athlete for his
commitment?'' Urbanchek said. ''Even if there's not a physical
factor, there is a mental factor. If he feels good in the suit and
looks good in it and feels confidence from it, he will swim
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The meet is the second of five in the Cadillac Challenge Swim
Series leading up to the Olympic trials in August in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Most swimmers use the events as a warmup for the Olympic trials,
so event organizers were stunned when the record was broken. They
didn't have the proper forms on hand that are required to be filled
out immediately after a world record is broken and organizers were
scrambling to have one faxed in.

<HEADLINE> Clinton rips Lazio for missing oil vote  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTAMONT, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Saturday accused her Republican opponent of failing to stand up for
New Yorkers by missing a vote aimed at easing high oil costs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio was an early champion of the measure to
spend $10 million to establish a 2-million barrel home heating oil
reserve. But when the House of Representatives voted at 9 p.m.
Thursday, Lazio was already headed for New York to get back on the
campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was defeated 195-193 and some supporters said Lazio's
presence could have made the difference.
</P>
<P>
   At a campaign stop in front of about 5,000 Albany County
Democrats, Clinton said Lazio's decision to campaign rather that
vote should raise questions about his commitment to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very disappointed because he missed the vote on the
northeast oil reserve, something I had called for months ago as a
way of answering some of the challenges we face here in the
northeast when it comes to affordable home heating oil and gasoline
prices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he had been there, it might have made all the difference,''
Clinton said. ''I think it's really a shame that when we needed a
vote for the Northeast strategic oil reserve, he was missing in
action. Because, you know, that's the kind of vote that could
literally save New Yorkers millions and millions of dollars and
make a difference on what people could afford on limited or fixed
incomes.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his nomination in May as the Republican candidate for the
Senate seat being vacated by Daniel P. Moynihan, Lazio has said he
will continue his work in Congress while campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Sources on Capitol Hill told Newsday they were surprised he left
before the vote, having cosponsored the original proposal to create
a $10-million oil reserve to be stored in tanks in New York Harbor
and released in times of shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McLagan, a Lazio spokesman, told Newsday the congressman
hopes to revive the funding in a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign did not immediately return calls Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also defended her latest round of ads that attack
Lazio's vote against the Patients' Bill of Rights and his
opposition to a bill to increase penalties when a crime is bias
related. Clinton said the ads are not so much a negative tactic as
they are about issues important to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is campaign based on differences on issues and
there are very clear differences and contrasts between me and my
opponent and I'm going to be pointing them out,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he voted against the health care bill because he
believes it will benefit lawyers rather than patients. He says he
supports the hate crimes law that passed in the state Senate, but
abstained in 1990 while serving in the Suffolk County Legislature
on a measure calling for a hate crimes law to be enacted in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   He has characterized the ads as ''desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to criticize a reported stock deal in which
Lazio turned a $2,300 investment into about $16,000 by buying
options in a brokerage company right before it was taken over by
Fleet Financial Group. Two former executives at the brokerage firm
said they and other company officials donated at least $35,000 to
Lazio campaigns since 1995 but said there was no discussion of the
company stock and Lazio said he had no inside information about the
pending Fleet takeover when he bought the options.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know all the facts yet,'' Clinton said. ''The stories
that have been written raise some serious questions that I think
he'll have to answer and then it will be up to New Yorkers to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   In attendance at Saturday's picnic was Andrew Cuomo, U.S.
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and son of former
governor Mario M. Cuomo. The younger Cuomo has been mentioned as a
possible Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 2002 and sounded
like one Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leadership in the state hasn't done what they
needed to do to bring the economy back,'' Cuomo said. ''It's not
going to be that way for long.''
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo later Saturday, Clinton addressed about 300 people at
an Erie County Democratic Committee dinner where she thanked
Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello for calling her a ''Buffalonian.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will wear it proudly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   During her 20-minute remarks, which were moved up to beat the
start of a reggae concert at the Buffalo Convention Center, she
stressed her commitment to education, health care reform and social
security, keeping her attacks on Lazio relatively low-key.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of those serving on the other side have always voted the
way they were told, not necessarily the way that was in the best
interest of the people they represented,'' she said. ''I will not
be making decisions based on what anyone tells me I need to do to
get ahead. I don't need to get ahead, I just need to do what's
right for the people of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Attending the Buffalo black-tie event were H. Carl McCall,
another potential gubernatorial candidate in 2002, and U.S. Rep.
John LaFalce.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If Game 5 had been played a day earlier,
Travis Best would have had to watch from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Best separated his left shoulder while fouling Shaquille O'Neal
in Game 4, and he didn't practice the day before the Indiana
Pacers' 120-87 victory on Friday night, forcing Game 6 in Los
Angeles on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers' top reserve guard played just 10 minutes in Friday
night's runaway Indiana win, making both of his shots and getting
three assists.
</P>
<P>
   He said his shoulder was too sore to play in the second half of
Game 5, but with the Pacers up by 20 points, he didn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was pulling up a little bit on the jumper,'' Best said. ''I
was able to get it to go down, but I couldn't get that full
extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Best was a spark off the bench for the Pacers in Games 3 and 4,
and he has handily won his matchup with Los Angeles backup point
guard, Derek Fisher. But Best struggled in the first two games at
Staples Center, managing just 6 total points on 2-of-10 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   He rested the shoulder again on Saturday and might not shoot on
Sunday at the Lakers' practice gym in El Segundo. He figures rest
will be the only way to heal in time for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully with a couple days' rest, it will be better,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PHIL'S COMPLAINT: His team has now lost six potential closeout
games during its 2000 playoff run, but it took Friday night's
humiliating loss at Indiana to get Lakers coach Phil Jackson really
angry.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had few kind words to say about his team after it was
beaten by 33 points in a game that could have ended with a trophy
presentation. Although he acknowledged the Pacers' excellent
shooting as the primary reason for the defeat, he didn't allow that
to be an excuse for the Lakers' dismal defense and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like to think of a team that has championship quality
in it that loses by 33 points,'' Jackson said. ''We have something
to prove to ourselves when we go back home in this regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has perhaps more experience than anyone with up-and-down
winning teams. He won six championships in Chicago during the
1990s, but his Bulls often lived on the edge, relying on Michael
Jordan to pull out dramatic victories.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 NBA Finals, Jordan hit game-winning shots in the
final minute of three of the Bulls' four victories over the Utah
Jazz, including the title-clinching jumper in Game 6, the final
game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson thinks the Lakers still lack what Jordan had in
abundance: a killer instinct.
</P>
<P>
   ''You try to get them sharp,'' he said. ''You have to be precise
and sharp. ... But the precision wasn't there, the execution wasn't
there in what we do. That's where you've got to get back to some of
the nuts and bolts of what you do as a basketball team.''

46-34 in Game 5. The winning team in all five games of the series
has had the rebounding edge. ... In Game 5, the Pacers shot better
from 3-point range (50 percent) than the Lakers did from inside the

<HEADLINE> Ala. Trucker Convicted of Murder  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- A truck driver who walked into two
businesses, complained his co-workers there were spreading rumors
about him, and then shot them was convicted Saturday of capital
murder in the rampage that left three men dead.
</P>
<P>
   A Shelby County jury deliberated for 20 minutes before finding
Alan Eugene Miller guilty.
</P>
<P>
   They later recommended the death penalty. Shelby County Circuit
Judge Al Crowson said he would schedule final sentencing later. He
can either accept or reject jurors' suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 35, showed no reaction as the verdict was read. During
the trial, his lawyers had all but conceded his guilt in the Aug.
5, 1999, shootings in the Birmingham suburb of Pelham.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was charged with gunning down Lee Holdbrooks and Scott
Yancy at Ferguson Enterprises, the company where he worked. Then,
prosecutors said, he drove to Post Airgas, a company that had fired
him, and shoot Terry Jarvis.
</P>
<P>
   During closing arguments Saturday, prosecutor Gordon Ladner told
jurors the victims had at least one thing in common: Miller wanted
them all dead.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking as jurors looked at photos taken inside Ferguson
Enterprises, state forensics expert Angelo Della Manna testified
Holdbrooks crawled more than 20 feet down a hall despite being shot
three times in the chest, once in the face and once in the right
shoulder. The fatal shot was fired from less than 2 inches away, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Mickey Johnson conceded the evidence was
convincing, but described Miller as a ''tortured soul'' who suffers
from a personality disorder. A psychological evaluation found
Miller believed he had been slighted by ''perceived events,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening fire at each place, Miller made comments about
the victims spreading rumors about him, testimony showed.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Miller) believed in the death penalty. He just believed he
could impose it,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson criticized prosecutors for showing dozens of gruesome
crime scene an autopsy photos, calling the display ''excessive.''
He rested his case Friday without calling any witnesses to counter
a mountain of prosecution evidence, including an eyewitness to one
slaying and testimony linking Miller's handgun to shell casings and
slugs found at the crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Miller showed little reaction during the two days of testimony,
and he didn't speak to his mother or other relatives seated a few
feet behind him. He craned his head once for a better look at one
of the crime scene photos.
</P>
<P>
   The two attacks came one week after one of the worst office
massacres in U.S. history. On July 29, Mark O. Barton, a frustrated
investor, killed nine people and wounded 13 others at two Atlanta
brokerage firms before taking his own life.

<HEADLINE> Tales of history will accompany Adirondack train ride  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Passengers riding The Adirondack
train between New York City and Montreal will get a history lesson
along with a great view.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ackerman, retired chief interpreter for the National Park
Service, will narrate the trip between Saratoga Springs and
Westport in Essex County beginning July 1. He'll tell of such
historic figures and events as the Battles of Saratoga, President
Ulysses S. Grant, Rogers' Rangers, and other 18th-century wars
fought near Lake Champlain and the Hudson River valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge is starting the announcement at the right spot
on the track so the words you hear match the view you see. Going
into Fort Edward talking about Rogers' Rangers, you don't want to
step on the conductor's announcement for the station,'' Ackerman
told the Times Union of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondack is the first Amtrak train in the Northeast to
carry National Park Service narrators under their joint Trails and
Rails Program. Amtrak provides the audience and the Park Service
the staff to explain what happened along the rails. They've worked
on this project previously in Louisiana and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman and other volunteers from Saratoga National Historical
Park will narrate rides in one train car. Northbound, the focus
will be the French and Indian War; southbound will be the American
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to enhance the experience of our guests on the
train. We're anxious to promote tourism in upstate New York and
highlight some of the attractions and scenery in the area,'' Wes
Coates, general manager of the Empire Product Service Line for
Amtrak, told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   After the northern leg is under way, Coates said a similar
effort would be made along the southern portion from New York
through the Hudson River valley to Albany.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Kin Send Castro a Greeting  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and the rest of his family sent a
Father's Day greeting to President Fidel Castro on the eve of a
huge Saturday rally in Cuba to protest the 6-year-old's extended
stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''On this Father's Day we want to send you an affectionate
greeting and a deserved kiss from all of us,'' read the letter sent
to Castro and all Cuban fathers and read Friday night on state
television. ''Especially to the father who we love very much for
his unequaled teaching and infinite love ... our
commander-in-chief,'' Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's name led the list of signatories, followed by his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his stepmother, Nersy, and five
schoolmates from his hometown of Cardenas, Cuba, who are staying
with the family in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would like very much to be with you today, sharing the
happiness that characterizes our family,'' the letter read. ''But,
as you know the enemies of the fatherland are delaying Elian's
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the letter was read, more than 300,000 people
gathered for the largest rally held in the Cuban countryside since
early December, when Cuba launched a national campaign of mass
gatherings demanding the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that the objective of the 'mafia' and the relatives is
to gain time,'' student Yenes Alvarez told the crowd in the Plaza
of the Revolution in Camaguey, about 325 miles east of Havana. ''We
denounce their dirty intentions. ... We must be better prepared and
united in this battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was attended by Gen. Raul Castro, head of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces and younger brother of Fidel Castro.
State television broadcast the event live, offering sweeping aerial
views that showed the sea of people waving red, white and blue
banners fashioned after the Cuban flag.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the rally, Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's
National Assembly, told a national television program that Cubans
must prepare themselves for new delays in Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon criticized a court order preventing the child from
leaving the United States with his father while their relatives in
Miami continue legal maneuvers aimed at preventing them from
returning to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Alarcon, who has played a central role in the Elian case, said
the Miami relatives' appeal of an appellate court decision siding
with Elian's father is a ''great farce.''
</P>
<P>
   In an opposing rally in Washington on Saturday, some two dozen
anti-Castro demonstrators from the Miami area marched outside the
house where Elian has been staying.
</P>
<P>
   After a 16-hour bus ride from Florida, they stood on a lawn near
the house, carrying signs and a Cuban and an American flag and
chanting ''Freedom for Elian.'' They later demonstrated at the
Cuban mission in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still think Elian is going to stay in this country,'' said
Marta Lorenzo of Key Biscayne, Fla. ''That's why we pray every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle
since he was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank during a
journey to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He lived with his Miami relatives for five months until their
temporary custody of the boy was revoked by the U.S. government and
he was forcibly reunited with his father in the United States on
April 22.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives asked the full 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
on Thursday to reverse a decision that would allow boy to return to
Cuba with his father.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 12-member court ruled two weeks ago
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service had the right to
deny the boy an asylum hearing requested by his relatives. But the
ruling blocked Elian from returning to Cuba immediately, giving the
relatives two weeks to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge J.L. Edmondson ordered the government and lawyers
for Elian's father to file a joint response to the appeal by 11
a.m. Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Ramirez Homers in Minors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Cleveland Indians outfielder Manny Ramirez,
playing in his first minor league game since 1993, hit a two-run
home run Saturday in his rehab assignment for a strained left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, out since May 29, with a strained left hamstring, was
in the Akron lineup as a designated hitter against Altoona in a
Double-A Eastern League game.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, Ramirez hit a pitch from Steve Sparks over
the left-field fence in the third inning. He struck out looking in
the first inning and walked in the fifth and seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 3-3, Ramirez drew a walk to lead off the seventh,
but he was thrown out at second on Jon Hamilton's attempted
sacrifice bunt. Ramirez's running on the play appeared to be
hampered.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was batting .322 with 13 homers and 47 RBIs for the
Indians when he was injured while running out a grounder against
Anaheim on May 29. Last season, Ramirez drove in 165 runs, the
highest RBI total in baseball in more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Aeros were the Canton-Akron Indians in 1993, when Ramirez
hit .340 with 17 homers in 89 Eastern League games.
</P>
<P>
   Akron beat Altoona 4-3 in the first game of a doubleheader.
Ramirez sat out the second game.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 10, Yankees 9  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM NAZIMOWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Chicago White Sox won their 10th straight
road game, overcoming Bernie Williams' seven RBIs to beat the New
York Yankees 10-9 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez homered and drove in four runs as the White Sox
won their sixth in a row -- three at Cleveland and three at Yankee
Stadium. Chicago has the longest road winning streak in the majors
this season, and its longest since taking 11 straight in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Although it didn't have an effect on the score, Yankees second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch's throwing woes continued.
</P>
<P>
   After fielding a slow grounder by Greg Norton that was ruled an
infield single in the fourth, Knoblauch made a throw that sailed
over first baseman Tino Martinez and hit a woman in the stands.
Knoblauch immediately turned away in disgust as the ball left his
hand.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who appeared to be hit in the body, was OK. She
initially declined help, then walked with two Emergency Medical
Service workers through the stands to the first-aid station. She
later returned to her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Eldred (8-2) survived a 57-minute rain delay to pitch five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Westbrook (0-1) was in trouble from the start in his major
league debut. He walked leadoff man Ray Durham and went on to allow
six runs and seven hits, including Ordonez's 14th homer, in just 1
2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a two-run homer, a three-run double and a two-run
double. His 13th homer came in the eighth and made it 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke got the final four outs for his 16th save. Ricky
Ledee doubled with two outs in the ninth, but Scott Brosius
grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox, with the best record in baseball, will try Sunday
for its first four-game sweep at Yankee Stadium since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton hit a solo homer off Jason Grimsley in the
Chicago fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a two-run double in the third and scored on
Martinez's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Williams cleared the bases with a double to deep
center, and again scored on Martinez's single.
Notes: All of the Yankees' runs scored with two outs. ...
Williams' career high for RBIs is eight. ... Ordonez extended his
hitting streak to nine games and has 16 RBIs in his last 12. ...
LHP Kelly Wunsch made his AL-leading 37th appearance. ... Eldred
beat the Yankees for the second time this year and is 7-2 career
against them. ... Ledee snapped an 0-for-16 slump with a
fourth-inning single. ... Williams has 61 RBIs. No one else on the
Yankees has 40. ... Jorge Posada has struck out six times in his
last eight at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Threatens Israel Attack  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Hezbollah guerrillas who have fought
Israeli forces in southern Lebanon for 18 years warned Saturday
that they will resume attacks if Israel does not give up tracts of
land claimed by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''All violations should be dealt with; ... otherwise we consider
the mission of liberating Lebanese territory to be incomplete and
resistance remains our choice to liberate the last inch of our
occupied land,'' Hezbollah said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The statement came a day after U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan, scheduled Monday to visit Lebanon as part of a Middle East
tour, confirmed Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon ''in full
compliance'' with Security Council resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Friday rejected the United Nations'
verification of Israel's May 24 withdrawal, saying Israeli forces
still controlled some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Hoss renewed Lebanon's commitment to cooperate with
the United Nations ''to the extreme.'' But he added that Lebanon
''insists on recovering every inch of its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Hezbollah described Annan's announcement as
''unrealistic and premature,'' saying it favored Israel. ''We
regret that the United Nations has become a cover for the
continuation of the Zionists' occupation of parts of Lebanese
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The government and Hezbollah's rejection of the U.N. withdrawal
verification prolongs the risk of renewed cross-border fighting and
is likely to delay the deployment of Lebanese army troops in
southern Lebanon, where the anti-Israel guerrillas are the de facto
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, Annan's formal declaration of the withdrawal
paves the way for the 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in
Lebanon to deploy to the Lebanese-Israeli border and help the
Lebanese government reassert its authority in the vacated
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. spokesman Timur Goksel said Saturday that no
peacekeepers will be deployed before matters are sorted out with
the Lebanese government, possibly during talks Monday with Annan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said all along that Lebanese consent is a
prerequisite of U.N. deployment in any place in the country. After
all, the peacekeeping force is subject to their sovereignty,'' he
told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains that Lebanese officers working with a
U.N. inspection team found that Israeli troops still manned several
positions inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The new border line was drawn by U.N. cartographers according to
the 1923 line fixed by colonial France and Britain.

<HEADLINE> 34 Low Caste India Villagers Killed  </HEADLINE>
By INDRANIL SINGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Black-garbed gunmen stormed a village while
its residents slept early Saturday, executing 34 women, children
and old men after the latest caste-related battle in India's
poorest and most lawless province.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers, identified as members of an upper-caste militia
backed by rich landlords, fought a gunbattle with several armed
villagers for 2&AMP;frac12; hours until the residents ran out of ammunition,
said M.V. Rao, police superintendent of the Aurangabad area in
Bihar state, where the massacre took place.
</P>
<P>
   Then the attackers stormed several homes and ordered the women,
children and elders to stand in a line. They were shot and killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were sleeping, and suddenly the firing started,'' said
Anupama Devi, 68, whose two daughters-in-law were killed in the
attack. ''I ran out and screamed, 'Why are you killing us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Devi quoted one of the attackers as shouting: ''Shut up, we have
come to take revenge.'' Satyendra Singh, 23, whose brother was
killed, said some of the attackers were injured and taken away by
their comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the handiwork of the Ranvir Sena,'' Rao told The
Associated Press, referring to the upper caste militia.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, a young girl, seven boys, 19 women and seven old men
-- all members of lower castes -- were killed in Miapur village in
east India. Fifteen people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Caste-related violence often flares in Bihar state between the
Ranvir Sena and Maoist guerrillas belonging to the People's War
Group and the Maoist Communist Center, who say they represent the
underclass. Revenge attacks are often carried out against villagers
and scores die each year.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said hatred between different castes in the
centuries-old social hierarchy of Hindus, who form nearly 83
percent of India's 1 billion people, was not the only reason for
the seemingly unending cycle of killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a problem of caste or policing. It is a problem of
infighting among the political bosses,'' said Shivendra Narayan,
senior anthropologist at the independent A.N. Sinha Institute of
Social Sciences in Patna.
</P>
<P>
   Rival political parties in the state accuse each other of
funding rival groups. Hundreds of unemployed youth in Bihar are
sucked into the rivalry and end up joining the rival groups
according to their caste affiliations, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Maoist rebels in the state rode to strength along with the rise
of a slew of political parties that represent the landless lower
caste people. To fight their growing influence, powerful landowners
started creating their own militias.
</P>
<P>
   ''The electoral empowerment of the lower castes has contributed
to the violence,'' said Saibal Gupta of the Asian Development
Research Institute. ''For a person here, his caste is his only
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no one claimed responsibility for the massacre,
eyewitnesses said the killers announced they were acting in
retaliation for the killing of 11 upper caste villagers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have since rushed about 400 police to Miapur. Angry
villagers refused to allow district officials to take away the
bodies of the victims, saying they wanted Rabri Devi, the chief
minister of Bihar, to come to Miapur.
</P>
<P>
   The state's police chief said his men had sealed the borders of
the district and were searching for the attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Miapur, a village accessible only by foot, is 5 miles from
Senari village, where 34 upper caste villagers were killed by the
Maoist Communist Center last year.

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Sheri Sam scored a season-high 21 points as the
Miami Sol withstood a late rally to beat the Cleveland Rockers
55-48 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Marlies Askamp added 10 points for Miami, which won its second
straight home game.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Melvin scored 11 points and had seven rebounds, and
Suzie McConnell Serio added 10 points for the Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (3-5) led 51-39 with 6:42 to play before the Rockers (5-3)
went on a 9-0 run to pull within three. But Cleveland failed to
score the final 4:12 of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol weren't much better, going 6:30 without scoring during a
late stretch before Katrina Colleton converted a pair of free
throws and Sam scored on a layup in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sol, who led 30-26 at the half, pushed the lead to 45-35
with 12:02 to play on a 3-pointer from the right side by Sam, but
couldn't put it away.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were plagued by turnovers, as they each committed 19.
</P>
<P>
   Miami was coming off an embarrassing 77-53 loss to the
three-time WNBA champion Houston Comets on Thursday in which it
tied a league record for fewest first-half points (13).
</P>
<P>
   The Sol, which shot only 19 percent in the first half against
Houston, did much better Saturday shooting 44.4 percent. Miami
jumped out to an 8-2 lead as Debbie Black and Sam made 3-point
jumpers on consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   After tying it at 20, the Rockers, coming off a loss to Indiana
that snapped a five-game winning streak, took their first lead --
22-20 with 5:38 left -- on an 18-footer by Vicki Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Miami shot 54.5 percent from beyond the 3-point arc, including
4-of-7 by Sam.

   ''Anytime I compete I love to win, I thrive on winning and when
I don't I'm a little sour,'' said Jones, who didn't run in the 100,
one of her strongest events. ''But this is going to motivate me to
keep on keeping at it.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Jones was fouling on her last of six long jump
attempts, husband C.J. Hunter was wrapping up the shot put victory
with a world-best throw of 71-8&AMP;frac34;. The 1999 winner at the World
Championships also had the previous best this season of 71-4 in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he is the best in the world,'' Jones said. ''You
(reporters) are the ones who seem surprised, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prix meet was the first of three such events in the
Golden Spike Tour leading up to the U.S. Olympic trials July 14-23
at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, trying to qualify in five events for the Sydney Olympics,
had a pair of best jumps at 21-6 Saturday, much better than her
leap of 20-7 in Japan in May. However, Jones admitted she has more
work before the trials.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is experimenting on more speed on the runway and less
power on her leap. There was progress, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have had problems in the long jump and heard my share of
criticism, but I still feel very confident,'' Jones said. ''I'm
still the same person who jumped in 1998, nothing has changed. I
just have to get a little more confident in my jumping and things
will fall in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones' best long jump was 23-11&AMP;frac34; two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went for it on the last jump,'' Jones said. ''I know I
fouled, but I had a feeling it was pretty far. It is going to
happen. I am going to leave it all out on the track. I'm not going
to take any home.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also got pushed by Adam Nelson, who threw a personal best
70-2&AMP;frac12; in an event that also included 1996 Olympic silver medalist
John Godina and 2000 indoor champion Andy Bloom. Hunter and Nelson
traded the lead several times before Hunter got his winning throw
on his fifth attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''He sent some people home thinking about what they thought was
going to be an easy spot on the (Olympic) team,'' Hunter said of
Nelson. ''He certainly confused the issue a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturrup, who will try to qualify for four events for the Bahamas
next month, was thrilled this event was held on her home training
grounds -- a track she shares with Jones and other top track stars.
A late addition to the event, she is long jumping for the first
time since she was at Norfolk State in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was to my advantage that I train on this track every day,''
Sturrup said of the Paul Derr Track at North Carolina State. ''It
really helped in the long jump, knowing where my mark was and
trying to see if I can do the same things I do in practice every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was a good day for some of the older U.S. runners.
Mike Marsh and Antonio Pettigrew -- each 32 -- won the 100 and 400
races respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, who ran a wind-aided 9.90 April 16 at the Mt. SAC Relays,
was competing against top-level competition for first time in 18
months after having bone spurs removed from his left foot. The gold
winner in the 200 at the 1992 Olympics, ran a 10.01, edging
Auburn's Coby Miller at 10.04.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh's impressive time came after two false starts by an
anxious field.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of differences I notice physically. I don't
have the same body that I had at 26,'' Marsh said of a group of
young sprinters he'll challenge at the trials. ''It takes me a
little longer to recover. I am like an old car -- I really have to
take care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But at the same time, I celebrate my age. Just like the false
starts, I've seen things, I've been through things that a lot of
those guys have yet to see. There is very little now that surprises
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew, who also trains here, ran 44.65 after slowing up over
the final 100 meters because of a cramp in his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 5&AMP;frac12; weeks before the Olympic trials, so you have to
start picking it up,'' Pettigrew said. ''Everybody will start
running a little faster now because we start jockeying for
position.''

Bush Criticizes Security Lapse
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- At a state convention of the Veterans of foreign
wars, George W. Bush criticized the Clinton administration's handling of nuclear
secrets at the Los Alamos weapons laboratory. ''America's nuclear security
should not be a matter of lost and found,'' said Bush. Bush, appearing with his
brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, also pledged to rebuild military strength with
lighter and more lethal weapons. At Los Alamos, two computer hard drives
containing nuclear secrets were found yesterday and federal investigators
believe they are the ones that were missing for more than a month.

Death Penalty Recommended For Ala. Trucker
</SUBHEAD>

   COLUMBIANA, Ala. (AP) -- A jury today recommended the death penalty for a
truck driver convicted of capital murder in a rampage that left three men dead.
Alan Eugene Miller, 35, walked into two businesses, complained his co-workers
there were spreading rumors about him, and then shot them. Shelby County Circuit
Judge Al Crowson said he would schedule final sentencing later. He can either
accept or reject jurors' suggestion. Miller was charged with gunning down Lee
Holdbrooks and Scott Yancy at Ferguson Enterprises, the company where he worked.
Then, prosecutors said, he drove to Post Airgas, a company that had fired him,
and shot Terry Jarvis.

the latest caste-related battle in India's poorest and most lawless province.
The attackers, identified as members of an upper-caste militia backed by rich
landlords, fought a gunbattle with several armed villagers for 2&AMP;frac12; hours
until the residents ran out of ammunition, said M.V. Rao, police superintendent
of the Aurangabad area in Bihar state, where the massacre took place. Then the

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Central Park Attacks, 1st Ld-Writethru,320  </HEADLINE>
Alleged ringleader: ''I'm not involved'
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The alleged ringleader of the Central Park gang
that sexually assaulted dozens of women last weekend insisted that
he was ''doing nothing'' when the attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting there having fun, you know?'' said Manuel Vargas,
18, as he was led from the 13th Precinct in handcuffs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is one of 16 suspects arrested so far in connection with
the incident following the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Police said
Saturday that they were seeking additional suspects identified from
amateur videotapes that captured the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The NYPD has assigned more than 75 detectives full-time to
identifying and arresting the suspects. Police Internal Affairs
investigators are also checking into reports that some officers
failed to help the victims of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, of the Bronx, claimed he had nothing to do with the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're telling me that I was involved,'' the high school
dropout said. ''I was just sitting there doing nothing. I'm not
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Police report that 50 women - including two British tourists and
a French newlywed - have reported that they were attacked by the
rampaging gang. Victims were doused with water before the men began
tearing away their clothes and pawing at them.
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday night arraignment for some of the suspects,
Assistant District Attorney Leemie Kahng painted a chilling picture
of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects belonged to ''a malicious mob that literally took
over the southern and western parts of Central Park ... and
horrified not only the city, but the world,'' Kahng said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fourth woman announced plans for a $7 million
lawsuit against the Police Department, charging that officers
failed to come to her aid when the groping began.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were animals,'' said a teary 25-year Jasmine Gonzalez of
Brooklyn. ''There were no men in the park.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Firefighters Making Progress  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAILEY, Colo. (AP) -- As residents shoveled ashes from their
yards and sifted through the rubble of their charred homes
Saturday, firefighters worked in rain and light snow to cut off two
wildfires burning in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners were left with nothing; others found houses
mercifully spared by the blazes that have blackened 21,000 acres
and destroyed 54 homes since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's smoky in here; it's not too bad,'' said Ceilly Robl, as
she walked through her home near the fire's edge southwest of
Denver. ''There were several times we thought it was going to go. I
could see the fire coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Carol Myers found a lone pine tree standing next to
the remains of their home. It was the one they had planned to cut
the tree down because it is infected with pine beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McCoy, who lives in a nearby subdivision, said 11 homes
were destroyed on his street. He described the neighborhood he
drove through to reach as his home as a black forest that was total
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I built this house with my own two hands. I'm staying and
maybe help my neighbors rebuild if I have to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and snow on the narrow mountain roads kept most
firefighters from a blaze east of Rocky Mountain National Park
early Saturday. One crew spent the night near the fire site, and
officials said firefighters expect to have it contained on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The second fire, about 35 miles southwest of Denver, was
expected to be contained by Wednesday, said Mike Rieser, operations
sections chief for the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team.
</P>
<P>
   Rieser said the light rain has been a mixed blessing for
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a good starting point, but the only thing a light rain
will do is hide the hot spots for a day or two. Now we would like
to see some drier weather so we can find the hot spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fires were about 50 percent contained by midday Saturday,
allowing officials to send some firefighters to work on blazes in
California, Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, government leaders began assessing damage to the
environment, including water resources metropolitan Denver relies
on. Gov. Bill Owens toured the burned out areas southwest of Denver
and met with homeowners in devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also identified a suspect who may have started the
fire while camping in the area. They said the 33-year-old Loveland
resident, Kenny Winchester, has retained a lawyer and refused to
talk with sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Both fires broke out Monday and spread quickly across the dry
brush and timber of the foothills, propelled by hot, dry winds.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 miles northwest of Denver, the fire east of the park
damaged nearly 10,600 acres and burned 15 homes in a mostly
ranching and farming region. Southwest of Denver, at least 39 homes
were destroyed and an estimated 10,500 acres of wooded foothills
were engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   All of the estimated 800 evacuees from both fires were allowed
to return home by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire managers estimated the cost of fighting both blazes had
climbed to more than $4.2 million. Nearly 1,700 firefighters were
on the scene by week's end, and helicopters and tanker planes had
made scores of runs to drop water and fire-retardant.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes are the latest in what is shaping up as the nation's
worst fire season since 1996. The National Interagency Fire Center
in Idaho reported that more than 45,000 fires this season have
burned 1.2 million acres.

<HEADLINE> Illinois man has miles to mow before he sleeps  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF LINKOUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The way Gary Hatter sees it, he has a
little more than 3,100 miles to go before he makes the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Hatter, 46, is driving a bright orange lawn tractor in a quest
to land himself in the Guinness Book of World Records for the
longest distance traveled on a riding mower. The record is 4,039
miles over 51 days.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, the Champaign, Ill., man rolled down
Barrack Street in Trenton with his 17-year-old son, Gary Jr.,
following in a car. When he pulled up to the New Jersey Statehouse
on his 17th day of driving, an odometer he added to his Kubota
mower read 877.9.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yee-hah!'' he said as he coasted to a stop in a parking lot a
just off the Statehouse. Showing off his mower, Hatter held up a
block of wood he uses to trap the mower's accelerator in a down
position. ''This is my cruise control,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years ago, Hatter had a higher highway vantage point
and more horses under the hood. He drove trucks for a food company
but injured his back unloading milk. Two operations have failed to
remedy the spinal disk degeneration he suffers, and he has been
unable to work since.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Guinness Book of Records is kind of secondary,'' said
Hatter, adding that his primary goal is to raise money for a third
operation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has raised $425 through donations and selling
checkered flags for $5 that he autographs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes a third operation will stave off nerve damage
that doctors have told him could leave him paralyzed. He said he
long ago exhausted his medical insurance. He estimates he needs
$100,000 to cover the operation and related physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Hatter began his trek June 1 in Maine, where he bought the
22-horsepower lawn tractor with money lent to him. Along the way -
through New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut - he has
gotten cheers from onlookers and encouragement from police who have
stopped him to find out why there was a man chugging down the
highway on a mower at 9 mph.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hatter rolled into New York City. He drew plenty
of attention and even some perks: complimentary front-row seats to
Thursday's taping of ''Late Night With David Letterman.'' When he
left the city, he said, New York's finest escorted him through the
Lincoln Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't sure how I was going to get out of New York City,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   From Trenton, Hatter planned to head to Philadelphia, then
Wilmington, Del. From there, it's Baltimore and Washington, then
more points south.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading out of Trenton, Hatter, with a bridge crossing
into Pennsylvania to his back, paused to asked a reporter for
directions.

   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Alicia Thompson scored 17 points and Rita
Williams added 16 as the Indiana Fever beat the Orlando Miracle
79-54 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana reserve Gordana Grubin scored 13 points, and Danielle
McCulley added 12 as the Fever used lopsided runs at the end of
each half to snap a three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Taj McWilliams led Orlando with 11 points, and Shannon Johnson
scored 10 as the only Miracle players in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   The Fever finished the game on a 20-4 run after outscoring
Orlando 25-8 to close out the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando trimmed Indiana's lead to 59-50 on a basket by Nykesha
Sales at 7:22 of the second half, as the Fever struggled by only
making six of their first 23 shots of the half.
</P>
<P>
   But Orlando could not get any closer as Indiana held the Miracle
to only four points following Sales' basket. Orlando had four
turnovers and a technical foul called on coach Carolyn Peck in the
final 6:32.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied 23-23 with 7:53 remaining in the first half
when Indiana pulled away to take 48-31 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana shot 8-for-19 from 3-point range, while Orlando was
1-of-16.

<HEADLINE> NL Umpire Greg Bonin Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Umpire Greg Bonin was removed from the field
by ambulance after he was knocked down by a foul ball off his mask
in the eighth inning of Saturday night's game between Florida and
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin was working behind the plate when Pittsburgh's Wil Cordero
fouled a pitch from Braden Looper straight back. It struck Bonin
with enough force to knock off his mask and immediately force him
to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin remained stretched out in the dirt around home plate as
trainers from both teams and Pirates doctors attended. With the
assistance of paramedics, they applied a brace to immobilize his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin was moving his legs before he was strapped to a stretcher.
An ambulance then drove onto the field to take him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bonin, who turned 45 on Thursday, became a regular member of the
NL umpiring staff in April 1986.
</P>
<P>
   After a 16-minute delay, the game continued with three umpires.

<HEADLINE> Escaped bees cause buzz at Thruway rest stop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHITTENANGO, N.Y. (AP) - Thousands of bees escaped from a truck
at the Chittenango rest stop on the state Thruway Friday, stinging
several people and closing down three diesel fuel pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 4 p.m. a gas station attendant noticed the bees
swarming in the air. A truck carrying bees was pulling away, but
the attendant could not get the driver to stop, police said. They
were unable to find the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The bees stung one man six times in the face and twice in the
arm. He did not require medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   The bees swarmed around the fuel pumps and a pickup parked
nearby, keeping truckers and their gas-starved rigs at bay.
Hundreds of them clumped to the underside of the red pumps and to
the driver's side window of the pickup.
</P>
<P>
   A trapper lured most of the bees into a box and his car using
honey and pheromones.
</P>
<P>
   Several truck drivers waited four hours at the rest stop,
between exits 34 and 34A of the state's main highway.
</P>

   Chittenango is 14 miles east of Syracuse.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Nate Dogg Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- Rapper Nate Dogg was arrested Saturday for
investigation of kidnapping his former girlfriend and torching a
car.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old rapper, whose real name is Nathaniel Dwayne
Hale, was arrested by a SWAT team at about 12:30 p.m. at his Pomona
home, said Sgt. Norine Plett, a sheriff's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   He was booked for investigation of kidnapping, making terrorist
threats, domestic violence and arson and was held in lieu of $1
million bail, Plett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale allegedly held his girlfriend against her will at a home in
Lakewood, assaulted her and set her mother's car on fire.
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriend, identified only as Rhoda, told KABC-TV that she
had broken up with Hale several days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hale got his start with rappers Snoop Dogg and Warren G in a
Long Beach-area band. He later recorded with Dr. Dre on ''The
Chronic'' and appeared on Snoop Dogg's ''Doggystyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, Snoop Dogg and other rappers are part of the current ''Up
in Smoke'' concert tour.

<P>
	   LAKE LUZERNE, N.Y. (AP) - A 35-year-old man died late Friday,
several hours after crashing his all-terrain vehicle into a car,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Warren County said Kevin J. Garnsey was riding his ATV
in front of his Lake Luzerne home when he collided with a car
driven by Scott Bujanowski, 30, of Saratoga County.

rolled onto the Camaro before coming to rest about 150 feet away on
the opposite side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Garnsey was not wearing a helmet and suffered massive head and
leg injuries in the accident.

   ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- Lightning struck nine people gathered
under a tree during a storm Saturday afternoon, killing one and
seriously injuring two others, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Arundel County Fire Department spokesman Capt. Allan Graves
said the lightning struck a tree under which the victims waited to
resume a rugby tournament at Annapolis Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims were rugby players.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Patton, 58, of Centreville, Va., was killed, authorities
said. He was attending the tournament to watch his son, Robert
Patton, 26, of Norfolk, Va., who was injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Patton and another man, Brian Bohannon, 24, also of
Norfolk, were taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma
Center in Baltimore, where they were listed in serious condition
late Saturday afternoon, said Dina Holler, a nursing supervisor.

<HEADLINE> Belle Tolls Loudly With Homers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Because of his volatile personality, Albert
Belle has been called The Human Time-Bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The analogy also applies in his performance at the plate. When
the weather heats up, Belle's bat erupts. This season is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   After lying relatively dormant for two months, Belle had 10
homers and 27 RBIs in his first 15 games in June. That includes a
four-game tear through Saturday in which he hit six home runs,
including two grand slams, and drove in 16 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every ball he's hit has been hit hard,'' Baltimore reliever
Mike Timlin said. ''Even the popups.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle amassed more home runs and RBIs in 14 games this month
than he did in 50 games in April and May. He entered Saturday's
game against Anaheim leading the Orioles with a .315 batting
average, 15 homers and 51 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's No. 4 hitter is finally cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   When the Orioles signed Belle to a $65 million, five-year
contract in December 1998, they knew they were getting a moody
slugger who had a history of behavioral problems but was also one
of the game's most productive players.
</P>
<P>
   His first season in Baltimore featured a couple of clubhouse
tirades, an April in which he hit .234. Although Belle closed
strong, the Orioles finished 78-84 while carrying an $84 million
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Belle's fury has been focused solely on opposing
pitchers. His offensive surge enabled Baltimore to put together a
six-game winning streak, longest in the majors through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It's not necessarily the warm weather that has caused the change
in Belle's production. Actually, Belle has become more selective
and has stopped trying to pull virtually every pitch to left field.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's being patient, he's getting good counts and he's looking
for the right pitch,'' Orioles manager Mike Hargrove said. ''A lot
of hitters get the pitch they're looking for. The trick is doing
something when you get it. Albert's been doing that the last couple
of weeks. The biggest reason Albert has increased his production is
because mechanically, he's staying in on pitches and using all
parts of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   When he gets into a groove like this, Belle can carry a team.
Belle made a winner out of starter Mike Mussina on Friday, driving
in all of Baltimore's runs in a 4-3 win over the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank goodness Albert's on the roll he's on,'' Mussina said.
''He's carried us for a couple nights here. He was exclusively the
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as his temperament goes, Belle has been tame in the
clubhouse, playing chess with teammates before games and smiling
much more frequently than he did last year. He still won't speak to
reporters, preferring to let his bat do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   The message is loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Albert's a very special hitter when he's on his game,''
Hargrove said, ''and right now he's on it.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners 12, Twins 3  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Jamie Moyer pitched 6 2-3 strong innings and
Alex Rodriguez scored three times as the Seattle Mariners beat the
Minnesota Twins 12-3 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, Jay Buhner and David Bell had two RBIs each for
Seattle. Mike Cameron and Edgar Martinez added three hits apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners pounded out 17 hits. Eric Milton (6-2) took the
loss, giving up six earned runs on seven hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer (5-2) kept the ball down and allowed just three hits in
the first six innings and didn't let a runner reach second base
until giving up a two-out RBI triple to David Ortiz and a two-run
homer to Butch Huskey in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer left after that with an 8-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Milton had faced just one batter over the minimum until the
fourth, when Cameron led off with a single and Rodriguez followed
with a double. Cameron held up at third because Rodriduez's liner
was almost caught by a leaping Cristian Guzman at shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron scored on a sacrifice fly by Martinez and the Mariners
added two more runs on a single by Bell, which brought home
Rodriguez and Olerud. Bell was in a 13-for-76 slump entering the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton set the tone for Seattle's three-run sixth,
misplaying a long fly ball by Martinez into a ground-rule double.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud had an RBI groundout, Buhner had a run-scoring single and
Mark McLemore walked with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud added an RBI double and Buhner had a run-scoring single
in the seventh to make it 8-0.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle added four more runs in the eighth on a sacrifice fly by
Rodriguez, a run-scoring single by Martinez and Raul Ibanez's
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Moyer has earned a decision in each of his starts this
season. ... After Milton struck out Rickey Henderson for the second
time, looking on a 93 mph fastball in the third, Henderson turned
around and exchanged words with home plate umpire Rick Reed. ...
Milton lost for the first time since shaving his goatee following a
14-0 loss to Seattle May 15, when he yielded eight earned runs in 2
1-3 innings. He was 4-0 with a 1.13 earned run average since
removing his facial hair. ... Mike Lincoln, who relieved LaTroy
Hawkins to start the seventh, made his season debut for the Twins.
It wasn't pretty: in one inning, he gave up two earned runs and
four hits.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 9, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After watching a pregame ceremony that
honored the 1980 World Series champions, the present-day version of
the Phillies played just like them.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Politte struck out a career-high seven in six innings,
Bobby Abreu had four hits and Alex Arias had a homer and three RBIs
as Philadelphia beat the Atlanta Braves 9-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Politte (1-1), starting in place of the injured Andy Ashby,
allowed two runs, six hits and walked one as the last-place
Phillies took their second straight from Atlanta, which has the
best record in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd of 37,292, Philadelphia scored three runs on five
straight hits in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Run-scoring singles by Scott Rolen and Pat Burrell and an RBI
double by Kevin Jordan put the Phillies ahead against Terry
Mulholland (6-6).
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves closed to 3-2 on homers by Reggie Sanders and
Andruw Jones, Arias hit a two-run double in the third. His first
homer since last Aug. 23 gave the Phillies a 6-2 lead in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Politte struck out Chipper Jones in the fifth to escape a
two-out jam with runners on second and third. He fanned Andres
Galarraga three times and struck out four of the first five hitters
around a walk.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old right-hander was slated to start against the New
York Mets on Tuesday, but was moved up to Saturday when a blister
on the middle finger of Ashby's pitching hand became infected.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was his second with the Phillies and first as a
starter. Politte, acquired from St. Louis in November 1998, won
once in relief last season.
</P>
<P>
   He was called up from Triple-A Scranton Wilkes Barre on June 2
to replace the ineffective Paul Byrd, an All-Star last season who
was 1-5 with a 7.86 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland, who missed his previous start on Thursday because of
a tight hamstring, allowed seven runs and 13 hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brock pitched two innings in relief of Politte and allowed
one run -- Chipper Jones' 16th home run. Abreu added a two-run
single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Chipper Jones extended his hitting streak to 15 games with
a third-inning single. He later made a nice play ranging far to his
left while playing shortstop after starting the game at third base.
... Andruw Jones' 18th homer in the third nearly reached the upper
deck in left-center, bouncing off the facade. ... The Braves are
1-21 when trailing after eight innings. ... Phillies SS Desi
Relaford was not in the starting lineup after committing two errors
on Friday that brought his major league-leading total to 18. ...
Gant went 2-for-4 against Mulholland to raise his lifetime average
off the left-hander to .400 (24-for-60).

<HEADLINE> Rose Recalled at Phillies Ceremony  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pete Rose was at Veterans Stadium -- in
spirit, anyway -- for a ceremony honoring the 1980 World Series
champion Philadelphia Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   When Phillies announcer Harry Kalas announced his name Saturday
night, the crowd of about 37,292 gave Rose a standing ovation and
broke into a chant of ''Pete, Pete, Pete.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Green, manager of the 1980 team and now an adviser with
the Phillies, held Rose's jersey above his head and waved it at the
crowd before folding it and placing it on first base.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, the heart and soul of the only championship team in the
history of the Philadelphia Phillies, agreed to a lifetime ban from
baseball in 1989 following an investigation of his gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The majors' career hits leader did not attend similar
celebrations earlier this month in Cincinnati when the 1975 Reds
were honored for their championship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioner said Rose can't be here and we have to abide
by that,'' Green said. ''This is about a team though, not about
Pete Rose. He was part of this team and he should be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose got the loudest ovation in the festivities held before
Philadelphia played Atlanta. Hall of Famers Steve Carlton and Mike
Schmidt also got big cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Tug McGraw, who threw the final pitch that clinched the
Phillies' victory over the Kansas City Royals, had invited Rose to
watch Saturday's game from his corporate box.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that Pete Rose is not here is none of my business,''
McGraw said. ''Pete has a problem with baseball and the
commissioner. If it was my business, I'd tell the commissioner to
take a hike. But if you do that, you don't show any respect to the
game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball made a one-time exception during the World Series last
fall, allowing Rose to be introduced as part of the All-Century
team. Commissioner Bud Selig, however, refused to allow Rose to
take part in the team celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies said they knew all along Rose would not be at the
Vet.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't want to take attention away from the team,'' said
Gene Dias, a team spokesman. ''He didn't go to the celebration in
Cincinnati where he's worshipped so we knew he wasn't coming
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans held signs saying, ''It's not complete without Pete'' and
''It's beat without Pete.'' One fan near the third-base line threw
a bouquet of roses on the field while Green walked toward first
base with the No. 14 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand both sides of it, but as a baseball player I lean
toward the baseball side and I would've like to see Pete here,''
injured Phillies first baseman Rico Brogna said. ''He was an
integral part of that team and an integral part of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his former teammates enjoyed discussing Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about the 1980 ballclub,'' said Bob Boone, the catcher
on that team. ''That club was put together for over 10 years. It's
much bigger than Pete. We didn't win because Pete Rose was on the
team. He was among 25 guys. I'm sad (the lifetime ban) happened.
I'm also resentful about the fact that we have to talk about it all
the time when this is about the reunion of a world championship
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone also jokingly attempted to downplay the legend of Charlie
Hustle by telling his version of the infamous foul pop in the ninth
inning of Game 6 of the 1980 series. The ball popped out of Boone's
glove and into Rose's glove for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm out there listening for Pete, almost falling into the
dugout, and I kept thinking, 'Where is Pete? Where is Pete?'''
Boone said. ''Finally it bounces off my glove and he catches it and
I'm saved from being a failure forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose wasn't the only no-show from the 1980 team. Larry Bowa, the
shortstop for that club, did not attend because of a long-running
feud he has with Bill Giles, the former team president and current
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Bowa coaches third base for the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason for Bowa not to be here,'' Green said.

<HEADLINE> UN Council May Back Israeli Pullout  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council reached tentative
agreement late Saturday to endorse a U.N. verification that Israel
had completed its withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A council statement, which was expected to be formally adopted
early Sunday, came after the Lebanese government insisted that
Israel still occupies part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to overcome the differences, the council held a marathon
10-hour session Saturday, including a conference call with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and others, U.N. sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, diplomats said Russia -- which has close ties to Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon -- was under instructions to reject
any text that did not satisfy the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss rejected the U.N.
verification of Israel's pullout, he said Saturday that his
government was committed to cooperating with the United Nations.
But he reiterated that the country ''insists on recovering every
inch of its territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member council met Saturday morning, took a short break,
and resumed consultations on the text of a statement endorsing
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's announcement Friday that Israel had
completely withdrawn from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Council members were under pressure from Annan, who left for the
Middle East after Friday's announcement and wanted a Security
Council endorsement of Israel's pullout before he arrives in
Lebanon on Monday. Diplomats said the secretary-general reiterated
the importance of an endorsement in a phone conversation Saturday
with the current council president, France's U.N. Ambassador
Jean-David Levitte.
</P>
<P>
   A Security Council endorsement of Israel's withdrawal would put
its political weight behind the U.N. position, rather than
Lebanon's.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Under 1978 Security Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping
troops were charged with verifying any Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's deputy U.N. ambassador, Michel Duval said the U.N.
peacekeeping force in Lebanon had rechecked five or six positions
and installations Saturday that the Lebanese government raised
questions about ''and has confirmed the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the basis on which we will work,'' Duval said. ''We
don't contest the right of the Lebanese to make some verification,
but this should not be an impediment for an endorsement of the
report of the secretary-general.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's rejection of the U.N. announcement was a setback for
Annan, who had hoped to discuss the next steps to achieve peace in
the Middle East during his trip to the region.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Israel's withdrawal has delayed the deployment
of U.N. peacekeeping troops -- and more critically the deployment of
the Lebanese army to the region. The Lebanese army's presence is
important because Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas who fought
Israeli troops for years have moved into to fill the vacuum left by
the departing Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla presence in the zone right across from Israel's
border is a major concern for residents of northern Israeli towns,
who in the past have been the target of guerrilla rocket attacks.
On Saturday, Hezbollah warned it would resume attacks on Israel's
north if the Jewish state does not give up tracts of land claimed
by Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''All violations should be dealt with ... otherwise we consider
the mission of liberating Lebanese territory to be incomplete and
resistance remains our choice to liberate the last inch of our
occupied land,'' Hezbollah said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. force in Lebanon, said
Saturday that no peacekeepers would be deployed before matters were
sorted out with the Lebanese government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has been said all along that Lebanese consent is a
prerequisite of U.N. deployment in any place in the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office welcomed Annan's
declaration, saying in a statement Saturday that it expected the
United Nations to act to ''help restore law and order in the
area.''

<HEADLINE> Tiger Surrender Almost Complete  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Won't somebody please stand up and
take on Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to happen this week at Pebble Beach, where Woods'
would-be challengers all but waved white towels in surrender before
the third round even began.
</P>
<P>
   It might not happen for some time, as dominating and
intimidating as Woods is every time he steps up to the first tee.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the show pony,'' Paul Azinger said.
</P>
<P>
   While Woods was making a mockery of the U.S. Open, the players
who were supposed to rise to the occasion at major tournaments
appeared ready to pack their bags -- even before the tide came back
in Saturday morning at Stillwater Cove.
</P>
<P>
   They hoped for wind, perhaps even silently prayed for a Gil
Morgan-type collapse. What they got was another whipping they were
helpless to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad thing is, you can't control him,'' Azinger said.
''It's not like boxing -- unless you want to fight on the first tee,
which we don't because it's a gentleman's game.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting Woods might not be an option, but playing better than
him is. No one, however, has figured out just how to do that.
</P>
<P>
   The big names weren't even close Saturday at Pebble Beach, with
Ernie Els and a gaggle of European Ryder Cup players the only ones
who deemed a chase worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Only Els -- helped by an early windless stretch -- managed a more
than respectable 3-under 68. And even Els was not exactly nipping
at Woods' heels, a record 10 shots back, or brimming with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to believe that anything can happen,'' Els said. ''I'd
like to think I'm in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the notable missing:
</P>
<P>
   -- Greg Norman shot 82 Friday and wasn't around.
</P>
<P>
   -- Davis Love III, who was the playoff victim in Woods' first pro
win, but had long left since left the Monterey Peninsula by the
time the third round began.
</P>
<P>
   -- David Duval, who hasn't won since Woods deposed him as the
world's No. 1 player last year, struggled once again.
</P>
<P>
   -- Phil Mickelson, making saves from everywhere but still over
par for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's playing spectacular and no one else is,'' Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik saw that for himself up close while playing with
Woods the first two rounds. Unfortunately, he didn't play well
enough to make the final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At least Parnevik went out with a bang, trying to hole a 3-wood
second shot on the 18th hole early Saturday that would have gotten
him on the cut line and into the final two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's good enough to shoot under par even when he's not playing
well,'' Parnevik said. ''The way I see it, he should win it pretty
easy. The only thing that can stop Tiger from winning is Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly held true as Woods' pursuers teed off two-by-two
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Any thoughts Sergio Garcia might have had about reprising his
duel in the PGA championship last year with Woods evaporated with a
snowman 8 on the eighth hole and a total of 81.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie was already 13 shots back when he teed off,
had a quadruple bogey of his own on No. 8, part of a stretch of six
holes he played in a total of 9 over en route to a 79.
</P>
<P>
   Duval and Mickelson were hanging around, playing well enough to
contend in the ''B'' Flight, but nowhere near Woods.
</P>
<P>
   And these are supposed to be the best players in the world?
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like everyone else is playing for second,'' Nick
Price said, before insisting: ''No man's infallible''
</P>
<P>
   Woods showed that by making a triple bogey on the third hole
Saturday. But he followed it with some spectacular shots, leaving
only a total Sunday collapse between himself and his first U.S.
Open title.
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before -- Gil Morgan was up by seven after a birdie
on No. 7 in the third round of the 1992 Open, only to lose the
tournament to Tom Kite. Morgan followed his birdie by playing the
next seven holes 9 over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gil Morgan and Tiger Woods are not the same players,'' Justin
Leonard reminded would-be historians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, players may just be coming to the revelation that
Tiger Woods can only beat himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not much the other players can do,'' Parnevik said.

<HEADLINE> Trans-Atlantic Kayaker Rescued  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- An Englishman attempting to
paddle a kayak across the Atlantic was rescued off Canada's eastern
coast, 31 hours after he abandoned his capsized and flooded boat.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bray, a 43-year-old ex-military officer from Plymouth,
England, left St. John's on Thursday night planning to kayak 3,000
miles to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   After rescuing Bray on Saturday night, officials said the kayak
had begun leaking and capsized. Bray survived in a rubber life-raft
that was attached to the kayak, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The area flooded and he had to get out quickly,'' said
Clarence Peddle of the St. John's rescue coordination center.
</P>
<P>
   The coast guard began searching Saturday night for Bray, after
his 26-foot kayak was spotted about 25 miles northeast of St.
John's.
</P>
<P>
   Bray was found by coast guard in the raft 10 miles north of
where his kayak capsized. A coast guard airplane had spotted a
flare he sent up.
</P>
<P>
   Peddle described Bray as ''weak and wobbly'' but ''otherwise
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Bray is a veteran of Britain's elite Special Air Service
military unit. ''His training had taught him to live with the
sea,'' said Jim Rowlinson, organizer of the voyage.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Firefighters Battle 2 Blazes  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN K. PAULSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAILEY, Colo. (AP) -- As residents shoveled ashes from their
yards and sifted through the rubble of their charred homes
Saturday, firefighters worked in rain and light snow to cut off two
wildfires burning in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners were left with nothing; others found houses
mercifully spared by the blazes that have blackened 21,000 acres
and destroyed 54 homes since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's smoky in here; it's not too bad,'' said Ceilly Robl, as
she walked through her home near the fire's edge southwest of
Denver. ''There were several times we thought it was going to go. I
could see the fire coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry and Carol Myers found a lone pine tree standing next to
the remains of their home. It was the one they had planned to cut
the tree down because it is infected with pine beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McCoy, who lives in a nearby subdivision, said 11 homes
were destroyed on his street. He described the neighborhood he
drove through to reach as his home as a black forest that was total
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I built this house with my own two hands. I'm staying and
maybe help my neighbors rebuild if I have to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rain and snow on the narrow mountain roads kept most
firefighters from a blaze east of Rocky Mountain National Park
early Saturday. One crew spent the night near the fire site, and
officials said firefighters expect to have it contained on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The second fire, about 35 miles southwest of Denver, was
expected to be contained by Wednesday, said Mike Rieser, operations
sections chief for the Rocky Mountain Incident Management Team.
</P>
<P>
   Rieser said the light rain has been a mixed blessing for
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a good starting point, but the only thing a light rain
will do is hide the hot spots for a day or two. Now we would like
to see some drier weather so we can find the hot spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Both fires were about 50 percent contained by midday Saturday,
allowing officials to send some firefighters to work on blazes in
California, Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, government leaders began assessing damage to the
environment, including water resources metropolitan Denver relies
on. Gov. Bill Owens toured the burned out areas southwest of Denver
and met with homeowners in devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also identified a suspect who may have started the
fire while camping in the area. They said the 33-year-old Loveland
resident, Kenny Winchester, has retained a lawyer and refused to
talk with sheriff's deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Both fires broke out Monday and spread quickly across the dry
brush and timber of the foothills, propelled by hot, dry winds.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 miles northwest of Denver, the fire east of the park
damaged nearly 10,600 acres and burned 15 homes in a mostly
ranching and farming region. Southwest of Denver, at least 39 homes
were destroyed and an estimated 10,500 acres of wooded foothills
were engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
   All of the estimated 800 evacuees from both fires were allowed
to return home by Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire managers estimated the cost of fighting both blazes had
climbed to more than $4.2 million. Nearly 1,700 firefighters were
on the scene by week's end, and helicopters and tanker planes had
made scores of runs to drop water and fire-retardant.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes are the latest in what is shaping up as the nation's
worst fire season since 1996. The National Interagency Fire Center
in Idaho reported that more than 45,000 fires this season have
burned 1.2 million acres.

<HEADLINE> Nader Reaps Profit From Tech Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Green Party presidential candidate Ralph
Nader, who has made a career of criticizing corporate America, is
personally worth millions, in large part because of high-tech stock
holdings, published reports say.
</P>
<P>
   The (Baltimore) Sun, citing a financial disclosure report filed
this week by Nader with the Federal Election Commission, reported
Saturday that his holdings were conservatively valued at more than
$3.9 million and that over the past 16 months, he earned more than
$512,000, mainly in speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign worker Jonah Baker said Saturday night that he did not
have access to the financial disclosure forms, could not confirm
their contents, and that no one else was available who could.
Campaign spokeswoman Laura Jones did not return a telephone message
left at her office seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Nader made no apologies for his income, saying 80 percent of
what he earns goes to civic projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money doesn't mean anything to me, except to fund projects. I
don't have real estate. I don't have cars. I don't have yachts,''
he told The Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Among the projects that Nader lists as having been financed with
his own money are organizing efforts for public-interest research
groups on college campuses, consumer insurance protection, truck
safety and aviation safety projects.
</P>
<P>
   His single largest holding is shares of Cisco Systems stock
worth $1,158,750.
</P>
<P>
   He owns smaller amounts of five other technology stocks, has
more than $2 million in money-market funds, and lists no debt, The
Washington Post reported in Sunday editions. Nader told the Post
that the stocks he chose were ''the most neutral-type companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Number one, they're not monopolists and number two, they don't
produce land mines, napalm, weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Nader refused to make public any of his personal
financial information. He told the Post that he would not release
his personal income tax forms. ''Assuring privacy rights for all
Americans has been one of my active engagements for many years,''
he said.

back with plastic bullets. Three police officers and a soldier were slightly
injured and one man was arrested after about an hour of fighting, a Royal Ulster
Constabulary spokesman said. The Orange Order, Northern Ireland's largest
Protestant fraternal group, had received permission from the Parades Commission
to march through Lurgan town center, about 20 miles southwest of Belfast.
Hundreds of troops and police in riot gear had sealed flashpoint areas in
Lurgan, but they came under attack by dozens of anti-parade protesters who threw

lighter and more lethal weapons. At Los Alamos, two computer hard drives
containing nuclear secrets were found yesterday and federal investigators

   PATNA, India (AP) -- Black-garbed gunmen stormed a village while its
residents slept early Saturday, executing 34 women, children and old men after
the latest caste-related battle in India's poorest and most lawless province.
The attackers, identified as members of an upper-caste militia backed by rich
landlords, fought a gunbattle with several armed villagers for 2&AMP;frac12; hours
until the residents ran out of ammunition, said M.V. Rao, police superintendent
of the Aurangabad area in Bihar state, where the massacre took place. Then the
attackers stormed several homes and ordered the women, children and elders to

<HEADLINE> Marlins 4, Pirates 3, 11 innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rich Loiselle hit Alex Gonzalez with a pitch
with the bases loaded in the 11th inning to give the Florida
Marlins a 4-3 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Loiselle (0-1), the fifth Pittsburgh pitcher, gave up a double
to Preston Wilson, an infield single to pinch-hitter Kevin Millar
and walked Derrek Lee before hitting Gonzalez with an 0-1 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca (2-4) got the win despite blowing his third
save in 22 opportunities in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Strong got one out, striking out Jason Kendall with runners
on first and third, for his first career save.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates tied the game by rallying with two outs and no on in
the ninth against Alfonseca, the NL saves leader with 19.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter John Vander Wal singled and scored on Luis Sojo's
double to left-center. Vander Wal collided with catcher Mike
Redmond on a play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who bobbled Gonzalez's relay, was injured in the
collision and was carried from the field on a stretcher with a
right knee sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonseca had blown only two other save opportunities this
season. The last came on May 30 at Pittsburgh when he gave up
consecutive doubles in the ninth and a game-winning home run to
Brian Giles in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Sanchez pitched 7 1-3 strong innings but remained winless
in seven starts since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson homered in the fourth off Todd Ritchie, and Pittsburgh
added a pair of runs in the fifth when Redmond singled, Luis
Castillo walked and Kotsay doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh scored in the sixth on consecutive doubles by Mike
Benjamin and Jason Kendall, who had gone 12 games without driving
in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, making his longest appearance this season, left after a
one-out single to Benjamin in the eighth. Kendall singled off
Braden Looper and Wil Cordero hit an RBI grounder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Looper's save against the Pirates on Friday was the first
by a Marlins pitcher other than Alfonseca since Dennis Springer's
against the Dodgers last Aug. 17. ... Pittsburgh's first two
runners led to errors on pickoff tries. 1B Lee missed Sanchez's
throw in the first and Sanchez threw wildly to second in the second
inning. ... Vander Wal is 7-for-14 as a pinch hitter. ... Sojo's
game-tying double extended his hitting streak to nine games.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 3, Mets 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Marquis Grissom hit a two-run single in the
sixth inning, and the Milwaukee Brewers took advantage of some
uncharacteristic wildness by Glendon Rusch in beating the New York
Mets 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   John Snyder (2-2) allowed both runs and seven hits in seven
innings, Curtis Leskanic pitched the eighth and Bob Wickman closed
with a perfect ninth for his eighth save. The Brewers won despite
getting outhit 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard's fifth-inning homer off Rusch (4-5) drove in the
game's first run, and the Milwaukee second baseman also made some
outstanding defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   He made a spectacular dive with Jay Payton on and no outs in the
second inning, coming up with a hard Melvin Mora grounder behind
second and flipping to shortstop Luis Lopez for a forceout at
second. John Snyder retired the next two hitters to escape the jam.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard and Lopez combined on a nifty double play in the sixth
on another smash by Mora.
</P>
<P>
   Rusch, who entered tied for the NL for fewest walks per nine
innings (1.3), walked six in 6 1-3 innings. But he allowed only
three runs and three hits, two by Grissom, before Turk Wendell
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton's RBI single tied the score in the second, Jason
Tyner led off the fifth with a single and scored from first on Mike
Piazza's two-out single to right-center, beating Belliard's
off-line relay.
</P>
<P>
   But Rusch couldn't hold the 2-1 lead. He hit Luis Lopez and
walked Charlie Hayes -- both former Mets -- starting the sixth. The
runners advanced on a groundout by Jeromy Burnitz, another former
Met, and scored on Grissom's ground single between first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   After Leskanic gave up singles to Piazza and Robin Ventura
opening the eighth, Todd Ziele popped out, Payton struck out and
pinch-hitter Matt Franco lined to Belliard.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Milwaukee is 9-14 against the NL East this year. ... After
signing OF Jonah McClanahan of Monterey (Calif.) High School (18th
round) and RHP Jeremy Shorey of Lisbon, Maine (29th), the Brewers
have signed 18 of their 49 picks. ... C Henry Blanco made his first
start in June after missing two weeks while spending time in
Venezuela with his father, who dies June 10. Blanco threw out
Melvin Mora trying to steal second in the fifth. He has thrown out
six of his last seven and is 13 for 23 this season on steal
attempts.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Leads 100th U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Not even the toughest test in golf
could stop Tiger Woods from turning in the most dominant
performance in U.S. Open history.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the field stands much of a chance, either.
</P>
<P>
   With incredible shots, unlikely birdies and a round that just
might rank as one of his greatest ever, Woods had an even-par 71 on
Saturday to build a 10-stroke lead after three rounds, the largest
54-hole margin in U.S. Open history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tough conditions, I thought, played into my hands,'' Woods
said about the whipping winds, thick rough and rock-hard greens.
''I played solid golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Woods had such a commanding lead was in the 1997
Masters, when he was nine strokes ahead after the third round and
won by a record 12 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless something dramatic happens, I think he is the winner
already,'' Jose Maria Olazabal said.
</P>
<P>
   Something already did.
</P>
<P>
   On a Pebble Beach course exposed by strong winds off the Pacific
that produced more than a dozen rounds in the 80s, Woods was the
epitome of a U.S. Open champion, missing only two fairways and
never losing control.
</P>
<P>
   He was at 8-under 205, 10 strokes clear of two-time U.S. Open
champion Ernie Els, whose 3-under 68 was the only round under par
all day.
</P>
<P>
   ''With these conditions, it shows you the quality of player he
is,'' said Miguel Angel Jimenez, who began the third round six
strokes back and was at 216, along with Padraig Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to win my own tournament,'' the Spaniard said.
''He's playing a different tournament. There's no way you're going
to take that tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10-stroke lead shattered the mark set in 1921 by James
Barnes, who led by seven strokes and went on to win by nine. Less
than 12 hours earlier, Woods' six-stroke lead after 36 holes broke
the record of five set by Willie Anderson in the 1903 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever come back from more than seven strokes to win a
U.S. Open, and never before has a player of Woods' caliber been the
one protecting a lead. He is 17-2 worldwide when he has at least a
share of the lead after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Els' brilliant effort moved him from a tie for 30th to second
place. That put him in the final pairing Sunday with Woods, but
hardly a showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had a triple bogey on the third hole, twice chopping out
of the gnarly collar around a bunker, and finally showed signs of a
struggle. Still, he maintained a sizable lead because everyone else
was having the same problems.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn of Denmark, who started the third round
six strokes off the pace, quickly dropped out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington had a 72 and was at 216. Olazabal and Phil Mickelson,
the runner-up last year at Pinehurst No. 2, were at 217 -- not a bad
54-hole score at any U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Except this one.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the toughest stretch of holes at Pebble Beach, along
the rugged California coastline, Woods was at his best.
</P>
<P>
   With one foot in the bunker and his ball in thick grass around
the lip of a bunker, Woods blasted it out to 10 feet on the par-5
sixth for a birdie. He then holed another 10-footer on No. 7 to
return to even par for the day.
</P>
<P>
   After a bogey on No. 8 from the left rough -- no crime compared
with what happened to Colin Montgomerie and Sergio Garcia -- Woods
holed a 15-footer for birdie on No. 9, which was playing as the
toughest hole on the course.
</P>
<P>
   The best hope for the other golfers was for Woods to repeat
history, not make it.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the U.S. Open was played at Pebble Beach, Gil
Morgan reached 12 under after seven holes of the third round. Then,
the wind kicked up and the white caps in the blue Pacific raged,
and Morgan came undone.
</P>
<P>
   He played his next seven holes in 7 over, lost his seven-stroke
lead and eventually the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, Gil Morgan and Tiger Woods are not the same players,''
Justin Leonard said. ''But it has happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a tee shot into the Pacific that caused Woods to curse
up a storm, he finished his second round Saturday morning with a 69
and for a six-stroke lead. His 134 tied the U.S. Open record first
set by Jack Nicklaus in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In the six hours before Woods teed off in the third round, the
only question was how much lower he could go, how much more
distance he could put between himself and the rest of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ''Typically in the U.S. Open, everybody always comes back,''
Mickelson said. ''You have a little different sense of that with
Tiger, but there's nothing we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The field was trimmed to 63 players after the second round was
completed, which is abnormally low because the cut is the top 60
players plus anyone within 10 strokes of the lead. Only 17 players
were within 10 strokes of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that could stop Tiger from winning is Tiger,''
said Jesper Parnevik, who was paired with him for the first two
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach slammed just about everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie required two swings out of the rough on the eighth
green just to move the ball the length of his wedge. He took
quadruple bogey 8 and finished at 79, his worst score in a U.S.
Open. Garcia also took an 8 and had an 81.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk birdied the first hole and nothing else, signing for
an 84. Hal Sutton, who was at 6 under at one point in the first
round, had an 83.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo finished off his 76 to finish at 219, and looked back
at the scoreboard to see whom might be left to challenge Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was looking for Jimenez, and I couldn't find him,'' Faldo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The three-time Masters and British Open champion knows something
about comebacks. He was six back of Greg Norman in the '96 Masters
and won by five.
</P>
<P>
   Could it happen again?
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't think so,'' Faldo said. ''He's just playing so
well, and he keeps his sensibilities about him. Even if he gives an
odd shot back here and there, it won't be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Those closest to the lead -- if 10 strokes can be considered
close -- have to catch a player who appeared to handle the tough
conditions as easily as the tame ones.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kevin Appier beat his old team and Ben
Grieve, Miguel Tejada and Sal Fasano homered to power the Oakland
Athletics over the Kansas City Royals 10-4 Saturday night, their
fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Appier (7-3), the ace of the Kansas City staff through most of
the '90s, went to 6-0 on the road while facing his former team for
the first time since being traded last July.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals' career strikeout leader gave up four runs and seven
hits in seven innings. He retired his first six batters, then was
struck in the leg twice in the third inning by liners back to the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, who had a tiebreaking three-run homer Friday night, hit
a two-run shot in the first off Jay Witasick (1-6) and has homered
in four of the last five games. A three-run homer off Miguel
Batista by Tejada, who also homered the previous night before,
keyed a six-run sixth inning that made it 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez, stretching his career-long hitting streak to 14
games, had a two-run single in the sixth and Randy Velarde added an
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland is 17-6 since a a five-game losing streak. The A's,
whose 23-12 road record is the best in the majors, have won nine
road series, two more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has allowed a major league-leading 113 homers, an
average of 1.7 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Fasano, another former Royal, hit his second home run of the
year in the second, a drive off Witasick. The former Oakland
pitcher gave up four runs, three hits and five walks in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon hit his league-leading eighth sacrifice fly in the
third and Carlos Beltran had a two-run homer in the fifth. Mike
Sweeney added a sacrifice fly in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: LHP Jose Rosado will have arthroscopic surgery on his left
rotator cuff and be out for the year,. ... Allard Baird was
promoted from assistant general manager to general manager of the
Royals. Ten-year GM Herk Robinson was promoted to chief operating
officer. ... RHP Omar Olivares, who was injured while pitching to
the first Kansas City batter Friday night, was placed on Oakland's
15-day DL Saturday with a strained right shoulder. The A's recalled
reliever Luis Vizcaino from Triple-A Sacramento. ... After Witasick
walked the first two batters of the fifth, Chavez was caught too
far off the bag at second and thrown out, costing the A's a run
when Terrence Long singled. ... Oakland won only 10 games last June
but already has 11 victories this June. ... The A's are 9-2 in
games when Grieve homers.

<HEADLINE> Last Look for Nicklaus After US Open  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The slogan du jour on the PGA Tour
is, ''These guys are good.'' The reality, though, is that one guy
is just too good for all the others.
</P>
<P>
   The only golfer Tiger Woods fears anymore is himself. The old
strategy of waiting for him to screw up is a waste of time now.
He's been in real trouble exactly twice through three rounds of the
U.S. Open and managed to extricate himself quite nicely both times,
thank you.
</P>
<P>
   One came at No. 3 on Saturday, when he dumped his approach shot
into gnarly rough behind a greenside bunker, tried unsuccessfully
to hack out sideways, and wound up making a triple-bogey. But a
slew of birdies quickly cleaned up that mess.
</P>
<P>
   Another bad shot caused the other hiccup, but cleaning up proved
a little stickier. Earlier in the morning, Woods had to play six
holes to complete a second round postponed by darkness Friday. At
the 18th, he hooked his drive into the ocean and talked to himself
in terms only a sailor would repeat.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us were treated to the outburst because NBC had a
boom microphone near the tee box. The ball had barely settled in
the rocks lining Carmel Bay when announcer Johnny Miller deftly
applied some damage control: ''Not much more to be said about that
shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods went on to make a remarkable bogey, and proof that his
maturity now extends beyond the course came a short while later. He
is still just 24 and not far removed from the days when emotion was
like jet fuel for his play. But informed by friends that his
cursing made it to live TV, Woods gracefully apologized.
</P>
<P>
   A clear conscience is nice, but the most varied and powerful
game ever seen is probably more important to someone determined to
become the greatest golfer ever. All of that was on display in
Saturday's up-and-down round, which Woods closed out at even-par
71. That left him at 8 under, the only player in red, 10 shots
clear of the pack pursuing him into the final round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played solid golf,'' Woods said. ''I thought if I hit a lot
of fairways and greens, I'd pick up a couple of strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   When he hoists the trophy over his head Sunday evening, the
numbers might be even more eye-popping than they are now. Woods
already has claimed the record for biggest lead after both the
second and third rounds and his 36-hole total of 134 tied Jack
Nicklaus and two others for the lowest ever. But glance at his play
over the last 20 tour events, where Woods has 11 victories, and his
dominance looks clearer still.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nicklaus, his model, he's learned spectacular golf can stir
the soul, but solid golf wins more often and it's easier on the
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing out the Sprint International last August -- a tournament
that uses the quirky Stableford scoring system -- Woods has finished
in the top 20 at every tournament he's played in since Bay Hill in
early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revealingly, he's needed just two rounds in the 60s to seal
those 11 wins. His run of top-20 finishes in the majors stretches
back even further, to the 1997 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods has done is cut out nearly all the spectacular
failures -- double and triple bogeys -- and let opponents take the
high-risk road to catch him. So far the results have been
impossible to argue with.
</P>
<P>
   He will walk away from Pebble Beach and toward next month's
British Open at St. Andrews a more prohibitive favorite than ever,
capable of completing the career Grand Slam two years earlier than
Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was always Woods' benchmark and much has been made of
the fact that the Golden Bear made his exit at the place where
Woods began building his Open legacy in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the next Nicklaus took longer than expected and
more people auditioned for the role than should have been allowed.
But as Woods slips on one more jacket that Nicklaus wore, there is
no longer any questions about the fit.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods tore through the field at the Memorial two weeks ago
-- tearing up Nicklaus' finest work as a course designer in the
bargain -- worries about the lack of a dominant player were replaced
by those of a player who had become too dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ''People mention Brad Faxon or Jim Furyk when they talk about
the best putter on tour,'' Paul Goydos said, ''and Tiger is as good
or better than they are. Guys mention Justin Leonard as the best
chipper. Tiger is a better chipper. People talk about David Duval
and Greg Norman driving the ball long and straight. Tiger is longer
and straighter.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is overwhelming the game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenery changes, the reality does not.
</P>
<P>
   The guy is too good.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rockies 14, Diamondbacks 5  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeffrey Hammonds hit two of Colorado's four home
runs and drove in four runs as the Colorado Rockies beat the
Arizona Diamondbacks 14-5 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Rockies within one game of first-place
Arizona in the NL West. It's the closest Colorado has been to the
top spot this late in the season since June 11, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (3-4) pitched into the seventh inning and Jeff
Cirillo and Mike Lansing each had three hits and two RBIs for the
Rockies. They have won 19 of 23 at Coors Field and improved to a
major league-best 24-8 at home.
</P>
<P>
   While Colorado's hitters had no problem against Brian Anderson
(6-2), Bohanon stifled Arizona for the first five innings before
tiring in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a 7-0 lead, Bohanon gave up a two-run homer to Tony
Womack in the sixth and left with one out in the seventh after
singles by Matt Williams and Greg Colbrunn.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Belinda relieved and induced a grounder by Danny Bautista,
but Rockies shortstop Neifi Perez kicked it for an error to load
the bases. Damian Miller followed with a three-run double to cut
the lead to 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds, who hit a two-run homer off Anderson in the fifth,
added a solo shot, his 13th, off Mike Morgan to give the Rockies an
8-5 lead in the seventh. It was Hammonds' 10th career multihomer
game and his third this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies pulled away in the eighth when Lansing hit a two-run
homer and Todd Helton had a three-run shot off Matt Mantei.
Colorado had a franchise-record 11 extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   Banished to the bullpen earlier in the year, Bohanon gave up
four runs and five hits in 6 1-3 innings. Anderson surrendered
seven runs and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies led 3-0 after three and chased Anderson with four
runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, 10-for-19 against Anderson, had an RBI double and
scored on Todd Helton's run-scoring single. Hammonds followed with
a 422-foot homer onto the left-field concourse.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Because of Friday's rainout, the Diamondbacks will play 18
games over the final 17 days of the season, including 11 on the
road. ... Before the game, the Rockies acquired C Adam Melhuse from
Los Angeles for a player to be named later and cash. Melhuse was
expected to be added to the 25-man major league roster Sunday with
INF Aaron Ledesma the likely candidate to be replaced. ... The
Diamondbacks had won 17 straight games when Anderson started but
are 2-3 in his last five starts. ... Hammonds extended his hitting
streak to 15 games. ... Womack has hit in 10 straight.

<HEADLINE> Alleged ringleader: ''I'm not involved'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The alleged ringleader of the Central Park gang
that sexually assaulted dozens of women last weekend insisted that
he was ''doing nothing'' when the attacks began.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sitting there having fun, you know?'' said Manuel Vargas,
18, as he was led from the 13th Precinct in handcuffs on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas is one of 16 suspects arrested so far in connection with
the incident following the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Three of the
suspects arrested are from New Jersey. Police said Saturday that
they were seeking additional suspects identified from amateur
videotapes that captured the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The NYPD has assigned more than 75 detectives full-time to
identifying and arresting the suspects. Police Internal Affairs
investigators are also checking into reports that some officers
failed to help the victims of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas, of the Bronx, claimed he had nothing to do with the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're telling me that I was involved,'' the high school
dropout said. ''I was just sitting there doing nothing. I'm not
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Police report that 50 women - including two British tourists a
French newlywed and two New Jersey women - have reported that they
were attacked by the rampaging gang. Victims were doused with water
before the men began tearing away their clothes and pawing at them.
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday night arraignment for some of the suspects,
Assistant District Attorney Leemie Kahng painted a chilling picture
of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects belonged to ''a malicious mob that literally took
over the southern and western parts of Central Park ... and
horrified not only the city, but the world,'' Kahng said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a fourth woman announced plans for a $7 million
lawsuit against the Police Department, charging that officers
failed to come to her aid when the groping began.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were animals,'' said a teary 25-year Jasmine Gonzalez of
Brooklyn. ''There were no men in the park.''

<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Nick Price was feeling better after
making the cut in the U.S. Open. As for his homeland, that's quite
a different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Price grew up in Zimbabwe, now embroiled in racial turmoil. At
least 31 people, most of them opponents of President Robert Mugabe,
have been killed in political violence since February, and many
more have been beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has expressed sympathy with the mobs of black supporters
illegally occupying more than 1,400 white-owned farms. Zimbabwe was
formerly named Rhodesia and ruled by the white minority until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's awful there,'' said Price, who is white. ''My biggest
priority is my health and my family's health, but outside of that,
it's what is going on in my country. It's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Price manages to put those issues aside when he's on the course,
as he showed by finishing the second round at Pebble Beach with a
1-under 70 Saturday morning -- good enough to make the cut after an
opening 77. He slumped in the afternoon, putting up a 78 in the
stiff winds.
</P>
<P>
   His homeland is never far from his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I get 20 e-mails a day telling me what's going on down
there,'' said Price, who now lives in Hobe Sound, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh, a native of Fiji, doesn't want to get involved in
his country's problems, which began May 19. A rebel leader is
holding the deposed prime minister and 30 other hostages at
gunpoint in parliament to press demands that Fiji's ethnic Indian
minority be stripped of political power.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a sad thing,'' said Singh, who lives in Ponte Vedra
Beach, Fla. ''I hope they get it sorted out. But whatever I say,
it's not going to make a difference back home. I'll leave it to
them to settle that.''
</P>

<P>
   MONTY'S WOES: Playing with Ernie Els seems to bring out the
worst in Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   The British star struggled to a 79 in Saturday's third round,
falling apart with a quadruple bogey at No. 8. That was the low
point in a stretch of six holes he played at 9-over -- on the first
six and last six, he had one birdie and 11 pars.
</P>
<P>
   ''My irons are terrible and that's what I've been suffering
with,'' Montgomerie said. ''I just played badly, pure and simply.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie required two swings out of the rough around the
eighth green to move the ball the length of his wedge. He finally
chipped out and settled for an 8 on the way to his worst score in
36 U.S. Open rounds.
</P>
<P>
   His previous high was a 78, which came in a 1994 playoff that
also included Loren Roberts and was won by Ernie Els.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie was pared again Saturday with Els, who shot a
brilliant 3-under 68 to get back on the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always seems to play well with me in the U.S. Open,'' Monty
said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY 80: Jeff Coston, a golf instructor playing in the U.S.
Open for the first time in 22 years, wasn't the least bit concerned
about shooting an 80 in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he thoroughly enjoyed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is so much better than the first time,'' the 44-year-old
Coston said, referring to his 79-79 showing in the 1977 Open. ''I
missed the cut and left the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   In '78, Coston went home early again after rounds of 89-84.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was playing with a club pro from Texas,'' remembered Coston,
who now teaches at a golf academy in Blaine, Wash. ''He said,
'Where do you work, because you obviously don't play golf for a
living.'''
</P>
<P>
   After finally qualifying for the Open again this year, Coston
opened with a 1-under 70 and made the cut by two strokes with a 77
in the second round. He was being assisted in the stiff winds by
his 19-year-old son, Tyler, who doubled as his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel I played way better today than I did yesterday,''
Coston said after his 9-over showing Saturday. ''Yesterday, I felt
like I was leaking oil and needed a new carburetor.''
</P>
<P>
   Displaying the wit that made him a favorite in the interview
area, Coston was asked to describe Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ''The golf course is always changing character: sunny, foggy,
windy,'' he said. ''They're related, but it's not the same
person.''

   TRASHY SHOT: Angel Cabrera had golf's version of the
3-pointer, sending his drive at the par-3 12th into a trash can on
the right side of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera was completing a weather-delayed second round when he
sliced his tee shot, which bounced once and plopped right in the
container. He was allowed to take a drop without penalty and,
thankfully, clean his ball. He wound up with a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you make a mistake,'' Cabrera, a native of
Argentina, said through a translator. ''This time, it just happened
to go in the garbage bin.''
</P>
<P>
   The shot epitomized a trashy morning all around for Cabrera, who
was 2-under when he started play. He shot a 5-over 41 on the back
nine to drop from contention heading into the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Told that his shot might be called a two-pointer in the United
States, Cabrera smiled and said, ''Three points!''

   TIN CUP II: Rick Hartman, a club pro from New York, fulfilled
at least part of the script written by his caddie, who also doubles
as an actor, director and screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Don Michael Paul of Los Angeles met Hartman at the Pebble Beach
Invitational last year. They remained friends and when Hartman
qualified for the U.S. Open, he asked Paul to serve as his caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wrote a little script and sent it to him,'' Paul said. ''In
my script, he wins it. He hits a wedge from the rocks for an eagle
at 18.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartman, 41, is unlikely to win his first Open, but he made the
cut Saturday with a 6-over 148. His caddie was more excited than he
was, jumping around so much that Hartman had to tell him to calm
down a few times.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hartman, he planned to enjoy the final two rounds, having
accomplished his main goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing on the weekend in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach,'' he
said, glancing toward the Pacific Ocean as he stood at 18. ''Not
too bad.''
</P>

   MAYFAIR ON THE MOUND: Phoenix native Billy Mayfair had
something to look forward to after rounds of 83-76 in the U.S.
Open. He'll be throwing out the first pitch in the Arizona
Diamondbacks game on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was supposed to do it last year in Game 5, but they got beat
in New York,'' he said, alluding to the NL playoff series won by
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   How's the arm? Mayfair isn't sure but said, ''I'm not the Big
Unit.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   DQ'D: Kyle Blackman was disqualified when he signed his
scorecard with the wrong score at the 18th hole Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a mere technicality. Blackman finished with
back-to-back 78s and didn't make the cut anyway. He still receives
$1,000, as does every players who fails to make it past the first
two rounds.

   EUROPEAN SUCCESS: Tony Jacklin is the only European to win the
U.S. Open since the 1920s. That streak won't end this year, thanks
to Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaderboard after the third round showed those from
across the Atlantic are getting the hang of America's toughest
test.
</P>
<P>
   The top 11 included five Europeans: Miguel Angel Jimenez and
Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain, Lee Westwood and Nick Faldo of
England, and Padraig Harrington of Ireland. Two other foreign-born
players -- South Africa's Ernie Els and New Zealand's Michael
Campbell -- left only four Americans in the other spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to see all your partners up there,'' Jimenez said.
''It shows you there are great players all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And that list doesn't even include Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, who
played in the final pairing with Woods but collapsed to 22nd place
with an 82 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You hear on TV all the time over here that we can't play in
the Open,'' Bjorn said. ''But look at that leaderboard. I don't see
too many Americans up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has a 10-shot lead over Els, while Harrington and Jimenez
were 11 shots back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our top 12 is not far behind their top 12,'' Bjorn said.
''Tiger is way ahead of everybody else. But the rest of the top 12
is very close.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a new generation of European golfers is getting adjusted
to U.S. Open-style courses -- narrow fairways, thick rough and tiny,
fast greens. Maybe one of them will someday follow in the footsteps
of Jacklin, an Englishman who won the 1970 Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the guys have been here a couple of times now,'' Bjorn
said. ''We're getting used to what it takes to win over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this year, though.

   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Simon Elliott and Danny Califf scored
first-half goals as the Los Angeles Galaxy ended a four-game
winless streak by beating the Tampa Bay Mutiny 2-1 Saturday night
in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Lagos scored during injury time in the second half for
Tampa Bay (8-7), taking Carlos Valderrama's pass and putting a shot
under goalkeeper Kevin Hartman for his fifth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Before 14,603 at the Rose Bowl, Valderrama missed a penalty kick
in the 47th minute, putting it against the left post.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott opened the scoring in the ninth minute after referee
Noel Kenny awarded the Galaxy the free kick for Eric Quill's foul
of Luis Hernandez 25 yards from the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Cienfuegos and Greg Vanney both made runs at the ball,
but Elliott eventually took the kick, putting it over goalkeeper
Scott Garlick's right arm for his third goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A rookie defender, Califf got inside of defender Ritchie
Kotschau to head Vanney's corner kick in from six yards out in the
40th minute for his first MLS goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny awarded Tampa Bay the penalty kick following a collision
between Vanney and Manny Lagos on the left side of the penalty
area.

Two Colo. Fires 70 Pct. Contained
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BAILEY, Colo. (AP) -- As residents shoveled ashes from their yards and sifted
through the rubble of their charred homes Saturday, firefighters worked in rain
and light snow to cut off two wildfires burning in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains. Both fires were about 70 percent contained by midday Saturday,
allowing officials to send some firefighters to work on blazes in California,
Arizona and New Mexico. Meanwhile, government leaders began assessing damage to
the environment, including water resources metropolitan Denver relies on.

Gunmen Execute 34 in Indian Village
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Black-garbed gunmen stormed a village while its
residents slept early Saturday, executing 34 women, children and old men after
the latest caste-related battle in India's poorest and most lawless province.
The attackers, identified as members of an upper-caste militia backed by rich
landlords, fought a gunbattle with several armed villagers for 2&AMP;frac12; hours
until the residents ran out of ammunition, said M.V. Rao, police superintendent
of the Aurangabad area in Bihar state, where the massacre took place. Then the
attackers stormed several homes and ordered the women, children and elders to
stand in a line. They were shot and killed.

Girl Needing Double Transplant Graduates
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   McMINNVILLE, Ore. (AP) -- Brandy Stroeder, an 18-year-old in need of a a
double transplant, acheived her lifetime goal, graduating from high school. ''It
meant everything to me, I just didn't want to stumble,'' Stroeder said after the
Friday night ceremony. Stroeder, who suffers from a disease that causes her body
to produce excessive mucus that clogs her lungs, has sued the state because it
won't pay for a potentially lifesaving double transplant. Oregon Health Plan,
which extends Medicaid coverage to roughly 350,000 low-income Oregonians, pays
for single transplants but considers a simultaneous lung-and-liver transplant
too experimental and, at $250,000, too costly. Without it, Brandy is expected to
die within two years.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez and the rest of his family sent a Father's Day
greeting to President Fidel Castro on the eve of a huge Saturday rally in Cuba
to protest the 6-year-old's extended stay in the United States. ''On this
Father's Day we want to send you an affectionate greeting and a deserved kiss
from all of us,'' read the letter sent to Castro and all Cuban fathers and read
Friday night on state television. Hours after the letter was read, more than
300,000 people gathered for the largest rally held in the Cuban countryside
since early December.

Gunfire Erupts in S. Leone Capital
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Residents dashed for cover Saturday as gunfire
rang out in the streets of Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital. The source of the
half-hour burst of small-arms fire was not immediately clear. The shooting was
heaviest around the main prison, where members of the rebel Revolutionary United
Front have been jailed since they reignited the country's eight-year civil war.
U.N. peacekeepers and government soldiers were patrolling the city, U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst said. Sporadic gunfire continued for about two hours
after the main outburst as armed soldiers raced through the city in military and
civilian vehicles. At about 11 p.m., however, the city fell silent.

   HYDE PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made a pilgrimage Saturday to
the home of her hero, Eleanor Roosevelt, a former first lady who declined a
challenge the current one has taken on -- a run for the U.S. Senate. Clinton
came to Val-Kill, Eleanor Roosevelt's cottage home and a national historic site,
to announce that $150,000 has been raised through private donations to help with
preservation. Introducing the first lady to a crowd of more than 400 people,
Anna Roosevelt, granddaughter of Eleanor Roosevelt, said: ''The legacy of this
place is the legacy of a great woman who simply took stock of who she was and
where she was and then tried to be useful. Such a woman is Hillary Rodham
Clinton.''
